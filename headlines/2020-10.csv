New York and New Jersey join a growing list of states with contact-tracing apps residents can use.,2020-10-01,By Jack Nicas,"['Residents of New York and some surrounding states can now use their smartphones to track whether they have come close to someone with the coronavirus. New York and New Jersey on Thursday released apps that use new technology from Apple and Google that detects nearby phones and can notify people if they spent time with someone who was later tested positive for the virus. New York and New Jersey are the latest states to enable its residents to use the technology, joining at least eight other states: Alabama, Delaware, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wyoming. [An earlier version of this article included an inaccurate list of the states.] Residents of those states can turn on so-called exposure notifications in their phones’ settings. Depending on the phone, people might have to download an app run by their state. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Thursday that the technology would work with the apps of other states near New York, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. He said Connecticut would soon add the technology, too. “So even if you’re traveling in the metropolitan area, it will tell you if you’ve been in contact with a person,” he said. The technology will “give people comfort.” Apple, Google and the states have said that the technology does not collect people’s personal health details or track their locations. The technology uses Bluetooth signals to enable iPhones and Android devices to create an anonymous log of other nearby phones. If someone using the technology tests positive for the virus, that person can enter the positive result into the system using a unique authentication code. An automatic notification would then go to other phones that had opted in and had been in close contact.']",
In Pictures: Trump’s Busy Week Before Testing Positive,2020-10-02,By The New York Times,"['President Trump revealed early Friday morning that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Britain and E.U. Enter Make-or-Break Phase for Brexit Deal by Year’s End,2020-10-03,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Britain’s lengthy divorce proceedings with the European Union entered a make-or-break phase on Saturday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission president agreed that the two sides shared enough common ground to aim for a final settlement. The announcement, after a video call between Mr. Johnson and the Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, fell well short of a breakthrough, but neither was it a breakdown. Negotiations for a long-term trade agreement, which have ground on inconclusively for months, will now intensify as the two sides scramble to meet a deadline that would allow a deal to be in place on Dec. 31. The two leaders agreed that “progress had been made in recent weeks but that significant gaps remained,"" according to a statement from 10 Downing Street. “They instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps.” Britain formally left the European Union at the end of January. But under the terms of its withdrawal agreement, it remains part of the bloc’s customs union and single market until the end of the year while the two sides hammer out permanent arrangements on issues like fishing quotas and state aid to industries. While the issues in dispute are technical and even at times tedious, they have profound implications for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union. The risk of a rupture is as big as it was this time last year, when negotiations on the withdrawal agreement hit a similar moment of truth. Mr. Johnson’s intervention in the talks is an important, if long-expected, shift from working-level negotiators to top leaders. In addition to the prime minister and Ms. von der Leyen, much will depend on the role played by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Each has very different political calculations. Mr. Macron’s polling numbers have swooned in recent weeks as French voters increasingly disapprove of his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He faces an election next year, which raises questions about how much ground he will be willing to give Britain on politically sensitive issues like fishing rights. Ms. Merkel, in the twilight of her long tenure, has her eye firmly on securing her legacy as the de facto leader of Europe. A bitter breakup with Britain, especially when Germany holds the presidency of the European Council\xa0— the bloc’s executive arm — would mar that record and she seems determined to avoid that outcome. “You see that now with Merkel still being very cautious but constructive, and the Macron team being far more aggressive and even hostile toward the U.K.,” said Mujtaba Rahman, a former economist at the European Commission who is now an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. Yet even Ms. Merkel has shown impatience with what many in Europe perceive as Britain’s needlessly provocative tactics. Mr. Johnson recently introduced a bill that would override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland. His own aides acknowledged that it would be a violation of international law, and the European Union bought legal action against Britain this past week. “We’ve suffered a certain setback with the breaching of the agreement we reached on Northern Ireland,” Ms. Merkel said on Friday in language that, for her, was more frank than usual. “I have to say simply: That’s bitter.” With time running out, the British have been pressing for an opportunity to take their case higher up the political food chain. Last year, Mr. Johnson successfully brokered an agreement on Britain’s withdrawal in talks with Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister at the time, and seems confident that he can do so again. Things are harder this time, however. The most contentious points in last year’s withdrawal agreement mainly affected a single country, Ireland, while these negotiations on trade affect many more. The big economies, like France and Germany, have much at stake, and red lines they will not cross. Among the main sticking points are fisheries, with most analysts saying that to get a deal, the European Union would have to accept lower quotas for catches in British waters. The new quotas could be phased in, however, giving continental fishing fleets more time to adjust. At the same, Britain would have to give ground on the thorny issue of state aid. The European Union fears that an unfettered British government could subsidize its companies and dump goods in the continental European market. The bloc wants the British to specify which antitrust rules it will enforce domestically, and to agree on a mechanism to resolve disputes with the E.U. Britain, however, sees it as a matter of national sovereignty. Mr. Johnson’s powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings, wants Britain to have a free hand to promote artificial intelligence and other the high-tech industries. Yet the pandemic has heightened pressure on Mr. Johnson to compromise. Not only has the British economy taken a big hit, but his handling of the pandemic has been widely criticized. With lawmakers in his own Conservative Party increasingly rebellious, Mr. Johnson would run an acute political risk if he allowed the absence of a Brexit trade deal to produce chaos at Channel ports in January. In interviews with the BBC on Saturday before his call with Ms. von der Leyen, Mr. Johnson struck a more optimistic tone then he has in recent weeks, when he talked openly about a no-deal Brexit. The ingredients for a deal were “all there,” though he added, “It’s up to our friends and partners to be common-sensical.” Mr. Rahman said he expected more fireworks in the weeks to come, and he did not rule out a collapse in the talks. But he predicted that in the end, Mr. Johnson would compromise to get an agreement. “The world around him is melting down, and he needs a win on Brexit,” Mr. Rahman said. Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.']",Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of the European Commission agreed that the two sides shared enough common ground to aim for a final settlement.
Turkey admits not including asymptomatic people in its count.,2020-10-01,By The New York Times,"['Turkey has acknowledged that it was not making all confirmed coronavirus cases public in its daily announced tally, but counting only those patients showing symptoms. Many doctors for months have been warning that the actual scale of the pandemic is much wider in Turkey than has been depicted in the official figures. “We have been saying that for six months,” said the Turkish Medical Association on Twitter, addressing the government. “You concealed the truth. You did not stop the epidemic.” Turkey had imposed a partial lockdown during weekends and official holidays, banned travel between cities and closed social facilities like gyms and cafes, but it avoided any measure that would further harm an already staggering economy. The country has recorded at least 318,000 confirmed cases and nearly 8,200 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The country had been announcing daily figures since mid-March, when the first confirmed coronavirus case was detected. Until the end of July, the government figures included the number of daily confirmed cases, but since then has changed its wording to “the daily number of patients,” although there was not a major diversion in the figures. “Symptomatic ones are called patients, asymptomatic ones called cases,” the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said Wednesday. “What we are announcing is the daily number of patients.” Mr. Koca said the tally included every patient, whether hospitalized or treated at home, stopping short of revealing figures on asymptomatic cases, despite being asked twice. He rejected an opposition lawmaker’s claim that the actual number of cases is 20 times more than the official figures. “Nothing covert is done in this struggle,” Mr. Koca said, noting that asymptomatic cases were being detected and isolated, too. Yet the opposition saw his remarks as a confession on concealing the truth. “You cannot manage a pandemic by hiding the truth from the people,” said Murat Emir, an opposition lawmaker who has expressed skepticism about the official count. “Who is going to take the responsibility of stalling our people with only a very small portion of the truth?” he said.']",
Floodgates in Venice Work in First Major Test,2020-10-03,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — After decades of bureaucratic delays, corruption and resistance from environmental groups, sea walls designed to defend Venice from “acqua alta,” or high water, went up on Saturday, testing their ability to battle the city’s increasingly menacing floods. By 10 a.m., all 78 floodgates barricading three inlets to the Venetian lagoon had been raised, and even when the tide reached as high as four feet, water levels inside the lagoon remained steady, officials said. “There wasn’t even a puddle in St. Mark’s Square,” said Alvise Papa, the director of the Venice department that monitors high tides. Had the flood barriers not been raised, about half the city’s streets would have been under water, and visitors to St. Mark’s Square — which floods when the tide nears three feet — would have been wading in a foot and a half of water, he said. “Everything dry here. Pride and joy,” tweeted Luigi Brugnaro, Venice’s newly re-elected mayor. Designed some four decades ago to help save Venice from flooding, the mobile barrier system was delayed by cost overruns, corruption, and opposition from environmental and conservation groups. The cost of the system tripled from initial estimates, and a 2014 bribery scandal led to the arrest of the then-mayor, Giorgio Orsoni, and dozens of others, including politicians and businessmen involved in the project. Mr. Orsoni and some of the others charged were acquitted. “We found a difficult situation and slowly, slowly we’ve been able to resolve things,” said Giuseppe Fiengo, one of the commissioners who have overseen the project since 2014. “The important thing is that today, for the first time, with high water, Venice didn’t flood.” The floodgates have been tested several times over the past summer, but under less threatening weather conditions than those on Saturday. “This time we raised them to defend Venice,” said Alberto Scotti, the engineer who designed them. The system is not fully operational yet. Some infrastructure still needs to be completed, and workers haven’t been fully trained, so Saturday’s operation was technically a test. “But it’s a test that had an objective, to guarantee the safety of the city, and it did,” Mr. Scotti said. The construction firms building the system have until December 2021 to finish the work. When it is fully operational, the floodgates will be activated whenever the tide reaches 3½ feet. Until then, the floodgates will be operated when the tide reaches four feet, as it did on Saturday. Though significant, Saturday’s tide levels were a far cry from the exceptionally high water levels seen last year — six feet — and the year before, endangering the city and prompting the mayor to declare a state of emergency. Mr. Scotti said the floodgates had been designed to defend the city “even in anomalous situations,” and even with high tides reaching nearly 10 feet. While supporters of the project welcomed Saturday’s test as a major victory, some pointed out that the floodgates won’t fully solve the growing threat posed by climate change. Increasing sea levels and new wind patterns could force the floodgates to stay up so often that it could destroy ship traffic or turn the Venice lagoon into a swamp. “With climate change, there’s a chance that the floodgates could be employed 150-180 days a year, becoming an almost fixed barrier and severing the lagoon’s relation to the sea,” said Cristiano Gasparetto, an architect and former provincial official who has long opposed the project. “If the lagoon is cut off from the sea for long periods, it dies, because the natural exchange of waters stops, and all of its organic life risks decaying,” he said. “If the lagoon dies, Venice dies,” he added. “It loses its characteristics.” Mr. Gasparetto also said he doubted that the floodgates would work in extreme conditions with high waves and strong winds. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “Today’s test says nothing when it comes to that.” Concerns also remain about the costs of maintaining the floodgates and potential damage from saltwater. Still, the operation of the gates on Saturday was greeted in Venice as progress. “Today we had the certainty that it works,” Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, which includes Venice, told reporters on Saturday. “At least we know that it can help Venice.”']","The fiercely contested floodgate system was used to stop a high tide from flooding Venice’s fragile streets. The system held, but will it work as the climate worsens?"
"Covid-19 Upends South Korea’s Thanksgiving, and Its Rituals",2020-10-02,By Jun Michael Park and Mike Ives,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Once a year for the past three decades, the Joo brothers have traveled back to their hometown from South Korea’s capital to mark the Chuseok holiday. They drive from Seoul with their respective families, forgoing a bullet train that would cut the journey in half, with car trunks full of presents. And they always save room for the giant meal that they eat with their parents to mark Chuseok, the rough Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving. This year, the government has asked South Koreans to stay home during Chuseok, which runs through the weekend, to avoid exacerbating the country’s latest coronavirus outbreak. Many South Koreans, including the Joo family, have grudgingly followed orders, but their acquiescence comes with an emotional price: A normally joyful time of year now feels empty of its sacred rituals, and clouded with feelings of anxiety and disorientation. “Watching my parents grow older and change often worries me, but seeing them in person puts my mind at ease again,” said Joo Jae-wook, 57, a retired salesman and the oldest of four brothers, one of whom still lives close to home. “But this year I can’t even do that.” Chuseok falls on the nearest full moon to the fall equinox, known as a harvest moon. It is also celebrated in North Korea, albeit without the Thanksgiving-like holiday travel rush that precedes the version in the South. The holiday has deep links to South Korea’s agricultural past and its custom of ancestor worship. Most families returning to their hometowns — usually that of the husband or father, though the tradition is evolving — visit graveyards and tidy their ancestors’ tombs. They also set out fruit on picnic mats as ritual offerings, exchange presents and gather to make songpyeon, a special rice cake that symbolizes familial bonds. “For people in my generation, Chuseok means family and comfort,” Mr. Joo said. “We renew our sense of community and belonging by getting together and catching up with relatives.” During a normal Chuseok, South Korea’s roads and public transit system strain to accommodate all the people who are rushing back from cities to their hometowns. Train tickets sell out well in advance. But this year, trains are leaving stations half empty because of social distancing restrictions. Passengers are buying seats at the last minute with relative ease. South Korea has reported 415 deaths and more than 23,000 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began, including more than 500 new cases in the past week. The country’s response has been widely praised as a model, but a recent outbreak that began in Seoul has tested the government’s strategy of using social-distancing restrictions and extensive tracking to keep the virus at bay without shutting down the economy. On Wednesday, President Moon Jae-in told the nation that South Korea’s people were observing Chuseok at a “difficult time,” and their sacrifices would be rewarded. “The government will surely repay the people who have endured the difficulties by succeeding in controlling the virus and protecting the economy,” he said. That offered little comfort to Choi Jee-woong, a freelance M.C. in Gangnam, a well-heeled Seoul district. Mr. Choi, 39, and his parents normally spend Chuseok in South Jeolla province, where his father grew up. But they’re skipping the trip this year because his mother is unwell, he said, and he plans to spend the holiday watching Netflix. “It feels pretty desolate these days,” Mr. Choi said, sitting on a bench outside a cafe. “I’m an active and social person, but some kind of emotional barrier has gone up among us.” Mr. Joo, the retired salesman, said that he and his wife normally spend Chuseok shuttling between the southern city of Gwangju, where his parents live, and her parents’ home in nearby Sunchang County. Two weeks ago, his parents instructed him not to come this year, citing the government’s advice. He agreed, but it didn’t quell his lingering anxiety about the pandemic and its grinding restrictions. “If there was a set timeline, people would feel more hopeful,” said Mr. Joo, who lives in a quiet residential neighborhood. “But I’m scared because we don’t know if there will ever be an end to this.” Mr. Joo said that the family will miss the stories that his father tells about growing up under Japanese occupation in a part of northeast China then known as Manchuria, and of the hardships of life in South Korea during the late 1950s. The couple’s daughter, Joo Hyena, 26, said that many young people in South Korea feel as though the pandemic has left them “abandoned and thrown onto the floor.” “For people seeking jobs or those who were just hired for the first time, the start to their career has not been what they ever wanted or imagined,” said Ms. Joo, who recently quit her job at a multinational cosmetics company. As for Chuseok, she said, young people often find it tedious because relatives often ask intrusive questions about their careers and relationships. But Ms. Joo added that the holiday has a “bright energy” that tends to bring people together. Some of her fondest memories, she said, are of riding through rice and pepper fields in the early autumn, on the back of her late maternal grandfather’s motorbike. “It used to make us feel more whole and generous, putting time and effort into preparing food and gifts for one another, as others might feel at Christmas,” Ms. Joo said of Chuseok celebrations past. “But this year things are fragmented, and the streets seem lonesome.” Jun Michael Park reported from Seoul, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.']",Millions have canceled family gatherings during this year’s Chuseok harvest festival at the government’s request. The anxiety is palpable.
The 22-Year-Old Force Behind Egypt’s Growing #MeToo Movement,2020-10-02,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Nadeen Ashraf had a burning secret. Earlier this summer, an anonymous Instagram page that named and shamed a man accused of being a notorious sexual harasser at Egypt’s most prestigious university was causing a sensation among her friends. Unknown to them, she was running it. The experiment started, in a flash of fury, in the dead of night. On July 1 Ms. Ashraf, a 22-year-old philosophy major, was up late to cram for an exam the next morning when she became preoccupied with the fate of a Facebook post that had mysteriously disappeared. Days earlier, a fellow student at the American University in Cairo had posted a warning on Facebook about a man she said was a sexual predator — a brash, manipulative young man from a rich family said to be harassing and blackmailing women on campus. Now, Ms. Ashraf realized as she stared at her laptop, the post had been deleted without explanation. Enraged, she set aside her textbooks and created an Instagram page under a pseudonym —\xa0@assaultpolice —\xa0that identified the man, Ahmed Bassam Zaki, alongside his photo and a list of accusations of misdeeds against women. “This guy had been getting away with stuff since the 10th grade,” she said. “Every time a woman opened her mouth, someone taped it shut. I wanted to stop that.” After creating the page, Ms. Ashraf flopped into bed at 6 a.m. and slept through her exam. But when she awoke, she found hundreds of notifications from people who applauded her post, and about 30 messages from women who confided that they, too, had been assaulted by Mr. Zaki. Some said they had been raped. An Egyptian #MeToo moment was born. Within a week, Mr. Zaki had been arrested, the @assaultpolice account had amassed 70,000 followers and the page had prompted an outpouring of testimonies from other Egyptian women fed up with being humiliated and violated. Sexual assault is endemic in Egypt — a United Nations study in 2013 found that 99 percent of women had experienced harassment or violence — but reporting it is notoriously difficult. Police officials are reluctant to register assault cases. Powerful institutions prefer to sweep accusations under the carpet. Even the families of victims, wary of scandal or feeling a misplaced sense of shame, tend to hush it up. Ms. Ashraf’s bold page offered a new way. “It was so wonderful,” she recalled, sitting in her family home. “A lot of the girls who got in touch said ‘I can’t believe I’m finally being heard.’ Even though it was a dark time, here they were speaking out. There was a sense of empowerment, of relief.” On Sept. 1, the authorities charged Mr. Zaki, 21, with three counts of sexual assault against underage women, as well as multiple counts of blackmail and harassment. He remains in detention, awaiting trial. But then a second high-profile case came to light, also through Ms. Ashraf’s Instagram page, that complicated matters. It promised to be even more sensational —\xa0an account of a gang rape by five young men in a five-star hotel overlooking the Nile. In recent weeks, however, the case has become clouded in a murk of counter-accusations and leaked images that threatens to overshadow the progress Ms. Ashraf has made — and possibly even reverse it. “It’s very worrisome,” she said. Ms. Ashraf, 22, is not an archetypal Egyptian rebel. She comes from an apolitical family that lives in a gated community in eastern Cairo — a place of manicured lawns and hushed streets lined with luxury vehicles where support for Egypt’s authoritarian leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, runs relatively high. Her father owns a software company, her mother is a nutritionist, and her family stayed in the suburbs during the 2011 uprising that toppled Egypt’s longtime ruler, Hosni Mubarak, and the 2013 protests that ushered in a military takeover and Mr. el-Sisi’s rule. When the #MeToo movement erupted in the United States in 2017, driven by accusations against the disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, she didn’t pay much attention — even if she did have her own experience of assault. When she was 11 years old, a delivery man carrying laundry approached her as she walked down the street and slapped her bottom. “I had no idea why he was doing this,” she said. “It took me years to realize it was sexual.” Public outrage over sexual assault has been growing in Egypt for about a decade, driven by high-profile attacks and, last year, harassment accusations against a famous soccer player. Even so, men continue to assault with impunity. Working-class women run a gantlet of harassment in crowded public buses, Ms. Ashraf said. Among the rich, although dating is tolerated, young men exploit their family connections to misbehave with license, she said, and many parents reflexively blame their daughters when things go wrong. “The first response is that it’s your fault,” she said. “How did he get your number? Why did you let him in?” Ms. Ashraf initially shielded her activism from her parents, who thought she was locked into her bedroom to study. When she finally came clean to her father, weeks later, he was alarmed. “He went silent for three minutes,” she recalled. “Then he said, ‘You can’t tell anyone.’” Ms. Ashraf told him it was a little late for that. Is her brand of vigilantism open to abuse, or even fair? False accusations are a hazard, she admitted, adding that she tried to confirm the charges against Mr. Zaki through her network of friends. Even so, she had to delete one accusation, from his time as a business student in Spain, after it was found to be untrue. In a country like Egypt, such methods were necessary, she said. “It’s not like the West. You can’t just walk into a police station.” The real difficulties started, though, with the second high-profile case. In late July, Ms. Ashraf posted to Instagram about five men in their 20s, from wealthy families, who were said to have gang-raped a teenage woman in a suite at the Fairmont Nile City hotel after a party in 2014. A video of the assault, made by a sixth man, had been distributed to their friends. The accusation caused a sensation. Although Ms. Ashraf didn’t identify the accused men, copycat accounts sprang up on Instagram that did. One is the son of a prominent steel tycoon; another is the son of a well-known soccer coach. Within one week the victim, who said her drink had been spiked by the assailants, approached the police and pressed charges. In late August, Egypt’s prosecutor general announced five arrests — two men in Egypt and three in Lebanon, who have since been extradited to Egypt. At least three other men are being sought. But the investigation became muddied after investigators moved against several people who had come forward in connection to the case. Two men were accused of “debauchery” —\xa0code for homosexuality — based on photos found in their phones that were later leaked to the news media. They have been detained, as has a woman — a former partner of one of those accused of rape — whose intimate photos have been leaked onto the internet. Just who leaked those photos is unclear, and the cases are expected to come to court in the coming weeks. But they have already sent a chill through the ranks of Egyptian women who hoped it had become safer to report sexual violence. “Fairmont has become our case of the century,” Ms. Ashraf said. “But it shouldn’t be a precedent for assault cases. There’s so many other things coming up that prove we are on the side of girls.” After threats to her security, Ms. Ashraf suspended her Instagram page for 10 days in August. Now it is up and running again, but with a focus on educating women about their rights. “You use the word consent all the time in English,” she said. “But I’ve never heard its Arabic equivalent —\xa0taraadi. So we try to translate these concepts, break them down, explain.” The only name she’s made public of late is her own. Realizing that her identity was leaking out, and fearing retribution from men who were threatened by the page, she decided it was safest to end her anonymity. “I figured that if the bad guys knew who I was, good people should too,” she said. “There’s protection in that.” Nada Rashwan contributed reporting.']","In a moment of rage, Nadeen Ashraf created an Instagram page naming a man accused of being a sexual harasser.

Trump and first lady test positive for the virus.,2020-10-02,By Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman,"['President Trump said early Friday that he and his wife, Melania, had tested positive for the coronavirus, throwing the nation’s leadership into uncertainty and escalating the crisis posed by a pandemic that has already killed more than 207,000  Americans and devastated the economy. “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said in a statement that the president and first lady were both doing well. Although people at the White House noticed that his voice sounded raspy on Thursday, it was not clear that that was abnormal for him, especially given the number of campaign rallies he has held lately. Mr. Trump received the test results after one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, became infected, bringing the virus into his inner circle and underscoring the difficulty of containing it even with the resources of a president. Mr. Trump has for months played down the severity of the virus and told a political dinner just Thursday night that “the end of the pandemic is in sight.” Mr. Trump’s positive test result could pose immediate difficulties for the future of his campaign against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic challenger, with just 33 days before the election on Nov. 3. Even if Mr. Trump, 74, is asymptomatic, he will have to withdraw from the campaign trail and stay isolated in the White House for an unknown period of time. If he is sick or becomes ill, it could raise questions about whether he should remain on the ballot. Even if he does not become seriously ill, the positive test could prove devastating to his political fortunes given his months of diminishing the seriousness of the pandemic even as the virus was still ravaging the country and killing about 1,000 more Americans every day. He has repeatedly predicted the virus “is going to disappear,” asserted that it was under control and insisted that the country was “rounding the corner” to the end of the crisis. He has scorned scientists, saying they were mistaken on the severity of the situation. Mr. Trump has refused for months to wear a mask in public on all but a few occasions and repeatedly questioned their effectiveness while mocking Mr. Biden for wearing one. Trailing in the polls, the president in recent weeks increasingly held crowded campaign events in defiance of public health guidelines and sometimes state and local governments.']",
"Contact Tracing, Key to Reining In the Virus, Falls Flat in the West",2020-10-03,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — As the coronavirus stampeded across Europe and the United States this spring, governments made their depleted citizens a tantalizing promise: Soon, legions of disease detectives would hunt down anyone exposed to the virus, confining them to their homes and letting everyone else get on with their lives. Nearly eight months on, as a web of new infections spreads across Europe and the United States, that promise has nearly evaporated. Despite repeated vows by Western nations to develop “world-beating” testing and tracing operations, those systems have been undone by a failure of governments to support citizens through onerous quarantines or to draw out intimate details of their whereabouts. That has shattered the hope of pinpoint measures replacing lockdowns and undermined flagging confidence in governments. Beholden to privacy rules, Western officials largely trusted people to hand over names to contact tracers. But that trust was not repaid, in large part because governments neglected services that were crucial to winning people’s cooperation: a fast and accurate testing system, and guarantees that people would be housed, fed and paid while they isolated. “Public health leaders fell in love with the idea of contact tracing as an important tactic — and it is — but that’d be like if you’re going into war and were just talking about the tanks,” said Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a public health charity in Maryland. Just as important, officials overlooked the impact of raging mistrust in government and a thicket of conspiracy theories about the virus’s spread. Fearful of plunging themselves or their friends into a painful period off work, infected patients have handed over a paltry number of contacts and often flouted self-isolation rules. Contact tracers are struggling to reach people who test positive, and being rebuffed once they do. In theory, countries were to build mass testing programs that would provide quick diagnoses. Then a group of tracers would find others who had crossed paths with the infected person and tell them to stay home. Elected officials presented the system as a critical bridge between lockdown and a vaccine, allowing them to contain small outbreaks without shutting down large parts of society. But construction of that bridge has been rocky, at best. The West’s public health systems have not matched the success in parts of East Asia where  the fear of epidemics became more ingrained after SARS and MERS. Following those outbreaks, places like Taiwan and South Korea built robust tracing systems and legal frameworks for limiting civil liberties during an epidemic. Some contact tracers have used cellphone and credit card data to identify people who were potentially exposed. But in Europe and the United States, which have largely relied on the public to provide information and follow quarantine rules voluntarily, the response has been spotty. The West also ran up against the blunt fact that contact tracing, while useful in containing limited cases, has become overwhelmed by a new explosion of infections. In the past week, Europe has averaged about 60,000 new daily cases, while the United States is registering more than 40,000. “The track and trace system is unrealistic and useless,” said Mahmoud Salamon, 27, a recent business school graduate on a visit to Brighton, on England’s south coast, where a testing center at a stadium was recently closed for the start of soccer season. He said he distrusted restaurants or stores with his personal information. In Taiwan, an infected person names more than 15 contacts on average, and tracers often interview patients in person, trying to extract details about secret jobs or marital affairs. But the picture in Europe is far different, and the low level of cooperation has startled public health experts. In Spain, where hospitals are struggling with a new rush of cases, contact tracers identify, on average, only three contacts for each known case. In France, the figure has fallen below three. Yet even those numbers are higher than in the United States. In New York City, each infected person hands over an average of 1.1 other names. In England, people are neither handing over many contacts — about five, on average — nor following the rules. In a survey of about 32,000 Britons, less than one in five who reported coronavirus symptoms said they had stayed home. Of those alerted that they had been close to an infected person, only one in 10 said they had complied with orders to self-isolate. “It suggests there is some degree of skepticism in the population to engagement,” said Professor Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, an adviser to the government’s tracing program, referring to the proportion of known cases — a fifth — who handed over no other names. Crucially, many Western governments have failed to cushion the financial and psychological blow of self-isolation by guaranteeing people tests or giving them enough money to weather two weeks without work.  People self-isolating and unable to work in England were eligible for just 13 pounds, or $16.70, per day, until the government increased the payments this past week. “You need to have the trust of people for this to work, and trust comes by whether you’re going to take care of me,” said Dr. Jason Wang, a Stanford University professor of health policy who has studied Taiwan’s coronavirus response. “If I’m sick, are you going to help me, or just quarantine me? Are you going to get me tested on time?” With tests results lagging in many countries, contact tracers cannot get ahead of the virus. In Paris, people wait up to a week to get testing appointments and results. England recently recorded a backlog of nearly 200,000 untested lab samples, making it impossible to track the virus through newly reopened schools. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Danielle Lennon, who lives in hard-hit northeastern England, sat in a mile-long line of idling cars for almost an hour to get her 7-year-old daughter tested, only for someone to announce that the testing center was closed. “The government has kind of lost the general public on this, through incompetence,” she said. Some elected leaders have blamed recalcitrant citizens for undermining contact tracing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said the problem was that Britain was “a freedom-loving country.” But the evidence for such claims is thin. Some countries have successfully tracked the virus, despite people’s resistance, in large part by investing in chronically underfunded health departments, epidemiologists said. In Germany, people said they would refuse to hand over names to contact tracers at double the rate of Britons, according to a poll by Imperial College London. Even so, the country has largely kept a small uptick in new infections under control. Beyond Germany’s strong testing program, said Ralf Reintjes, a professor of epidemiology at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, the country also responded to the pandemic by pouring money into its roughly 400 local public health offices, which had long conducted contact tracing for communicable diseases. England, by contrast, awarded a £108 million ($138 million) contract to an outsourcing company, putting the fate of contact tracing in the hands of ill-trained call center workers. Gerry, a former nurse who asked not to be fully identified because she was barred from speaking publicly, said she had quit her job as a more senior contact tracer in England because so few people either picked up the phone or helped her track cases. Western countries have been slow to introduce mobile contact tracing apps like those used in parts of Asia, which notify users who have spent time near an infected person. Even if only 15 percent of people download them, they can reduce infections by 8 percent and deaths by 6 percent, according to research by Prof. Fraser, the Oxford professor. But the dissonance of countries asking people to take personal and professional risks in handing over contacts’ names, while at the same time scarcely supporting those who do, makes tracking the virus a difficult order. “We say we’d like you to quarantine for the good of your neighbors, but in doing so potentially your kids starve and you lose your home,” Mr. Castrucci said. “That’s bad math.” Anna Schaverien and Megan Specia contributed reporting.']","Tracing is seen as a vital tool to avoid lockdowns and open economies, but that requires a robust system, widespread rapid testing and public trust. All are lacking in the West."
Unemployment claims in the U.S. show little relief from pandemic layoffs.,2020-10-01,By Nelson D. Schwartz,"['American employers continue to cut jobs at rates that dwarf the pace of layoffs in past decades, even as the economy crawls forward from the coronavirus-induced recession that began last spring. The Labor Department reported Thursday that 787,000 Americans filed for state unemployment benefits for the first time last week, a decline from the previous week’s total of 827,000. These figures, unadjusted for seasonal variations, are roughly four times the weekly tally of claims from before the pandemic. But the totals did not reflect a fresh report from California, where officials have halted claims processing for two weeks to clear a backlog and deal with fraud. Instead, the Labor Department used the most recent weekly figure available. With seasonal adjustments, last week’s national figure was 837,000. Applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program aimed at independent contractors, gig workers and part-time employees, totaled 650,000. As bad as the numbers look compared with the start of the year, they are much improved from early spring, when fired and furloughed workers sought out benefits by the millions each week. Still, the totals offer little indication of a strengthening labor market. “It’s unclear how many companies can sustain themselves and retain payrolls that support incomes,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. “A solid rebound in job growth is now looking more muted.”']",
"India’s Covid-19 Death Toll Passes 100,000",2020-10-03,By Sameer Yasir,"['SRINAGAR, Kashmir — More than 100,000 people in India have died from the coronavirus, the government said on Saturday, even as officials plan to lift more restrictions in hopes of reviving the crippled economy. India’s health ministry reported 1,069 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the official total to 100,842, though experts say the true toll is probably much higher. Until Saturday, only the United States and Brazil had reported more than 100,000 deaths from the virus. At 6.4 million, India’s official caseload is the second-highest in the world, surpassed only by the United States, which has more than 7.3 million cases. India’s death and infection rates have climbed in recent months, with September alone accounting for more than 40 percent of its cases and about a third of its deaths. The numbers have fallen somewhat since mid-September but remain high. Over the past week, India reported almost twice as many new cases as the United States did. And experts suspect that many Covid-19 fatalities in India have gone unreported. “Actual number of deaths is much higher,” said Dr. Anant Bhan, a health researcher at Yenepoya University in southern India. “But how much higher it is, that is difficult to know.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government imposed a harsh nationwide lockdown in March, a move that many experts say was poorly planned, devastating the economy while failing to stop the virus’s spread. Now, despite the climbing numbers, officials are lifting restrictions in hopes of easing the economic suffering. Cinemas will be allowed to reopen with limited capacity this month, for example, and some states are expected to reopen schools. Dr. Bhan said the reopenings could imperil older Indians and other vulnerable people who have been staying home. Children who return to school are likely to bring the virus home, he said. “The potential for exposure to infection would go up.” Thekkekara Jacob John, a former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said many lives could have been saved if the March lockdown had been handled properly. “Now, today, the economic revival has priority over handling the virus,” Mr. John said.']","Only the United States and Brazil have reported more deaths from the coronavirus.

Macron Vows Crackdown on ‘Islamist Separatism’ in France,2020-10-02,By Norimitsu Onishi and Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron of France on Friday outlined  measures designed to rein in the influence of radical Islam in the country and help develop what he called an “Islam of France” compatible with the nation’s republican values. In a long-awaited speech on the subject, Mr. Macron said that the influence of Islamism must be eradicated from public institutions even as he acknowledged government failures in allowing it to spread. The measures include placing stringent limits on home-schooling and increasing scrutiny of religious schools, making associations that solicit public funds sign a “charter” on secularism.  While these measures would apply to any group, they are intended to counter extremists in the Muslim community.  Under the measures, the widespread practice of bringing over foreign imams to work in France, where they are often accused of preaching an outdated or extreme version of Islam, would be ended. The issue of the effects of Islamism has been a persistent one in France, amid fears of the kinds of terrorist attacks the country has faced in recent years, putting pressure on Mr. Macron as he faces re-election. Many of the proposals from Mr. Macron were ideas that had been floated in the past or ones he had already approved. His speech on Friday assembled it all into a comprehensive package that the government is expected to present as a bill in December. “What we must attack is Islamist separatism,” Mr. Macron said in front of six of his ministers in Les Mureaux, a town northwest of Paris. “Secularism is the cement of a united France,” he said, calling radical Islam both an “ideology” and a “project” that sought to indoctrinate children, undermine France’s values — especially gender equality — and create a “counter-society” that sometimes laid the groundwork for Islamist terrorism. But Mr. Macron also recognized that France bore responsibility for letting that ideology spread uncontested. “We built our own separatism ourselves,” he said. For too long, the authorities had amassed largely immigrant populations in poverty-stricken neighborhoods with little access to jobs or public transportation, leading to a “ghettoization of our republic,” he said. The speech was postponed several times this year as the president searched, sometimes publicly, for the best approach and language. The stakes were high, as the setting indicated: Mr. Macron’s speech and answers to journalists, which lasted nearly two hours, were broadcast live on television and the internet. In a sign of how delicate the issue is for Mr. Macron, a member of his party walked out of a parliamentary hearing last month because she objected to the veil worn by a student union leader who was testifying, setting off days of heated debate. Crucially, Mr. Macron’s announcement came as France’s political establishment gears up for the next presidential election in 18 months. Accused by both the far right and traditional conservatives of being lax against radical Islam, Mr. Macron has recently used words and adopted positions on social issues that have signaled a clear departure from his more liberal stances at the start of his presidency. Over the summer, Mr. Macron reshuffled his cabinet with a view toward the next election, handing a key job to Gérald Darmanin, a conservative, hard-charging protégé of the former right-wing president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Darmanin, now the interior minister and head of the national police, has quickly helped set the tone for the remainder of Mr. Macron’s term. Even though official data show steady or declining crime rates over all in France, Mr. Darmanin joined political rivals on the right to denounce what they claim to be the country’s supposed growing insecurity. Mr. Darmanin began using and strongly defending the vocabulary of the far right to describe a France supposedly “turning savage” — or undergoing an “ensauvagement,” a loaded word used by the right to target nonwhite immigrants from France’s former African colonies. The tough talk on crime helped set the stage for Mr. Macron’s speech, which is likely to set off fierce debate over the coming months as lawmakers consider the bill. It is also expected to sharpen tensions within Mr. Macron’s party, as the president’s rightward tilt has already alienated its left-leaning members. Driss Ettazaoui, a deputy mayor in Évreux, a town in Normandy, praised Mr. Macron for his call to avoid the “trap” of “stigmatizing all Muslims,” and said he approved of several of the measures — including a push to teach more Arabic in French public schools to draw children away from unregulated classes in mosques or other settings. But Mr. Ettazaoui, who is also vice president of an association of urban mayors, said that Mr. Macron’s messaging was muddled by the more martial tones of some of his ministers, whom he accused of playing up isolated incidents, like the time the education minister referred, with little proof, to boys who refused to hold their female classmates’ hands for religious reasons. “A wide majority of Muslims are only asking one thing: We want a right to normality, to practice our faith without pressure,” Mr. Ettazaoui said. In his speech, Mr. Macron said that to avoid “illegal schools” run by “religious extremists,” home-schooling would be strictly limited to children with valid medical reasons. Only about 50,000 of France’s more than 12 million school students are currently home-schooled. Mr. Macron also outlined a series of measures aimed at making the financing and management of mosques more transparent. Most notably, he said that within the next four years a widespread practice that has foreign-trained imams come to preach in French mosques would be phased out in favor of a France-based training and certification system. He also said the bill would authorize prefects — representatives of the French state at the local level — to overrule mayors who are deemed too accommodating with religious minorities, for instance by allowing women- or men-only hours at public swimming pools. Yet his speech also addressed a deep-rooted problem in French society: its enduring difficulty to integrate significant parts of its large, nonwhite, Muslim population of immigrants and their descendants. The political establishment adheres to France’s founding universalist values, which reject public expressions of race, religion and ethnicity. But those ideals have come under increasing strain in a rapidly changing society, and were manifest in recent debates and protests over issues like police violence, race, colonialism and feminism, as nonwhite or younger French looked for ideas outside France, often to the United States. Even Mr. Macron — who vowed in the aftermath of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May that France would never unbolt statues — acknowledged on Friday that France “is a country that has a colonial past and that has traumas that have not been settled yet.” “Certain things were not as caricatural as one might have thought,” Sarah Mazouz, a sociologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said, referring to Mr. Macron’s comments on France’s colonial legacy. “But then, in the announcements, we come back to the usual practices and speeches that are essentially a security response.” Ms. Mazouz added that by framing individual practices, like dietary preferences or participating in swimming lessons, as a threat to the republic, Mr. Macron risked conflating Islam and terrorism. The failure to integrate immigrant populations and their descendants has contributed to a growing inequality in France. At its extreme, it has radicalized some young French, especially of North African origin, who went to fight for the Islamic State in Syria, or carried out terrorist attacks at home. They have included the two brothers who in 2015 attacked the office of Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper that published satirical cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, and whose alleged accomplices are now on trial. In some French communities, that failure has led to sociological, economic and ideological ghettos where Islamism has flourished, Chems-Eddine Hafiz, the rector of the Great Mosque of Paris, wrote in a column in Le Monde on Friday. Mr. Hafiz agreed on the need to combat such extremism and said he would support Mr. Macron’s efforts if they were sincere. But he also warned about the dangers of politicians exploiting the theme for gains “on the eve of electoral deadlines” and pushing through “gimmicky measures.”']","President Emmanuel Macron’s speech addressed a deep-rooted problem in French society: its enduring difficulty to integrate significant parts of its large, nonwhite, Muslim population of immigrants and their descendants."
Russian Opposition Leader Navalny Says Putin Is Behind His Poisoning,2020-10-01,By Christopher F. Schuetze and Megan Specia,"['BERLIN — Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, who was poisoned in August in Siberia, says he has no doubt that President Vladimir V. Putin was behind the attack. In his first full interview since being released from the hospital, Mr. Navalny said that the use of a closely held, military-grade nerve agent in the attack was convincing evidence that it had been ordered at the highest level of Russia’s security or intelligence services. “Putin is behind the crime,” he told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel in an interview published on Thursday. “I have no other versions of the crime. I am not saying this to flatter myself, but on the basis of facts.” Mr. Navalny has been recuperating in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany after the poisoning. Although he became ill and collapsed on a domestic flight in Russia, he and his team believe that he was poisoned in his hotel room in the city of Tomsk, in Siberia. He was discharged from a German hospital last week after 32 days, many of them in a medically induced coma. Initially, Mr. Navalny was treated for two days at a hospital in Omsk, Russia, where doctors offered a variety of diagnoses — none of them poisoning with a nerve agent from the Novichok family, as German military investigators determined —\xa0and claimed that he was too sick to be moved. The opposition leader called that a ruse and said that the Russians had initially been determined not to let him leave the country. “They were waiting for me to die,” he said. While Moscow has maintained that it played no role in the poisoning, Mr. Navalny would not be the first Kremlin adversary to be attacked with Novichok. A former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by the same class of toxin in Salisbury, England, in 2018, touching off a crisis in relations between the countries. Mr. Navalny said he hoped his recovery would be helpful in understanding the nerve agent. “The Russian leadership has developed such an inclination to poison that it will not stop so soon,” he said. “My medical history will yet become instructive.” The Novichok family of nerve agents was developed in the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and ’90s, and can be delivered as a liquid, powder or aerosol. The chemical is said to be more lethal than other well-known nerve agents. The poison causes muscle spasms that can stop the heart, cause fluid buildup in the lungs that can also be deadly, and damage other organs and nerve cells. Russia has produced several versions of Novichok, and it is anyone’s guess how often they have been used, experts say, because the resulting deaths can easily escape scrutiny, appearing like nothing more sinister than a fatal heart attack. “The doctors say I can recover 90 percent, maybe even 100 percent, but nobody really knows,” Mr. Navalny told Der Spiegel. “Basically, I’m something of a guinea pig — there aren’t that many people you can watch living after being poisoned with a nerve agent.” Mr. Navalny said he had long known that he could be subjected to arrest, beatings or even a targeted killing as a prominent opposition figure, but said he would never have suspected an attack with a chemical weapon like Novichok, since they are typically “reserved for secret service agents.” “Nobody expected a nerve agent. I could hardly believe it myself. It’s like dropping a nuclear bomb on a person,” he said. “There are a million more effective methods.” Mr. Navalny also described instantly suspecting that he had been poisoned when he began feeling ill on the flight, and lying down on the floor of the aircraft, convinced it was the end. “I know that I am dead,” he said. “Only it turned out later that I was wrong.” He also shed light on what his life has been like since being released from the hospital in Germany, and described his daily routine as “monotonous.” “I train every day — otherwise I do nothing,” he said. “In the morning I walk in the park — that is my job — then I do exercises with the doctor. In the evening, I walk again. During the day, I try to work on the computer.” Mr. Navalny said that he intended to return to Russia as soon as his health improves, because not returning would signal a victory for Mr. Putin. He also vowed to continue traveling throughout Russia and staying in hotels, despite fears for his life. “They will use more sophisticated methods against us, and we will try to survive,” he said of himself and others who oppose Mr. Putin’s government. When his interviewer noted that his hand was shaking as he poured a glass of water, he said the trembling was “not from fear,” but rather a result of the chemical agent. “My task now is to remain the guy who is not afraid,” Mr. Navalny said. “And I am not afraid!” Christopher F. Schuetzereported from Berlin and Megan Specia from London.']","In an interview with Der Spiegel, Aleksei Navalny said the use of a military-grade nerve agent was proof that Russia’s president was involved."

"Russian Journalist Sets Herself on Fire and Dies, Blaming Government",2020-10-02,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — A Russian journalist who edited an independent news website died on Friday, setting herself afire in front of police headquarters in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, a day after investigators had searched her home there. Just before her self-immolation, Irina Slavina, 47, the founder and editor of Koza Press, a local news site, posted a message on Facebook saying: “I ask you to blame the Russian Federation for my death.” Koza Press confirmed her death. The local branch of the Investigative Committee, Russia’s equivalent of the F.B.I., said in a statement that the allegation that her death had anything to do with the search of her apartment was “groundless.” The statement said the search had been conducted as part of a criminal case in which Ms. Slavina was considered a witness. Ms. Slavina said on Facebook Thursday that early in the morning 12 people, including members of a special police unit, had conducted a search of her apartment. The Facebook post said law enforcement agents had been looking for “brochures, leaflets, accounts” from Open Russia, an opposition organization, financed by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a Kremlin critic, who had to flee Russia after spending more than a decade in prison. The search was conducted as part of a criminal case against Mikhail Ioselevich, a local entrepreneur, who the authorities suspect was working together with Open Russia, officially regarded as an “undesirable organization” in the country. Ms. Slavina’s death came against the backdrop of rising dangers confronting journalists who write about subjects deemed objectionable by the Kremlin. The number of threats and attacks against journalists in the country has surged in recent years, according to incidents compiled by Justice for Journalists, an advocacy group. “Russia remains a country where working as a journalist is associated with increased risks to life, health and freedom,” the group says on its website. Before the search, Ms. Slavina had been continuously pressured by the local authorities. She was fined for taking part in opposition demonstrations in Nizhny Novgorod and for mentioning Open Russia in her Facebook posts. Local authorities throughout the Russian regions have been putting pressure on independent media outlets and journalists. Many have quit established publications to create their own small websites or blogs. Before founding her own news website in 2016, Ms. Slavina worked in several local media outlets, where she always faced various forms of censorship. “I lost jobs three times because I can say that I poked my nose too far,” she said in an interview in September of last year. The website’s only editor and writer, Ms. Slavina published investigative articles about the internal workings of the Federal Security Service, the most powerful security agency in Russia. Despite its one-member staff, Koza Press quickly turned into one of the most cited outlets in the region. In Nizhny Novgorod, a city of 1.3 million people 250 miles east of Moscow, people were taking flowers and candles to the site of Ms. Slavina’s death, according to photos posted online. Natalia Gryaznevich, an acquaintance of Ms. Slavina, described her “as a brave journalist, without any cynicism or suspiciousness.” “She was just a very free and passionate person,” Ms. Gryaznevich wrote on her Facebook account. “It is deadly dangerous to be such a person in Russia.”']","The self-immolation by the journalist, Irina Slavina, 47, a longtime Kremlin critic, came a day after the authorities in her hometown of Nizhny Novgorod had searched her apartment."
Trump’s positive cause global markets to tumble.,2020-10-02,By Carlos Tejada,"['Global markets dropped early Friday after President Trump said that he and the first lady had tested positive for the coronavirus. European markets opened more than 1 percent lower with some markets recovering slightly as the day went on. Wall Street was set to open sharply lower, according to futures markets, but intense volatility suggested that investors will still be parsing how strongly to react to the news. The news injects a huge amount of uncertainty into financial markets, and uncertainty is what investors like least. It throws the political leadership of the world’s largest economy into doubt. It also raises questions about his campaign for re-election against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic challenger. The election is set for Nov. 3, a little more than a month away. The market moves early on Friday reflected those jitters. Investors sought to put money in investments that are traditionally considered safe havens. Prices rose for United States Treasury bonds, sending yields lower. Gold prices also rose, as did the value of the Japanese yen against other currencies. Investments that are more sensitive to economic and policy shifts fell quickly. Oil futures slid on Friday along with stocks, while other commodities fell too. In Japan, where the news broke late on the trading day, stocks were nearly 0.7 percent lower after spending most of the day in positive territory.

"After 2 Years of Paralysis, Belgium Forms a (Very Fragile) Government",2020-10-01,By Matt Apuzzo and Monika Pronczuk,"['BRUSSELS — For nearly two years, Belgium has been without a formal government, leaving a country that was already divided by language and politics to endure a pandemic with lame-duck caretakers wielding emergency powers. A fragile coalition government finally took power on Thursday, ending one of the longest political stalemates in the Western world. Cobbled together from seven political parties, the partnership keeps a growing far-right movement at bay for now and should allow the country to finally pass a budget and consider a Covid-19 recovery package. But the transition, which is set to be formally adopted by lawmakers this weekend, is not without risk. The governing coalition is now so large that any disagreement has the potential to topple it. And ushering in a new government means forcing out the ministers who have overseen the pandemic response — at a time when infections and hospitalizations are rising. “The government will do everything possible to contain outbreaks quickly and locally,” the new prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said in a national address in which he compared the pandemic to the Great Depression of the 1930s. “Our country, our economy and our businesses cannot take another general lockdown.” Belgium is notoriously difficult to govern. The wealthy Dutch-speaking region in the north and a poorer French-speaking region in the south each have their own governments, political parties and cultures. That makes the national Parliament a political grab bag, with no party holding close to the majority needed to govern. The previous national government collapsed in December 2018, toppled by a populist revolt over migration. Belgium’s linguistic and cultural divide magnifies the similar challenges facing leaders across Europe and the United States, where centrist politicians face pressure from their far left and far right. In that way, the new government will be a test, in the heart of the European Union, of whether fractured parties can find common ground. Mr. De Croo (pronounced “crow”), 44, was sworn in on Thursday as prime minister. A center-right Dutch-speaking politician, he will lead an unlikely coalition that includes the Socialists and the Greens, along with centrists and socially liberal fiscal conservatives. The newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws called it “a government deal worthy of a buffet restaurant.” With such a range of political views, the government is vulnerable to any dispute. If one party defects, the coalition is likely to collapse. “In Belgium, it’s always fragile,” said Philippe De Backer, who until Thursday led the government’s emergency task force for coronavirus testing and protective equipment. But he said that the new government would inherit a stockpile of 200 million medical masks and the ability to test 45,000 people a day. The country recently surpassed 10,000 coronavirus deaths and has one of the world’s highest per capita fatality rates. That figure is due in large part to the government’s failure to protect older adults. Nursing home patients accounted for two of every three Covid-19 deaths this spring, and public health officials have acknowledged that the country’s unwieldy bureaucracy slowed their response to the crisis. Overhauling that system will be challenging, however, as the national government is under constant pressure to give the regions more power. That is especially true in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region, which is home to two right-wing separatist parties. One of them, Vlaams Belang, has risen in power in recent years with a message that is increasingly racist and anti-immigrant. Vlaams Belang has pledged to work against the national government. At a recent antigovernment demonstration, Nazi symbols were visible among the thousands of protesters who took to the streets. The failure to form a government had become a long-running and rueful joke in Brussels, an unofficial capital of the European Union. Immediately after Mr. De Croo’s national address, he dashed across town to join other European leaders at a foreign affairs summit meeting. Half the new government’s ministers are women, a first for Belgium, Mr. De Croo said. One of them, Petra De Sutter, a gynecologist, became the first openly transgender minister. And two years after a fight over migration upended the government, Sammy Mahdi, a 32-year-old son of an Iraqi refugee, became the minister in charge of immigration. “Our diversity makes us stronger,” Mr. De Croo said. Caroline Sägesser of the Brussels-based Center for Socio-Political Research and Information, was less optimistic. She said the country was “sliding toward paralysis” because so many people lacked a national identity. A key reason, she said, is that French and Dutch speakers effectively live in different worlds. They read different newspapers, watch different television stations and attend school in their own languages. News coverage typically focuses on regional, not national, affairs. “The only thing you get that’s national is the weather report,” Ms. Sägesser said. “This was not the case 30 years ago. Our living space has shrunk to our own linguistic community.” The Belgian Parliament is expected to vote on Saturday to approve the new government, seen as a formality now that the ministers have all taken office. To allow for social distancing under the nation’s public health regulations, the voting has been moved to the cavernous European Parliament, a legislative body of the European Union.']","A coalition, cobbled together from seven political parties, will try to keep a growing far-right movement at bay and look to finally pass a budget and a pandemic recovery package."
TV news networks begin live coverage of the president’s infection.,2020-10-02,By Michael M.

On Fox News, the host Sean Hannity, a close confidant of Mr. Trump, dialed in to declare the president “strong” and “healthy.” An overnight anchor, Ashley Strohmier, later told Fox News viewers of the president: “He obviously does not sleep. The man works 24/7. He’s up, I feel, like every hour of the day.” Mr. Trump’s former doctor, Ronny Jackson, called into Fox News and sought to downplay concerns about Mr. Trump’s health. “I bet you he does not develop symptoms,” Dr. Jackson said. “This does not become a big deal.” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, later said that the president was experiencing “mild symptoms.” By Friday afternoon his symptoms included a low-grade fever, nasal congestion and a cough, according to two people close to Mr. Trump.']",
"Jacinda Ardern Admits Past Cannabis Use. New Zealanders Shrug: ‘Us, Too.’",2020-10-01,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The question from the debate moderator in New Zealand was simple and to the point: “Jacinda Ardern, have you ever used cannabis?” “Yes I did,” said Ms. Ardern, the country’s popular prime minister, “a long time ago.” The moderator paused, looking surprised. Then the audience applauded. Ms. Ardern later declined to say whether she supported the legalization of marijuana, which New Zealanders will decide in a referendum with the national election on Oct. 17. But by that point in the debate on Wednesday, she had already won another smiley-face emoji from the global left, while reminding voters that she hadn’t always been so earnest. Before leading the coronavirus lockdown that worked and becoming New Zealand’s unifier-in-chief after the deadly shootings last year at two mosques in Christchurch, Ms. Ardern was, it seemed, like most of her constituents: a toker, at least once or twice. Roughly 80 percent of New Zealanders have tried marijuana, according to independent studies — more than double the rate for Australians, and far above what Americans report, too. So when Ms. Ardern, 40, acknowledged her own past drug use, the nation of five million — where a lot of things are green and dank — simply shrugged. “Most people will have just smiled to themselves, as most have had a puff,” said Peter Williamson, 67, a Methodist minister in South Auckland. “I’m probably one of the few people who’s never actually had the opportunity.” That’s New Zealand for you — democracy’s relaxed parallel universe. While President Trump and Joe Biden were drawing comparisons to dumpster fires inside a train wreck this week, Ms. Ardern and her opponent, Judith Collins, leader of the conservative National Party, were engaging in an intense debate with just a few interruptions (and a call at one point for “manners”). New Zealand’s upcoming election is an anomaly in other ways as well. It has the potential to be historic — as a marker of consensus, not division. Ms. Ardern is such a favorite that the only question is whether her Labor Party will win enough support to form New Zealand’s first majority government since landmark electoral reform in the 1990s, or whether she will need to form a coalition with the Greens. Marijuana has become a hot issue precisely for that reason. With a majority in reach, Ms. Ardern has been reminding the world that her politics of kindness also includes steely calculation. Helen Clark, the former Labor prime minister who is a vocal supporter of legalization, said “the indication that she has used it is in itself a powerful signal.” But polls show a closely divided electorate on legalization. Some observers see that as the reason Ms. Ardern has refused to say which way she leans on the issue. “She needs center-right voters,” said Richard Shaw, a politics professor at Massey University in Palmerston North. “The concern might be that the National Party would use it against her as a weapon.” For now, her “I smoked but may not want you to” approach has flummoxed her critics on both the left and the right. During the debate on Wednesday night, Ms. Collins, a lawyer who is the second woman to lead the National Party, interjected a sarcastic “come on” when Ms. Ardern said she wanted to let the public decide whether marijuana should be legal. Her own answer was more definitive: Ms. Collins, 61, said she had never used cannabis and would vote no on the referendum. “I want to protect the mental health of young people in particular,” she said. Many New Zealanders seem, like Ms. Ardern, to be arguing not about the intent of the law, but how far it would go and how it should be passed. Mr. Williamson, the Methodist pastor, who is also a former criminal barrister, said he would prefer that marijuana possession be decriminalized. Indigenous New Zealanders are three times as likely to be arrested and charged with marijuana offenses as white New Zealanders are. “An ordinary person with a small amount of marijuana should not be afraid of being stopped by police,” he said. Even supporters of legalization have wondered aloud if the referendum was the best way to go. It lays out in great detail how the drug would be regulated: Cannabis would be sold via licensed retailers; it would be legal for those 20 and older; and people would be allowed to grow up to four plants at home, and share up to 14 grams socially. But given that Ms. Ardern said in 2017 that she supported a public health approach to recreational marijuana use, many ask, why turn the decision over to the people? “They committed to writing a very good law, but they’re letting it hang out in a no-man’s-land,” said Ross Bell, executive director of the Drug Foundation, which has worked for decades to reduce the harm of alcohol and drugs through education and policy advocacy. Nandor Tanczos, a former Greens party lawmaker who is now on the district council in the town of Whakatane, and who runs a social change organization called He Puna Whenua, agreed. “Parliament should have just legislated these reforms, based on science,” he said. Relying on a referendum, he argued, has allowed misinformation to bloom. One example he cited: The antilegalization lobby has shown images of businesses with marijuana ads plastered on them — although the new law would prohibit advertising. “It’s an attempt to scare people into thinking we’re getting something different than we actually will,” Mr. Tanczos said. That kind of fearmongering could have long-term consequences, said Mr. Bell. “A ‘no’ vote means no politicians will touch cannabis for a long, long time,” he said. “And that law will stay, doing harm mainly to young people and Maori.” Amanda Saxton contributed reporting from Auckland, New Zealand.']","As a former marijuana smoker, the prime minister has plenty of company in New Zealand.

"Breaking Impasse, E.U. Imposes Sanctions on Belarus",2020-10-01,By Steven Erlanger and Monika Pronczuk,"['BRUSSELS — European Union leaders early Friday finally broke a longstanding impasse to impose sanctions against Belarus as they tackled a raft of interconnected issues — from Turkey to the coronavirus recovery fund to the rule of law — that would have been complicated even if taken one by one. The delay in punishing Belarus for its crackdown after flawed elections on Aug. 9 had been a huge embarrassment for the bloc, and one that Charles Michel, president of the European Council, which comprises the bloc’s leaders, had insisted on resolving, at long last. The sanctions had been blocked by Cyprus, which wants penalties imposed on Turkey for its energy explorations in Cypriot and Greek waters. Early Friday morning, after eight hours of talks, the leaders agreed on language that urges Turkey to enter serious negotiations with both Cyprus and Greece on disputed waters and energy rights, and threatens sanctions against it for breaches of international law. Mr. Michel said Brussels still hoped to create “a positive agenda” with Turkey and would review relations in December. Most important, though, the compromise opened the way for Cyprus to lift its veto and allow the bloc to impose sanctions on some 40 key Belarusian officials — even if those sanctions are likely to have, as many predict, little or no impact on President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko’s behavior or hold on power. Mr. Lukashenko himself is not on the sanction list. With Turkey now in talks with Greece after German and NATO mediation, there was little appetite among many of the leaders to annoy Ankara further by imposing sanctions against it now, especially given its importance in helping to manage migration flows into Europe. There is general unhappiness with the aggressive positions taken by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on display again with his support for Azerbaijan in its clashes with Armenia. But the European Union needs to find a modus vivendi with Mr. Erdogan, and antagonizing him further is unlikely to change his behavior. Still hanging over the leaders, though, is the bloc’s problem with violations of the rule of law in member states, and how efforts to punish those violations are tied in with money. Of particular concern are the coronavirus recovery fund of 750 billion euros, or about $880 billion, and the European Union’s €1.1 trillion multiyear budget. In July, leaders agreed in a vague way to condition spending to adherence to the rule of law. The insistence of several northern countries, notably Austria, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, on a connection drew immediate opposition from Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, which felt targeted by the measure. A German proposal to open talks on that condition with the European Parliament, which must approve the spending, is considered too lax by a third of the member states, because it is seen as focusing more on the misuse of money than on breaches of law. But without a deal, delivery of the funds, which countries badly affected by the virus, such as Italy and Spain, desperately need, will be delayed even further into next year. So between the two presumably worthy goals — enforcing the rule of law with conditions on funding, and then delivering the funding more quickly — is a political quandary that cannot be resolved quickly. In the background, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, has introduced a less confrontational effort to warn countries about authoritarian backsliding. For the first time, the commission has published assessments of the state of democracy in each of the 27 member states, avoiding singling out Hungary and Poland (though their reports were more critical than most). Democratic standards are facing “important challenges,” especially in Hungary and Poland, where judicial systems are under threat, the reports said. They found that prosecution of high-level corruption in Hungary “remains very limited,” and deemed Poland deficient in the four main areas reviewed: national justice systems, anticorruption frameworks, freedom of the press, and checks and balances. Prosecution of high-level corruption is also limited in the Czech Republic and Malta, the reports said, and there were special challenges to a free press in Bulgaria, Hungary, Malta and Poland. Poland got particular attention, because bloc officials believe that there is more potential for remedial action there than in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban called for the resignation of the commissioner in charge of the reports, Vera Jourova of the Czech Republic, who called his country an “ill democracy.” Ms. Jourova, the commissioner for European values, told journalists, “It is relevant to have an overview of these issues and see the links between them — not least because deficiencies often merge into an undrinkable cocktail.” “The European Union was created also as an antidote to those authoritarian tendencies,” she added. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, rejected Mr. Orban’s demands. But Hungary and Poland announced that they would set up their own institute to assess the rule of law in all member nations to avoid “double standards,” Hungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said. He added that he had had “enough of some Western European politicians using us as a punching bag.” Hungary and Poland have repeatedly clashed with Brussels over issues like judicial independence, freedom of speech, the role of the news media and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. But the commission has few weapons. It initiated proceedings before the European Court of Justice, whose rulings are obeyed, albeit reluctantly, by Budapest and Warsaw. And it set into action a mechanism that could theoretically lead to the loss of voting rights, but which is useless because it requires unanimity, and Poland and Hungary have vowed to protect each another. Officials have been reluctant to file an avalanche of cases before the court for fear of being seen as targeting countries and because they would take a long time to resolve. Hence the effort to tie the disbursement of funds to the rule of law. The German proposal will face a serious challenge in the European Parliament. Sergey Lagodinsky, a Green lawmaker in the chamber, said, “The report as it stands is a toothless tiger, unless it is accompanied by an effective enforcement mechanism that includes cutting funds in case of deficiencies.” The proposal, he said, “has decapitated the initial idea.” But without a deal soon, warned Michael Clauss, the German ambassador to the bloc, “delays with consequences for Europe’s economic recovery will most likely be unavoidable.”']",The delay in punishing Belarus for the crackdown that followed its flawed elections had been a huge embarrassment for the bloc. 
"Trump Tests Positive for Coronavirus, and the World Shudders",2020-10-02,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — President Trump’s disclosure that he had been infected by the coronavirus sent a shudder around the world on Friday, drawing sympathy from leaders who have grappled with the pandemic in their own countries and more pointed responses from critics who noted Mr. Trump’s cavalier handling of the threat. Mr. Trump is not the first world leader to be stricken. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil both were infected — drawing an eerie link between three populist politicians whose countries have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. At 74, Mr. Trump is older and more vulnerable than either of those men. The news of an American president contracting a potentially lethal virus also carried global repercussions beyond what would be generated by any other world leader. Financial markets fell in Asia and wobbled in Europe and the United States, before steadying after the disclosure that Vice President Mike Pence had tested negative. For allies and adversaries alike, there was a sense of shock as they woke up to the news on Friday — even after three and a half years in which many believed they had lost the capacity to be shocked by anything involving a president whose words and deeds have regularly rocked the international order. From Mr. Johnson to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a host of foreign leaders voiced concern, sending Mr. Trump good wishes for his convalescence, as well as that of the first lady, Melania Trump, who was also infected. “Hope they both have a speedy recovery from coronavirus,” Mr. Johnson said on Twitter, making no mention of his own bout with Covid-19, which sent him to an intensive-care unit where, he said later, “things could have gone either way.” Mr. Putin, who has taken extraordinary precautions to shield himself during the pandemic, told Mr. Trump by telegram, “I am certain that your inherent vitality, good spirits and optimism will help you cope with this dangerous virus.” Beyond the expressions of sympathy, however, there was an unmistakable sense of “I told you so,” particularly in countries that have practiced social distancing more assiduously than has much of the United States. Mr. Trump, these critics noted, had minimized the threat of the virus, spurned simple precautions like wearing a mask and taken risks like holding campaign rallies with little or no social distancing and few if any masks. During the presidential debate on Tuesday, he mocked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for wearing a mask. “If you look at all his public campaigns, there are lots of people who gather without masks,” said Kenichiro Sasae, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington. Mr. Trump, he said, “had given the impression that he’s trying to open the economy first.” In China, which Mr. Trump has blamed as the seedbed of the virus, the commentary reflected a mix of sympathy, disbelief and even celebration from some who saw the development as just retribution for Mr. Trump. “The whole world rejoices!” read one comment on Sina Weibo, a popular though heavily censored social media platform, which was liked 55,000 times in the hour after it was posted. Others took the opportunity to ridicule Mr. Trump. Radoslaw Sikorski, a former foreign minister of Poland, wrote on Twitter, “Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I suggest you do not try to treat yourself with bleach.” For some, Mr. Trump’s misfortune was a grim reminder of a virus that does not distinguish between rich and poor, weak and powerful. Some even saw it as a kind of teachable moment for the world’s most powerful man. In Myanmar, a Baptist minister who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last year and told him about oppression and torture by the military, said this ordeal could help him better understand the pain of others. “Now, he is suffering himself and he should be compassionate for his people,” said the minister, Hkalam Samson. Britain’s experience shows that even in a country with a well-organized political system, a leader’s sudden illness can be deeply unsettling. When Mr. Johnson contracted the virus in March, the government was adrift for several days while he struggled to keep leading the response to the pandemic, via Zoom calls, from isolation in his official residence on Downing Street. When Mr. Johnson, 56, was admitted to the hospital and then to intensive care, he deputized the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to act in his absence. But that did little to dispel the uncertainty, especially since unlike in the United States, there is no legal line of succession if a prime minister dies in office or is permanently incapacitated. The government issued upbeat, unrevealing reports of Mr. Johnson’s health, using phrases like “mild symptoms” and “good spirits” — the same terminology deployed by White House officials on Friday. After Mr. Johnson was released from the hospital on Easter Sunday, he disclosed that his condition had been graver than was reported. Even now, six months later, politicians in Westminster whisper that Mr. Johnson is not fully back in fighting form, though he insisted earlier this week he was as “as fit as a butcher’s dog,” having lost weight since his illness. In Brazil, Mr. Bolsonaro’s bout with the virus was less serious. He said he suffered only mild fever and body aches before testing positive on July 7. After quarantining on the grounds of the presidential residence in Brasília, he pronounced himself recovered on July 25, posting a photo of himself smiling and giving a thumbs up. Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, who has adopted Mr. Trump’s approach of playing down the virus and promoting miracle cures, appeared to brandish a box of hydroxychloroquine pills, the anti-malaria medicine. Despite claims by Mr. Trump, there is growing scientific consensus that the drug is not effective in treating Covid-19. In the zero-sum world of geopolitics, Mr. Trump’s setback deepens a political and public-health crisis in a country already consumed by the presidential election. Some analysts said they worried that China, Russia, Iran, North Korea or another adversary would try to exploit the disarray in Washington. “The unanswerable question is whether any country will be tempted to use this period to advance its own agenda on the assumption that the United States will be too preoccupied to respond,” said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations who served in the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Trump’s erratic style had already been a recurring source of anxiety abroad. Analysts said the major worry was not about continuity of government — given the depth of contingency planning in the United States — but how the president would react to enforced confinement and the specter of illness. “This highlights that what has always been destabilizing about Trump’s administration is not really his policies — it is him,” said Jeremy Shapiro, an Obama administration national security official who is now research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “In this sense, the worry from foreign governments will likely be its effect on the president’s fragile psyche.” On a day-to-day basis, however, Mr. Trump’s health problems are not likely to affect relations with most countries. His nuclear negotiations with North Korea are paralyzed anyway. And he has just come off a diplomatic coup with the restoration of relations between Israel and Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Trump’s vilification of China has frozen relations with Beijing. His tensions with the European Union over trade and Iran — on top of the distractions of the pandemic — had limited his contact with leaders like Ms. Merkel. She had rebuffed his invitation to a Group of 7 meeting in May. Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to Washington, characterized the news as a “blip"" in “the brain of our leaders, who have much more urgent issues to handle.” And Kim Darroch, a former British ambassador to the United States, said, “It’s not like Trump was all that great at consulting anyway.” Mr. Darroch, who resigned his post last year after British newspapers published private cables in which he was bluntly critical of the Trump administration, said close allies like Britain communicated with the United States regularly through military, diplomatic and intelligence channels. But that does not mean, he said, that people in Britain and elsewhere were not following the news in the United States with keen interest. “We all care about this because America is the global superpower,” he said.

Data shows fewer Afghan women than men get Covid-19. That’s bad news.,2020-10-03,By Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Fatima Faizi,"['In Afghanistan, the numbers of women reported to have tested positive for the virus and to have died of Covid-19 are far below the numbers reported for men. Globally, men account for 53 percent of confirmed cases and 58 percent of deaths, according to the independent research group Global Health 50/50. But in Afghanistan, men account for 70 percent of cases and 74 percent of deaths — a discrepancy that experts say is most likely the result of women being shut out of the health care system and the public sphere. Afghan women face obstacles within both their own households and the health care facilities themselves, said Suraya Dalil, who was Afghanistan’s public health minister from 2010 to 2014 and now leads special programs in public health at the World Health Organization. “Women have to be accompanied by somebody to go to the hospital,” she said, “so those decisions are often made by the men in a household, whether it’s the husband or the father or the son.” And when women do get to health care facilities, they are expected to engage only with female doctors, she added. That becomes nearly impossible given the small number of female doctors. Another explanation for the gap could be that Afghanistan’s labor force is male-dominated. A study published by the Center for Economic Policy Research in London found a positive correlation between women’s participation in the work force and Covid-19 death rates. In Afghanistan, women make up only about 30 percent of the work force. All of this brings into sharp focus how much hangs in the balance for Afghan women as the government holds peace negotiations with the Taliban.']",
Belgium Arrests 3 Men Suspected of Involvement in Rwandan Genocide,2020-10-03,By Elian Peltier and Abdi Latif Dahir,"['LONDON — Three men suspected of involvement in the 1994 Rwanda genocide were arrested in Belgium this week, according to the Belgian authorities, the latest in a series of captures linked to the 100-day blood bath in which as many as one million people were killed. A spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor’s office said that the men were arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that two of the suspects remained in detention while the third was put under electronic surveillance. “The investigation is still ongoing, and the prosecutor’s office will determine whether the men should face trial,” said the spokesman, Eric Van der Sypt. He declined to provide details about the identities of the men, who were charged with serious abuse of human rights. The arrests, which were reported by the Belgian weekly magazine Le Vif on Friday, are the latest attempts to bring justice over the genocide, in which as many as one million ethnic Tutsis and Hutus were killed. After more than two decades on the run, Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy tycoon who was accused of financing the genocide, was arrested by the French authorities in May outside his home in a Paris suburb. Mr. Kabuga, 84, was accused of importing several hundred thousand machetes that were used during the killings and was also charged over his funding of Radio-Television Mille Collines, which incited hatred against ethnic Tutsis. Mr. Kabuga denied the accusations, and his lawyers said he was too old to stand trial at a United Nations tribunal in Tanzania. But in late September, France’s top appeals court ruled that he should be tried at the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals in the Tanzanian town of Arusha. The tribunal took over the duties of the U.N.’s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which folded in 2015, and which indicted Mr. Kabuga in 1997 on seven charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity. Rwanda’s government has also sought to arrest and extradite those involved in the genocide. In late August, officials in Kigali wrote to the French authorities in an effort to extradite a former top spy chief, Maj. Gen. Aloys Ntiwiragabo, who is accused of crimes against humanity. He was found in July while living in the suburbs of Orléans, about 70 miles southwest of Paris. Rwanda has also cracked down on those it accuses of denying the genocide and distorting how events unfolded in those tragic days. These include Paul Rusesabagina, the famed hotelier depicted in the movie “Hotel Rwanda” who sheltered 1,268 people during the killings. Last month, the authorities said they had lured Mr. Rusesabagina — whom they previously accused of minimizing the gravity of the genocide — to return from abroad. He now faces 13 charges, including terrorism, complicity in kidnap and murder, and forming a rebel group, all of which he denies. The U.N.’s Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda indicted over 90 people and tried 80 of them, according to data provided by the tribunal. Six fugitives suspected of involvement in the genocide remain on an international most-wanted list. Since 2001, Belgium has held five trials of Rwandans accused of involvement in the genocide. In 2009, a court in Brussels sentenced a former executive of the Commercial Bank of Rwanda, Ephrem Nkezabera, to 30 years in prison for war crimes. In December, a Brussels court for the first time found a former Rwandan official guilty of genocide. The official, Fabien Neretse, was also found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

"Amid a surge in cases, India plans to reopen cinemas, entertainment parks and some schools.",2020-10-01,By Sameer Yasir,"['Despite a fast-growing number of coronavirus cases, India will allow cinemas and entertainment parks to open with limited capacity beginning Oct. 15, in an effort to revive an economy that has been battered by the pandemic. Swimming pools will be open for athletes in training, and states could be allowed to open schools. As of Thursday, India had at least 6.3 million reported cases and 98,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The country has the second-highest caseload in the world but has reported nearly twice as many new cases in the past week — at least 580,000 — than the United States, the world’s leader in total cases. India’s health ministry said on Thursday that the month of September, with about 2.6 million new cases, accounted for 41.5 percent of the total caseload in the country. The death toll in September also accounted for about one-third of India’s total. Many Indians doubt restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus, including penalties for noncompliance, are working. That thinking is fast seeping into the countryside, where people hardly wear masks now and maintain little social distance. People in cities are more likely to follow restrictions. As the cases continue to rise, many Indians are also blaming the government for a poorly planned and severe lockdown in late March. During the lockdown, most cases were concentrated in urban areas. The sudden lockdown crippled an already ailing economy, and hundreds of thousands of Indians were left jobless. But as restrictions on interstate travel were eased, many people started moving from the cities to rural areas, bringing the virus with them. Now, despite the country passing one milestone after another, officials are still going ahead and lifting more restrictions, hoping to ease the economic suffering.']",
The U.S. presidential campaign is upended in its final stretch.,2020-10-02,"By Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Matt Stevens","['President Trump’s announcement early Friday that he had contracted the coronavirus upended the presidential race in an instant, inviting significant questions about his cavalier attitude toward the pandemic and the future of his campaign just 32 days before the election. Mr. Trump had already been trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the polls, in part because of his mishandling of a virus that has unsettled the day-to-day lives of voters for over six months. The president compounded his difficulties by disregarding and at times belittling the basic precautions, such as wearing a mask, that his health advisers were urging Americans to take to protect themselves. Now, though, his personal indifference toward the virus could threaten his own health, the stability of the country and his already dimming hopes for re-election. Strategists in both parties and even senior aides to Mr. Trump said the president would face a harsh judgment from voters for throwing the country into greater uncertainty after one of the most trying years in American history. “It’s hard to imagine this doesn’t end his hopes of re-election,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican consultant, pointing to Mr. Trump’s “flaunting of obvious precautions.” Mr. Trump’s political fortunes will depend in part on the severity of his illness. Other world leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, have been sickened by the virus and returned to lead their countries. The 74-year-old president is older than his counterparts who have contracted the virus, however, and they were not on the ballot when they tested positive. Even if he does fully recover after his isolation period, millions of Americans are already voting right now, via mail-in ballot or in-person early voting. After a year that began with Mr. Trump’s impeachment and has included a pandemic, an economic collapse, racial justice protests and urban unrest as well as the death last month of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, this October surprise could also prompt voters to seek a respite from the tumult. In the White House, advisers to the president acknowledged that the positive test would remind voters of how dismissive Mr. Trump had been about the virus, not only with his own neglect of safety but also in his overly rosy assessments about a pandemic that has killed more than 207,000 people in the United States. Mr. Trump’s recklessness, one adviser admitted, amounted to a political “disaster.”']",
"Battling Wildfire and Pandemic, Ukraine Faces a New Foe: Landmines",2020-10-03,By Maria Varenikova,"['VINNYTSIA, Ukraine — A wildfire burning out of control in the war zone in eastern Ukraine is setting off land mines in a buffer area between government forces and Russian-backed separatists, complicating the already dangerous work of fire crews facing hot, dry and windy conditions. The fire is burning through an area of grassy hills and pine forests, all tinder dry, in the Luhansk region, near the border with Russia and divided by the front line in the war, which began in 2014 and has settled into a long stalemate. The explosions reported by firefighters and military observers near the front line, called the line of control, have piled one problem on top of another, hampering firefighting efforts. “We cannot reach it because of the mines, and we cannot use aviation because of the war,” Mykhailo Shevchenko, a member of the city council in Stanytsia Luhanska, a nearby town, said in a telephone interview. Firefighting airplanes could become targets of antiaircraft systems near the front. A cease-fire agreed to in July has mostly held, but mines, unexploded artillery shells, lost bullets and other hazards litter the area after years of conflict. There are no indications either side has tried to use the fire or smoke to restart hostilities. Mr. Shevchenko said he stood near part of the wildfire zone for a time and heard “continuous explosions of different strengths, from bullets to anti-tank mines.” Local residents have told Ukrainian authorities that artillery shelling into the dry forest touched off at least one wildfire, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the cause is still unknown. Whatever started it, hot, dry winds have fanned the flames. “This is not the best year for our country in terms of natural disasters and other tragedies,” Mr. Zelensky said at a briefing Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated firefighting and evacuation efforts. Seven people have died in the wildfires, 18 have been injured and another four are missing, all unrelated to the exploding ordnance, officials said. The fires have destroyed or damaged about 400 houses, forced the closure of the region’s only crossing point over the front line, and destroyed a Red Cross aid point. Evacuees, meanwhile, are at risk of catching the virus in crowded shelters. When the fire approached Olhovski Dachi, a summer home community, Tetiana Vasiukova boarded a bus with about 30 other residents and spent the night with them on folding beds in a community center. While worried about the virus, Ms. Vasiukova said she mostly felt “very depressed” to see the region’s forests burn. Farther from the front, the fire forced the evacuation of a dormitory for schoolchildren, many of whom had moved there from front-line villages at risk of artillery shelling. Liubov Ponomarenko, 15, said in a telephone interview that she had been enjoying the sense of safety of the dormitory before the fire arrived. Deadlier and more frequent wildfires are occurring around the world, often linked to climate change. In Australia’s wildfire season, wind and heat fanned what Australians called “megablazes.” Major wildfires exploded on the West Coast of the United States in the worst fire season on record there. Ukraine has been no exception. The number of wildfires in Ukraine tripled during the first half of the year; the burned area was 40 times larger compared with the same period last year. This spring, a large wildfire burned through the so-called Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That fire burned through a radioactive forest, causing radiation to waft into the air with smoke that blew over Kyiv, the capital, though not at concentrations considered harmful, officials said.

"Italy’s daily new cases topped 2,000 for the first time since April.",2020-10-01,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['Italy registered a number of infections exceeding 2,000 for the first time since April on Thursday, when 2,548 residents tested positive for coronavirus in one day. Before Italy’s civil protection agency released the official daily figures, in an appointment that has become a routine for Italians, Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced that he would seek to extend a state of emergency the country has been working under until at least the end of January. The decree, which was put in place to help deal with the pandemic, allows the government to maintain greater centralized power, skip some bureaucracy, including making working from home easier, and restrict travel if need be. Italy is faring better than many of its neighbors at the moment. But Italians have seen the virus at its worst. From March through May, more than 30,000 people in Italy died of the virus and it still has the highest death toll in continental Europe. Health officials have expressed concern about the situation of neighboring countries, like Spain and France, which are seeing strong spikes in cases. And the reopening of schools and universities has led millions of Italians to increase their social interactions, adding to virus risks. Mr. Conte said that the situation remained “critical” in televised remarks, and that it demands diligence from officials and from citizens alike.']",
"Germany’s Far Right Reunified, Too, Making It Much Stronger",2020-10-03,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — They called him the “Führer of Berlin.” Ingo Hasselbach had been a clandestine neo-Nazi in communist East Berlin, but the fall of the Berlin Wall brought him out of the shadows. He connected with western extremists in the unified city, organized far-right workshops, fought street battles with leftists and celebrated Hitler’s birthday. He dreamed of a far-right party in the parliament of a reunified Germany. Today, the far-right party Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD, is the main opposition in Parliament. Its leaders march side by side with far-right extremists in street protests. And its power base is the former communist East. “Reunification was a huge boost for the far right,” said Mr. Hasselbach, who left the neo-Nazi scene years ago and now helps others to do the same. “The neo-Nazis were the first ones to be reunified. We laid the foundation for a party like the AfD. There are things we used to say that have become mainstream today.” As it marks the 30th anniversary of reunification on Saturday, Germany can rightly celebrate being an economic powerhouse and thriving liberal democracy. But reunification has another, rarely mentioned legacy — of unifying, empowering and bringing into the open a far-right movement that has evolved into a disruptive political force and a terrorist threat, not least inside key state institutions like the military and police. “Today’s far-right extremism in Germany cannot be understood without reunification,” said Matthias Quent, a far-right extremism expert and director of an institute that studies democracy and civil society in the eastern state of Thuringia. “It liberated the neo-Nazis in the East from their underground existence, and it gave the far-right in the West access to a pool of new recruits and whole swathes of territory in which to move without too much oversight.” For years, German officials trusted that a far-right party could never again be elected into Parliament and dismissed the idea of far-right terrorist networks. But some now worry that the far-right structures established in the years after reunification laid the groundwork for a resurgence that has burst into view over the past 15 months. Far-right terrorists killed a regional politician on his front porch near the central city of Kassel, attacked a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle and shot dead nine people of immigrant descent in the western city of Hanau. This summer, the government took the drastic step of disbanding an entire military company in the special forces after explosives, a machine gun and SS paraphernalia were found on the property of a sergeant major in the eastern state of Saxony. A disproportionate number — about half — of those suspected of far-right extremism inside that unit, the KSK, were from the former East, its commander said. Nationalism and xenophobia are more ingrained in the former East, where the murderous history of World War II was never confronted as deeply on a societal level as it was in the former West. The AfD’s vote share is twice as high in the eastern states, where the number of far-right hate crimes is higher than in western ones. Officially, there were no Nazis in old East Germany. The regime defined itself in the tradition of communists who had resisted fascism, giving rise to a state doctrine of remembrance that effectively exculpated it from wartime atrocities. Far-right mobs who beat up foreign workers from fellow socialist states like Cuba or Angola were classified as “rowdies” led astray by western propaganda. But a potent neo-Nazi movement was growing underground. In 1987, Bernd Wagner, a young police officer in East Berlin, estimated that there were 15,000 “homegrown” violent neo-Nazis, of whom 1,000 were repeat offenders. His report was swiftly locked away. Two years later, as tens of thousands took to the streets in anti-communist protests that eventually brought down the regime, the pro-democracy activists were not the only marchers. “The skinheads were marching, too,” Mr. Wagner recalled. The battle cry of those anti-communist protests — “We are the people” — later became the battle cry for the far right at anti-Muslim Pegida marches during the 2015 refugee crisis, far-right riots in Chemnitz in 2018, and again at the current anti-coronavirus protests. Before reunification, the far-right scene in West Germany was small and aging, but now western neo-Nazis flocked east to offer “reconstruction aid” and unexpectedly found a refuge. Behind the wall, the East had been frozen in time, a largely homogeneous white country where nationalism was allowed to live on. “The leaders of the western scene thought they were in paradise,” Mr. Hasselbach recalled. Since then the East has become the home of choice for several prominent western extremists. Götz Kubitschek, a leading far-right intellectual from Swabia who wants to preserve the “ethno-cultural identity” of Germany, bought a rural manor house in the East, which serves as the headquarters for his far-right publishing house and research institute. So did Björn Höcke and Andreas Kalbitz, two westerners who became leaders of the most radical factions of the AfD in the former East. “The East has become a sort of retreat for the far right,” Mr. Quent said, “a place where Germany is still Germany and where men are still men.” But the infatuation with the East is also strategic, he said. “There is a sense among far-right extremists: ‘We can’t win in the West, but we can win in the East and then, from a position of strength, we will take on the West.’” Reunification also provided a physical space in which far-right members could move and train. Secret neo-Nazi training camps were held at abandoned Soviet military bases. At one of them, on the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea, Mr. Hasselbach took part in workshops on forging identity papers, bomb making, guerrilla warfare and “silent killing.” The initial years after reunification were so tumultuous that security services were incapable of controlling this coalescing extremist movement. “In the eastern states there was no mature structure for a domestic intelligence service,” Thomas Haldenwang, the president of the domestic intelligence office, said in an interview. “The agencies in the new states had to be built from nothing.” During the early 1990s, a wave of racist violence swept through Germany, much of it in the East. Foreigners were chased, beaten up and sometimes killed. Asylum homes were firebombed. Buses of immigrants were attacked. Sometimes eastern onlookers would watch, clap or join in. “You could see that something was shifting and not just on the fringes,” said Volkhard Knigge, a historian. “Otherwise the AfD would not be so strong today.” In the early 1990s, Mr. Knigge moved east to run the memorial at the former concentration camp in Buchenwald. He was startled by the abundance of Nazi memorabilia like Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” for sale at flea markets and by the mob of angry young neo-Nazis who would gather on the historic theater square, shouting xenophobic slogans. “We thought democracy had won,” Mr. Knigge said. “The West thought this was the end of history. But for nationalists, this was a revision of history.” Reunification brought two strains of nationalism together, said Anetta Kahane, a Jewish anti-racism activist — western-style nationalist conservatism and a more radical eastern social-revolutionary variety. On their own, neither had been powerful enough to stir a political movement. “It was the marriage of the two that made the AfD possible,” said Ms. Kahane, who runs the Amadeu-Antonio Foundation, named after a Black Angolan who was beaten to death with a baseball bat by neo-Nazis less than two months after reunification. For most Germans, the new century was defined by progress. Chancellor Angela Merkel, an easterner, has personified western liberal values. When the country was host to the soccer World Cup in 2006, a confidently multicultural Germany was on display, in what many at the time called “a summer fairy-tale.” “I wanted to believe that that’s who we are as a country — and I did believe it,” said Tanjev Schultz, an author and journalism professor. “But it wasn’t true.” That summer, the National Socialist Underground, a far-right terrorist group that had come out of the extremist networks formed in East Germany, was engaged in an immigrant killing spree that the police would not discover until 2011. From 2000 to 2007, the group killed nine immigrants and a police officer, even as paid informers of the intelligence agency helped hide its leaders and build up its network. Mr. Hasselbach said he was not surprised to see the recent revelations of far-right infiltration of security services. When he was still a neo-Nazi, he said, friendly police officers would warn them before raids or hand them files of leftist enemies. It was the deadly violence in the early 1990s that made Mr. Hasselbach leave the neo-Nazi scene in 1992. An arson attack on the home of a Turkish family killed two girls and their grandmother. He spent years underground to escape threats from his former far-right compatriots. Then, with Mr. Wagner, the former eastern police officer, he co-founded Exit Germany, an organization that helps extremists leave their networks. The fortunes of the AfD have ebbed and flowed in recent years. Polls show that voter support has dipped to around 10 percent during the pandemic. But the fringes are radicalizing, intelligence officers say. It worries Mr. Hasselbach and Mr. Wagner. “The readiness to commit violence today is greater than it’s ever been,” Mr. Hasselbach said. “Westerners have no feel for how fragile things are,” Mr. Wagner said. “The elites don’t see the post-democratic decline. Easterners have seen a system collapse before.”']","Thirty years after Germany came back together, the former East has become the stronghold of a once-marginalized movement that now sits in Parliament."
China’s ‘Golden Week’ Kicks Off in Boost to Battered Tourism Industry,2020-10-01,By Vivian Wang,"['Along the Great Wall, extra security guards have been deployed to deter rowdy tourists. Hotel bookings in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, have risen 600 percent from the same period last year. In Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began late last year, visitor demand for the city’s Yellow Crane Tower has been so high that the landmark sits atop a major travel agency’s list of the “Country’s Hottest Scenic Spots.” China has kicked off Golden Week, the annual spree of shopping and travel built around the Oct. 1 National Day celebrations, and the first major holiday since the country brought its epidemic more or less under control. In any year, the outlay of the weeklong holiday is a closely watched barometer of the country’s economic health. This year it may be especially so, offering the clearest measure yet of China’s recovery from the pandemic as people squeeze into train cars, crowd into ancient temples, and do everything else that people in many other countries can still only dream of. The early signs seem to confirm two trends. First: China has returned to near normalcy with remarkable speed. And second: Even so, the ripple effects of the pandemic are hard to shake off. The week will also reflect how the pandemic has reshaped travel, turning China’s increasingly global tourists back inward. Most years, millions of Chinese go overseas during the holiday, but this year, they have little option but to stay closer to home. China’s official tourism research institute has predicted that 550 million domestic trips will be made during the eight-day holiday, which this year coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival. Though impressive, that is still only about 70 percent of the number in the same period last year, reflecting the sizable number of people being kept home by economic insecurity or lingering fear of infection. Official restrictions, though loosened, also remain. Tickets for Beijing’s Forbidden City are sold out, but capacity is limited to 75 percent. And even as the authorities encouraged people to get on the road, some schools said they would grant only half the week off, or required students to obtain advance permission to leave campus. Still, the tourism industry was bracing for an onslaught. “The energy has been pent-up for too long,” said Lisa Li, a manager at a Shanghai travel agency. “So we can predict that this National Day will not be relaxing at all.” While the rest of the world still struggles to tame the virus, China has not reported any locally transmitted symptomatic cases since Aug. 15. Most foreigners are not allowed to enter the country unless they have valid residence permits, but inside, factories, shopping malls and even luxury auto shows have whirred back to life. Beijing recently stopped requiring people to wear face masks at all times; in Wuhan, a massive elbow-to-elbow pool party grabbed international attention. The recovery has been enabled in part by the same strenuous, top-down tactics that Chinese officials used to control the virus. The authorities were already urging companies to get back to work in February and March, though the virus was still spreading domestically. Factories dutifully fired back up, though few consumers were buying. Gradually, though, people’s confidence revived, and officials turned their attention toward restarting the retail and tourism sectors. Over the summer, several airlines advertised passes that would grant passengers unlimited flights within a fixed time period. Tourist attractions, especially in Wuhan, offered free admission. The central government declared the period from Sept. 9 to Oct. 8 “National Consumer Promotion Month,” with the slogan, “Enjoy consumption for a beautiful life.” As the holiday begins, those efforts seem to be paying off. While many lower-income people, especially migrant workers, are still struggling to find work, the middle-class and affluent Chinese who drive the country’s economy are eager to let loose. Last year, more than seven million people left the country during Golden Week, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. This year, demand for hotels in remote locations like Lhasa has soared, reflecting a desire to still find “faraway places,” according to a report by Ctrip, an online travel agency. Moran Li and her family have not left their home city of Hangzhou, in eastern China, this year. So as Golden Week neared, Ms. Li, who works in the hotel industry, had hoped to finally make an outing. She set her sights on Sanya, a palm-tree-laden city in China’s tropical island province of Hainan. But every hotel she checked was sold out for the holiday as well as the two weekends after. She eventually booked a room for the weekend of Oct. 30. This week, she, her husband and her 22-month-old son plan to visit her husband’s hometown not far from Hangzhou instead. Ms. Li said she did worry about her son catching the coronavirus, but that the situation within China felt manageable. “In the end, we have to take him out eventually,” she said. Others like Liu Zihan, 23, didn’t wait for Golden Week to set out. After graduating from college this year, Ms. Liu spent two months crisscrossing the country, taking advantage of the unlimited flights package. She visited 17 cities, flitting from the industrial metropolis of Shenzhen in the southeast to the walled old town of Dali in the southwest, from humid Hangzhou to the arid Tibetan plateau. She recently finished her trip in Hainan, where she took advantage of duty-free policies to load up on Kiehl’s face masks and Armani lip gloss. For the holiday, though, she planned to visit her boyfriend in the eastern city of Changzhou and stay put for the week. “There are too many people on National Day to go anywhere,” she said. Still, the frenzy to get out belies some less rosy realities. Though the number of domestic flight passengers during Golden Week is expected to increase 10 percent from the same period last year, the average price of tickets on many routes was lower than in previous years, according to Chinese news reports citing Qunar, an online travel company. While five hotels in the semiautonomous Chinese city of Macau were sold out for Golden Week in the beginning of September, a week later only three still were, reflecting a high volume of cancellations, according to a survey by Morgan Stanley analysts. The drop may have reflected overly optimistic projections by tour groups, the analysts said. Ms. Li, the Shanghai travel agency employee, said that even when tour groups do go out, many are made up of older travelers, who tend to spend less money and often qualify for reduced admission prices. Full recovery for the travel industry is still far off, she said. “Every company is desperately trying to think of how to survive, not about how to make money.” Compounding difficulties has been many schools’ reluctance to let their students travel. Nearly 200 million Chinese students have returned to in-person learning. Gon Hong, a Hangzhou resident, had planned to take his 10-year-old son to either Guangzhou or Chengdu for the holiday, especially because he had a coupon for a Chengdu hotel that would have included cheaper room rates and in-room dining. But word soon circulated in a chat group for parents at his son’s school that they would need to seek permission from the school in order to take their children out of the city. Mr. Hong decided to take his son roller-skating closer to home instead. Universities also introduced measures to limit students’ movement, sometimes at the last minute. China West Normal University, in Sichuan Province, announced on Monday that the eight-day holiday would be reduced to five nonconsecutive days for public health reasons. The first of those days, the announcement said, was Sept. 27 — the day before. “I don’t know if I’ve been time traveling or lost my memory — how did I not know on the 27th that I was already on vacation?” one student wrote in response on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform. Still, China’s experience suggests that consumption can bounce back fairly quickly once the virus is under control, said Zhang Tianbing, who leads the Asia-Pacific consumer products and retail team at Deloitte, the global consulting firm. “That probably gives you a bit of hope and optimism for other countries,” he said. For his part, Mr. Zhang, who lives in Shanghai, said he had no plans to travel during the holiday. He had spent much of the year stuck in Britain because of the pandemic and returned to China only recently. He planned to spend the next few days, he said, trying to revive his garden.

Armenia and Azerbaijan: The Conflict Explained,2020-10-03,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — A simmering, decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in late September into the worst fighting the area had seen since a vicious ethnic war in the 1990s. Skirmishes have been common for years along the front lines of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan but is home to ethnic Armenians. This time the conflict is different, analysts and former diplomats say, because Turkey has offered more direct support to Azerbaijan, and because of the scale of the fighting. Both sides have been using drones and powerful, long-range rocket artillery, they say. Turkey’s direct engagement in support of its ethnic Turkic ally, Azerbaijan, in an area of traditional Russian influence, risks turning the local dispute into a regional one. And the attacks have spread far from the front lines. Cities in Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have been hit by long-range weaponry fired by combatants on both sides. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, has been repeatedly bombarded. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of firing powerful rockets at the country’s second largest city, Ganja, and at a hydroelectric station, suggesting an effort to destroy civilian infrastructure. Even the impetus for the latest hostilities, which began on Sept 27, is in dispute. Azerbaijan said Armenia shelled its positions first, while Armenia says an Azerbaijani offensive was unprovoked. On Oct. 17, the two countries announced  a truce, mediated by France, to allow bodies to be collected and prisoners to be exchanged. But as with a Russian-brokered cease-fire a week earlier, the agreement was violated and fighting has continued. Here’s a guide to the conflict and why it has flared again. Nagorno-Karabakh has long been ripe for renewed local conflict. A war that began in the late Soviet period between Armenians and Azerbaijanis set the stage for the fighting today. At that time, the ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan declared independence and was nearly crushed in the ensuing war before its fighters captured areas of Azerbaijan in a series of victories leading up to a cease-fire in 1994. But the tensions go back further, to at least World War I, during the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when Armenians were slaughtered and expelled from Turkey in what many now consider a genocide. That history, Armenians say, justifies their military defense of their ethnic enclave. The 1994 cease-fire, always meant to be temporary, left about 600,000 Azerbaijanis — who had fled Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts captured by the Armenians — stranded away from their homes. It also left Nagorno-Karabakh, closely aligned with Armenia, vulnerable to attack by Azerbaijan, which vowed to recapture the area. Russia and Turkey had coordinated at times in the past to tamp down tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. But the uneasy cooperation between Turkey and Russia, an ally of Armenia, is starting to fade as both countries become increasingly assertive in the Middle East and as the United States steps back. Relations between all three countries have become more complicated. Turkey has alienated the United States by buying antiaircraft missiles from Russia and cutting a natural gas pipeline deal seen as undermining Ukraine. At the same time, it is fighting proxy wars against Moscow in Syria and Libya. After Russian airstrikes in Syria killed Turkish soldiers earlier this year, Turkey soon appeared on other battlefields where Russia was vulnerable. In May, Turkey deployed military advisers, armed drones and Syrian proxy fighters to Libya to shore up the U.N.-backed government and push back a Russian-supported rival faction in that war. In July and August, it sent troops and equipment to Azerbaijan for military exercises. Armenia has said that Turkey is directly involved in the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, and that a Turkish F-16 fighter shot down an Armenian jet. Turkey denied those accusations. After satellite images revealed F-16s parked on the apron of an Azerbaijani airfield, Azerbaijan’s president conceded that Turkish planes were in his country but said they had not flown in combat. Russia and France have both supported Armenia’s claim that Turkey deployed Syrian militants to Nagorno-Karabakh, following its playbook in Libya. Distracted by other issues like the pandemic and a popular uprising in Belarus, another former Soviet state, international mediators missed warning signs and possible openings for diplomacy, analysts say. Travel restrictions related to the coronavirus prevented traditional shuttle diplomacy over the summer, said Olesya Vartanyan, a senior Caucasus analyst at the International Crisis Group. For the antagonists in Nagorno-Karabakh, “this is a perfect time” to start a war, she said. When Armenia killed a general and other officers in Azerbaijan’s Army in a missile strike during a border skirmish in July, Turkey immediately offered to help prepare a response, a retired Turkish general, Ismail Hakki Pekin, has said. Turkish and Azerbaijani joint military exercises ensued, raising tensions. The prospects for a broader peace deal appear dim. A cease-fire brokered in Moscow on Oct. 10  failed to hold, and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has threatened a further escalation of his offensive.  A truce mediated by France a week later also broke down, with each side blaming the other for violations. Neither side appears willing to compromise, with rhetoric having grown harsher in recent months. The recent conflict has killed more than 750 Armenian soldiers and, according to the United Nations, more than 50 civilians; Azerbaijan has not revealed its military casualties. The last major American effort to broker peace in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was 20 years ago when the United States invited the sides to talks in Florida, but the issue dropped off the United States agenda after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Earlier that year, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia had  secretly agreed to swap territory, including some land that Azerbaijan lost in the 1990s war, to settle the conflict. But both backed away from the deal before it could be finalized. The most optimistic outcome in the current fighting, analysts say, would be a return to the same unhappy status quo before the fighting started in September. At least, they say, that would avoid a wider war that might draw in Turkey and Russia.']",Fighting in and around the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh shows signs that a local ethnic dispute could spiral into a regional conflict.
E.U. Brings Suit Against U.K. on Eve of Crucial Trade Talks,2020-10-01,By Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger,"['LONDON — A decision by the European Commission on Thursday to press ahead with legal action against Britain over its plans to override parts of an agreement on withdrawal from the bloc raises the stakes at a critical moment in talks that will determine whether the two sides can avert an economically ruinous rupture.  The commission’s decision was not a surprise. It gave Britain an ultimatum last month, threatening to take it to court unless it dropped its plans to backtrack on a deal Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck last year. But the decision roiled the waters on the eve of a crucial meeting between the two sides scheduled for Friday at which they were supposed to decide whether to intensify negotiations over a trade deal that needs to be largely in place by a mid-October deadline set by Mr. Johnson.  Little European Union business gets done until the last minute, however, and analysts said that timetable was likely to slip. Nonetheless, negotiators are running up against a harder deadline in early November, the minimum time needed for ratification of any agreement by the European and British Parliaments by the end of the year. “This cannot be good news,” said David Henig, director of the U.K. Trade Policy Project at the European Center for International Political Economy, a research institute, who added that the decision over legal action illustrated the tensions between the two sides. “There is an awful lot to be done in two to four weeks to get a trade deal done.”  Britain formally quit the European Union on Jan. 31 but is subject to its economic rules until the end of this year. Even with a trade agreement, some disruption is certain after that date as new checks on freight are implemented at busy cross-Channel ports.  But without a deal the economic damage would be significantly worse, especially for Britain. At the heart of the legal case launched on Thursday are parts of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent the creation of a “hard border” between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. There are currently no border controls between the two, allowing for the free movement of goods and people. Sections of a proposed law being considered by the British Parliament, known as the United Kingdom internal market bill, would override that withdrawal agreement by allowing British ministers to take key decisions on Northern Irish trade unilaterally, rather than through a process involving Brussels. Britain, which has acknowledged that its plans would violate international law, has 30 days to respond, and any legal action could take months to unfold. On Thursday, the British government said it would respond later to the move from Brussels. “We have clearly set out our reasons for introducing the measures,” it said in a statement. The British internal market legislation at issue has been approved by the House of Commons but still needs the consent of the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Britain’s Parliament, and could still be changed. Critically, the dispute has not so far derailed the talks on a trade agreement between Britain and the European Union. If those are successful, they could resolve many of the points at the center of the legal action and pave the way for a compromise. Talks between Michel Barnier, the European Union’s main negotiator, and his British counterpart, David Frost, are scheduled to take place on Friday.  If the two sides decide that sufficient progress has been made they could enter a new, intensive, phase of negotiations that is conducted confidentially. Though Britain’s threat to renege on its international commitments has heightened tensions and diminished trust between the two sides, there is still a stated desire in Brussels and London to reach a trade agreement.     The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, played down the significance of the European Commission’s legal action, hinting that everything remained in play.  “Don’t look for too much behind this,” Mr. Rutte told reporters in Brussels, where a summit meeting of European Union leaders was underway. “It is normal procedure, more administrative than political.”  European officials have repeatedly said that they will not break off negotiations, and that their objective is to defend the integrity of the single market, to ensure a level playing field for trade with Britain and prevent having a physical border on the island of Ireland.  On Thursday the British government said it remained committed to working constructively to reach a trade agreement with the European Union. Britain said that it would be possible for informal talks to continue next week, but that next steps would be outlined on Friday. Though there has been more optimism recently, some analysts believe that Mr. Johnson has yet to focus on the concessions he needs to make to secure a breakthrough. “We can all see what a deal looks like but we can’t be sure how we get there and whether the U.K. is really on for it,” said Mr. Henig. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.']",The move came after Britain refused to withdraw legislation that it admits could break international law by potentially overriding commitments on Northern Ireland.
Fauci pushes back against Trump for misrepresenting his stance on masks.,2020-10-01,By Simon Romero,"['Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the leading U.S. official on infectious diseases, hit back at President Trump on Wednesday for what he called the misrepresentation of his stance on using masks to curb the coronavirus. In the presidential debate on Tuesday, Mr. Trump claimed that Dr. Fauci initially said “masks are not good — then he changed his mind.” And when former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said wearing masks could save tens of thousands of lives, Mr. Trump contended that “Dr. Fauci said the opposite.” Dr. Fauci, whose relationship with his boss has often seemed tenuous at best, took issue with his claims the day after the debate. “Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,” he  said in an interview on ABC News’s “Start Here” podcast. The full interview can be heard Thursday, ABC said. Dr. Fauci explained that “very early on in the pandemic,” the authorities did not recommend masks to the general public because they were worried about shortages and hoarding. But that changed, he said, as it became clear that asymptomatic transmission was spreading the virus and that  masks helped stop it.   “I have been on the airways, on the radio, on TV, begging people to wear masks,” Dr. Fauci said. “And I keep talking in the context of: Wear a mask, keep physical distance, avoid crowds, wash your hands and do things more outdoors versus indoors.” Mr. Trump has often signaled his displeasure with Dr. Fauci, especially as the scientist’s stock has risen with many Americans. He once called him “a major television star” — apparently a compliment — but it was not clear that the president enjoyed sharing the spotlight. In April, under fire for his slow initial response to the pandemic, the president reposted a Twitter message that said “Time to #FireFauci.” And in July, Trump advisers undercut Dr. Fauci by anonymously providing details to various news outlets about statements he had made early in the pandemic that they said were inaccurate. Mr. Trump, watching the economy crumble in a re-election year, has been a cheerleader for state officials to reopen. Dr. Fauci has been rather the opposite. Just this week, he was ringing the alarm on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “We’re not in a good place,” he said when asked about the nation averaging 40,000 new coronavirus cases a day. Dr. Fauci said the increases some states are seeing were especially ill timed, given the approach of flu season. “You don’t want to be in a position like that as the weather starts getting cold,” he said. “So we really need to intensify the public health measures that we talk about all the time.”']",
What happens if Trump becomes too ill to perform his duties?,2020-10-02,By Megan Specia,"['In the wake of President Trump’s testing positive for the coronavirus, the White House did not immediately offer information on what the plan would be if the president became too ill to do his job. But for some people, what happens if he falls seriously ill is top of mind. The White House doctor has maintained that Mr. Trump will continue carrying out his duties “without disruption,” but there are protocols for when a president becomes unfit to perform the role. The government’s continuity plan in case of a national emergency, which largely focuses on wide-scale attacks, outlines such a procedure. The presidential line of succession, laid out in a 1947 law, puts Vice President Mike Pence first in line to replace the president and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, second. A point of contention, however, is that the Constitution does not offer clear guidance on how to determine whether a president is unable to perform the duties of office. The 25th Amendment was intended to deal with any ambiguity about who leads the government when a president cannot. If the president becomes sick and the cabinet determines that he or she is unable to perform the office’s duties, the 25th Amendment grants the administration the power to temporarily transfer authority to the vice president. The president can then, once he deems himself or herself fit, reclaim the power of the presidency.

The battle over restrictions in Madrid moves to the courtroom.,2020-10-01,By Raphael Minder,"['The debate over how and whether to lock down Madrid, the epicenter of Spain’s second wave of the virus, is moving to the courtroom as the region challenges a national decree that would lock down the capital and prevent Madrid-area residents from traveling to other parts of the country. The region has so far opted for a selective lockdown of about one million residents in some of its worst-affected and mostly working-class areas. The decree presented on Wednesday by the central government would extend the lockdown to about 4.8 million residents, preventing them from traveling to any other part of Spain unless for work or other exceptional reasons. “Our region is not in rebellion, we will follow it (the decree) but we will go to court to defend the legitimate interests of Madrilenians,” Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the regional leader of Madrid, said on Thursday, speaking before her regional Parliament. The limited lockdown now in force has prompted demonstrations and put a spotlight on the line between rich and poor. The latest turn in the battle over the lockdown came after a meeting on Wednesday during which a majority of the 17 regions backed the government, but Madrid was among a handful of regions to reject it. The split largely reflected the polarization of Spanish politics. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez leads Spain’s first left-wing coalition government, while Ms. Díaz Ayuso heads a right-wing coalition in Madrid.']",
"Trump says he feels better, but his chief of staff says he is ‘still not on a clear path to a full recovery.’",2020-10-03,By Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker,"['President Trump’s vital signs were “very concerning” over the last day and he is not out of danger, the White House chief of staff said on Saturday, contradicting a rosier picture painted by the president’s doctors on television just minutes before. And in a four-minute video posted to Twitter on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump said he was “starting to feel good,” but added that the severity of his case would probably become apparent over the coming days. The video, meant to reassure the nation, showed him sitting at a conference table at the hospital and wearing a suit jacket but no tie. “You don’t know, over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test,” he said. “So we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days.” Mr. Trump said he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, but said “I feel much better now” and that he expected to return to work shortly. The White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said later Saturday night that the president had made “substantial progress since diagnosis.” Mr. Trump was “fever-free and off supplemental oxygen,” Dr. Conley said after he had declined earlier on Saturday to say whether the president had been on oxygen at any point since being diagnosed with Covid-19. “While not yet out of the woods,” Dr. Conley said, “the team remains cautiously optimistic.” While the president’s doctors had maintained earlier Saturday that Mr. Trump was “doing very well” and in “exceptionally good spirits” after his first night in the hospital with the coronavirus, Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, provided a more sober assessment and warned that the next two days would be pivotal in determining the outcome of the illness. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,” Mr. Meadows told reporters outside Walter Reed, where the president was flown on Friday evening and will remain for at least a few days. “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.” Mr. Meadows’s remarks were attributed to a person familiar with the president’s health in a pool report sent to White House journalists in keeping with ground rules that he set for the interview. But a video posted online captured Mr. Meadows approaching the pool reporters outside Walter Reed following the doctors’ televised briefing and asking to speak off the record, making clear who the unnamed source was. The comments infuriated the president, according to people close to the situation, and he intervened directly to counter the perception that he was sicker than the White House has admitted. Within hours, he posted a message on Twitter saying “I am feeling well!” and called his friend and personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to have him convey a message to the outside world. “I’m going to beat this,” Mr. Trump told him. Mr. Meadows called into Fox News on Saturday night, knowing the president was most likely watching, and praised his “unbelievable courage” and “unbelievable improvement.” But he also confirmed that Mr. Trump’s condition on Friday was worse than originally described. “Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,” Mr. Meadows said. “He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.” The mixed messages only exacerbated the confusion and uncertainties surrounding the president’s situation. During their briefing on Saturday, the doctors refused to provide important details and gave timelines that conflicted with earlier White House accounts and left the impression that the president was sick and began treatment earlier than officially reported. Two people close to the White House said in separate interviews with The New York Times that the president had trouble breathing on Friday and that his oxygen level dropped, prompting his doctors to give him supplemental oxygen while at the White House and transfer him to Walter Reed where he could be monitored with better equipment and treated more rapidly in case of trouble. During the televised briefing, Dr. Conley said the president was not currently receiving supplemental oxygen on Saturday but repeatedly declined to say definitively whether he had ever been on oxygen. “None at this moment and yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” he said, seeming to suggest that there was a period on Friday at the White House when he was. Dr. Conley likewise appeared to indicate that the president was first diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday rather than Thursday night, before Mr. Trump disclosed the test on Twitter early Friday morning. While describing what he said was the president’s progress, he said Mr. Trump was “just 72 hours into the diagnosis now,” which would mean midday on Wednesday. Just two hours later, the White House issued a statement it said was written by Dr. Conley trying to clarify. “This morning while summarizing the president’s health, I incorrectly used the term ‘72 hours’ instead of ‘Day 3,’” it said.  Dr. Conley also said that on Thursday afternoon “we repeated testing and, given clinical indications, had a little bit more concern.” Late that night, he said, “we got the P.C.R. confirmation that he was” positive. Mr. Trump attended campaign events on both Wednesday night and Thursday without wearing a mask and gathering hundreds of supporters who likewise were not taking precautions against the virus. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, another physician treating the president, also said that Mr. Trump had received an experimental antibody therapy “about 48 hours ago,” which would have been midday Thursday — before the confirmation test Dr. Conley said came back positive that evening and a full day before the White House disclosed the treatment on Friday. The confusion came from a briefing where Dr. Conley and his team offered a relentlessly positive assessment of Mr. Trump’s condition. “This morning the president is doing very well,” Dr. Conley said. “At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made.” The doctors said Mr. Trump had been free of fever for 24 hours and had blood pressure and heart rates that were normal for him. Asked why he moved Mr. Trump to the hospital, Dr. Conley said, “Because he’s the president of the United States.” Dr. Sean N. Dooley, another physician on the team, said Mr. Trump was feeling optimistic. “He’s in exceptionally good spirits,” Dr. Dooley said. He added that the president told his doctors, “I feel like I could walk out of here today.” In his rambling video statement, Mr. Trump looked wan and sounded less energetic than usual. At one point, he offered a muddled explanation for his behavior that was not entirely clear whether he was talking about his decision to go to the hospital or to keep campaigning in recent months despite the pandemic. “I had no choice,” he said. “I just didn’t want to stay in the White House.” He added: “I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens. I can’t do that. We have to confront problems.”']",
"World Reacts to Trump’s Diagnosis With Shock, Unease and Some Derision",2020-10-02,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Some pointed to the irony of it. Others offered well wishes. More than a few said it was just deserts. From London to Rome to Nairobi, the revelation on Friday that President Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus was met with a mix of surprise and unease, even as some saw it as a comeuppance. Many pointed out that Mr. Trump had contracted the virus after disregarding health protocols and downplaying the pandemic while it ran rampant in the United States. Others noted his dismissal of scientific advice about the pandemic, which has been core to his messaging around the virus. “I am sorry, but he deserved it,” said Vincenzo Altobelli, 27, an engineer from Milan who was visiting his brother in central Rome. His brother, Cuono Altobelli, a financial analyst who joined him for an after-breakfast walk, agreed. “He kept sending the message that coronavirus was not a serious thing,” he said. “If you sow wind, you can only reap a tempest.” The French newspaper Le Monde published a cartoon depicting President Trump sitting in a corner of a boxing ring, unmasked, with his opponent in the opposite corner — the coronavirus. Outside the ring, his Democratic challenger in the presidential campaign, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was wearing a mask with arms folded. Many Twitter users around the world made a point of mocking President Trump’s suggestion in April that injecting or ingesting a disinfectant might aid in combating the virus. Others were more sympathetic to the president’s plight. In Berlin, Frank Wortmann, 49, said he was surprised about the result and wished the president well. “It goes to show you it can get anyone, from the president of the United States on down,” he said. In Kenya as in much of the world, the hashtag #TrumpHasCovid was the top trending topic on Twitter. Patrick Gathara, 48, a Kenyan political commentator, said that while there was an immediate reaction from many that the president was somehow deserving of the virus, he wanted to focus on a more humane response. “Trump will get a bit of lashing and some people might even celebrate,” he said. “I don’t think it should be celebrated, but he would be deserving if people came out and reminded him that he brought this unto himself, that he ignored science and scientists.” He said he hoped the president and his advisers would learn from the ordeal. “Does this mean the U.S. changes how it handles the virus?” he asked. “What do they do to learn from this? Or does it become another thing that happened, and they don’t learn much from it?” Danielle Van Elewyck, a 62-year-old pharmacist in Brussels, said it was hard for her as a European to understand Trump’s mentality, especially taking into account the lack of universal health care in the United States. “I don’t think it is normal. But this is why the situations in Europe and the United States are incomparable,” she said. “Maybe people there have a different approach to those things.” Some worried that the president’s infection might sow fear in the American public and upend the campaign ahead of an already fraught presidential election campaign. “That’s not what we needed right now,” said Giulio Livoni, a 53 year-old-lawyer in central Rome. “He has a campaign to do, and we really need the United States to be in good shape at the moment.” In Brussels, Marie-Pierre Chapuis, a 45-year-old researcher for a company that produced face masks, also said she felt it could be a learning experience for Mr. Trump. “If he has light symptoms, he will probably continue saying that this virus is nothing. If he gets seriously ill — which of course I don’t wish for anyone — maybe he will change his views and realize Covid-19 is not a joke,” said Ms. Chapuis as she was strolling down a street in the Belgian capital. In Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized in April after contracting the virus, many were unsurprised. “Like Boris, Trump has been shaking hands and dismissing masks,” said Annie Fen, a 40-year-old hairdresser in north London. “So of course, I’m not surprised.” Yet Ms. Fen said she doubted Mr. Trump’s infection would make him change his response to the coronavirus, “because his pride is just too big for that,” she said. “Good luck to him, still,” she added.

Companies ditch plans for rapid spit tests at home.,2020-10-01,By Katherine J. Wu,"['The technology for rapid saliva-based coronavirus tests that could be used at home is not panning out the way some have hoped. E25Bio and OraSure, two companies trying to develop rapid at-home coronavirus tests, have abandoned efforts to use saliva samples with their products. Instead, their tests, which detect pieces of coronavirus proteins called antigens, will rely for now on shallow nose swabs. Public health experts are eagerly watching the companies trying to develop the technology, which they hope will greatly expand the number of people who are tested. Some experts have even said that the rapid antigen tests, which are aimed at delivering a result in a matter of minutes, could perform as well as a vaccine in curbing the spread of the coronavirus and paving a path back to normalcy. “If I was placing a bet — which I am, because I’m leading an antigen-based testing company — I would say it’s going to be very difficult for antigen-based testing to work on saliva samples,” said Bobby Brooke Herrera, chief executive of E25Bio and one of its founders. He said the notion that the virus sets up shop in the mouth and produces enough antigen there to be detected by today’s technology “is far-fetched.” As they continued to tinker with their tests, researchers at both E25Bio and OraSure found saliva’s performance to be more lackluster than anticipated, and were forced to pivot. One problem is that spit differs vastly from one person to another, and can even change over the course of a single day. Both E25Bio and OraSure now plan to seek authorization from the F.D.A. to sell at-home antigen tests using nose swabs, a technique similar to the one used by the much-talked-about Abbott antigen test that takes about 15 minutes.']",
"Turkey Jumps Into Another Foreign Conflict, This Time in the Caucasus",2020-10-01,By Carlotta Gall,"['ANKARA — When a long-simmering conflict in the south Caucasus burst into open warfare this week, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was the first world leader to jump into the fray. His mission was not to calm tensions between the warring parties, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Instead, he declared all-out support for the Azerbaijanis, close Turkic allies, and accused Armenia of ignoring efforts to negotiate a resolution. He also demanded that Armenia withdraw from lands it occupied 30 years ago. “I condemn Armenia once again for attacking Azerbaijani lands,” he said. “Turkey continues to stand with the friendly and brotherly Azerbaijan with all its facilities and heart.” Dozens have been killed in four days of fighting since Azerbaijan and Armenia began missile strikes against each other’s positions along a front line that has been frozen since a territorial war between the former Soviet republics in the 1990s. On Thursday, the American, Russian and French presidents together called on both sides to cease hostilities. Turkey supplies weapons and training to Azerbaijan, and there are signs that it is actively engaged in the fighting, which Ankara has denied. If Turkish involvement is confirmed, even in a supporting role, it would be just one of several fronts where Mr. Erdogan has deployed troops, ships and aircraft with increasing readiness this year. Turkey is engaged in the wars in Syria and Libya, it has mounted repeated military operations against Kurdish forces in Iraq, and it is pressing territorial claims in disputes with Greece and Cyprus. This more aggressive foreign policy has alarmed Turkey’s NATO allies but has won Mr. Erdogan a certain respect at home, at a time when the country is suffering economically and his party’s popularity is flagging. And as in Syria and Libya, Mr. Erdogan finds himself on the opposite side of the Caucasus conflict from Russia in an increasingly complicated geopolitical rivalry. Analysts see both the conflicts in Libya and the Caucasus as extensions of the struggle between Turkey and Russia in Syria. Mr. Erdogan’s growing assertiveness has come partly in response to changing global dynamics, particularly the shrinking American role in the region, deep divisions within the European Union and the devastating civil war in Syria, just across Turkey’s southern border. He has at his disposal a powerful military that Turkey has been upgrading for decades. The increasing militarism abroad mirrors Mr. Erdogan’s combative personality, his taste for gunboat diplomacy and the belief that flexing his military gives him a place at the table with the big powers. “Turkey’s approach to the Caucasus is deceptively simple, and in line with its logic in other theaters of conflict/dispute,” tweeted Selim Koru, an analyst at TEPAV, a nonprofit think tank in Ankara. “Turkey-Azerbaijan are stronger than they were in the 1990s vis-à-vis Armenia. They feel that the territorial distribution needs to reflect that reality.” Both Turkey and Azerbaijan are richer and militarily better equipped than they were in 1994, when Azerbaijan ceded control of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia after years of fighting. At that time, Russia warned Turkey not to come to Azerbaijan’s aid. “There is a broad consensus that the region is in flux in terms of regional power,” said Ryan Gingeras, professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California. “So Turkey has had the opportunity to play a much more expansive role.” Turkey has been careful to avoid direct conflict with Russia when they are on opposing sides, and to fight opponents who are weaker militarily — Kurdish guerrilla fighters in Iraq, Libyan militias and the Syrian army. Its successes have only emboldened it, Mr. Gingeras said. “They have not only achieved their goals but done so in rather, from the inside out, spectacular fashion,” he said. “And that has really been a gratifying realization, so that Turkey will continue to grow hungry as it eats, knowing that it will continue and will be able to perhaps affect other regional parties by using or threatening to use military force,” he said. “It is definitely a harbinger of what is to come,” he added. At the beginning of the year, virtually single-handedly, Turkey took a stand in northwestern Syria, managing to stall a blistering air and ground offensive by Russian and Syrian forces and to hold on to a portion of the last opposition-held Syrian province, Idlib. In May, Turkey deployed military advisers, weaponized drones and Syrian proxy fighters to Libya to shore up the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and push back Russian contractors who were supporting an assault on the capital. Turkey’s success in reversing the momentum of the war stunned many, although Russia forced it to halt its push toward Libya’s lucrative oil fields. With its presence in Libya established — and plans afoot to build bases and train the Libyan army — the Turkish navy projected an increasingly assertive presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkish naval vessels accompanying a supply ship to Libya prevented a French attempt to search the vessel, which led to a NATO investigation. An entire fleet escorted Turkish drill ships exploring for gas in waters off Cyprus, defying the European Union. When Armenia killed a general and other officers of Azerbaijan’s army in a missile strike in July on the decades-old cease-fire line between the two countries, Turkey immediately offered help in preparing a response, according to a retired Turkish general, Ismail Hakki Pekin. “Azerbaijan for a very long time used to have an issue of lack of self-confidence,” he told the Turkish daily Yeni Safak. “The response to those attacks is very important in that sense. The drones, armed and unarmed, that have been provided by Turkey, have been very effective in those operations.” After the attack in July, Azerbaijan and Turkey undertook joint exercises and made defense plans, he said. Mr. Erdogan’s opponents at home criticize his methods but generally support his stance. Many Turks saw the intervention in Libya and the demand for greater maritime rights in the eastern Mediterranean as in Turkey’s interests, and the country overwhelmingly sides with Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia. And the belligerence does not all come from Mr. Erdogan. The military, though diminished politically, remains a powerful institution in Turkey, with capabilities honed as part of NATO. There has been a move since the 1990s, before Mr. Erdogan’s tenure, to build a domestic defense industry, which now produces armed drones — made by a company owned by Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law, Selcuk Bayraktar — warships and attack helicopters. Turkey has built up its navy, long a lesser part in the armed forces, to the point that it will far outstrip Greece as a naval power in coming years. Within the next five or 10 years, Turkey will have one or two light aircraft carriers and a number of frigates, including guided missile ships, that would be entirely produced at home, Mr. Gingeras said. “This would make it a navy that, in local terms, was really the power of the eastern Mediterranean, at least among local states.” Armenia claims a Turkish F-16 shot down an Armenian fighter jet, though officials from Azerbaijan and Turkey have denied that. And President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Wednesday that there was evidence that a proxy force of Syrian fighters had been deployed from southern Turkey to Azerbaijan. A Syrian fighter confirmed the presence of those forces, which Azerbaijan and Turkey have denied. Despite Turkey’s refusal to confirm the use of Turkish armed drones in the Caucasus, Mr. Bayraktar posted Azerbaijan’s defense ministry footage of drone strikes on Twitter on the first day of the conflict. There is concern among many Turks that Mr. Erdogan, who has alienated European and Western allies with his growing authoritarianism, has no exit plan for his interventions. Ahmet Davutoglu, who served as prime minister under Mr. Erdogan, warned Tuesday that Mr. Erdogan’s talent for making enemies and dispensing with formal diplomatic channels was dangerous, especially when it concerns Armenia and Azerbaijan. “Taking military steps will cause greater problems in the Caucasus,” he said. “It is clear there is no proper coordination with Russia,” he added. But Mr. Erdogan is as much a chess player as Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, intent on preventing on outright Russian victory and further humanitarian disaster in Syria, said Asli Aydintasbas, a Turkish analyst with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “They always push each other to the brink,” Ms. Aydintasbas said. Andrew Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.']","President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already intervened militarily in Syria, Libya and Iraq this year.

"‘I feel like crying’: In Rio, the pandemic has stopped an unstoppable parade.",2020-10-01,"By Manuela Andreoni, Ernesto Londoño, Mike Ives and Anna Schaverien","['Wars, disease and political turmoil have never prevented Rio de Janeiro from putting on its famous carnival. Now, the pandemic has forced a suspension of the annual parade for the first time since 1932.  “I want this moment to come, this moment when we will celebrate life that defeats death, when we will reunite, gather,” said Leandro Vieira, the artistic director of Estação Primeira de Mangueira, one of Rio’s most traditional samba groups. “But this moment is not possible yet.” Faced with a pandemic that has killed nearly 144,000 people — Brazil’s toll is second only to the United States — a deep economic crisis, and a president whose inner circle is engulfed in a growing number of criminal and legislative investigations, Rio residents are being robbed of the moment of catharsis that many look forward to year-round. Few places have been hit as hard as Rio de Janeiro, a state of 16 million people where the virus has killed more than 18,000. The decision to suspend the parade will deprive the city of an important source of revenue and its citizens of performances that often deliver skewering political commentary. But the heads of the city’s leading samba organizations found that without a vaccine, conditions would not be safe. With the official parade postponed indefinitely, it is unclear if — and how — Rio residents will celebrate come February, when the festivities are scheduled. “I feel like crying, seeing they haven’t started the work of building the floats,” said Nicilda da Silva, 80, who was elected queen of the Porto da Pedra samba group this year and helps plan their parade. “But our hands are tied.” In other developments around the world: More than one in 200 people in England, about 0.55 percent of the country’s population, have the coronavirus, according to the latest update from the country’s largest study of Covid-19. “The prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date,” said Professor Paul Elliott, one of the study’s authors. People between 18 and 24 have the highest rate of infection, the study found, although cases are also increasing among people over 65. Based on the results of tens of thousands of random tests, the researchers said the growth of new cases had slowed, in part because of a variety of government restrictions. Britain recorded at least 7,100 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, according to a New York Times database. Singapore’s civil aviation authority said the city-state would no longer require visitors from Vietnam or most of Australia to self isolate, starting on Oct. 8, as long as they pass a Covid-19 test on arrival and have not traveled to other countries in the two weeks leading up to the flight. The new rules do not include the Australian state of Victoria, which reported 15 new cases on Thursday. Self-isolation requirements were lifted for travelers from Brunei and New Zealand on Sept. 1. South Africa will begin allowing some international tourists to enter the country on Thursday, for the first time since a national lockdown took effect in March. In a blow to hopes of reviving the country’s tourism sector, at least a dozen high-risk European countries, the United States and most of Latin America will remain on a no-fly list.']",
,2020-10-02,,"['With New York City watching to see if a recent uptick in coronavirus cases could trigger another wave of shutdowns and closings, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the city’s seven-day average for positive test results had risen to 1.53 percent. On Tuesday, when Mr. de Blasio first announced the uptick, which he attributed in part to a rise in cases in neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, the positivity rate was 1.38 percent. The increase has come as New York City finished reopening all its public schools on Thursday and as restaurants were permitted to resume indoor dining for the first time in months. Mr. de Blasio has said that if the seven-day average rose to 3 percent, the entire school system would again close. The city’s health department wrote in an email that officials were focused on 12 neighborhoods where “cases continue to grow at an alarming rate.” The seven-day average positivity rate in those neighborhoods is 5.86 percent, compared with 1.17 percent for the rest of the city. The email described seven more neighborhoods as areas of concern, because of their proximity to the other clusters and elevated rate of case growth. The health department has issued an order that allows city agencies to shut down businesses if they repeatedly violate social distancing requirements, including limits on maximum occupancy and mandates that workers and patrons all wear face coverings. In a call with reporters on Friday morning, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that 648 people were hospitalized with the disease, a level not seen since late July. Excluding hot spots, the state’s positivity rate was just over 1 percent, he said. Mr. Cuomo said he was pushing local governments in hot spots to enforce measures to reduce transmission of the virus, or face fines of up to $10,000 per day. “Enforce the laws because the numbers are still going up, it’s that simple,” Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Cuomo also wished President Trump well after the president announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Cuomo said that the president’s case “is a microcosm of Covid.

The U.S. and Europe lag on implementing an essential weapon against the virus: contact tracing.,2020-10-03,By Benjamin Mueller,"['Experts have warned that fall will be a uniquely challenging time for combating the pandemic, yet one of the most essential tools for stemming the spread of the coronavirus still has not been widely deployed in the United States and Europe. While Western nations vowed repeatedly to develop “world-beating” contact tracing and testing operations at the onset of the pandemic, counting and monitoring people who have been exposed to the virus, and who may expose others, has rarely been effectively implemented. Beholden to privacy rules, Western officials largely trusted people to hand over names to contact tracers. But that trust was not repaid, in large part because governments neglected services that were crucial to winning people’s cooperation: a fast and accurate testing system, and guarantees that people would be housed, fed and paid while they isolated. Elected officials presented the system as a critical bridge between lockdown and a vaccine, allowing them to contain small outbreaks without shutting down large parts of society. But construction of that bridge has been rocky at best. “Public health leaders fell in love with the idea of contact tracing as an important tactic — and it is — but that’d be like if you’re going into war and were just talking about the tanks,” said Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a public health charity in Maryland. The West’s public health systems have not matched the success in parts of East Asia where the fear of epidemics became more ingrained after SARS appeared in 2002 and MERS was identified in 2012. In England, people are neither handing over many contacts — about five, on average — nor following the rules. “It suggests there is some degree of skepticism in the population to engagement,” said Professor Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, an adviser to the British government’s tracing program, referring to the proportion of known cases — a fifth — who handed over no other names.

Tight New Restrictions in Parts of Quebec as Cases Rise Again,2020-10-02,By Ian Austen,"['The arrival of autumn has brought along the predicted rebound of coronavirus infections, at least in Quebec and Ontario. On Friday, Ontario set a record for the number of new cases in one day and Quebec reported 1,000 new cases for the first time during the second wave. My colleague Dan Bilefsky and I wrote this week about the unwelcome resurgence and the return of tight restrictions in many parts of Quebec. [Read: As Cases Surge, Pandemic Restrictions Again Descend on Quebec] Since our article appeared, François Legault, the premier of Quebec, announced that the police now have the power to issue fines of 1,000 Canadian dollars to people violating measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus in the areas of the province that have been declared red zones. Officers can also call in a request for a warrant to enter the homes of people who have ignored restrictions by having visitors, and those breaking the rules can be fined. And in Ontario, the province said on Friday that social bubbles had been put on hold and that people were asked to limit close contact to members of their households. How the pandemic affects civil liberties also arose this week. Two groups, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation, separately reported that the police had misused access to a database of Ontario residents who had tested positive for the coronavirus, making 95,000 searches many of which were not related to any obvious active calls. A court cut off the access of the police to that information in July. Since March, Canadians have generally accepted a host of rules,  even though there have been sporadic protests against them. The Supreme Court in Newfoundland has ruled on that province’s closing of its borders with the rest of Canada. It agreed with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association that the measures violate the section of the charter that allows Canadians to travel freely across the country. But the court also found that the violation was reasonable and justified because of the public health benefits it brings. Similarly, contact tracing raises privacy issues. The Royal Society of Canada, the country’s national academy which honors academic achievement and promotes research, recently published a paper that studied the potential conflicts between civil liberties and controlling the pandemic. It’s part of a series of Covid-19 related research papers by some of Canada’s top scholars. Although it’s written in academic language, it’s still worth a read. Its takeaway is this: Individual rights don’t trump public health, but governments must present a good reason and evidence for their restrictions and narrowly tailor them. The paper says that the charter’s “guarantee of life, liberty and security of the person does not protect against what might be called ‘trivial’ intrusions on liberty.” Given that, the paper notes, “it is not clear that laws requiring masking engage Charter rights at all.” At the same time, the paper argues, the enforcement of mandatory mask laws could become a threat to civil liberties if the police used them as “pretext for harassment of marginalized populations and needless escalations of force.” In the early summer, the border closings brought stigma to a doctor in New Brunswick who had traveled to Montreal to pick up his 4-year-old daughter there. He was also charged with breaking emergency measures laws in August. He believes racism played a role in his public denunciation and shaming. If more limits appear as the second wave grows, the public’s acceptance of intrusions into civil rights may be tested. John Turner, whose time as prime minister was brief but whose political legacy was long and distinguished, has died at the age of 91. The police have charged a Burlington, Ontario, man with faking terrorist activity. The New York Times has opened a “fresh examination” into how its “Caliphate” podcast portrayed him.

Layoffs grow as companies gauge the course of the pandemic — and prospects for federal aid.,2020-10-01,By Nelson D. Schwartz and Gillian Friedman,"['American employers continue to cut jobs, signaling new anxiety about the course of the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainty about further legislative relief. Furloughs of more than 30,000 workers by United Airlines and American Airlines began Thursday after Congress was unable to come up with a fresh aid package for the industry. The Walt Disney Company, whose theme parks in Florida and California have been hard hit by a shortage of visitors, said Tuesday that it would lay off 28,000 workers. Allstate announced Wednesday that it would lay off approximately 3,800 employees, primarily in claims, sales, service and support functions, as part of a plan to reduce costs. The cuts constitute about 8 percent of the roughly 46,000 employees Allstate had at the end of 2019. Many economists say another effort like the CARES Act, passed in March, could ease the employment outlook, but an agreement has been elusive for months. Last-ditch negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats were continuing Thursday. “It’s unclear how many companies can sustain themselves and retain payrolls that support incomes,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. “A solid rebound in job growth is now looking more muted.” The Labor Department reported Thursday that 787,000 Americans filed for state unemployment benefits for the first time last week. It was a decline from the previous week’s total of 827,000, but the figures — unadjusted for seasonal variations — are roughly four times the weekly tally of claims from before the pandemic. “Clearly there has been a moderation in the rate of improvement from the early stages,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “As we get further away from the initial shock, we have less of a natural catch-up, and we face more residual damage.” With seasonal adjustments, last week’s figure was 837,000. Applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program aimed at independent contractors, gig workers and part-time employees, totaled 650,000. With the end of a $600 federal weekly supplement to unemployment benefits in July, consumers have less to spend at businesses struggling to stay open, like restaurants, bars and retail stores. The Commerce Department said Thursday that personal income declined 2.7 percent in August, reflecting the cessation of the $600 payments. ']",
"On China’s National Day, Hong Kong Police Quash Protests",2020-10-01,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — One year ago, China’s National Day on Oct. 1 was a day of protest and turmoil in Hong Kong. Demonstrators set fires and blockaded streets. The police responded with tear gas and pepper spray. One officer shot a young demonstrator with a live bullet. The holiday on Thursday once again brought protesters to the streets of Hong Kong. This time, however, their numbers were far smaller, and they were smothered by thousands of police officers.  The police corralled and searched dozens of people at a time, effectively quashing all but the briefest expressions of dissent. Officers even stood guard near Lion Rock, a rugged granite outcrop where protesters have often draped large pro-democracy banners, and took down identification numbers of activists who had hiked up to the peak and shouted slogans. The stark contrast from one year to the next shows how the Hong Kong authorities have used social distancing rules, an overwhelming police presence and a sweeping national security law imposed on the city by Beijing at the end of June to silence pro-democracy rallies. Public discontent remains high in Hong Kong, but displaying it is increasingly risky. The police had banned protests on Thursday, citing coronavirus concerns, so activists looked for creative ways to skirt the restrictions. Some demonstrations looked more like performance art than the seas of people with thunderous chants that were hallmarks of last year’s protests. Several demonstrators stood in the streets of Causeway Bay, a shopping district, holding up copies of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper, as though they were reading them. The papers showed full-page ads with slogans like “Protect the children, hold on to your conscience.” A teenage boy played popular protest tunes on a recorder at a crowded intersection as some demonstrators sang along. The police targeted many young people, including some who wore black, a color associated with the protest movement, herding them behind a security cordon near luxury stores. A number of older residents and people clutching grocery bags were also rounded up. Officers unfurled blue banners that warned against unauthorized gatherings. They hoisted purple banners when some people chanted protest slogans that the authorities have said could potentially violate the new security law. By midafternoon, the police had blocked off large parts of Causeway Bay and prevented pedestrians from lingering. They arrested at least 74 people, including four district council members, on suspicion of taking part in an unauthorized assembly. The police said they had seized a sharp knife as well as rods, masks and protest stickers. Officers were also investigating reports that Molotov cocktails had been thrown onto a major road in the Kowloon district. Before the holiday, Luo Huining, the director of China’s powerful representative office in Hong Kong, said it was important for the semiautonomous region’s young people and civil servants to feel more patriotic. He called for more education on topics like national security, Chinese history and culture. “As a Chinese person, loving the country is not a choice, but a duty and the right course,” he said in a speech on Wednesday.  Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said during a National Day gathering on Thursday that the relative calm showed the value of the national security legislation. “Over the past three months, the plain truth is, and it is obvious to see, that stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded,” she said. Mrs. Lam also asserted, again, that the city’s residents continued to enjoy basic rights and freedoms. Activists and academics have challenged the government’s stance, noting that the security law — with vaguely defined political crimes like subversion — was being used to target speech that had long been protected. Some protesters had planned to rally in support of 12 people from Hong Kong who were being held in the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen on accusations of illegal boundary crossing. The group, which included people who had been charged in Hong Kong for acts committed during last year’s protests, had sought to escape to Taiwan by boat in August when they were caught by the Chinese Coast Guard. On Wednesday, prosecutors in Shenzhen authorized the continued detention of the 12 Hong Kong residents. Two of them were charged with organizing an illegal boundary crossing, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, while the remaining 10 were charged with crossing a boundary illegally, which carries up to a year in prison. That means they are likely to face trial in mainland China. The police warned protesters against violating a ban on groups of more than four people, but did not interfere when a group of a few dozen government supporters gathered in the Wan Chai district to sing the Chinese national anthem and wave national flags.']","One year ago, an important political anniversary in China was met with chaotic demonstrations in Hong Kong.

"Despite Crises, India Fixes Its Gaze on a Bollywood Tragedy",2020-10-03,By Shalini Venugopal Bhagat,"['NEW DELHI — A rising young movie star meets a tragic end. His family blames his death on his glamorous girlfriend. As she sits in jail, her friends proclaiming her innocence, the police hint at a shadowy network of money laundering and illegal drugs deep within the world of show business. India has been captivated by the story of Sushant Singh Rajput, a 34-year-old actor whose death has been ruled a suicide by the police in Mumbai. News outlets have focused on every twist in a tale that for many encapsulates Bollywood’s hypocrisy and elitism. Three federal agencies are investigating whether his girlfriend, the actress Rhea Chakraborty, gave him marijuana and was involved in Bollywood drug dealing and money laundering. The police are interviewing other Bollywood actresses. Ms. Chakraborty’s attorney said the police had found no evidence to support their allegations. The scandal has puzzled and infuriated social critics. With hard proof lacking, they say, the investigation and coverage appear to be fueled by institutional misogyny, a taboo against discussion of mental health issues and an increasingly partisan news media. In fact, many of the media outlets sympathetic to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have focused on the story at the expense of bigger problems. India may soon surpass the United States as the world leader in Covid-19 infections. Its economy is in a tailspin. An increasingly bellicose China is testing its borders. The investigation has become an election issue in Mr. Rajput’s home state of Bihar, which is controlled by an ally of Mr. Modi. The state’s chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has criticized the police in Mumbai, which is controlled by a rival coalition, and he has promised Bihar voters, who go to the polls in the coming weeks, that he would uncover the truth behind Mr. Rajput’s death. Still, even many outlets critical of Mr. Modi could not resist the story. “I think it suits the government to use news television as a weapon of mass distraction,” said Vir Sanghvi, a journalist, talk-show host and media critic. Nevertheless, he added, high ratings “show that there is a great hunger for this kind of news among viewers.” India is hardly alone in turning to celebrity news to distract from real-world problems. For many Indians, Mr. Rajput’s story also taps into a rising sense of anti-elitism. Many believe he was driven to suicide by a clubby culture of Bollywood insiders. Bihar is one of India’s poorer states, and they see Mr. Rajput as a rare outsider who broke into the industry but was held back from even greater stardom. “The condition of the economy due to the coronavirus or other issues is in front of all of us,” said Jaya Mukherjee, a 28-year-old school counselor in Delhi who has followed the developments. “We are tense, but we can’t avoid injustice, which happened to Sushant.” Others believe Mr. Rajput did not commit suicide. Some people, including his family, believe he was killed. On Saturday, a government medical board ruled his death was by suicide. Ms. Chakraborty’s allies and experts on Indian society say the explanation for Mr. Rajput’s death is simpler than many people believe, but more difficult for them to talk about. Susan Walker, a psychologist in Mumbai and Mr. Rajput’s therapist, has said that he suffered from bipolar disorder and disputed that Ms. Chakraborty had anything to do with his death. “In India, depression is a serious illness that has spread like an epidemic, but there is very little discussion about his illness,” said Ashis Nandy, a psychologist and social critic, referring to Mr. Rajput. “It has been artificially blown up to turn it into a political circus.” Ms. Walker could not be reached for comment. Mr. Rajput’s family has complained to Indian medical officials that she violated patient confidentiality. Mr. Rajput’s family declined to be interviewed. Vikas Singh, their lawyer, said they believed that he had been killed and that the police in Mumbai bungled the initial investigation. He also said they believed that Mr. Rajput had not suffered from mental health issues until he met Ms. Chakraborty. Mr. Rajput, a versatile actor with an easy smile and chiseled chin, appeared in soap operas before winning a role in the 2013 dramatic film “Kai Po Che!” His performance as a gifted but troubled cricketer earned him a nomination for the Filmfare award, Bollywood’s most prestigious prize, for best male actor debut. He then went on to star in films like “Shuddh Desi Romance,” “MS Dhoni” and “Kedarnath,” several of which were commercial and critical successes. He cultivated an image as a wholesome boy-next-door from Bihar. Mr. Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14. The Mumbai police listed the cause of death as asphyxia by hanging. Online, disbelieving fans blamed Bollywood studios. Kangana Ranaut, a popular actress, helped put the industry under a spotlight with a video released the day after Mr. Rajput’s death that disputed the idea that he had been depressed, even as it accused studio bigwigs of driving him to suicide. Ms. Ranaut is a high-profile supporter of Mr. Modi, and her criticism helped galvanize his supporters to press for answers. Mr. Rajput’s death also sent ripples through the news media. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which Mr. Modi leads, has sought to influence and cajole India’s traditionally cacophonous newspapers and broadcasters. Though the government has sometimes shut down outlets critical of its policies, it also uses more subtle ways to direct coverage, like granting or withdrawing government advertising money. Stories about Mr. Rajput nosed out headlines about spreading infections or shuttered shops and factories. The result was ratings gold: Republic Bharat, a new broadcast outlet often sympathetic to Mr. Modi’s party, surged to the top of the Hindi-language news ratings in August. Its editors did not respond to requests for comment. Attention turned to Ms. Chakraborty, who had been dating the actor for more than a year. Mr. Rajput’s father, K.K. Singh, filed a police complaint against Ms. Chakraborty, her parents and her brother alleging abetment to suicide, theft, cheating and wrongful confinement. In India, driving someone to suicide carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.  Ms. Chakraborty became the target of vicious attacks online, including rape and death threats, as well as on TV channels. The coverage prompted the Press Council of India, a self-regulating press watchdog, to warn the media not to “conduct its own parallel trial.” “She was unable to work, to socialize, because she felt that she needed to be with him and look after him,” said one friend, Shibani Dandekar, a singer and actress. “The vicious media trial hasn’t even given her a chance to grieve for him.” Ms. Chakraborty was arrested last month on suspicion of buying and supplying marijuana to Mr. Rajput as well as financing illicit traffic, a nonbailable offense. Satish Maneshinde, Ms. Chakraborty’s lawyer, said that no drugs had been found in her possession and that the police lacked evidence. The police have 180 days to file charges. Some lawyers and women’s groups have come to Ms. Chakraborty’s defense, saying that female defendants often face hostile reactions when their cases become media sensations. “The subtext is always deeply, deeply misogynistic,” said Rebecca John, a lawyer who successfully defended parents accused of murdering their child in an earlier case. “It’s been getting much worse in the past 10 to 12 years, and that’s very disturbing.” And in this case, the coverage has overshadowed issues of national importance. On Aug. 31, the government released data showing the economy had shrunk by nearly a quarter. A talk show broadcast by Republic TV, a Republic Bharat sister station, led with the death of a former president and the disclosure of the contents of Mr. Rajput’s WhatsApp chats, which it labeled “today’s biggest story.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the United States at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

"Leaders Who Caught Virus: Boris Johnson, Jair Bolsonaro and Now Trump",2020-10-02,By Kaly Soto and Elian Peltier,"['As the coronavirus has spread around the globe, world leaders have not been spared. With his positive coronavirus test, President Trump joins the ranks of others like Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil who have been infected. Also having tested positive are the presidents of Bolivia, Guatemala and Honduras and the prime ministers of Armenia and Russia. Some leaders have been gravely ill — including Mr. Johnson, who was hospitalized for a week with the illness, which has killed at least a million people worldwide and infected more than 34 million. Others like Mr. Bolsonaro appeared to have had only mild cases. In Nigeria, a top aide to President Muhammadu Buhari died of the coronavirus in April. Here is a rundown of world leaders who have fallen ill and how they handled it. Britain Mr. Johnson, 56, who in the early part of the pandemic resisted a lockdown and social-distancing measures, contracted the virus in March. He was later hospitalized, spending three nights in an intensive care unit, and deputized the country’s foreign secretary to carry out his duties.  After being released from the hospital in April, he thanked Britain’s National Health Service, saying that it had “saved my life, no question.” Returning to office in late April, he adopted a more somber and cautious tone, a stark contrast to his initial insistence that Britain would contain the coronavirus without lockdown measures. He eventually brought in such restrictions for nearly two months and warned about the risks of resuming regular public life too quickly.  His government’s approach since then has been mixed. During the summer, Mr. Johnson encouraged people to return to working in offices to help restart the economy, and offered patrons a government-subsidized discount to eat at restaurants and pubs.  With a second wave of the virus now bringing thousands of new cases every day, Mr. Johnson’s government again introduced tighter restrictions in England last month, including limits on the size of social gatherings across the country and local shutdowns in places with larger outbreaks. The government is also encouraging people to work from home if they are able to.  To date, Britain has been the worst-hit country in Europe, with more than 56,000 reported deaths. Brazil Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro was cavalier about the coronavirus, calling it a “measly cold.” Even as Brazil became one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, he attended political rallies, shook hands with supporters and went around without a face mask. The approach caused both uncertainty and political upheaval, with Mr. Bolsonaro firing one health minister in the spring, only to have the minister’s successor resign one month later over the president’s chaotic response to the pandemic. To date, more than 144,000 people in the country have died from the virus. Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, tested positive in July. Although he said he experienced aches and a fever, his case appears to have been mild. Experts said his quick recovery reinforced the stance of some supporters — and Mr. Bolsonaro —\xa0that the threat of the virus could be dismissed.  After later testing negative, he posted a tweet including a picture in which he appears to be smiling and giving a thumbs up while brandishing a box of hydroxychloroquine pills, the anti-malaria medicine promoted by Mr. Trump as a remedy for the virus, despite a growing scientific consensus that the drug is not effective in treating Covid-19. “His illness was not even able to teach him how to fight the disease,” Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the health minister who was fired by Mr. Bolsonaro in April after defending social distancing rules, told the Financial Times last month. “He remained in denial.” Honduras Mr. Hernández, 51, tested positive in June along with his wife and two aides, and was treated for pneumonia. He initially vowed to keep working as he displayed mild symptoms, but his health quickly worsened. For days, he remained in a “delicate” situation, doctors said, as he was hospitalized and needed oxygen. Bolivia Ms. Añez, 53, who took office as Bolivia’s caretaker leader in January after the ouster of President Evo Morales, tested positive for the coronavirus in July. She remained in self-isolation for 14 days, and several government officials also tested positive, including Bolivia’s health minister. Ms. Añez returned to work in late July. Guatemala Mr. Giammattei, 64, said last month that he had tested positive for the coronavirus — on the same day that the Central American country reopened its borders and allowed in international flights after a six-month closure. Mr. Giammattei, a former surgeon who walks with crutches after suffering sclerosis in his youth, said his health condition made him a “high-risk” patient. “My symptoms are very mild. Up to now, I have body aches. It hurt more yesterday than today, like a bad cold,” Mr. Giammattei told a local radio station, vowing to keep working from home. Guatemala’s culture minister and four government officials also were infected. MONACO  Prince Albert, 62, was apparently the first head of state to test positive for the coronavirus when the diagnosis was disclosed in a statement from his office on March 19. The palace later reported that he emerged from a 14-day period of self-isolation “in good health.” BRITAIN  Buckingham Palace announced March 25  that the prince, 71, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and the heir to the British throne, had contracted the coronavirus. After isolating himself for seven days at Birkhall, his residence in Scotland, Charles re-emerged publicly, via a video link, to dedicate a new field hospital for coronavirus patients. The diagnosis had raised fears about the health of his mother, now 94, whom Charles had met with on March 12, only a day before his medical advisers assessed that he might have been infectious. By the time her son’s diagnosis was disclosed, the queen had sequestered herself at Windsor Castle and the palace reported her to be in good health.  NIGERIA  Abba Kyari, an influential aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, tested positive for the coronavirus in March and died weeks later at a hospital in Lagos. Mr. Kyari was one of the most powerful men in the country, acting as a gatekeeper to the presidency. The country’s foreign minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, contracted the virus in July and self-isolated for three weeks. At least eight state governors have also contracted the virus in the past several months.  Armenia Mr. Pashinyan, 45, went into self-isolation in June after he and close family members tested positive for the coronavirus. A week later and after displaying no symptoms, he said he had tested negative. The Armenian authorities eased a weekslong lockdown in May but acknowledged that they had failed to enforce the measures thoroughly and that there had been widespread quarantine violations. Russia Mr. Mishustin, 54, who became prime minister in January, was hospitalized after testing positive for the coronavirus in April. Russia initially boasted a low mortality rate, but the country’s have since spiked. The country’s death toll has included hundreds of health care workers. Gambia Several Gambian officials tested positive for the coronavirus in August, including Mambury Njie, the finance minister; Fafa Sanyang, the petroleum and energy minister; and Amie Fabureh, the agriculture minister. Vice President Isatou Touray also contracted the virus, leading President Adama Barrow to self-isolate. “Stay safe, Covid 19 is real,” the State House of Gambia said in a tweet announcing that the ministers had contracted the virus. European Union Mr. Barnier, 69, tested positive for the coronavirus in mid-March as many European countries imposed stringent lockdown measures and closed their borders to neighbors, and as the European Union banned nonessential travel from outside the bloc. Mr. Barnier said at the time that he was “doing well and in good spirits,” and returned to office in mid-April. Iran As Iran struggled with a severe outbreak in February, several government leaders became infected, including Masoumeh Ebtekar, President Hassan Rouhani’s deputy for women’s affairs. Ms. Ebtekar, the highest-ranking woman in the country’s government, later said she had recovered. The speaker of Parliament, Ali Larijani, tested positive in April, and several high-ranking clerics have died of the virus. India In India, where coronavirus cases are soaring, several politicians have been among those to contract the virus. Suresh Angadi, a junior railways minister who died last week, became the first high-ranking official in the country to die. He was 65. Canada and Germany As many countries went into lockdown in March, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, 48, was the first leader of a major industrialized country to go into self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Trudeau said he looked after his three young children while hosting daily meetings with his cabinet or discussing strategies to contain the spread of the virus with other leaders like Mr. Johnson and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Mr. Trudeau, who displayed no symptoms, didn’t take a test but stayed in self-isolation for nearly three weeks. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, 66, also self-isolated in March after her doctor tested positive for the coronavirus. But after receiving several negative test results, she returned to office in early April.']","Mr. Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, was hospitalized.

Australians Watching American Politics: ???!!!!***$%%#,2020-10-02,By Damien Cave,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief. Australians used to talk about American politics the way they talk about sport — they followed the ups and downs, marveled at the competitor, and tried to game out who would win. This year? It’s more like the discussion of a car wreck involving a neighbor or an uncle. For months, friends and even strangers have been asking if my relatives are healthy, worried they may have perished in the American coronavirus catastrophe. And this week, after a debacle of a debate and the news that President Trump and Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus, I saw and heard more than just empathy — also shock, dismay, fear, heartbreak and just head-shaking alarm. Van Badham, a commentator who often writes for The Guardian (and occasionally the New York Times Opinion section), replied to my tweet about Mr. Trump’s positive test result with what many Australians seem to be feeling: “I just I can’t I mean What Oh god” I emailed Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office right away seeking comment — and got nothing, at least for the moment. My guess: The power-brokers in Canberra were also trying to lift their jaws off the ground. Earlier in the week, after the debate — in which Mr. Trump interrupted Joe Biden or the moderator 128 times, by one count — many Australians seemed eager to lend my fellow Yanks a hand. They offered therapeutic assistance, alcohol and an invitation to visit (or escape) to Australia, a country with national Medicare, unsolicited and easy mail-in voting and a successful response to the pandemic. But all over the country (and the world), there were also signs of intensifying frustration. Michael Fullilove, who heads up the Lowy Institute and who wrote a book on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, offered an early and surly critique — “The words I missed most in that debate: ‘You’re on mute.’” David Rowe, a political cartoonist for the Australian Financial Review, quickly published an illustration titled “undebatable” showing President Trump in clown shoes, shirtless, with a single phrase written on his body: “Me the people.” When I asked Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australia National University, how he felt watching the debate, he said two emotions came to mind: dismay and sadness. “Specifically, it renewed my bewilderment that over 40 percent of Americans are willing to contemplate a vote for Trump,” he said. “What does that say about their views of the presidency?” He added that the policy-free back and forth also “reinforced my sense that Biden is indeed a very weak candidate, whose only claim to the presidency, as he himself acknowledged, is that he isn’t Donald Trump.” And, he said, “it deepened my anxiety that the election result will be contested and chaotic.” Jen Overbeck, a dual American-Australian citizen who teaches about power and management at Melbourne Business School, said that watching the campaign from afar has brought her closer to Australians, as together they share a mix of fear and helplessness. “It’s been terrifying in a larger way to watch what’s happening in the U.S., the decline (or should I say assisted suicide) of legitimacy and Trump’s extraordinarily effective way of using raw power to destabilize and to break or re-form institutions in a very short time,” she said. The U.S., she added, has been moving from a system of adversarial politics to one simply “fought on the grounds of raw power.” What Mr. Trump’s diagnosis means for that approach — and the race in general — is very much an open question. As our White House correspondents put it: Mr. Trump’s positive test result could pose immediate difficulties for the future of his campaign against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic challenger, with just 33 days before the election on Nov. 3. Even if Mr. Trump, 74, remains asymptomatic, he will have to withdraw from the campaign trail and stay isolated in the White House for an unknown period of time. If he becomes sick, it could raise questions about whether he should remain on the ballot at all. Looks like Australians, like the rest of us, will have a lot more to watch and react to between now and Election Day on Nov. 3. Now here are our stories of the week.

"30 Years After Reunification, Old German-German Border Is a Green Oasis",2020-10-02,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['MITWITZ, Germany — Two men, one riding a bicycle, the other wearing binoculars, met in a field in the middle of Germany on a recent afternoon. Both 61, they started arguing politely, the way strangers do, about where exactly the border between East and West Germany had been. Soon, it became clear that both had good reason to think they were right. One used to be an East German border guard; the other grew up just west of the border and started bird-watching in the area at 13. “You might have seen me here with my big binoculars,” said Kai Frobel, the onetime birder, thinking back more than three decades. “There were quite a few of those here then,” laughed Mario Wenzel, the former guard, before predicting that all too soon nobody would remember the reality of a border within Germany. While the militarized border that split Germany for 38 years has disappeared more readily than the persistent economic and political differences between the two parts, a faint 870 mile-long scar remains. It is green. After a long-running battle between landowners, government authorities and environmentalists, the federal government announced last month that the entire former border zone would be designated a nature reserve. “It’s a national nature monument — similar to the Statue of Liberty,” said Mr. Frobel, an ecologist who has worked for the BUND, a German nature conservancy, since 1985. Once an insurmountable obstacle — especially to the people in the East — crossing the strip has now become a literal walk in the park. Thirty years after the border between East and West Germany ceased to exist by the stroke of a pen on Oct. 3, 1990, it remains one of the most important psychological dividers in the country. The jagged line drawn by Soviet and Allied forces after World War II tore apart villages, families and lives, and created competing narratives of liberty and nationhood that the country is still working to overcome. If Mr. Wenzel, the former border guard, had noticed Mr. Frobel observing birds back in the 1970s, he would not have been allowed to speak with him; East German guards were prohibited from speaking with anyone from the West. They were also forced to patrol behind a 10-foot fence and in pairs to prevent them from escaping. Only the most trustworthy border soldiers were allowed into the buffer zone, a wild stretch of nature, usually 200 yards wide, that belonged to East Germany and set aside to give the guards time to shoot escapees. Germans called it the death strip. The young Mr. Frobel mostly kept out of that area — where, as a West German, he would have been arrested if he strayed — and relied on his binoculars to spot birds. Through them, he discovered the death strip was teeming with life. Farmers and foresters on both sides had been forced to leave the zone alone, allowing animals and plant life to flourish. Today, more than 5,200 different species live there, 1,200 of them so rare that they are on a list for extinction. These days, the swaying gold of the wild grasses competes with the green of bushes and trees. On a recent visit, half a dozen yellowhammers busied themselves atop a high bush. A ditch that was part of the border defenses on the eastern side is overgrown with trees, but the concrete sentry path is still visible, although fresh grass is growing out of the cracks. Mr. Frobel raised his binoculars to watch several birds of prey sailing above. “Red Kites,” he pronounced. His childhood bedroom had a direct view of the border.  “I firmly believed that this monster was built for eternity and that I would never see anything change,” he recalled. “Reunification was beyond my imagination.” That view was widely shared. A physical border between East and West was first built in 1952, nine years before the Berlin Wall. Eventually the border included not only the death strip, but also barbed-wire fences, watch towers and a concrete ditch meant to stop vehicles. At its peak, the East deployed some 44,000 soldiers to protect its boundaries and prevent flight. About a thousand people died trying to flee the Communist regime, according to Robert Lebegern, the director of the German-German Museum in the small village of Mödlareuth, which was once split in two by the border. People tried crossing by ramming their cars through gates; hiding in trucks or cars; building homemade submersibles; or flying gliders or stolen crop dusters. In 1979, two families escaped in a hot-air balloon they had sewn themselves. But almost every successful escape led to stronger security. By the 1980s, the border was so fortified that only one in 20 of those trying to flee made it, Mr. Lebegern said. And then it was gone. Both Mr. Frobel and Mr. Wenzel first heard of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, on television news. The day after, Mr. Frobel and other environmentalists from the nature conservancy where he works, wrote to East German counterparts and invited them to a meeting in the Bavarian city of Hof a month later. That meeting would lead to a coordinated campaign that three decades later led the government to last month’s commitment to protect the entire length of the border, which will be known as the Green Belt. Environmentalists in East Germany were one of the less well-known driving forces behind the revolution that ultimately led to reunification 30 years ago. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they also mobilized to protect much of the East’s surprisingly abundant land resources. Because East Germany relied on heavy industry and industrial farming for economic survival, it was notoriously polluted. But the state also owned much unspoiled land, vast areas reserved for military exercises or set aside to serve as hunting grounds for the party elites. In all, about a tenth of the country’s land was near-pristine, said Michael Succow, a deputy minister of environment in what was the only freely elected government in East Germany, when it ran the rapidly dissolving country from April to October of 1990. During the last legislative session, which ended with Parliament voting to dissolve itself, lawmakers designated most of that land as national park or protected nature reserves. With last month’s announcement, the entire border will be safeguarded. On a patch of wetlands between the western state of Bavaria and the eastern state of Thuringia, the former border runs down the center of a small creek. Before reunification Mr. Frobel would come here to count the green snaketails, a rare dragonfly, and a freshwater pearl mussel. Three decades later, the creek still gurgles softly. “It is hard to believe that this peaceful place was once the frontline between N.A.T.O. and the Warsaw Pact,” Mr. Frobel said.']",Crossing the militarized border that split Germany into east and west once meant risking death. Now? It’s a literal walk in the park.
Indonesia’s Stimulus Plan Draws Fire From Environmentalists and Unions,2020-10-02,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — Indonesia’s Parliament is on the verge of approving a sweeping coronavirus stimulus package that opponents charge would undermine worker protections and permit widespread destruction of the country’s rainforests. The legislation is backed by Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, and is seen as a way to attract investment and stimulate the creation of new jobs by reducing regulations on businesses. Its supporters hope to win passage before Parliament ends its session next Friday, even as opposition to the measure grows. A confederation of labor unions is calling for a three-day national strike starting on Tuesday over provisions in the bill that would reduce job security, wages and mandatory days off. Union leaders say the strike has the backing of five million workers from dozens of industries. Environmentalists oppose the measure because it would eliminate environmental reviews for many new projects and could lead to the destruction of primary rainforests that are essential in controlling carbon emissions and slowing climate change. “The government is pursuing this policy as if they were completely deaf and blind to the effect on people by the emerging climate crisis,” said Phelim Kine, senior director for Asia at Mighty Earth, a global environmental campaign organization. “This is the Indonesian equivalent of ‘Drill, baby, drill.’” Branded as an “omnibus bill,” the legislation is 1,028 pages long and would amend 79 laws and more than 1,200 articles. Supporters say it would improve Indonesia’s investment process by speeding regulatory approval and eliminating many permit requirements. “This is the key to facilitate investment, especially in terms of simplifying permits,” said Luhut Pandjaitan, a top cabinet minister whose portfolio includes investment. Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous country, has been hit hard by the coronavirus, which has pummeled the economy and threatens to overwhelm the country’s beleaguered health care system. The government was slow to adopt coronavirus restrictions this year, then quick to lift them in the hope of reviving the economy. Now, the country is nearing 300,000 confirmed cases, and its death toll — nearly 11,000 — is the highest in East Asia. Jakarta, the capital, has imposed a partial shutdown for the second time. Indonesia’s economy is expected to contract this year for the first time since the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s. The finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, has forecast a decline in the gross domestic product of as much as 1.7 percent this year. Officials fear that the economic downturn — along with the closing of schools as a pandemic measure — will reverse the country’s recent gains in reducing poverty, improving nutrition and raising education levels. Mr. Joko, in his second five-year term, has made economic development the focus of his presidency, often overshadowing other concerns.  The effort to push this bill through Parliament has given his critics a sense of déjà vu. A year ago, as Parliament neared the end of its session, lawmakers attempted to push through legislation that would have sharply reduced personal freedom, including limiting free speech and prohibiting sex outside marriage, effectively banning gay and lesbian relations. Thousands took to the streets in protest around the country, and five died in clashes with the police. Mr. Joko withdrew the measure, although he refused to block another contentious bill that weakened the country’s anticorruption agency. This year, despite coronavirus restrictions making it harder to stage protests, labor organizers said they planned to demonstrate outside Parliament and invited students, environmentalists and other opponents of the measure to join. The labor coalition supports the idea of job creation but argues that the omnibus bill would harm workers by reducing severance pay for those laid off, cutting the amount of mandatory leave, allowing longer work hours and permitting the hiring of contract and part-time workers to take the place of full-time employees. “The fact is that the omnibus law reduces labor rights in the existing law,” said Said Iqbal, president of the Indonesian Trade Union Confederation and a leader of the planned strike. Indonesia, which straddles the Equator and once had vast rainforests, has lost much of its forest cover to intentional burning that has been used for decades to clear land for palm oil plantations. Forest fires occur every year and produce huge volumes of smoke that drift over neighboring Singapore and Malaysia and into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Environmentalists say that the government has made some progress in recent years in reducing the amount of burning, but that restrictions now in place would be reversed by the omnibus bill. Especially vulnerable, they say, are four provinces in Sumatra and another on Java that still have intact primary forest and serve as natural carbon sinks that help protect against climate change. Asep Komarudin, senior forest campaigner for Greenpeace in Indonesia, said the measure would gut forest protection, including by eliminating public input in the permit process and repealing laws that the government uses to sue companies for illegal burning on their land. He noted that these provisions were drafted in the interest of corporations long before the pandemic and had nothing to do with the coronavirus. “The government is offering investment by eliminating all the safety nets, meaning that everything has been put on sale,” he said. Defenders of the measure say that the current environmental requirements would not be eliminated for large projects, just for smaller ones. “If the business field poses low risks, then there would be no need for a permit,” said Ihsan Zulkarnaen, an official at the coordinating ministry for the economy. “They would only need to register.” But critics said the lack of safeguards and the reduction in environmental protections could make foreign investors — especially those from Europe, where environmental standards are high — less interested in putting money in Indonesia. “This is very damaging for our forest and for our environment,” Mr. Asep, of Greenpeace in Indonesia, said. If the bill passes, “all the effort to work on climate change and preventing deforestation will be futile.”']",Critics say the sweeping measure near passage in Parliament would lead to greater deforestation and the loss of worker protections.
"Lebanon and Israel, Officially Enemies, Agree to Talks on Sea Border",2020-10-01,By Ben Hubbard and Adam Rasgon,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon and Israel have agreed to open their first negotiations on nonsecurity issues in three decades, a rare if limited breakthrough between hostile neighbors that are technically at war and have no formal diplomatic relations. Talks aimed at ending an enduring dispute over their maritime boundary in a patch of the Mediterranean Sea rich with natural gas are slated to begin this month, officials from both countries said Thursday. The talks, to be held under the auspices of the United Nations and mediated by the United States, were announced just weeks after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain normalized relations with Israel, becoming the third and fourth Arab countries to do so. But officials involved in the Mediterranean Sea talks said a diplomatic accord between Lebanon and Israel was not on the table. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated the parties on the agreement, saying in a statement that the discussions “have the potential to yield greater stability, security and prosperity for Lebanese and Israeli citizens alike.” The United States has sought to mediate the dispute for years, with little progress. But senior United States officials, including Mr. Pompeo, visited Lebanon this year and have repeatedly raised the issue with Lebanese officials. The breakthrough came as Lebanon faces a punishing economic crisis and could benefit from the undersea gas. Its currency has lost 80 percent of its value over the past year, poverty and unemployment have spiked, and its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is about 170 percent, one of the highest in the world. In August, a massive explosion in the port of Beirut killed more than 190 people and destroyed large swaths of the capital, compounding the misery. Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament and the country’s senior Shiite politician, announced the agreement in Beirut, suggesting that gas from near the disputed area could “help us pay our debt.” The dispute is over 330 square miles of the Mediterranean that Israel and Lebanon both claim to be within their exclusive economic zones. The stakes of the disagreement have risen as Israel and Cyprus have begun exploiting offshore gas in the eastern Mediterranean, leaving the Lebanese searching for a similar, and much-needed, boost to their economy. Israel’s offshore gas has enhanced its energy independence and earned it export contracts with Jordan and Egypt worth billions of dollars, although demand has flagged this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The amount of gas in Lebanon’s offshore zone remains unclear, although the government has signed exploration contracts with foreign firms. Israel’s Energy Ministry said in a statement that the talks would be the first negotiations between the two countries on a civilian matter in 30 years. Officials from the two countries meet regularly under the auspices of the United Nations in southern Lebanon to address security issues along their shared border. That appeared to be the template adopted for the maritime border talks, which will be held in a United Nations headquarters in the Lebanese town of Naqura, near the Israeli border, David Schenker, the U.S. assistant secretary for near eastern affairs, told reporters. The talks were expected to start the week of Oct. 12, he said, although the exact date had not been determined. Nor was it clear how long they would last. “We hope Lebanon will be a global capital of natural gas and will develop all of its natural resources,” said Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, who will lead the Israeli delegation in the talks. “We don’t want to see Lebanon collapse.” He did not expect the talks to lead to swift breakthroughs on other issues dividing the two countries. “I don’t think Lebanon is going to become Abu Dhabi because of this,” he said, referring to the capital of the Emirates. “I don’t have any illusions.” It was not immediately clear who President Michel Aoun of Lebanon would appoint to represent Lebanon. Israeli forces invaded Lebanon twice to try to uproot Palestinian militants during Lebanon’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990, and Israel occupied a chunk of southern Lebanon until 2000. In 2006, Israel fought a bloody 34-day war with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that the United States, Israel and other countries consider a terrorist organization. Since then, the border has been mostly quiet, but the rancor remains. Lebanese television stations often refer to Israel as “the enemy” and most Lebanese avoid mixing with Israelis abroad for fear of being accused of treason at home. Mr. Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, heads a political party closely allied with Hezbollah, and the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned one of his top aides, Ali Hassan Khalil, last month for supporting Hezbollah. The mechanics and scope of the talks appeared to be unsettled. Mr. Steinitz, the Israeli energy minister, said the talks would be “face to face,” while Lebanese officials said they would not speak directly to Israelis. Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli brigadier general who took part in postwar talks with Lebanon starting in 2006, said that when those meetings began, the Lebanese “made a fuss” about sitting in the same room as the Israelis but then settled for separate Israeli and Lebanese tables, with a U.N. table in the middle. Initially, the Lebanese refused to speak directly to the Israelis, telling the United Nations officials what message to pass along, even if the Israelis could hear the Lebanese speaking, he said. Eventually, they started speaking to each other directly. Mr. Berri said the negotiations would also touch on the disputed land border, while Israel and the United States mentioned only maritime borders. In response to a question, Mr. Schenker said the United States would welcome any steps by Israel and Lebanon to reach agreement on the land border. The new talks were significant, Mr. Orion said, because they would go beyond security issues. “This is the first time we are going beyond the narrow scope of military, security and defense issues and moving to a wider scope of energy and border discussions,” he said. The resulting agreement could even exclude offshore facilities from being targeted in war, he said. Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Adam Rasgon from Jerusalem. Kareem Chehayeb contributed reporting from Beirut.']",The negotiations will be their first on nonsecurity issues in three decades but officials do not expect them to lead to peace talks.
"After 30 Years, East and West Germans Wonder: How United Are We?",2020-10-03,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Robert Hellmundt was born in East Germany in 1989, the year that the Berlin Wall fell. Some two decades later, he decided to quit the East after graduating from university, like so many of his generation looking for brighter futures, and move to the capital of a reunified Germany. But after only three years in Berlin, he moved back to his home state of Thuringia, convinced that it was the best place in Germany for him and his business partner to base their start-up, which offers products aimed at improving hand-sanitizing practices. “We realized that it was much more advantageous in Thuringia,” Mr. Hellmundt said. As Germany commemorates three decades as a united country, most people on both sides of the former border consider the reunification project a success. Living standards have risen. The mass exodus from East to West has been halted and even reversed. Chancellor Angela Merkel, an easterner who embodies the values of Western liberal democracy, has led the country for half of its existence. But while few people call unity itself into question, surveys show that a clear majority living in the East believe the process remains unfinished. Many question whether the expenditure of 1.6 trillion euros, almost $1.9 trillion, to try to raise living standards in the East to those of the West has been worthwhile. Economic growth in the East still lags that of the West, and many easterners are expressing their discontent by supporting the anti-immigrant, far-right Alternative for Germany party. The German government acknowledges that there is still work to be done. “The historically unique challenge of bringing together two long separated parts of a country, was tackled through many projects and measures,” the government said this year in its annual progress report on the state of reunification. “Not all of them proved to be successful and sustainable.” It added: “There was no overall ‘master plan’ for this.” We looked at some of those projects and measures, what they have achieved, and what still needs to be done. The start-up founded by Mr. Hellmundt and his partner in the eastern city of Jena received more than 300,000 euros, or $350,000, in public financial incentives, part of an effort to help strengthen the economy in the East by attracting young companies. After reunification, the East lost a generation of young people fleeing soaring unemployment to seek jobs and a future in the West after 94 percent of state-owned companies in the region were sold or shuttered. Since then, living standards have gradually been catching up with the West, but differences remain. A full-time employee in the states of the former East Germany, where economic output lags the West by 70 percent, earns 15 percent less on average for the same job as a Western counterpart, according to government figures. None of Germany’s publicly traded companies have their headquarters in the East, and the region trails in investment in research, development, machines and factories. The population drain stopped in 2013 and has recently begun to show signs of reversing. But the region lost 1.3 million people in the first decades after reunification, a shortfall that will take years to recover from — if ever. Young families remain scarce, meaning there are fewer people paying taxes or having children. Compounding the problem is a widespread hostility to foreigners in the former East, making it less attractive to asylum-seekers, but also other immigrants looking for work who may have skills that are in demand. Only 8.2 percent of the people living in the former East are minorities, or have an immigrant background, government figures show. In recent years, there has been a spate of racist attacks, like an assault on a synagogue and kebab shop in Halle last year, and anti-immigrant riots in Chemnitz in 2018. “Demographic development is the Achilles’ heel of East Germany,” said Klaus-Heiner Röhl, an economist with the German Economic Institute. To attract more people to the region, the federal government has created thousands of public-service jobs, and is offering incentives to lure entrepreneurs and start-ups like Heyfair, Mr. Hellmundt’s company. “Because of the lower cost of living, we could hire equally qualified employees at lower salaries there than in Berlin or Munich,” Mr. Hellmundt said. “And be part of a growing scene.” The biggest disruption to the political landscape since reunification has been the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has its power base in the former East. Alternative for Germany is the second-largest party in several eastern states, and in both Saxony and Thuringia it is the most popular among voters under 30. Six in 10 Germans overall see reunification as a success, according to a YouGov survey of 2,034 people. But more than eight in 10 people in the former East Germany consider reunification incomplete, and one in three see it as a failure. While Germany as a whole has seen a rise of far-right extremism and activity,  the popularity of Alternative for Germany among voters in the East has helped to shift society there as a whole to the right. It was in the East that the party first won seats in regional legislatures in 2014, and it went on to receive 13 percent of the vote in the 2017 general election, propelled by Eastern voters to become the largest opposition party in Parliament. Those East Germans who do not view reunification as a success reflect the bitterness that remains three decades after the project came into being on Oct. 3, 1990. Many of them look back with nostalgia at what was lost — state protections like guaranteed jobs and free child care — when their freedom was gained. While some who lived in the former East Germany now lament what has been lost to reunification, one area where the norms of the East persisted — and traveled West — is in the role of women in society. East Germany granted women the right to work and equal pay in 1949, and later introduced benefits like a paid year of maternity leave and full-time state-funded child care. But those were ended after West German norms were adopted following reunification. By contrast, women in the former West Germany have struggled to break from traditional gender roles, with men working and women staying home to care for the family. In the East, 74 percent of women work, compared with 68 percent in the West. But a recent study by researchers from University College London and Queen Mary University of London found that as women from the East moved west to find jobs, they brought with them the values of the more egalitarian culture into which they were born. The finding reflects a shift in western German society, making it more socially acceptable for women to balance a family with a career. “We looked at East German women working at firms in the West, and found that they still behaved pretty much like East Germans, despite their environment,” said Anna Raute, an assistant professor at Queen Mary. Since Ms. Merkel took office in 2005, Germany has made considerable investments in shared parental leave and child care, creating new norms to be shared by the generation growing up in a united Germany. Just on Thursday, her party announced that it would earmark 500 million euros to expand after-hours care for elementary schoolchildren. “German reunification, and the peaceful revolution that led to it, is one of the strongest symbols of peace, rationality and reconciliation in the history of the world,” said Mr. Hellmundt, the entrepreneur who moved back to the East. “You would really have to bend reality to not view it as a success.”']","With Germany now an established, reunified democracy, it is taking stock of what is working and what still needs work, especially as the economy continues to lag in the former East."
"Fans celebrate the Stanley Cup champions, well outside the N.H.L.’s pandemic bubble.",2020-10-01,"By Mike Ives, Ben Shpigel and Tyler Kepner","['The Tampa Bay Lightning won the National Hockey League’s top trophy on Monday from within the confines of a 24/7 pandemic bubble in western Canada, and without any fans in the arena to watch. By Wednesday, the players were back in Florida, greeting hordes of unmasked fans who turned out to celebrate their victory. No one appeared to mind that the state had passed 700,000 confirmed coronavirus cases a few days earlier and was reporting an average of at least 2,200 new cases a day over the past week. Wednesday’s celebration began with a boat parade by Lightning players through downtown Tampa, and segued into a party in a local stadium that was attended by about 12,000 to 15,000 people, according to The Tampa Bay Times. “It almost feels like what we’re doing now is, like, wrong,” one fan, Wes King, said. Photos from the event showed thousands of unmasked fans cramming together on the bank of the Hillsborough River as unmasked players from the Lightning floated by on motorboats, drinking beer and puffing on cigars. Other unmasked players slapped hands and posed for selfies with fans who had jammed together into a receiving line, and even allowed fans to drink from the cup, as winning teams normally do. “So … why did they spend months in a bubble if they were just going to go Covid crazy the minute they were released?” one Canada-based Twitter user wrote. “Not the brightest bulbs.” The N.H.L. was the first of the four major North American pro sports leagues to complete a season during the pandemic. It chose to base its playoff “bubbles” in Toronto and Edmonton because of their relatively low infection rates, especially compared with cities in the United States. Players, team and league staff members, and medical officers were fenced off inside “secure zones” that included hockey arenas, practice facilities and hotels. Broadcasters stood at a social distance while interviewing players on the ice. And many players went weeks, or months, without seeing their families. Even the league’s commissioner, Gary Bettman, had to produce negative tests during a weeklong home isolation, then quarantine in his hotel room for several days, before he could present the Stanley Cup to the Lightning. “There’s no harder championship to win,” Mr. Bettman said before handing the trophy to the team’s captain, Steven Stamkos. “The gauntlet that you have to run to hoist this trophy is unbelievable, and never more unbelievable than this year.” In other sports news related to the pandemic, Major League Baseball said it would sell tickets to the National League Championship Series and the World Series this October, both of which will be held at the Texas Rangers’ new retractable-roof ballpark in Arlington. The American League Championship Series will be played in San Diego, but the league could not get approval from California to sell tickets there.']",
Attack at German Synagogue During Sukkot Raises Anti-Semitism Fears,2020-10-04,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — A man wearing army fatigues and wielding a shovel attacked and badly injured a Jewish student coming out of a synagogue in Hamburg on Sunday, less than a year after an assault on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle turned deadly. Security guards and police officers deployed to the Hamburg synagogue, where people were marking the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, swiftly subdued and arrested a 29-year-old man, whose name the authorities did not disclose. The suspect was carrying a piece of paper with a swastika in his pocket, the German news agency DPA reported. The 26-year-old victim, who was wearing a kipa, or skullcap, when he was attacked, suffered grave head wounds and was taken to a hospital, the police said. “This is not a one-off case, this is vile anti-Semitism and we all have to stand against it,” the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, wrote on Twitter. Germany has seen the number of anti-Semitic crimes nearly double in the past three years. Last year alone, the government recorded 2,032 anti-Semitic crimes, culminating in the attack on the synagogue in Halle on Oct. 9. In that attack, a gunman tried and failed to force his way in during services for Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, and then killed two people elsewhere. The man arrested in Halle, Stephan Balliet, 28, is currently facing trial and has spoken openly in court about his hatred not only of Jews but also of Muslims and foreigners, and of being influenced by a far-right extremist attack against two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 people last year. Last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her concern about the rise in anti-Semitism in Germany, warning in a speech to the Central Council of Jews that it is a reality “that many Jews don’t feel safe and respected in our country.” “Racism and anti-Semitism never disappeared, but for some time now they have become more visible and uninhibited,” the chancellor said, citing the attack in Halle as an example of “how quickly words can become deeds.” In Halle a year ago, the congregation inside the synagogue only narrowly escaped a massacre. The door of the synagogue had been locked and withstood the clumsily built explosives meant to blow it open. In his rage the gunman later trained his weapon on other random targets in the city. Following Sunday’s attack, Jewish organizations in Germany and beyond urged the government to increase protection and focus on long-term strategies to stamp out anti-Semitism. “I am saddened to learn that once again, this time on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a German Jewish community is confronting a violent, anti-Semitic act of terror,” Ronald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement. “We must ask ourselves, and German local and national authorities must address the question — why does this keep happening? Why is anti-Semitism thriving?” “The German government must take responsibility in strengthening education so that the next generation understands that hatred of any kind is never permissible,” Mr. Lauder added. “The long-term viability of Jewish life in Germany depends on it.”']","Almost exactly a year after a far-right extremist shocked Germany by attacking a synagogue during Yom Kippur, another assault targets a synagogue in Hamburg."
Pope Criticizes Lack of Unity in World’s Response to Coronavirus,2020-10-04,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pope Francis criticized the failures of global cooperation in response to the coronavirus pandemic in a document released on Sunday that underscores the priorities of his pontificate. “As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities,” Francis said in the encyclical, the most authoritative form of papal teaching. “Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,” he added. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality,” the pope said. Released amid another Vatican financial scandal and after changes in church rules regarding sex abuse, the letter steered clear of other contentious subjects. It instead returned often to some of the church’s hobbyhorses, including a secularism that has produced what the church sees as a throwaway, consumerist culture. Francis argued that this was apparent in the treatment of older people during the pandemic. “If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of the dismantling, year after year, of health care systems. If only this immense sorrow may not prove useless, but enable us to take a step forward toward a new style of life,” he wrote. The pope also warned that the forces of “myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise.” The encyclical, titled “Brothers All,” is a reflection on fraternity and social friendship heavily influenced by St. Francis of Assisi, after whom the pope took his name. The document calls for closeness to the marginalized, support for migrants, resistance of nationalist and tribal populism, and the abolition of the death penalty, but in those respects it broke little new ground. Francis signed the letter on Saturday in the crypt of the Basilica of St. Francis in the town of Assisi in central Italy, his first trip outside Rome since the coronavirus pandemic prompted Italy to lock down for nearly three months starting in March. In the letter, the pope made a connection between the economic globalization that he thinks leaves people behind — writing, “We are asked to believe this dogma of neoliberal faith” — and the spread of the virus, which he said exposed existing inequalities. “If everything is connected, it is hard to imagine that this global disaster is unrelated to our way of approaching reality, our claim to be absolute masters of our own lives and of all that exists,” he writes. “I do not want to speak of divine retribution, nor would it be sufficient to say that the harm we do to nature is itself the punishment for our offenses.” Francis expounded on some of his preferred themes including an appeal for peace, justice and fraternity that he has elevated to church teaching. Most of the letter consists of spiritual reflections on love or biblical commentary or esoteric insights (“Concupiscence is not a flaw limited to our own day”). There are also long tracts about charity and respecting local cultures and outsiders. But Francis has some more concrete hopes, too, though they remain at an altitude high above policy proposals. To help migrants, he calls for simplifying the granting of visas and for opening humanitarian corridors. He argues that fraternity on a state level requires richer countries to help poorer ones. But at the same time, he expresses suspicion of foreign loans. “In many instances, debt repayment not only fails to promote development but gravely limits and conditions it,” he wrote. Instead, he endorsed a sort of international collective bargaining, with small or poor countries signing agreements with their regional neighbors that would allow them to negotiate as a bloc. The pope identified global trends that he believes “hinder the development of universal fraternity.” He cited economic inequality, sexism and racism, “a virus that quickly mutates” and which he said continues to shame the world despite “supposed social progress.” He was especially critical of internet trolls, the “frenzy of texting” and “self-centered chats” that prevent the seeking of wisdom and deep relationships. In social networks, he criticized technologies that “shamelessly peer into every detail” of people’s lives, and “do not really build community; instead, they tend to disguise and expand the very individualism that finds expression in xenophobia and in contempt for the vulnerable.” Debasement of culture on the internet, he wrote, has transferred to real life. “Things that until a few years ago could not be said by anyone without risking the loss of universal respect can now be said with impunity,” he said, “and in the crudest of terms, even by some political figures.” The pope devoted a full chapter, one of eight, to his view on politics, which he argued can be among the noblest of professions. But now he sees an enemy to fraternity in the way “certain populist political regimes, as well as certain liberal economic approaches, maintain that an influx of migrants is to be prevented at all costs.” He argued that disregard for the vulnerable “can hide behind a populism that exploits them demagogically for its own purposes.” And the pope made clear that he did not like the permanent campaign tenor of modern politics. “Today, in many countries, hyperbole, extremism and polarization have become political tools,” he wrote, without mentioning any specific country. Nevertheless, Francis sought to strike a hopeful note, expressing optimism that the “recent pandemic enabled us to recognize and appreciate once more all those around us who, in the midst of fear, responded by putting their lives on the line.” But, perhaps less optimistically, he noted, “once this health crisis passes, our worst response would be to plunge even more deeply into feverish consumerism and new forms of egotistic self-preservation.”']","In an encyclical, the most authoritative form of papal teaching, Francis lamented poor cooperation among countries and warned the forces of “myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise.”"
Britain and E.U. Enter Make-or-Break Phase for Brexit Deal by Year’s End,2020-10-03,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Britain’s lengthy divorce proceedings with the European Union entered a make-or-break phase on Saturday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission president agreed that the two sides shared enough common ground to aim for a final settlement. The announcement, after a video call between Mr. Johnson and the Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, fell well short of a breakthrough, but neither was it a breakdown. Negotiations for a long-term trade agreement, which have ground on inconclusively for months, will now intensify as the two sides scramble to meet a deadline that would allow a deal to be in place on Dec. 31. The two leaders agreed that “progress had been made in recent weeks but that significant gaps remained,"" according to a statement from 10 Downing Street. “They instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps.” Britain formally left the European Union at the end of January. But under the terms of its withdrawal agreement, it remains part of the bloc’s customs union and single market until the end of the year while the two sides hammer out permanent arrangements on issues like fishing quotas and state aid to industries. While the issues in dispute are technical and even at times tedious, they have profound implications for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union. The risk of a rupture is as big as it was this time last year, when negotiations on the withdrawal agreement hit a similar moment of truth. Mr. Johnson’s intervention in the talks is an important, if long-expected, shift from working-level negotiators to top leaders. In addition to the prime minister and Ms. von der Leyen, much will depend on the role played by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Each has very different political calculations. Mr. Macron’s polling numbers have swooned in recent weeks as French voters increasingly disapprove of his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He faces an election next year, which raises questions about how much ground he will be willing to give Britain on politically sensitive issues like fishing rights. Ms. Merkel, in the twilight of her long tenure, has her eye firmly on securing her legacy as the de facto leader of Europe. A bitter breakup with Britain, especially when Germany holds the presidency of the European Council\xa0— the bloc’s executive arm — would mar that record and she seems determined to avoid that outcome. “You see that now with Merkel still being very cautious but constructive, and the Macron team being far more aggressive and even hostile toward the U.K.,” said Mujtaba Rahman, a former economist at the European Commission who is now an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. Yet even Ms. Merkel has shown impatience with what many in Europe perceive as Britain’s needlessly provocative tactics. Mr. Johnson recently introduced a bill that would override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland. His own aides acknowledged that it would be a violation of international law, and the European Union bought legal action against Britain this past week. “We’ve suffered a certain setback with the breaching of the agreement we reached on Northern Ireland,” Ms. Merkel said on Friday in language that, for her, was more frank than usual. “I have to say simply: That’s bitter.” With time running out, the British have been pressing for an opportunity to take their case higher up the political food chain. Last year, Mr. Johnson successfully brokered an agreement on Britain’s withdrawal in talks with Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister at the time, and seems confident that he can do so again. Things are harder this time, however. The most contentious points in last year’s withdrawal agreement mainly affected a single country, Ireland, while these negotiations on trade affect many more. The big economies, like France and Germany, have much at stake, and red lines they will not cross. Among the main sticking points are fisheries, with most analysts saying that to get a deal, the European Union would have to accept lower quotas for catches in British waters. The new quotas could be phased in, however, giving continental fishing fleets more time to adjust. At the same, Britain would have to give ground on the thorny issue of state aid. The European Union fears that an unfettered British government could subsidize its companies and dump goods in the continental European market. The bloc wants the British to specify which antitrust rules it will enforce domestically, and to agree on a mechanism to resolve disputes with the E.U. Britain, however, sees it as a matter of national sovereignty. Mr. Johnson’s powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings, wants Britain to have a free hand to promote artificial intelligence and other the high-tech industries. Yet the pandemic has heightened pressure on Mr. Johnson to compromise. Not only has the British economy taken a big hit, but his handling of the pandemic has been widely criticized. With lawmakers in his own Conservative Party increasingly rebellious, Mr. Johnson would run an acute political risk if he allowed the absence of a Brexit trade deal to produce chaos at Channel ports in January. In interviews with the BBC on Saturday before his call with Ms. von der Leyen, Mr. Johnson struck a more optimistic tone then he has in recent weeks, when he talked openly about a no-deal Brexit. The ingredients for a deal were “all there,” though he added, “It’s up to our friends and partners to be common-sensical.” Mr. Rahman said he expected more fireworks in the weeks to come, and he did not rule out a collapse in the talks. But he predicted that in the end, Mr. Johnson would compromise to get an agreement. “The world around him is melting down, and he needs a win on Brexit,” Mr. Rahman said.

Floodgates in Venice Work in First Major Test,2020-10-03,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — After decades of bureaucratic delays, corruption and resistance from environmental groups, sea walls designed to defend Venice from “acqua alta,” or high water, went up on Saturday, testing their ability to battle the city’s increasingly menacing floods. By 10 a.m., all 78 floodgates barricading three inlets to the Venetian lagoon had been raised, and even when the tide reached as high as four feet, water levels inside the lagoon remained steady, officials said. “There wasn’t even a puddle in St. Mark’s Square,” said Alvise Papa, the director of the Venice department that monitors high tides. Had the flood barriers not been raised, about half the city’s streets would have been under water, and visitors to St. Mark’s Square — which floods when the tide nears three feet — would have been wading in a foot and a half of water, he said. “Everything dry here. Pride and joy,” tweeted Luigi Brugnaro, Venice’s newly re-elected mayor. Designed some four decades ago to help save Venice from flooding, the mobile barrier system was delayed by cost overruns, corruption, and opposition from environmental and conservation groups. The cost of the system tripled from initial estimates, and a 2014 bribery scandal led to the arrest of the then-mayor, Giorgio Orsoni, and dozens of others, including politicians and businessmen involved in the project. Mr. Orsoni and some of the others charged were acquitted. “We found a difficult situation and slowly, slowly we’ve been able to resolve things,” said Giuseppe Fiengo, one of the commissioners who have overseen the project since 2014. “The important thing is that today, for the first time, with high water, Venice didn’t flood.” The floodgates have been tested several times over the past summer, but under less threatening weather conditions than those on Saturday. “This time we raised them to defend Venice,” said Alberto Scotti, the engineer who designed them. The system is not fully operational yet. Some infrastructure still needs to be completed, and workers haven’t been fully trained, so Saturday’s operation was technically a test. “But it’s a test that had an objective, to guarantee the safety of the city, and it did,” Mr. Scotti said. The construction firms building the system have until December 2021 to finish the work. When it is fully operational, the floodgates will be activated whenever the tide reaches 3½ feet. Until then, the floodgates will be operated when the tide reaches four feet, as it did on Saturday. Though significant, Saturday’s tide levels were a far cry from the exceptionally high water levels seen last year — six feet — and the year before, endangering the city and prompting the mayor to declare a state of emergency. Mr. Scotti said the floodgates had been designed to defend the city “even in anomalous situations,” and even with high tides reaching nearly 10 feet. While supporters of the project welcomed Saturday’s test as a major victory, some pointed out that the floodgates won’t fully solve the growing threat posed by climate change. Increasing sea levels and new wind patterns could force the floodgates to stay up so often that it could destroy ship traffic or turn the Venice lagoon into a swamp. “With climate change, there’s a chance that the floodgates could be employed 150-180 days a year, becoming an almost fixed barrier and severing the lagoon’s relation to the sea,” said Cristiano Gasparetto, an architect and former provincial official who has long opposed the project. “If the lagoon is cut off from the sea for long periods, it dies, because the natural exchange of waters stops, and all of its organic life risks decaying,” he said. “If the lagoon dies, Venice dies,” he added. “It loses its characteristics.” Mr. Gasparetto also said he doubted that the floodgates would work in extreme conditions with high waves and strong winds. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “Today’s test says nothing when it comes to that.” Concerns also remain about the costs of maintaining the floodgates and potential damage from saltwater. Still, the operation of the gates on Saturday was greeted in Venice as progress. “Today we had the certainty that it works,” Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, which includes Venice, told reporters on Saturday. “At least we know that it can help Venice.”']","The fiercely contested floodgate system was used to stop a high tide from flooding Venice’s fragile streets.

"To ward off pessimism about his health, Trump releases a video from the hospital.",2020-10-04,"By Maggie Haberman, Peter Baker and John Ismay","['On Saturday, President Trump released a four-minute video from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where he is receiving inpatient care for the coronavirus, to say that he is “starting to feel good.” Wearing a blue jacket, cuff links and an American flag pin but no necktie, the president looked much paler than he did during his debate in Cleveland on Tuesday with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thanking the staff at Walter Reed, Trump said that he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he arrived at the hospital on Friday, but that he felt “much better now.” He congratulated himself for his job performance and said, “I think I’ll be back soon.” The video, released Saturday evening, contrasted with what Mark Meadows, the president’s chief of staff, had told reporters earlier in the day outside the hospital. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning,” Mr. Meadows said. “And the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care.” For a president who often serves as his own spokesman, the video’s release may have been a way to reclaim the narrative from doctors who have offered conflicting reports of the president’s health, and from statements made by his own White House staff. According to people close to the president, he was furious about Mr. Meadows’s comments. With only a month remaining until the Nov. 3 election, there is precious little time to recast the president’s current health problems in a positive light before the nation decides whether to give him a second term in office. Mr. Trump has canceled previously scheduled public appearances, and it is unclear whether he will be able to rejoin the campaign trail. No matter the tone of the video, the public has been left without a clear picture of the president’s health. Military doctors on Saturday morning offered a rosy picture of the president’s medical condition at a televised news conference outside Walter Reed. Afterward, Mr. Meadows told reporters that the president’s health was more worrisome, though he asked that that assessment not be attributed to him by name. Soon, however, it became clear that Mr. Meadows was the source of the information once a video posted online captured him approaching the pool reporters outside Walter Reed after the doctors’ televised briefing and asking to speak off the record. Mr. Meadows later tried to walk back his comments. “The president is doing very well,” he told Reuters. “He is up and about and asking for documents to review.” He called into Fox News on Saturday night, knowing the president was most likely watching, and praised his “unbelievable courage” and “unbelievable improvement.” But he also confirmed that Mr. Trump’s condition on Friday was worse than originally described. “Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,” Mr. Meadows said. “He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.” Despite the back-and-forth tussle over messaging, both Mr. Meadows and Mr. Trump agreed on a central point: The president’s potential for recovery is uncertain at the moment. “You don’t know over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test,” Mr. Trump said.']",
"Contact Tracing, Key to Reining In the Virus, Falls Flat in the West",2020-10-03,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — As the coronavirus stampeded across Europe and the United States this spring, governments made their depleted citizens a tantalizing promise: Soon, legions of disease detectives would hunt down anyone exposed to the virus, confining them to their homes and letting everyone else get on with their lives. Nearly eight months on, as a web of new infections spreads across Europe and the United States, that promise has nearly evaporated. Despite repeated vows by Western nations to develop “world-beating” testing and tracing operations, those systems have been undone by a failure of governments to support citizens through onerous quarantines or to draw out intimate details of their whereabouts. That has shattered the hope of pinpoint measures replacing lockdowns and undermined flagging confidence in governments. Beholden to privacy rules, Western officials largely trusted people to hand over names to contact tracers. But that trust was not repaid, in large part because governments neglected services that were crucial to winning people’s cooperation: a fast and accurate testing system, and guarantees that people would be housed, fed and paid while they isolated. “Public health leaders fell in love with the idea of contact tracing as an important tactic — and it is — but that’d be like if you’re going into war and were just talking about the tanks,” said Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a public health charity in Maryland. Just as important, officials overlooked the impact of raging mistrust in government and a thicket of conspiracy theories about the virus’s spread. Fearful of plunging themselves or their friends into a painful period off work, infected patients have handed over a paltry number of contacts and often flouted self-isolation rules. Contact tracers are struggling to reach people who test positive, and being rebuffed once they do. In theory, countries were to build mass testing programs that would provide quick diagnoses. Then a group of tracers would find others who had crossed paths with the infected person and tell them to stay home. Elected officials presented the system as a critical bridge between lockdown and a vaccine, allowing them to contain small outbreaks without shutting down large parts of society. But construction of that bridge has been rocky, at best. The West’s public health systems have not matched the success in parts of East Asia where  the fear of epidemics became more ingrained after SARS and MERS. Following those outbreaks, places like Taiwan and South Korea built robust tracing systems and legal frameworks for limiting civil liberties during an epidemic. Some contact tracers have used cellphone and credit card data to identify people who were potentially exposed. But in Europe and the United States, which have largely relied on the public to provide information and follow quarantine rules voluntarily, the response has been spotty. The West also ran up against the blunt fact that contact tracing, while useful in containing limited cases, has become overwhelmed by a new explosion of infections. In the past week, Europe has averaged about 60,000 new daily cases, while the United States is registering more than 40,000. “The track and trace system is unrealistic and useless,” said Mahmoud Salamon, 27, a recent business school graduate on a visit to Brighton, on England’s south coast, where a testing center at a stadium was recently closed for the start of soccer season. He said he distrusted restaurants or stores with his personal information. In Taiwan, an infected person names more than 15 contacts on average, and tracers often interview patients in person, trying to extract details about secret jobs or marital affairs. But the picture in Europe is far different, and the low level of cooperation has startled public health experts. In Spain, where hospitals are struggling with a new rush of cases, contact tracers identify, on average, only three contacts for each known case. In France, the figure has fallen below three. Yet even those numbers are higher than in the United States. In New York City, each infected person hands over an average of 1.1 other names. In England, people are neither handing over many contacts — about five, on average — nor following the rules. In a survey of about 32,000 Britons, less than one in five who reported coronavirus symptoms said they had stayed home. Of those alerted that they had been close to an infected person, only one in 10 said they had complied with orders to self-isolate. “It suggests there is some degree of skepticism in the population to engagement,” said Professor Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, an adviser to the government’s tracing program, referring to the proportion of known cases — a fifth — who handed over no other names. Crucially, many Western governments have failed to cushion the financial and psychological blow of self-isolation by guaranteeing people tests or giving them enough money to weather two weeks without work.  People self-isolating and unable to work in England were eligible for just 13 pounds, or $16.70, per day, until the government increased the payments this past week. “You need to have the trust of people for this to work, and trust comes by whether you’re going to take care of me,” said Dr. Jason Wang, a Stanford University professor of health policy who has studied Taiwan’s coronavirus response. “If I’m sick, are you going to help me, or just quarantine me? Are you going to get me tested on time?” With tests results lagging in many countries, contact tracers cannot get ahead of the virus. In Paris, people wait up to a week to get testing appointments and results. England recently recorded a backlog of nearly 200,000 untested lab samples, making it impossible to track the virus through newly reopened schools. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Danielle Lennon, who lives in hard-hit northeastern England, sat in a mile-long line of idling cars for almost an hour to get her 7-year-old daughter tested, only for someone to announce that the testing center was closed. “The government has kind of lost the general public on this, through incompetence,” she said. Some elected leaders have blamed recalcitrant citizens for undermining contact tracing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said the problem was that Britain was “a freedom-loving country.” But the evidence for such claims is thin. Some countries have successfully tracked the virus, despite people’s resistance, in large part by investing in chronically underfunded health departments, epidemiologists said. In Germany, people said they would refuse to hand over names to contact tracers at double the rate of Britons, according to a poll by Imperial College London. Even so, the country has largely kept a small uptick in new infections under control. Beyond Germany’s strong testing program, said Ralf Reintjes, a professor of epidemiology at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, the country also responded to the pandemic by pouring money into its roughly 400 local public health offices, which had long conducted contact tracing for communicable diseases. England, by contrast, awarded a £108 million ($138 million) contract to an outsourcing company, putting the fate of contact tracing in the hands of ill-trained call center workers. Gerry, a former nurse who asked not to be fully identified because she was barred from speaking publicly, said she had quit her job as a more senior contact tracer in England because so few people either picked up the phone or helped her track cases. Western countries have been slow to introduce mobile contact tracing apps like those used in parts of Asia, which notify users who have spent time near an infected person. Even if only 15 percent of people download them, they can reduce infections by 8 percent and deaths by 6 percent, according to research by Prof. Fraser, the Oxford professor. But the dissonance of countries asking people to take personal and professional risks in handing over contacts’ names, while at the same time scarcely supporting those who do, makes tracking the virus a difficult order. “We say we’d like you to quarantine for the good of your neighbors, but in doing so potentially your kids starve and you lose your home,” Mr. Castrucci said. “That’s bad math.” Anna Schaverien and Megan Specia contributed reporting.']","Tracing is seen as a vital tool to avoid lockdowns and open economies, but that requires a robust system, widespread rapid testing and public trust. All are lacking in the West."
"India’s Covid-19 Death Toll Passes 100,000",2020-10-03,By Sameer Yasir,"['SRINAGAR, Kashmir — More than 100,000 people in India have died from the coronavirus, the government said on Saturday, even as officials plan to lift more restrictions in hopes of reviving the crippled economy. India’s health ministry reported 1,069 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the official total to 100,842, though experts say the true toll is probably much higher. Until Saturday, only the United States and Brazil had reported more than 100,000 deaths from the virus. At 6.4 million, India’s official caseload is the second-highest in the world, surpassed only by the United States, which has more than 7.3 million cases. India’s death and infection rates have climbed in recent months, with September alone accounting for more than 40 percent of its cases and about a third of its deaths. The numbers have fallen somewhat since mid-September but remain high. Over the past week, India reported almost twice as many new cases as the United States did. And experts suspect that many Covid-19 fatalities in India have gone unreported. “Actual number of deaths is much higher,” said Dr. Anant Bhan, a health researcher at Yenepoya University in southern India. “But how much higher it is, that is difficult to know.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government imposed a harsh nationwide lockdown in March, a move that many experts say was poorly planned, devastating the economy while failing to stop the virus’s spread. Now, despite the climbing numbers, officials are lifting restrictions in hopes of easing the economic suffering. Cinemas will be allowed to reopen with limited capacity this month, for example, and some states are expected to reopen schools. Dr. Bhan said the reopenings could imperil older Indians and other vulnerable people who have been staying home. Children who return to school are likely to bring the virus home, he said. “The potential for exposure to infection would go up.” Thekkekara Jacob John, a former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said many lives could have been saved if the March lockdown had been handled properly. “Now, today, the economic revival has priority over handling the virus,” Mr. John said.']","Only the United States and Brazil have reported more deaths from the coronavirus. Despite its climbing numbers, India plans to lift more restrictions."
Armenia’s Leader Makes Plea to U.S. as Conflict Rages With Azerbaijan,2020-10-04,By Andrew Higgins,"['When Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, spoke by telephone on Thursday with President Trump’s national security adviser, he raised a delicate issue: Why is nothing being done to stop a longtime United States ally, Turkey, from using American-made F-16 jets against ethnic Armenians in a disputed mountain region? Mr. Pashinyan’s call to the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, followed an eruption of heavy fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a remote territory at the center of the most enduring and venomous of the “frozen conflicts” left by the collapse of the Soviet Union. The breakaway enclave, legally part of Azerbaijan but controlled by Armenians for the past three decades, has seen many military flare-ups over the years. But the current fighting, Mr. Pashinyan said in a telephone interview, has taken on a far more dangerous dimension because of Turkey’s direct military intervention in support of Azerbaijan, its ethnic Turkic ally. On Sunday, news reports said, the forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, exchanged rocket fire, with missiles falling on Azerbaijan’s second largest city, Ganja, and on the Armenian-controlled capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. Each side accused the other of targeting civilians while denying carrying out any attacks itself on residential areas. In a statement Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross denounced “a surge in attacks using heavy explosive weaponry on populated areas,” which it said “is taking a deadly toll on civilians.” It said that hundreds of homes, as well as schools and hospitals, had been destroyed or damaged, forcing families to flee or retreat “underground to unheated basements, sheltering day and night from the violence.” The conflict has set off alarms about the risks of a wider war and put the United States, with its large and politically influential Armenian diaspora, in the uncomfortable position of watching Turkey, a vital NATO ally, deploying F-16 jets in support of Armenia’s enemies. “The United States,” Mr. Pashinyan said in an interview, “needs to explain whether it gave those F-16s to bomb peaceful villages and peaceful populations.” He said that Mr. O’Brien had “heard and acknowledged” his concerns and promised to set up a phone conversation between the Armenian leader and President Trump. That opportunity to rally the United States to Armenia’s side vanished just a few hours later when President Trump announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. But Mr. Trump’s health issues, analysts say, have only accentuated his administration’s disengagement from a conflict that offers no easy diplomatic victories. It has confounded decades of efforts to resolve a dispute that has left Armenians in control of not only Nagorno-Karabakh but large swathes of Azerbaijani territory outside the breakaway enclave. Mr. Pashinyan declined to say whether Armenia might be ready to surrender any occupied Azerbaijani land as part of a possible peace settlement, insisting that this was not up to him but a matter for the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, a nominally independent entity ruled by ethnic Armenians. Turkey said on Sunday that Azerbaijani forces had retaken Jabrail, the latest in a series of villages previously occupied by Armenia now said to be back under Azerbaijani control as a result of fighting over the past week. The claim could not be independently confirmed. The Trump administration, distracted by other bigger issues like China, has “simply not been paying attention and been completely disengaged,” said Thomas de Waal, a British expert on the region and author of a book on Nagorno-Karabakh, “Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War.” For Armenia, Mr. Pashinyan said, the current fighting, which began Sept. 27 after months of rising tensions, poses an “existential threat” because of the role of Turkey, whose precursor, the Ottoman Empire, killed an estimated 1.5 million Armenians at the end of World War I. The U.S. Congress and many countries have declared that slaughter a “genocide,” a label Turkey strenuously rejects. Armenia, too, has selective memories of the past, with Mr. Pashinyan dismissing the worst atrocity of the 1991-1994 Karabakh war — the 1992 killing of hundreds of Azerbaijani civilians by Armenian fighters near the town of Khojaly — as a “pure propaganda trick.” Armenia and Azerbaijan have a long record of playing down or ignoring each other’s past traumas, a tendency that has made it all but impossible for either side to accept legitimate grievances and has frustrated outside efforts to settle their feud over Nagorno-Karabakh. “Each side focuses exclusively on their own traumas and belittles those of the other side,” Mr. De Waal said. “This conflict will go on for at least another generation unless it can be smothered by an international security operation” like the one that tamped down war in the Balkans in the 1990s. That, Mr. de Waal added, “is highly unlikely in the current international situation.” Azerbaijan, Mr. Pashinyan said, has long harbored hopes of recovering Nagorno-Karabakh by force but was “encouraged” by Turkey to launch its recent offensive against the Armenian-controlled enclave. “This is a continuation of the genocidal policies carried out by Turkey against the Armenians,” he said. He accused Turkey of not only providing air support but also recruiting Syrian fighters, whom he called “mercenaries and terrorists,” to strengthen Azerbaijan’s military forces on the ground. Turkey has denied Armenia’s accusations, including unsubstantiated claims that a Turkish F-16 last week shot down an Armenian jet. It has instead attributed the spiraling violence to Armenia, with the foreign ministry in Ankara saying on Sunday that “Armenia is the biggest barrier to peace and stability in the region.” Though obscured by a fog of propaganda by all sides, the conflict has clearly escalated beyond a local ethnic dispute into a bigger struggle as an increasingly assertive Turkey flexes its muscle in a region traditionally dominated by Russia. Russia has a military base in Armenia and, with the United States standing back, Moscow has taken the lead in diplomatic efforts, so far fruitless, to calm the fighting while avoiding a direct confrontation with Turkey, with which it is already fighting proxy wars in Syria and Libya. Describing the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh between Christian Armenia and Muslim Azerbaijan as a “civilizational front line,” Mr. Pashinyan said the dispute “is not about territory” but involves far bigger and more important stakes. “Armenians in the south Caucasus are the last remaining obstacle in the way of Turkish expansion toward the north, the south and the east,” he said.']","Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, said he was promised a call with President Trump over Turkey’s role in the intensifying conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Hopes Fade for New Political Course in Algeria a Year After Popular Uprising,2020-10-04,By Adam Nossiter,"['ALGIERS — In a Moorish-style palace on the Algerian capital’s airy heights, the nation’s president proclaimed a new day for his country, saying it was now “free and democratic.” The old, corrupt system — in which he had spent his entire career — was gone, he insisted. “We’re building a new model here,” said President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 75, chain-smoking a pack of cigarettes in an hourslong interview surrounded by aides in his sumptuous office last month. “I’ve decided to go very far in creating a new politics and a new economy.” But old habits die hard in this North African country, which has known nearly 60 years of repression, military meddling, rigged elections and very little democracy. On the streets below Mr. Tebboune’s office, Algeria’s old realities are reasserting themselves. The state jails dissidents, and seats have been for sale — the going price was about $540,000 according to a parliamentarian’s court testimony — in the same Parliament that ratified Mr. Tebboune’s proposed new Constitution, drafted after he came to power in a disputed election in December. But the opposition is hobbled by a lack of leadership and a failure to articulate an alternative vision for the country. A year after a popular uprising ousted the 20-year autocrat, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and led the army to jail much of his ruling oligarchy, hopes are now fading for an overhaul of the political system and real democracy in Algeria. “We are moving backward fast,” said Mohcine Belabbas, an opposition politician who played a major role in the uprising. Today there are two political narratives in Algeria: the one from Mr. Tebboune, on high, and the one in the streets below. The revolt in the streets that began last year, known here as Hirak, initially appeared to signal a new dawn in a country that had been stifled for decades by its huge military. But when the movement’s failure to coalesce around leaders and agree on goals created a vacuum, the remnants of the repressive Algerian state, with its ample security services, stepped in. Other advocates for change in the Arab world looked on enviously as week after week, tens of thousands turned out peacefully to protest the continued reign of Mr. Bouteflika, who was left paralyzed after a stroke in 2013. It seemed that the abortive Arab Spring that began in late 2010 was finally being realized. Algeria, an insular linchpin in the region, is the world’s 10th biggest producer of natural gas and is believed to have the second largest military establishment in Africa. It has been a key leader of nonaligned nations since it fought its way to independence from France 58 years ago. The military established its pre-eminence in politics shortly after that, and has been at the forefront or just behind it ever since. A civil war with Islamists in the 1990s, in which as many as 100,000 were killed, helped consolidate its grip. Soldiers in uniform are omnipresent in Algiers. But during last year’s demonstrations, Algerian security forces didn’t open fire on the Hirak protesters, the two sides instead staring each other down in a wary standoff. Although the army eventually forced Mr. Bouteflika and his governing elite out of office, that was not enough for the protesters. They demanded a full overhaul of the country’s political class, elections for a new constituent assembly to replace the country’s discredited Parliament, and the army’s definitive withdrawal from politics. They also deemed the army’s push for presidential elections premature. But the army’s all-powerful chief of staff, Ahmed Gaid Salah, overruled the movement. Mr. Tebboune, once an ephemeral prime minister under Mr. Bouteflika, is believed to have been backed for the presidency by Mr. Gaid Salah. He was elected in a vote that opponents said drew less than 10 percent of the electorate; Mr. Tebboune said it was more than 40 percent. He began with a few good-will gestures, releasing some detained protesters. The pandemic stopped the demonstrations in March, and since then the government has played a cat-and-mouse game with Hirak’s remnants, releasing some and arresting others. Dozens have been arrested, according to an opposition group.  The pandemic has dovetailed with the national penchant for insularity, giving Algeria a further excuse to tighten its borders and keep out foreigners. The results are low infection and mortality rates, few mask-wearers and a near-total absence of outsiders on the crumbling streets of central Algiers. The arrest and prosecution of one of the country’s best-known journalists, Khaled Drareni, 40, has hardened the mood in the streets and spread fear in the Algerian news media. The editor of a widely followed website, the Casbah Tribune, and a local correspondent for a French television station, Mr. Drareni covered Hirak with a mix of activism and detachment. “The system renews itself ceaselessly and refuses to change,” he wrote during last year’s uprising. “We call for press freedom. They respond with corruption and money.” That remark infuriated the authorities. On Sept. 15, he was convicted of “endangering national unity” and sentenced to two years in prison. The scene outside the courthouse that day turned ugly. “Khaled Drareni, independent journalist!” demonstrators shouted before the police poured in to disperse them. “Scram!” a muscular plainclothes officer barked at demonstrators. Officers roughly bundled a young woman and an older man into a police van. “He didn’t even have a press card,” the president fumed during the interview, casting Mr. Drareni as an activist with dubious credentials. Mr. Drareni once interviewed Mr. Tebboune himself, though, as well as President Emmanuel Macron of France. Mr. Tebboune insisted on an opposing narrative during the three-and-a-half-hour interview, saying his country was now “free and democratic.” He later made his normally reticent cabinet members available for interviews, and even demanded that the army chief of staff — who is never accessible to the media — agree to be interviewed. “The army is neutral,” growled Gen. Saïd Chengriha, a grizzled veteran of the country’s 1990s civil war with the Islamists. He succeeded General Gaid Salah, who died of a heart attack in December. “How do you want us to be involved in politics? We’re not at all trained in that,” said the general, 75, speaking in the military’s extensive compound in the heights of Algiers. But decades of history are not so easily reversed. The general and the president said they met at least twice a week to discuss the country’s situation, which is increasingly perilous because of a drop in oil prices. Well over 90 percent of the largely desert country’s exports consist of oil and gas, and with a heavy social expenditures bill, Algeria is estimated to need oil at $100 a barrel to balance its budget. The price has been hovering in the 40s. Of one thing Mr. Tebboune is certain: The citizen protest movement is over. “Is there anything left of the Hirak?” he asked dismissively during the interview. He spoke of change, vaunting his new Constitution, which limits a president to two terms and recognizes the rights of the opposition, at least in the eyes of its supporters. But this past week, the government threatened to strip Mr. Belabbas, the opposition politician, of his parliamentary immunity. And for all the talk of a new Algeria, the president employed the old language of the autocrat when he discussed dealing with dissent. “Everyone has the right to free expression —\xa0but only in an orderly manner,” he said. “It’s normal that someone who insults and who attacks the symbols of the state winds up in court.” An Algerian revolt against the French 58 years ago was hampered because of the lack of a clear leader. That resistance to anoint a leader, a tactic to minimize repression, also weakened Hirak. The activists who took a leading role have refused to engage with the deposed leader’s heirs, including the new president. Behind high locked metal gates, watched from the sun-blasted street by plainclothes officers, Mr. Belabbas acknowledged that the protesters were clear about what they were against — the entire Algerian political system — but less so about what should replace it. “We never succeeded in defining what we were for,” said Mr. Belabbas, who is head of the Rally for Culture and Democracy party and a member of Parliament. Caught in the middle are ordinary Algerians — skeptical of Mr. Tebboune’s claims of renewal and of his new Constitution, deflated by the demise of Hirak and angry about the imprisoned Mr. Drareni. “So, there’s a journalist who speaks. You put him in prison. And that’s supposed to be democracy?” asked Isa Mansour, who runs a small clothing store in the working-class neighborhood of Belouizdad, where the Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus grew up 100 years ago. “The citizens are fed up with all these promises,” he said. “You can’t expect reforms from the old guard. Algeria is still looking for democracy.”']","“We are moving backward fast,” said a leading figure in protests last year that ousted the country’s authoritarian ruler."
"Israel’s Coronavirus Lockdown Fuels Protests, Violence and Confusion",2020-10-05,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM —\xa0Fractured by internal political conflicts, confusing instructions and a lack of public trust in the government, Israel seems to be fraying further under a second national lockdown as the country struggles to cope with a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths that, relative to the size of the population, are among the worst in the world. With new daily cases of the coronavirus reaching up to 9,000 recently, here are some of the main factors contributing to the sense of chaos and loss of control. For months, tens of thousands of demonstrators have been calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is standing trial on corruption charges and has been the focus of blame for many Israelis over the country’s handling of the pandemic. Mr. Netanyahu, a polarizing conservative, has portrayed the protesters as left-wing anarchists and has accused them, without evidence, of spreading the virus in mass gatherings outside his Jerusalem residence. After coronavirus regulations were tightened late last month, the government approved temporary restrictions on the demonstrations, confining protests to groups of up to 20 people wearing masks, standing two meters apart, and gathering no farther than a kilometer, or just over half a mile, from their homes. Critics considered the curbs antidemocratic and found ways to fight back. On Saturday night, hundreds of smaller protests took place all over the country, with the largest gatherings shifting to Tel Aviv.  Protest leaders have vowed to continue. Urging Mr. Netanyahu to resign, many have adopted the Hebrew word for “Go!” as a rallying cry. But there has also been an increase in attacks by those who oppose the demonstrations. In television interviews with anti-Netanyahu protesters, a woman said she had been punched in the face in Tel Aviv and a man said he had been left with a broken arm in Pardes Hana-Karkur, in the north. The police were also accused of violence as they detained or dispersed protesters. On Sunday, the police said that they had detained 38 protesters in the Tel Aviv area overnight and that many had been fined for offenses such as not wearing masks, blocking roads or breaching social distancing orders. Ron Huldai, the 76-year-old mayor of Tel Aviv, who had joined the city’s main protest, went home with a bloodied arm. The government had placed the police in an “impossible position” and turned them into “a political tool,” Mr. Huldai said on Israeli television, adding that the scene had been calm and orderly until officers had moved in with force. Preventing large gatherings, especially in Israel’s crowded ultra-Orthodox areas, was always going to be a challenge during the Jewish High Holy Days, which began on Sept. 18 and extend until Oct. 11. Dr. Ronni Gamzu, Israel’s coronavirus czar, said last week that 40 percent of those testing positive came from the ultra-Orthodox community, even though it makes up only about 13 percent of the population. Even so, some Hasidic sects insisted on holding indoor prayers and large gatherings to celebrate Sukkot, the Jewish harvest holiday. Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, 92, a leading ultra-Orthodox authority, tested positive for the virus last week. The police said that they had closed at least 22 synagogues that were operating illegally over the weekend. Stormy confrontations broke out on Sunday in some ultra-Orthodox areas. In the West Bank settlement of Beitar Illit, police officers were shown on video throwing a bucket at and then aggressively dragging away a boy who was accused of throwing a chunk of concrete at a police vehicle. The police said they would investigate the officers’ conduct. In the cities of Bnei Brak and Jerusalem, crowds clashed with the police overnight. Two officers were wounded when objects were thrown at them, the police said on Monday. One rabbi of an extremist ultra-Orthodox branch told his followers not to fear the authorities and to perform all the usual holiday customs. In a less confrontational scene — which drew much online criticism — police officers received a blessing from a Hasidic rabbi after they arrived to ensure compliance with the lockdown. Even Israelis who have tried to adhere to the regulations have found them confusing. Pressured by interest groups, a largely dysfunctional governing coalition made changes in the dead of night, just before the lockdown took effect in September: A 500-meter limit on movement was extended to 1,000 meters (albeit with a copious list of exceptions), and Israelis were told that they could travel abroad but only with tickets purchased before the lockdown. And no one was given authority to enforce the flight rules. The temporary huts traditionally erected for Sukkot — a weeklong Jewish holiday that comes five days after Yom Kippur — were only to be used by members of the same household. But a last-minute change allowed huts with two of their four sides left open to be considered as outdoor space, allowing groups of up to 20 to enter. The large weddings that were blamed for a surge of infections among Israel’s Arab minority over the summer have subsided, after Arab mayors acted to enforce restrictions on large gatherings. There has been a significant decline in new cases among Arab citizens of Israel, part of a broader downward trend in the rate of new infections in the general population, except in the ultra-Orthodox community, according to Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. On Sunday however, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List of predominantly Arab parties and a prominent opposition figure, said he had tested positive for the virus. Just a month ago, Arabs, who make up a fifth of the Israeli population, accounted for about 30 percent of newly infected people. They now only make up about 10 percent of that infection figure, said Aiman Saif, an official working on the response to the virus in the Arab community. Mr. Saif, who called the numbers “encouraging,” attributed the decrease to the general lockdown measures that, among other things, had closed schools. Israel’s governing coalition, led by Mr. Netanyahu in partnership with his defense minister and prime-minister-in-waiting, Benny Gantz, a centrist rival, was formed in May to respond to the pandemic after months of political stalemate. But the government is widely considered a failure. Political differences have prevented a budget from being passed for 2020, and if a deadline in late December is not met, the government will automatically fall and Israelis will be heading back to the polls for the fourth time in two years. The lockdown has only exacerbated the tensions and deepened cracks in the coalition. Asaf Zamir, the tourism minister from Mr. Gantz’s party, resigned on Friday, citing the crackdown on the protests and accusing Mr. Netanyahu of putting his personal interests ahead of the country’s. In a stinging Facebook post, Mr. Zamir wrote that he was unable to serve in a government where he did not “have a shred of trust in the person standing at its head.” “I fear for the country,” he said. “Fear that it is on the edge of absolute rupture.” Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.']","Last month, the country became the first to reimpose nationwide measures. But the decision has led to chaotic scenes and criticism of how its fragile coalition is handling the crisis."
A Black Belgian Student Saw a White Fraternity as His Ticket. It Was His Death.,2020-10-04,By Matt Apuzzo and Steven Erlanger,"['GHENT, Belgium — Sanda Dia saw a fraternity as a doorway into a different life. The son of an immigrant factory worker, he was an ambitious 20-year-old Black student at one of Belgium’s most prestigious universities. The fraternity, Reuzegom, was home to the scions of Antwerp’s white elites. Access to that rarefied world, he decided, was worth enduring the fraternity’s notoriously vicious hazing ritual. He did not survive it. After being forced alongside two other pledges to drink alcohol excessively, chug fish oil until he vomited, swallow live goldfish and stand outside in an ice-filled trench, Mr. Dia died in December 2018 of multiple organ failure. His death was seen as a tragic accident, an example of hazing gone wrong. In recent weeks, however, an even uglier story has emerged. Fraternity members had used a racial slur as they ordered Mr. Dia to clean up after a party. A photo surfaced purporting to show a fraternity member wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. A fraternity speech referenced “our good German friend, Hitler.” A video showed them singing a racist song. And deleted WhatsApp messages, recovered by the police, show fraternity members — the sons of judges, business leaders and politicians — scrambling to cover their tracks. “This was not an accident,” said Mr. Dia’s brother, Seydou De Vel. The details, uncovered recently in a string of local news stories, have forced the nation’s Dutch-speaking region, Flanders, to confront rising racism and xenophobia, even at such renowned universities as this one, the Catholic University of Leuven, now known as K.U. Leuven. Belgian universities, like their American counterparts, are generally seen as left-leaning. But campuses and clubs here have also reflected and fueled the conservatism of Flanders, where a nationalist movement is increasingly openly racist and anti-immigrant —\xa0and growing in power. “They thought, ‘He’s just some Black guy,’” said Sanda’s father, Ousmane Dia, speaking French. “‘We are powerful and nothing can happen to us.’” Eighteen members of the now-disbanded fraternity are under investigation, with prosecutors recommending charges of involuntary manslaughter, degrading treatment and neglect. Those who have not already graduated remain allowed to take classes online while the investigation continues. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Dia was killed intentionally. But of the three students undergoing initiation that night, he was the only one who was Black and the only one who died. Discussions of race in Belgium often focus on its bloody past, rather than its present. Protests this spring, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, forced the removal of some statues commemorating King Leopold II, who oversaw the brutal colonization of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1880s. Mr. Dia’s death, however, highlights Belgium’s current problem with racism and far-right, identitarian politics. The country is divided between French speakers in the south and Dutch speakers in the north, each with their own governments, laws and culture. The wealthier Dutch region, known as Flanders, is home to a sizable separatist movement that wants to break away in the name of preserving Flemish culture and wealth. Lately, that campaign has taken a sharply anti-immigrant and anti-Islam tone. Ousmane Dia, now 51, was unaware of these cultural divisions when he arrived in Belgium from Senegal as an asylum-seeker in 1994. He settled in Antwerp, where he found work at the port and then in a truck factory. He learned Dutch. He and his wife raised a family. An ambitious first-generation Belgian, Sanda thrived in school, his father said. His acceptance to K.U. Leuven was a milestone for father and son alike. “It was a dream for me,” Ousmane Dia said. Sanda was beginning his third year of school when he pledged Reuzegom, an unsanctioned club for young men from Antwerp. “They represent a type of social class,” said Kenny Van Minsel, a former president of the campus student association. “Predominantly white — that’s a given — and predominantly upper-class.” Mr. Van Minsel frequently interacted with fraternities and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Reuzegom to sign a hazing code of conduct. Reuzegom had only one other Black member, who was given the nickname Rafiki, the name of the monkey in the movie “The Lion King,” he said.  But Sanda Dia saw Reuzegom as an opportunity. “It has benefits, being in a club like that,” he had said, his brother recalled. “If you know them, it’s good for your network. And when you leave school, they will trust you a lot faster.” If it sounds peculiar for a Black student to pledge a nearly all-white fraternity in the name of networking, students say it made sense. “It might seem like something outlandish, but for a lot of Black people it’s very understandable,” said Nozizwe Dube, a K.U. Leuven student who immigrated to Belgium from Zimbabwe as a teenager. One of the mantras of Flanders is that anyone can succeed by learning the language, working hard and getting a degree, she said. In reality, research has shown that Belgians of African descent are far more likely to be unemployed or work in low-skilled jobs, despite having high levels of education. Fraternities, she said, can seem like an avenue toward a better career. Reuzegom was notorious for its hazing rituals, known as “baptisms.” In October 2018, Reuzegom held a boozy party in a student association building. The fraternity trashed the venue, causing thousands of dollars’ worth of damage, Mr. Van Minsel said. Fraternity members ordered Mr. Dia to clean up, calling him a racial slur, said Mr. Van Minsel, whose student association colleague was present and reported the incident to him. “Their argument was that Black people should work for white people,” Mr. Van Minsel said. “They treated him like an object.” Two months later, Mr. Dia was dead. Not one of the 18 Reuzegom members under investigation has been named publicly, and their lawyers either did not return phone calls or declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Nearly all information about the membership of the club — it is not an official fraternity, and belongs to no national umbrella body — was scrubbed from the internet after Mr. Dia’s death. To most outsiders Reuzegom was not brazenly white supremacist, students say. But its members lived in an environment where racial slurs were somewhat accepted, if not routine. At parties or bars, it is not uncommon for drunken revelers to burst into song about how the Belgian colonizers severed the hands of millions of Congolese: “Cut off their hands, Congo is ours!” Even professors, when discussing colonialism, sometimes said things like, “There are many wonderful things that Belgium did in the Congo,” Ms. Dube said. “No one around you looks up in shock. It’s the norm.” “A typical Flemish sentence begins, ‘I’m not racist, but. …,’ ” Mr. Van Minsel said. “I grew up with those sentences.” For most of Belgium’s history Flanders was the poorer region, neglected by the French-speaking elite. This gave rise to the Flemish movement, which fought to have its language and identity recognized. The past half-century has seen Flanders become the nation’s economic powerhouse, but preserving Flemish culture remains a bedrock of politics. Flanders is not a political monolith, with parties on the right and left holding seats in the local parliament. But in recent years identity politics have taken a particularly anti-immigrant turn, with the revival of the far-right party Vlaams Belang and its slogan “Our People First.” The party recently held a huge protest in Brussels, where Nazi symbols were spotted on some cars. The details of the Reuzegom “baptism” are shocking, even in a culture of cruelty. On the evening of Dec. 4, 2018, the hazing began with Mr. Dia and two other pledges forced to drink until they passed out. Investigators would later discover a video showing fraternity brothers urinating on them, according to media reports that have been confirmed by The New York Times. The following morning, it was off to a cabin in the woodsy town of Vorselaar, outside Antwerp. The pledges were forced to dig a ditch and stand in it as it was filled with ice and water. They were made to bite the heads off live mice, swallow whole goldfish and chug fish oil. One by one, they were let out of the pit, but Mr. Dia was kept in the ice the longest that December night. After the other pledges dragged him out, photos show him lying in the fetal position on the grass, according to local press accounts confirmed by The Times. Almost immediately after Mr. Dia’s death, Reuzegom members began deleting text messages, removing Facebook and Instagram profiles and hurriedly cleaning the cabin and Mr. Dia’s room on campus. “Everything clean,” an investigator wrote when he arrived at the cabin, according to notes viewed by the newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. As part of the investigation, the police recovered WhatsApp messages, videos and photos. Among them: a video of Reuzegom members singing “Congo is ours” to a homeless Black man soon after Mr. Dia’s death. Mr. Dia’s father and brother absorbed such details very differently, a sign of how attitudes have changed in recent years. “It didn’t shock me,” said Mr. De Vel, the brother. “It shocked me,” his father interjected. “We’re another generation. I grew up in all of this,” said Mr. De Vel, 31. He described learning to laugh off racist comments. “You let them say it, because deep down, you really hope that they’re not like that.” The school never suspended the Reuzegom members, ordering them instead to write a paper on the history of hazing and do 30 hours of community work. Ousmane Dia is particularly bitter about the actions of the school’s rector, Luc Sels, whose only contact with the family was when he offered brief condolences at Sanda’s funeral. Mr. Sels has said he would have responded differently if he had known all the facts, and that he feared prejudging the investigation. A university spokeswoman, Sigrid Somers, said the school had only recently won access to the investigative file, and that it had banned the students from campus buildings. Ousmane Dia has heard the explanations — that the fraternity was independent, that the school did not have all the information, that investigations take time. But after nearly two years, he said, he does not know the answer to one question: “What would have happened if Sanda were white?” Koba Ryckewaert and Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.']",Sanda Dia’s death after an initiation ritual was regarded as a tragic accident. Newly released videos and photos have made it a symbol of growing intolerance.
Mike Pompeo cuts visits to South Korea and Mongolia from his Asia trip.,2020-10-04,By Austin Ramzy,"['As President Trump remains hospitalized with Covid-19, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will cut short a trip to Asia this week, canceling stops in South Korea and Mongolia but continuing with a visit to Japan. From Sunday through Tuesday he will be in Tokyo, where he will participate in a meeting of foreign ministers from Australia, India and Japan to discuss the pandemic and other issues. “Secretary Pompeo expects to be traveling to Asia again in October and will work to reschedule visits on that trip, that is now just a few weeks off,” a State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said in a brief written statement Saturday. She did not specify why the schedule had been changed. Mr. Pompeo earlier alluded to the possibility of curtailing his Asia visit because of the novel coronavirus infections in the president’s circle. “If we can’t — if have to postpone a trip or cancel something, we’ll figure out how to get it back on the schedule,” he told reporters on Friday. “But I’m hopeful we can at least make sure we get to Asia for sure — some important things, but we’ll see.

‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ May Not Work in a Time of Pandemic,2020-10-04,By Peter S. Goodman,"['LONDON — During a recent visit to a private London hospital, I was horrified to encounter a delivery man wheeling in a load of supplies without wearing a face mask. An orderly in blue scrubs stood inside the elevator, three feet from me, with his mask draped around his chin. The scene at the hospital may present an especially shocking example of the casual way in which many people in London continue to confront a pandemic that has killed more than 57,000 Britons, but it is hardly unusual. Coronavirus cases are again increasing rapidly, yet shoppers routinely wander the aisles of the supermarket in our North London neighborhood, Hampstead, without wearing masks. Cafes and pubs are full of people hoisting drinks in proximity. When I asked the proprietor of our local indoor fruit and vegetable market why, despite regulations mandating masks, he was allowing unlimited numbers of people to enter his narrow premises absent protection, he gruffly waved me away. “We’re not the police,” he said. Every morning, I take my children to school on the public bus, where the 14-passenger limit is routinely breached along with face mask rules. We angle for a spot near an open window. At our international school, the children must wear masks. But as I walk home through the leafy streets, I see children and parents chatting jovially without masks as they await the opening of their school gates. They look like people lining up to board the Titanic. Beyond the obvious ways that this cavalier behavior is disconcerting, it has enhanced a widely shared sense that Britain — famously rule-abiding — is now operating without adult supervision. Public confidence has plummeted, with more than half of respondents in a recent survey declaring the government has botched its handling of the pandemic, up from 39 percent in May. The modern Britain that we learn about in history lessons supposedly displayed its truest character during World War II, when Winston Churchill exhorted the nation to persevere in the face of the Blitz, the relentless German bombing campaign. People pulled together and endured in a collective effort whose inconveniences and indignities were borne as the cost of defeating the enemy. “The government issued thirty-five million gas masks to civilians, who carried them to work and church, and kept them at their bedsides,” writes Erik Larson in his history of the Blitz, “The Splendid and the Vile.” “Strict blackout rules so darkened the streets of the city that it became nearly impossible to recognize a visitor at a train station after dark.” How did that society turn into this one? Or is society more or less the same, while the nature of the menace has changed, triggering a different response? People with long memories counsel against using romanticized depictions of the past as jumping off points for lamenting supposed decline. “To quote a Russian proverb, ‘It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t true anyway,’” said Timothy Garton Ash, a European historian at the University of Oxford. “If you look at the real history of the Blitz, it wasn’t that wonderful national stereotype of people with bowler hats and rolled umbrellas patiently waiting in queues for cups of tea.” Not everyone was so cooperative or resigned, he said, with differences in discipline from place to place. The current crisis seems exacerbated by an offshoot of the very virtue celebrated in the conventional historical narrative — an admirable refusal to bend. The national mantra, “keep calm and carry on,” seems to have been reconfigured into the misguided notion that nothing is amiss. “There is a sense of bravado, and not being a wimp about illness, and you can just soldier through it,” said Selma Dabbagh, a British-Palestinian novelist who lives in North London. “There is this idea of, ‘Don’t be a wuss, man up, get on with it.’” Preventing transmission of the virus requires behavior that feels rude: not holding doors for fear of getting too close to other people; wearing masks that obscure smiles; avoiding unnecessary interactions. This feels more poignant in England, given the degree to which social discourse is governed by manners and ritual. Forgoing small talk with the butcher feels uncomfortable. Other cultural features may protect the populace. “England is the only place I know where the better people know each other, the less physical contact they have,” Mr. Garton Ash said. But that sense of remove may make it even harder for people here to follow the strictures imposed to halt the virus. In what amounts to both a stereotype and an observable truth, many English people require the aid of lubrication to bond with others. This means that closing pubs amounts to a revocation of basic human connection. When my family moved to London from New York in 2016, we were immediately struck by how tightly regulated everything seemed to be. In place of the crumbling New York subway, we encountered well-functioning facilities overseen by uniformed people who were pleasantly available for counsel. The post office was not an ordeal. Heathrow Airport was a marvel of efficiency. Competent people appeared to be in charge. The first alteration to this impression came courtesy of Brexit, Britain’s bewildering, torturous (and continuing!) abandonment of the European Union. In the face of warnings from business groups that Brexit amounted to an elaborate act of self harm, and despite an entirely anticipated slowdown in the economy, the political class carried on, tangling itself in arcane parliamentary procedure, while never fully resolving the question of what comes next. The word “shambolic” got a heavy workout. The experience divided the country into two warring tribes — Leavers and Remainers — a polarized state in which facts relating to nearly any subject, from health care to foreign policy, were reduced to props in arguments over Brexit. This legacy of distrust endured as the pandemic emerged in Britain, now led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose predilection for stagecraft over substance frequently draws comparisons to President Trump. Mr. Johnson first made light of the coronavirus. On the same day in March that the government’s top scientists urged the public to stop shaking hands, the prime minister gleefully told reporters that he had visited a hospital treating Covid patients, “and I shook hands with everybody.” Then, Mr. Johnson himself contracted the virus, a serious case that required intensive care at a London hospital. When he emerged, he presented himself as a modern-day Churchill rallying the nation against a lethal menace. But his policies have been widely pilloried as inconsistent and behind the curve. Rules on wearing masks did not come until late July. Schools and playgrounds remained closed as pubs reopened. With cases rising, Mr. Johnson recently ordered that pubs close at 10 p.m., but he initially exempted the drinking establishments that serve Parliament. My family reluctantly canceled our daughter’s 8th birthday party — an outdoor get-together with a half-dozen kids from school — because of new prohibitions against gatherings larger than six. That would seem a legitimate sacrifice, were it not for the fact that we could legally expose ourselves to scores of strangers inside a restaurant. One event yielded profound cynicism: the brazen flouting of the lockdown by Mr. Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who was caught driving more than 200 miles to visit his parents during the worst of the pandemic, followed by a journey to a scenic country town. His elaborate and evolving explanations — one centered on using the drive as a chance to test his eyesight — were widely dismissed as preposterous. Despite strident calls for his resignation, Mr. Cummings remained, supported by Mr. Johnson. It was as if Mr. Churchill’s right-hand man had been caught hosting a barbecue during a nighttime German bombing raid, flipping on the lights to illuminate the garden. The results of all this — the sense of hypocrisy, the confusion, the muddled messages — may account for why many people are flouting the rules. “This is a time when you really need government to step up and be very clear with its messaging,” said Ms. Dabbagh, the novelist. ”I think people would respond to messages if they were clear. Now, it’s all being pushed onto the individual to make these decisions.”']","Eighty years after Londoners rallied in the face of the deadly German Blitz, many are flouting the rules aimed at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus."
‘Then I Heard a Boom’: Heavy Weapons Take Toll on Civilians in Armenia-Azerbaijan Clash,2020-10-05,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Ruzanna Avagyana, a 53-year-old social worker from the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, was taking stock Monday of the region’s rapidly escalating military conflict with Azerbaijan from inside her basement. The fighting, the worst in Nagorno-Karabakh since a vicious ethnic war erupted in the region in the early 1990s, began a week ago and drove Ms. Avagyana underground. She counted a half-dozen or so explosions in each of the first days she hid out in the basement, more on Sunday and so many on Monday she could hardly keep track. Then the apartment building on top of her took a direct hit. “People are afraid,” Ms. Avagyana said in a telephone interview. “I heard whistling this way and that,” she said, recalling the artillery strikes on her city, Stepanakert, earlier in the day. “I couldn’t understand where they were falling. And then I heard a boom.” As her building burned, she escaped unharmed, Ms. Avagyana said. Skirmishes have been common for years along the front lines of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is run by ethnic Armenian separatists but internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. But this conflict is distinct, analysts and former diplomats say, for the more direct support that Turkey has offered to Azerbaijan and for the scale of the fighting. Both sides have been using armed drones and powerful, long-range rocket artillery, they say. Turkey has denied offering anything more than training, weapons sales and political support to Azerbaijan. Stepanakert, once a city of well-tended boulevards and stately stone homes, is now scattered with the ruins of bombarded buildings. On Monday, it came under heavy bombardment for a second day, Armenia’s military said. On the Azerbaijani side, the authorities said rockets had landed in a residential area of Ganja, the country’s second-largest city. At least 250 people have died in the recent fighting, including dozens of civilians on both sides, according to official reports. The long-range artillery fire of the type that destroyed Ms. Avagyana’s apartment building, which she said was across a street from a military headquarters and thus in a vulnerable location, has alarmed observers and former diplomats. The weapons raise the risks of a direct conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, two former Soviet states divided by a poisonous and long-running ethnic dispute and competing claims to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. So far, the fighting along the front has been muddled and inconclusive; reports from both sides are impossible to independently verify. Azerbaijan has reported capturing, and then recapturing again, several villages in seesaw fighting over small strips of land. Those accounts have been denied by Armenia, which has accused the other side of targeting civilians and Turkey of shooting down one of its planes. Both countries have in the past threatened to target strategic infrastructure with long-range weapons, raising worries that the conflict may intensify. Over the weekend and on Monday, both sides fired large-caliber, Russian-made rockets of a type known as Smerch, or Tornado, saying they were aiming for military targets. Russia has for decades sold the same weapons systems to both parties to the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh vowed to fire back into Azerbaijan to retaliate for its shelling of Stepanakert.  “We are not targeting the civilian population but military facilities permanently deployed in large cities,” Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for the enclave’s president, told the Armenian news agency Arka. He said civilians should leave their homes to escape harm. Rockets had already landed in Ganja, Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, on Sunday. Nagorno-Karabakh said it had fired at the city’s military airport, but photographs published in Azerbaijani media showed demolished houses. A Russian television channel posted pictures of a Smerch rocket that did not explode sticking out of a parking lot of an Azerbaijani hydroelectric station at a jaunty angle, suggesting the targeting of strategic infrastructure. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of firing the rockets from its territory, rather than from the disputed enclave, and said it was a tactic intended to provoke a retaliation that might trigger Armenia’s mutual defense pact with Russia. Armenia denied the charge. The cause of the fighting is disputed. Azerbaijan said it responded to artillery fire across the frontline on Sept. 27. Armenia said the Azerbaijani offensive was unprovoked. Armenia has said it is open to negotiating a cease-fire. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, on Sunday told Al Arabiya television in an interview that the offensive would continue until Armenia withdrew support for the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave — something that is highly unlikely to happen. “They must give us a timetable, or withdraw from the occupied territories,” Mr. Aliyev said. “Their prime minister who said ‘Karabakh is Armenia’ should now say that ‘Karabakh is not Armenia’ and after that, of course, we will be ready to put an end to hostility.” Negotiating a cease-fire now will be harder than it was during a previous escalation in 2016, said Olesya Vartanyan, a Caucasus analyst with the International Crisis Group, because Azerbaijan felt misled by that settlement. After the 2016 escalation, Russia brokered a truce with an assurance to return to Azerbaijan some territory occupied by ethnic Armenians in the 1990s fighting, but that never happened. “Even if Moscow calls on Baku to stop fighting, they have nothing to propose” now because the earlier promises never panned out, Ms. Vartanyan said, referring to the Azerbaijani government in the capital, Baku. The bombardments suggest that a wider conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is possible, said Carey Cavanaugh, a former American ambassador and mediator in previous peace talks. “We can see in Syria how fragile cities can be” in artillery barrages, he said. Wider fallout from the fighting may also be looming. If Armenia targets oil and natural gas pipelines in Azerbaijan, neighboring Georgia could lose fuel just as winter sets in, Mr. Cavanaugh said. There is also the risk of a coronavirus outbreak as troops hunker down in trenches and bunkers, he said. A deadly flu virus spread under such conditions in World War I. And prolonged shelling could result in a flow of refugees as civilians flee the fighting, Mr. Cavanaugh said. Ms. Avagyana has already left. Moments after the explosion rocked her building Monday, the people huddling in the basement rushed out, she said. Smoke was billowing from a top floor. She left Stepanakert later in the day, driving past a grocery store in flames and another apartment building with a gaping hole in it. Water from broken pipes was pouring through the ruined block, she said. Though it is one of six unrecognized splinter states of the former Soviet Union, which are typically rundown places, Stepanakert had in recent years become a remarkably well- developed city. Money had poured in from the Armenian diaspora in the United States, France and Russia to help construct well-paved roads and presentable municipal buildings. Seeing the city after the bombardments, Ms. Avagyana said, “was very painful.”']","Stepanakert, the capital of the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under bombardment on Monday as both sides used powerful, long-range weapons."
"Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, has the virus.",2020-10-03,By Maria Cramer,"['Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who for several days this week helped the president prepare for the debate, said he has tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Christie said Saturday that he would be receiving medical attention the same day. “I just received word that I am positive for COVID-19,” Mr. Christie said on Twitter. “I want to thank all of my friends and colleagues who have reached out to ask how I was feeling in the last day or two.” Mr. Christie was one of several advisers who huddled with President Trump and others for debate preparation from Sunday to Tuesday. Mr. Christie also attended a White House event on Sept. 26 for Judge Amy Coney Barrett in the Rose Garden. The debate preparation team included Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump’s his closest advisers, Stephen Miller, the president’s speechwriter and top domestic policy adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer and the former mayor of New York. None of them wore masks, Mr. Christie said.

"The White House outbreak grows as Kayleigh McEnany, the press secretary, tests positive for the virus.",2020-10-05,"By Michael Crowley, Maggie Haberman and Eileen Sullivan","['The coronavirus outbreak in the West Wing continued to spread on Monday, as the White House press secretary and two of her deputies joined the list of aides close to President Trump who have tested positive for the virus, heightening fears that more cases are still to come.  The press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, announced on Twitter that she had tested positive and would be quarantining. Ms. McEnany said she had previously tested negative several times, “including every day since Thursday,” but health experts said she may have been infectious for days — including when she spoke briefly to reporters without a mask outside the White House on Sunday. Two other members of the press team, Karoline Leavitt and Chad Gilmartin, who is Ms. McEnany’s relative, also tested positive — but learned about their status before Ms. McEnany, according to two people familiar with the diagnoses. The revelations came amid many unanswered questions about whether Mr. Trump could relocate to the White House without endangering himself and others and suggested that the White House does not have control of the virus.  Vice President Mike Pence, who tested negative on Sunday, was scheduled to travel to Utah ahead of Wednesday night’s vice-presidential debate. Mr. Pence also plans to attend campaign events in Arizona and Florida this week before stopping in his home state of Indiana to vote early.  His doctor said in a statement on Friday that Mr. Pence was not quarantining because, as of that time, he had not been close enough to any individuals known to have the coronavirus for long enough to qualify as “a close contact” at high risk of infection.']",
Killer in Canada Who Dismembered Rich Relative Gets 10-Year Sentence,2020-10-05,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — It was a quiet Saturday in 2015 in one of Vancouver’s wealthiest enclaves, when a Chinese immigrant told police he snapped. He shot dead his bullying, philandering relative outside the victim’s $6 million hillside mansion. Then he chopped the body into 108 pieces. On Monday, Judge Terence Schultes of the Supreme Court of British Columbia sentenced Zhao Li, now 60, to 10 years and six months in prison after his conviction for manslaughter and interfering with human remains. In January, the judge surprised Canadian legal experts when he ruled that Mr. Zhao was not guilty of murder. Under Canadian law, he could have been sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. Mr. Zhao had been in custody for more than five years after killing Yuan Gang, his business partner and a family member. With each day in custody counting as 1.5 days toward his sentence, Mr. Zhao has two years, four months and eight days left to serve, the judge said. Chris Johnson, a lawyer who represented the estate of Mr. Yuan, called the lurid case, which generated headlines in Canada and China, a cautionary tale about revenge and the corruptibility of money. “This offense was particularly shocking to Canadians because of the brazen nature of the crime, in broad daylight in one of Vancouver’s wealthiest neighborhoods,” he said. “The method of the killing was brutal.” Justice Schultes on Monday noted the violence of the crime, and observed that the dismemberment of the body was “unquestionably bizarre,” adding that its “clinical dispassion” and “coldness” were “very morally blameworthy.” He said his sentence was predicated on Mr. Zhao’s not having a criminal record and the remorse he had shown. When announcing the verdict in January, the judge said that while the crime was gruesome, he had been left with reasonable doubt over whether Mr. Zhao intended to kill Mr. Yuan. Intent to kill  is the prerequisite for a murder verdict in Canada. The trial, which took place in front of a judge rather than a jury, as agreed to by both the defense and the prosecution, shined a spotlight on how Vancouver has become host to rich foreigners, who use it as a sanctuary for cash and kin. In the case of Mr. Yuan, he had been ensnared in a corruption scandal in China before gaining permanent residency in Canada. The case presented two contrasting narratives. In the first, Mr. Zhao, whose wife was Mr. Yuan’s cousin, was characterized by the defense as a meek and law-abiding man who exploded when Mr. Yuan asked to marry his daughter. But prosecutors portrayed Mr. Zhao as a vengeful and violent aggressor. He cut up the body with an electric hand saw and concealed the right arm in a meat freezer in the garage at the mansion. Apart from its grisly nature, the case riveted Canadians because of the lavish lifestyle of the victim. At the mansion where he was shot, in a rarefied mountainside neighborhood, he had installed a stuffed black panther posing on a rock in its grand entrance. He also bought a stately 10-bedroom Tudor revival home, valued at about $13 million, in another exclusive area. Mr. Yuan owned a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce, as well as a private island and a yacht. He bought 48 parcels of land in Saskatchewan, valued at about $6 million, which Mr. Zhao managed. The case also attracted attention because of its colorful cast of characters. Among them was Mr. Zhao’s daughter, Florence Zhao, a fashion designer known as “Flo-Z,” who appeared in a popular reality show on YouTube, “Ultra Rich Asian Girls.” which showcased Vancouver’s wealthy second-generation Chinese.  During the sentencing, Justice Schultes recalled that Mr. Zhao’s father was imprisoned by the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution, consigning the son to a childhood of hardship and poverty. The judge also noted that Mr. Zhao had disapproved of Mr. Yuan’s mistreatment of his girlfriends — estimated at as many as 100 — according to testimony in a separate civil case. On May 2, 2015, Mr. Yuan told Mr. Zhao that he wanted to marry Florence, the court heard. Mr. Zhao became irate. He called Mr. Yuan “worse than a pig or a dog,” and then shot him twice with a licensed rifle after, he said, Mr. Yuan tried to harm him with a hammer. Then he began to chop up the body, and wash away evidence of blood from the crime scene. In the aftermath of the killing, seven women from China claimed that their children had been fathered by Mr. Yuan and deserved part of his $21 million estate. A Canadian judge ruled that five were entitled to split Mr. Yuan’s possessions. Mr. Johnson said Mr. Yuan’s family was disappointed in the Canadian justice system, believing that Mr. Zhao had “gotten away with murder.”']","Zhao Li shot his business partner outside a Vancouver mansion, and then chopped him into 108 pieces."
The Pressure to Be Perfect Turns Deadly for Celebrities in Japan,2020-10-05,By Motoko Rich and Hikari Hida,"['TOKYO — From the outside, Yuko Takeuchi seemed to have a golden life. She had won Japan’s top acting award three times and had recently given birth to her second child. A graceful beauty, she appeared in a box-office favorite last year and advertisements for a top ramen brand. Ms. Takeuchi, 40, died late last month, apparently in a suicide. No one can fully know what private torment might have lurked beneath the surface, but in a Japanese society that values “gaman” — endurance or self-denial — many feel pressure to hide their personal struggles. The burden is compounded for celebrities whose professional success depends on projecting a flawless ideal. Ms. Takeuchi is the latest in a succession of Japanese film and television stars who have taken their own lives this year. Her death came less than two weeks after the suicide of another actress, Sei Ashina, 36, and two months after Haruma Miura, 30, a popular television actor, was found dead in his home, leaving a suicide note. Earlier this year, Hana Kimura, a professional wrestler and star of “Terrace House,” a reality show, took her own life after relentless bullying on social media. Aside from Ms. Kimura, none of the other celebrities who died in suicides had shown any public signs of emotional distress. Their deaths have been echoed by an alarming rise in suicides within Japan’s general public during the coronavirus pandemic, after a decade of hard-won decline from some of the highest rates in the world. The authorities reported a nearly 16 percent increase in suicides in August compared with a year earlier, with the number spiking by 74 percent among teenage girls and women in their 20s and 30s. “As a society, we feel like we cannot show our weaknesses, that we must hold all of it in,” said Yasuyuki Shimizu, director of the Japan Suicide Countermeasures Promotion Center. “It’s not just that people feel like they can’t go to a counselor or a therapist, but many feel like they cannot even show their weaknesses to the people they are close to.” The reasons for any individual suicide are complex. And many of the strains felt by the Japanese are universal: They, like many others, feel the ruthless demands of social media, where people feel they must cultivate a narrative of eternal success and happiness. “This can definitely be a cause for spiraling into a depression” if your reality does not match someone else’s curated portrait, Mr. Shimizu said. Even away from social media, the Japanese tend to project a positive public front. There is a strict division between “uchi” (the home or inside) and “soto” (outside), with emotions — particularly messy ones — restricted to the private sphere. People also feel that they must conform to rules and not stand out in ways that could be perceived as burdening others. During the pandemic, this social tendency has actually helped the country avoid a surge in cases and deaths, because the public followed suggestions about wearing masks, avoiding crowded indoor venues, and practicing good hygiene and social distancing without the imposition of a strict lockdown. “So in this sense, a not-so-great quality was an advantage,” said Toshihiko Matsumoto, director of the drug addiction center at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health. “However, this also means that in terms of mental health, people don’t want to seek help and stick out from the crowd.” Yet help is exactly what many people have needed during the pandemic: Some have lost work or experienced drastic changes in their jobs, while many others have been unable to spend time with friends or have been cut off from visiting extended family. Women, especially, have been thrown into stressful situations. During the period when schools were closed and many employees worked from home, families were crammed together in small homes. While some men who have suddenly spent more time at home have pitched in on housework and child care, others have still left the bulk of it to their wives. “There are women at home with husbands working at home, and this can be very suffocating for the women,” Dr. Matsumoto said. In the 1990s, after a devastating economic recession caused hundreds of thousands of layoffs, suicides in Japan began to rise dramatically as mostly middle-aged men took their lives out of the shame and stress of sudden unemployment. Now strains have been growing on women, an increasing proportion of whom are juggling work and home life. The stress may be translating into more suicides among women, said Junko Kitanaka, a medical anthropologist at Keio University. For celebrities, the normal societal pressures can be magnified by the expectations of millions of fans. And unlike in the United States, where celebrities now talk more openly about seeking out psychological help, such behavior is largely taboo in Japan, which has been slower to develop mental health services, despite some improvement. “If you are a person in the spotlight and the media finds out that you are receiving mental health support, that would play badly for you and your career,” said Tamaki Tsuda, a television producer. “If you go out once for mental illness, that’s the image that will be tacked on to your brand forever. And when that happens, fewer and fewer job offers will come in.” The pandemic has been particularly tough for those in show business, as television and film production has been suspended or altered because of virus protection protocols. “People in the entertainment industry lost their gigs in an instant when the coronavirus hit, so it’s been an extreme blow,” Ms. Tsuda said. “A lot of these actors were given blank schedules over the past few months from their management companies.” Even a temporary halt in work can fuel insecurity about losing out to a new crop of performers waiting to be minted as the latest stars. “Unfortunately, with the Japanese mentality, we have the tendency to blame ourselves,” said Hiromichi Shizume, another television producer. The entertainers think “‘maybe I’m not getting hired because I’m not good enough.’” Still, public sympathy can be limited, with stars quickly criticized for any behavior that fans deem insufficiently grateful for their celebrity. Even in death, Ms. Takeuchi, an award-winning actress, has been subjected to condemnation, including references to her wealth and material comfort. “Yuko Takeuchi, I cannot believe that you would be so irresponsible as to have a child, then commit suicide only a few months later,” one person wrote on Twitter. “The rent of Yuko Takeuchi’s apartment cost 1.85 million yen,” or about $17,600, another posted. “Does this mean that money can’t make us happy?” At a news conference the day after her death, Katsunobu Kato, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, said he was concerned that reports of the celebrity suicides themselves might prompt others to take their lives. “In order for people not to feel isolated with their own worries, we must work together to build a society where we can warmly support and watch over each other,” he said. Experts on suicide said they were wary of vague government promises. “They say we should create a society where nobody feels lonely,” said Michiko Ueda, a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo who has researched suicide. “But as is typical with any Japanese government plan, there is no concrete plan.” She added: “We can’t change society in one day.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. In Japan, call TELL Lifeline at 03-5774-0992 or go to telljp.com/lifeline/.']",A succession of suicides has shown the burdens of a society where many feel that they must conceal their personal struggles.
"On Capitol Hill, the prospects for a stimulus deal before the election remain murky.",2020-10-05,By Lauren Hirsch,"['Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that President Trump’s positive test for coronavirus “changes the dynamic of stimulus talks.” But developments since suggest that the sides are still far apart on negotiating a new pandemic aid package, according to today’s DealBook newsletter. Those pushing hard for a bill include the White House. Mr. Trump tweeted from the hospital on Saturday that the country “wants and needs” more stimulus. For Mr. Trump, a deal would serve as a sign of his authority, taking attention away from his health and unfavorable polls. Congressional leaders, though, are still haggling. When asked Sunday whether Mr. Trump’s comments meant the two parties were closer to a deal, Ms. Pelosi demurred: “No, it means that we want to see that they will agree on what we need to do to crush the virus so that we can open the economy and open our schools safely.” She said that the parties were “making progress” toward a deal, but with Mr. Biden ahead in the polls, Democrats may feel they have the upper hand in negotiations. On the Senate side, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is balancing competing interests among his Republican colleagues — some want a deal to bring home to constituents and others are worried about approving another large spending deal. Adding to the difficulties, the Senate has delayed its next sitting until Oct. 19, to account for positive coronavirus tests among Republican members. Hanging in the balance are jobs and the economy. The longer people are out of the work, the harder it is for them to come back, suggesting that we may be entering the slow, grinding phase of a recovery that could tip into recession. There are still about twice as many people out of work now than before the pandemic, and without aid akin to what was in the first stimulus bill, weaker consumer spending, missed rent payments and other factors could ripple through the economy and the financial system.

"In Canada, Kamala Harris, a Disco-Dancing Teenager, Yearned for Home",2020-10-05,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — There were heirs to Canadian fortunes who lived in hillside mansions and arrived at their high school in luxury cars. There were children of Caribbean immigrants who commuted by bus or subway from a historically Black neighborhood. There were Anglophones, Francophones and kids from Chinatown. And then there was Kamala Harris, an extroverted American teenager who had moved to Montreal from California at age 12, dreamed of becoming a lawyer and liked dancing to Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. Thrown into one of Montreal’s most diverse public high schools, the young Ms. Harris — whose father was from Jamaica and mother from India — identified as African-American, her friends from high school recalled. At the same time, they said, she deftly navigated the competing racial and social divisions at the school. “In high school, you were either in the white or the Black group,” said Wanda Kagan, her best friend from Westmount High School, who had a white mother and an African-American father. “We didn’t fit exactly into either, so we made ourselves fit into both.” The future senator spent her formative adolescent years in a multicultural environment typical of many Canadian public schools. As she makes history as the first woman of color on a presidential ticket, Canadians have claimed her as a native daughter, seeing her as an embodiment of the country’s progressive politics. “Joe Biden’s new running mate, Kamala Harris, is a Westmount High graduate,” gushed the CBC, the Canadian national broadcaster. Such is the Kamala mania here that the school has designated an official to field media calls, which have come from across Canada as well as Latin America and Japan. Some also have a sense that if her ticket wins, it could mend Canada’s fraught ties with a once dependable ally. “She got educated in her earliest years through a Canadian lens and that was bound to have rubbed off,” said Bruce Heyman, a former ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama. Ms. Harris came to Montreal with her sister, Maya, and her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a breast cancer researcher who was divorced from the girls’ father, an eminent economist, and moved the family to pursue her career. Ms. Harris, who was born in 1964, has downplayed her time in Canada amid a racist misinformation campaign that she was not born American. She declined to comment for this article. But in her memoir, “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,” she described the culture shock of the move. “I was 12 years old, and the thought of moving away from sunny California in February, in the middle of the school year, to a French-speaking foreign city covered in 12 feet of snow was distressing,” she wrote. “My mother tried to make it sound like an adventure, taking us to buy our first down jackets and mittens, as though we were going to be explorers of the great northern winter,” she wrote. “But it was hard for me to see it that way.” Her mother initially sent the sisters to a Francophone school. It was a tumultuous time in Quebec, with an ascendant nationalist party and culture wars over language. “I used to joke that I felt like a duck, because all day long at our new school I’d be saying, ‘Quoi? Quoi? Quoi?’” — What? What? What? — Ms. Harris wrote in her memoir. At age 13, childhood friends said, Kamala mobilized local children to demonstrate in front of their apartment building because the owner had banned children from playing on the lawn. He backed down. Eventually the family settled on the top floor of a spacious Victorian home in an affluent neighborhood bordering Westmount, one of Canada’s wealthiest districts. “It was a comfortable home, with high ceilings, hardwood floors, Persian carpets,” recalled Ms. Kagan, who first met Ms. Harris in eighth grade and lived with her family for a time to escape an abusive stepfather. In September, Ms. Harris wrote a tweet about her friend’s abuse, saying, “One of the reasons I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her.” Westmount High, which counts Leonard Cohen among its alumni, was founded in 1874. Its catchment included not only the moneyed Westmount municipality, but also Little Burgundy — once known as “the Harlem of the North” — whose Black churches, Black community center and storied jazz clubs made it a center for Black culture. The school was roughly 60 percent white and 40 percent Black in 1978 to 1981, when Ms. Harris attended it, said Garvin Jeffers, a former principal who then led the math department. Still, Ms. Kagan said the school’s divisions “were more about who had the latest Jordache jeans than about race.” Ms. Harris straddled the school’s diverse worlds, her friends said. Hugh Kwok, the child of Chinese immigrants, can be seen in a 1981 yearbook photo with Ms. Harris’s arm leaning on his shoulder. Ms. Harris, he said, “melted in with everyone.” Anu Chopra Sharma, who was in Ms. Harris’s French and math classes, recalled the two bonding over having Indian names. “She said to me, ‘You have an Indian name but you don’t look Indian,’ and I said the same to her,” she said. “You couldn’t easily label her,” Ms. Sharma added. Although Ms. Harris mingled widely, Ms. Kagan said “she identified as being African-American.” She found belonging in the Black community, and “was drawn to the Little Burgundy kids.” She recalled that she and Ms. Harris attended Black community dance parties and griped about having to be home by 11 p.m. Above all, she found sisterhood in an all-female dance troupe, Super Six, later Midnight Magic. The girls wore glittering homemade costumes and performed aerobically charged disco moves in front of the school and at homes for the elderly. Ms. Harris was called Angel. Ms. Kagan said she and Ms. Harris spent long hours rehearsing, inspired by “Solid Gold,” a 1980s pop music television show featuring performers lip-syncing, surrounded by writhing dancers in shiny Lycra. “We were six girls with big personalities who were every shade of brown and Black, and Kamala could hold her own on the dance floor,” Ms. Kagan said. Trevor Williams, a former basketball player on the Canadian Olympic team, dated Maya Harris in high school. He recalled Maya as more bookish and shy, and Kamala as more outgoing. “Maya was more of the brainiac, every test 100 percent, Kamala was a bit more laid back,” he said. “They were always so organized compared to the rest of us.” He recalled that the Harris sisters played down their relative affluence. “I didn’t even realize at the time that their mother was this high-powered doctor.” Ms. Harris was prepared and forceful in intellectual discussions, her classmates recalled. She was also active — performing in fashion shows, working on the yearbook and part of the Pep Club, whose members yelled and sang at school events accompanied by a rabbit mascot, Purple Peter. At the heart of it all, however, was her family life. Ms. Harris’s mother was an abiding influence. Ms. Kagan recalled the warmth of their home, where Indian rice dishes simmered and studying was mandatory. “Her mom was strong and instilled that in Kamala,” she said. Every summer, the girls filled a freezer chest with blanched tomatoes in plastic bags, sucking the air out with straws. The tomatoes were used for soups and sauces. Dr. Gopalan Harris, who had a doctorate in endocrinology and nutrition from Berkeley, spent 16 years in Montreal, at the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University Faculty of Medicine. She developed a method for assessing cancerous breast tissue that became a standard procedure nationwide. As high school drew to a close, the Canadian version of the prom arrived. Ms. Harris was part of a group of girls who attended without dates so that girls who hadn’t been asked out wouldn’t feel excluded. “We decided that we were going to change the culture,” Ms. Kagan said. “Kamala was, like, ‘Let’s do it!’” The next step for Ms. Harris was Howard University in Washington. She had already been pining for home. In the high school yearbook she described her most cherished memory as a 1980 trip to Los Angeles. She thanked her mother and encouraged her sister: “Be cool MA YA!” Her favorite expression? “Naw, I’m just playing.” “By the time I got to high school, I had adjusted to our new surroundings,” she wrote in her memoir. “What I hadn’t gotten used to was the feeling of being homesick for my country. I felt this constant sense of yearning to be back home.”\u3000']",
Data shows fewer Afghan women than men get Covid-19. That’s bad news.,2020-10-03,By Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Fatima Faizi,"['In Afghanistan, the numbers of women reported to have tested positive for the virus and to have died of Covid-19 are far below the numbers reported for men. Globally, men account for 53 percent of confirmed cases and 58 percent of deaths, according to the independent research group Global Health 50/50. But in Afghanistan, men account for 70 percent of cases and 74 percent of deaths — a discrepancy that experts say is most likely the result of women being shut out of the health care system and the public sphere. Afghan women face obstacles within both their own households and the health care facilities themselves, said Suraya Dalil, who was Afghanistan’s public health minister from 2010 to 2014 and now leads special programs in public health at the World Health Organization. “Women have to be accompanied by somebody to go to the hospital,” she said, “so those decisions are often made by the men in a household, whether it’s the husband or the father or the son.” And when women do get to health care facilities, they are expected to engage only with female doctors, she added. That becomes nearly impossible given the small number of female doctors. Another explanation for the gap could be that Afghanistan’s labor force is male-dominated. A study published by the Center for Economic Policy Research in London found a positive correlation between women’s participation in the work force and Covid-19 death rates. In Afghanistan, women make up only about 30 percent of the work force. All of this brings into sharp focus how much hangs in the balance for Afghan women as the government holds peace negotiations with the Taliban.']",
Belgium Arrests 3 Men Suspected of Involvement in Rwandan Genocide,2020-10-03,By Elian Peltier and Abdi Latif Dahir,"['LONDON — Three men suspected of involvement in the 1994 Rwanda genocide were arrested in Belgium this week, according to the Belgian authorities, the latest in a series of captures linked to the 100-day blood bath in which as many as one million people were killed. A spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor’s office said that the men were arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday, and that two of the suspects remained in detention while the third was put under electronic surveillance. “The investigation is still ongoing, and the prosecutor’s office will determine whether the men should face trial,” said the spokesman, Eric Van der Sypt. He declined to provide details about the identities of the men, who were charged with serious abuse of human rights. The arrests, which were reported by the Belgian weekly magazine Le Vif on Friday, are the latest attempts to bring justice over the genocide, in which as many as one million ethnic Tutsis and Hutus were killed. After more than two decades on the run, Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy tycoon who was accused of financing the genocide, was arrested by the French authorities in May outside his home in a Paris suburb. Mr. Kabuga, 84, was accused of importing several hundred thousand machetes that were used during the killings and was also charged over his funding of Radio-Television Mille Collines, which incited hatred against ethnic Tutsis. Mr. Kabuga denied the accusations, and his lawyers said he was too old to stand trial at a United Nations tribunal in Tanzania. But in late September, France’s top appeals court ruled that he should be tried at the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals in the Tanzanian town of Arusha. The tribunal took over the duties of the U.N.’s International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which folded in 2015, and which indicted Mr. Kabuga in 1997 on seven charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity. Rwanda’s government has also sought to arrest and extradite those involved in the genocide. In late August, officials in Kigali wrote to the French authorities in an effort to extradite a former top spy chief, Maj. Gen. Aloys Ntiwiragabo, who is accused of crimes against humanity. He was found in July while living in the suburbs of Orléans, about 70 miles southwest of Paris. Rwanda has also cracked down on those it accuses of denying the genocide and distorting how events unfolded in those tragic days. These include Paul Rusesabagina, the famed hotelier depicted in the movie “Hotel Rwanda” who sheltered 1,268 people during the killings. Last month, the authorities said they had lured Mr. Rusesabagina — whom they previously accused of minimizing the gravity of the genocide — to return from abroad. He now faces 13 charges, including terrorism, complicity in kidnap and murder, and forming a rebel group, all of which he denies. The U.N.’s Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda indicted over 90 people and tried 80 of them, according to data provided by the tribunal. Six fugitives suspected of involvement in the genocide remain on an international most-wanted list. Since 2001, Belgium has held five trials of Rwandans accused of involvement in the genocide. In 2009, a court in Brussels sentenced a former executive of the Commercial Bank of Rwanda, Ephrem Nkezabera, to 30 years in prison for war crimes. In December, a Brussels court for the first time found a former Rwandan official guilty of genocide.

"For veterans, toxic rhetoric and political polarization are a new source of division.",2020-10-04,By Dave Philipps,"['After surviving some of the bloodiest combat in Afghanistan, the men of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment stayed connected on social media for support at home as they grappled with the fallout of war. Those close online connections offered something the veterans’ health care system did not: common ground, understanding, friends ready to talk day or night. But those connections have been frayed to breaking by the partisan rancor of 2020. The Facebook group the men once relied on for support is now clogged with divisive memes and partisan conspiracy theories, disputes over policing and protests, and, of course, strong views on the president. The din has driven a growing number of members to log off in dismay. Many say they still want to support their fellow Marines but cannot stand the toxic political traffic. “It hurts my soul to see all this childish drama,” said Keith Branch, a former infantryman of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment. “Brothers that formed bonds in war, I see them becoming broken over childish arguments. I disconnect from it — I’m already dealing with post-traumatic stress. It hurts too much to look at it.” Party strategists and analysts tend to treat veterans as a homogeneous voting bloc, conservative-leaning and focused mainly on defense and benefits issues. In 2016, exit polls showed that veterans backed Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by nearly two to one. Demographics are part of the reason — veterans skew old and male and white, and so does the core of Mr. Trump’s support. But veterans are increasingly diverse in their outlook, and deeply divided over the coming election. Younger veterans and active-duty troops, who tend to include more women and are less white than older veterans, are especially split. And with those splits have come the same type of infighting among veterans that is now so common at family gatherings. “There are many stories of battle buddies that fought together in combat together, and now they won’t talk because of politics,” said Alex McCoy, a former Marine who is now political director of Common Defense, a political action group working to mobilize veterans to vote against Mr. Trump. “It’s heartbreaking.”']",
"Battling Wildfire and Pandemic, Ukraine Faces a New Foe: Landmines",2020-10-03,By Maria Varenikova,"['VINNYTSIA, Ukraine — A wildfire burning out of control in the war zone in eastern Ukraine is setting off land mines in a buffer area between government forces and Russian-backed separatists, complicating the already dangerous work of fire crews facing hot, dry and windy conditions. The fire is burning through an area of grassy hills and pine forests, all tinder dry, in the Luhansk region, near the border with Russia and divided by the front line in the war, which began in 2014 and has settled into a long stalemate. The explosions reported by firefighters and military observers near the front line, called the line of control, have piled one problem on top of another, hampering firefighting efforts. “We cannot reach it because of the mines, and we cannot use aviation because of the war,” Mykhailo Shevchenko, a member of the city council in Stanytsia Luhanska, a nearby town, said in a telephone interview. Firefighting airplanes could become targets of antiaircraft systems near the front. A cease-fire agreed to in July has mostly held, but mines, unexploded artillery shells, lost bullets and other hazards litter the area after years of conflict. There are no indications either side has tried to use the fire or smoke to restart hostilities. Mr. Shevchenko said he stood near part of the wildfire zone for a time and heard “continuous explosions of different strengths, from bullets to anti-tank mines.” Local residents have told Ukrainian authorities that artillery shelling into the dry forest touched off at least one wildfire, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the cause is still unknown. Whatever started it, hot, dry winds have fanned the flames. “This is not the best year for our country in terms of natural disasters and other tragedies,” Mr. Zelensky said at a briefing Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated firefighting and evacuation efforts. Seven people have died in the wildfires, 18 have been injured and another four are missing, all unrelated to the exploding ordnance, officials said. The fires have destroyed or damaged about 400 houses, forced the closure of the region’s only crossing point over the front line, and destroyed a Red Cross aid point. Evacuees, meanwhile, are at risk of catching the virus in crowded shelters. When the fire approached Olhovski Dachi, a summer home community, Tetiana Vasiukova boarded a bus with about 30 other residents and spent the night with them on folding beds in a community center. While worried about the virus, Ms. Vasiukova said she mostly felt “very depressed” to see the region’s forests burn. Farther from the front, the fire forced the evacuation of a dormitory for schoolchildren, many of whom had moved there from front-line villages at risk of artillery shelling. Liubov Ponomarenko, 15, said in a telephone interview that she had been enjoying the sense of safety of the dormitory before the fire arrived. Deadlier and more frequent wildfires are occurring around the world, often linked to climate change. In Australia’s wildfire season, wind and heat fanned what Australians called “megablazes.” Major wildfires exploded on the West Coast of the United States in the worst fire season on record there. Ukraine has been no exception. The number of wildfires in Ukraine tripled during the first half of the year; the burned area was 40 times larger compared with the same period last year. This spring, a large wildfire burned through the so-called Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That fire burned through a radioactive forest, causing radiation to waft into the air with smoke that blew over Kyiv, the capital, though not at concentrations considered harmful, officials said. Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.']","The blaze is setting off mines and other ordnance littering the war zone in eastern Ukraine, hampering already dangerous firefighting and evacuation efforts."
Paris will close its bars and many cafes for at least two weeks starting on Tuesday.,2020-10-05,By Aurelien Breeden and Constant Méheut,"['Bars in Paris will close for two weeks starting on Tuesday, the authorities there announced on Monday, as France tries to stem a surge of coronavirus cases in its capital. The measure will also affect most cafes, which in many cases serve alcohol, but little or no food. Restaurants will be able to remain open if they follow a strict health protocol. Paris joined a handful of other French areas that have been placed on maximum alert because of a continued rise in infections, especially among older people. Local health authorities said the capital had been above the thresholds for the top alert level — more than 250 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people generally, more than 100 per 100,000 in the elderly, and more than one-third of intensive care beds used for Covid-19 patients — since last Thursday. On average, there are over 3,500 new infections a day in Paris and 203 active clusters, especially among young people for whom the incidence rate is over 500 infections per 100,000 people. In France generally, the seven-day average for new daily cases is above 11,000. The Paris region has as many patients hospitalized for coronavirus as it did in May, when the country was just exiting its two-month lockdown. Mayor Anne Hidalgo and the head of the Paris police said at a news conference on Monday that the bar closures would apply to Paris and the surrounding suburbs. Gyms, dancing halls and enclosed swimming pools will be closed to adults, though minors will be allowed to use gyms and pools. “The epidemic is going too fast,” said Didier Lallement, the Paris police chief. “We need to brake now before our health system is submerged.” Restaurants will have to keep registers of customers for contact-tracing, distance tables by one meter, keep seating to no more than six per table and take payments at the table. Those restaurant rules will also apply in other maximum-risk areas, including the southern cities of Aix-en-Provence and Marseille, where the authorities had closed restaurants under a tightening of restrictions last month. But bars in those two cities will remain closed for at least another week. Starting on Tuesday, new restrictions will also apply to universities in areas on high alert, with classrooms and lecture halls operating at half capacity or below. Retirement home visits will become appointment-only, and with a maximum of two people per visit. “Living with it and protecting, that’s the goal we must have,” Ms. Hidalgo said, adding that she hoped she would be able to come back in 15 days with good news about “the epidemic’s front line.”']",
"Germany’s Far Right Reunified, Too, Making It Much Stronger",2020-10-03,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — They called him the “Führer of Berlin.” Ingo Hasselbach had been a clandestine neo-Nazi in communist East Berlin, but the fall of the Berlin Wall brought him out of the shadows. He connected with western extremists in the unified city, organized far-right workshops, fought street battles with leftists and celebrated Hitler’s birthday. He dreamed of a far-right party in the parliament of a reunified Germany. Today, the far-right party Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD, is the main opposition in Parliament. Its leaders march side by side with far-right extremists in street protests. And its power base is the former communist East. “Reunification was a huge boost for the far right,” said Mr. Hasselbach, who left the neo-Nazi scene years ago and now helps others to do the same. “The neo-Nazis were the first ones to be reunified. We laid the foundation for a party like the AfD. There are things we used to say that have become mainstream today.” As it marks the 30th anniversary of reunification on Saturday, Germany can rightly celebrate being an economic powerhouse and thriving liberal democracy. But reunification has another, rarely mentioned legacy — of unifying, empowering and bringing into the open a far-right movement that has evolved into a disruptive political force and a terrorist threat, not least inside key state institutions like the military and police. “Today’s far-right extremism in Germany cannot be understood without reunification,” said Matthias Quent, a far-right extremism expert and director of an institute that studies democracy and civil society in the eastern state of Thuringia. “It liberated the neo-Nazis in the East from their underground existence, and it gave the far-right in the West access to a pool of new recruits and whole swathes of territory in which to move without too much oversight.” For years, German officials trusted that a far-right party could never again be elected into Parliament and dismissed the idea of far-right terrorist networks. But some now worry that the far-right structures established in the years after reunification laid the groundwork for a resurgence that has burst into view over the past 15 months. Far-right terrorists killed a regional politician on his front porch near the central city of Kassel, attacked a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle and shot dead nine people of immigrant descent in the western city of Hanau. This summer, the government took the drastic step of disbanding an entire military company in the special forces after explosives, a machine gun and SS paraphernalia were found on the property of a sergeant major in the eastern state of Saxony. A disproportionate number — about half — of those suspected of far-right extremism inside that unit, the KSK, were from the former East, its commander said. Nationalism and xenophobia are more ingrained in the former East, where the murderous history of World War II was never confronted as deeply on a societal level as it was in the former West. The AfD’s vote share is twice as high in the eastern states, where the number of far-right hate crimes is higher than in western ones. Officially, there were no Nazis in old East Germany. The regime defined itself in the tradition of communists who had resisted fascism, giving rise to a state doctrine of remembrance that effectively exculpated it from wartime atrocities. Far-right mobs who beat up foreign workers from fellow socialist states like Cuba or Angola were classified as “rowdies” led astray by western propaganda. But a potent neo-Nazi movement was growing underground. In 1987, Bernd Wagner, a young police officer in East Berlin, estimated that there were 15,000 “homegrown” violent neo-Nazis, of whom 1,000 were repeat offenders. His report was swiftly locked away. Two years later, as tens of thousands took to the streets in anti-communist protests that eventually brought down the regime, the pro-democracy activists were not the only marchers. “The skinheads were marching, too,” Mr. Wagner recalled. The battle cry of those anti-communist protests — “We are the people” — later became the battle cry for the far right at anti-Muslim Pegida marches during the 2015 refugee crisis, far-right riots in Chemnitz in 2018, and again at the current anti-coronavirus protests. Before reunification, the far-right scene in West Germany was small and aging, but now western neo-Nazis flocked east to offer “reconstruction aid” and unexpectedly found a refuge. Behind the wall, the East had been frozen in time, a largely homogeneous white country where nationalism was allowed to live on. “The leaders of the western scene thought they were in paradise,” Mr. Hasselbach recalled. Since then the East has become the home of choice for several prominent western extremists. Götz Kubitschek, a leading far-right intellectual from Swabia who wants to preserve the “ethno-cultural identity” of Germany, bought a rural manor house in the East, which serves as the headquarters for his far-right publishing house and research institute. So did Björn Höcke and Andreas Kalbitz, two westerners who became leaders of the most radical factions of the AfD in the former East. “The East has become a sort of retreat for the far right,” Mr. Quent said, “a place where Germany is still Germany and where men are still men.” But the infatuation with the East is also strategic, he said. “There is a sense among far-right extremists: ‘We can’t win in the West, but we can win in the East and then, from a position of strength, we will take on the West.’” Reunification also provided a physical space in which far-right members could move and train. Secret neo-Nazi training camps were held at abandoned Soviet military bases. At one of them, on the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea, Mr. Hasselbach took part in workshops on forging identity papers, bomb making, guerrilla warfare and “silent killing.” The initial years after reunification were so tumultuous that security services were incapable of controlling this coalescing extremist movement. “In the eastern states there was no mature structure for a domestic intelligence service,” Thomas Haldenwang, the president of the domestic intelligence office, said in an interview. “The agencies in the new states had to be built from nothing.” During the early 1990s, a wave of racist violence swept through Germany, much of it in the East. Foreigners were chased, beaten up and sometimes killed. Asylum homes were firebombed. Buses of immigrants were attacked. Sometimes eastern onlookers would watch, clap or join in. “You could see that something was shifting and not just on the fringes,” said Volkhard Knigge, a historian. “Otherwise the AfD would not be so strong today.” In the early 1990s, Mr. Knigge moved east to run the memorial at the former concentration camp in Buchenwald. He was startled by the abundance of Nazi memorabilia like Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” for sale at flea markets and by the mob of angry young neo-Nazis who would gather on the historic theater square, shouting xenophobic slogans. “We thought democracy had won,” Mr. Knigge said. “The West thought this was the end of history. But for nationalists, this was a revision of history.” Reunification brought two strains of nationalism together, said Anetta Kahane, a Jewish anti-racism activist — western-style nationalist conservatism and a more radical eastern social-revolutionary variety. On their own, neither had been powerful enough to stir a political movement. “It was the marriage of the two that made the AfD possible,” said Ms. Kahane, who runs the Amadeu-Antonio Foundation, named after a Black Angolan who was beaten to death with a baseball bat by neo-Nazis less than two months after reunification. For most Germans, the new century was defined by progress. Chancellor Angela Merkel, an easterner, has personified western liberal values. When the country was host to the soccer World Cup in 2006, a confidently multicultural Germany was on display, in what many at the time called “a summer fairy-tale.” “I wanted to believe that that’s who we are as a country — and I did believe it,” said Tanjev Schultz, an author and journalism professor. “But it wasn’t true.” That summer, the National Socialist Underground, a far-right terrorist group that had come out of the extremist networks formed in East Germany, was engaged in an immigrant killing spree that the police would not discover until 2011. From 2000 to 2007, the group killed nine immigrants and a police officer, even as paid informers of the intelligence agency helped hide its leaders and build up its network. Mr. Hasselbach said he was not surprised to see the recent revelations of far-right infiltration of security services. When he was still a neo-Nazi, he said, friendly police officers would warn them before raids or hand them files of leftist enemies. It was the deadly violence in the early 1990s that made Mr. Hasselbach leave the neo-Nazi scene in 1992. An arson attack on the home of a Turkish family killed two girls and their grandmother. He spent years underground to escape threats from his former far-right compatriots. Then, with Mr. Wagner, the former eastern police officer, he co-founded Exit Germany, an organization that helps extremists leave their networks. The fortunes of the AfD have ebbed and flowed in recent years. Polls show that voter support has dipped to around 10 percent during the pandemic. But the fringes are radicalizing, intelligence officers say. It worries Mr. Hasselbach and Mr. Wagner. “The readiness to commit violence today is greater than it’s ever been,” Mr. Hasselbach said. “Westerners have no feel for how fragile things are,” Mr. Wagner said. “The elites don’t see the post-democratic decline. Easterners have seen a system collapse before.”']","Thirty years after Germany came back together, the former East has become the stronghold of a once-marginalized movement that now sits in Parliament."
Interpol Issues ‘Red Notice’ for Thai Red Bull Heir,2020-10-05,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Interpol has issued a new “red notice” for the fugitive heir to the Red Bull fortune who fled Thailand after his Ferrari struck and killed a police officer in 2012, the police in Thailand said. The notice by the global police agency, its highest-level alert, comes after the police in Thailand reopened the case. The authorities, widely criticized for dropping charges against Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the inventor of the energy drink, are seeking Interpol’s help in arresting him, a police spokesman said on Monday. “We will do whatever it takes to bring him back,” said Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen, deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police. “We have been working around the clock to get him back to the country.” The case against Mr. Vorayuth, 37, who goes by the nickname Boss, had long been cited as evidence of the special treatment Thailand’s elite receives. The decision to drop charges against him in July was held up as a further example of impunity. Soon after the crash, Mr. Vorayuth’s family paid the police officer’s family nearly $100,000 in compensation. Mr. Vorayuth resumed his jet-set lifestyle, traveling around the world on private Red Bull jets, keeping a Porsche in London and staying in luxury hotels. After much public outrage over the decision to drop the case, the police reversed themselves in August, saying they had obtained new information and would reopen it. Colonel Kissana declined to discuss the new evidence, saying, “According to the law, if we receive new evidence, we are entitled to reopen the case.” He said Interpol issued the red notice on Wednesday. It has gone out to the international police agency’s other 193 member countries requesting help in locating Mr. Vorayuth, but the agency has yet to receive any new information on his whereabouts. Interpol previously issued a red notice for the Red Bull heir, but it did not lead to his arrest and was canceled after the Thai police dropped the case in July. The collision that killed the police officer, Wichean Glanprasert, occurred just before dawn in September 2012. The driver fled the scene, but a trail of leaking engine fluid led the police to Mr. Vorayuth’s door and to a damaged Ferrari nearby. The police initially arrested the family’s driver and were accused of trying to force him to take the blame. Bangkok’s police commissioner at the time, who took over the investigation, said it had been an attempt at a cover-up. The police also acknowledged that the wealthy playboy had been intoxicated and had admitted that his car hit the officer. But Mr. Vorayuth told them the officer, who was riding a motorcycle, had swerved in front of him. He was released on bail. During the investigation, Mr. Vorayuth repeatedly ignored police summonses. He fled the country in 2017, shortly before the first warrant for his arrest was issued. The statute of limitations has expired for some of the original charges, but he still faces a charge of reckless driving resulting in someone’s death, among other possible charges.']","The police in Thailand, widely criticized for dropping charges against the wealthy playboy in July after he was accused of a fatal hit-and-run, are seeking the agency’s help to arrest him."
Armenia and Azerbaijan: The Conflict Explained,2020-10-03,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — A simmering, decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in late September into the worst fighting the area had seen since a vicious ethnic war in the 1990s. Skirmishes have been common for years along the front lines of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan but is home to ethnic Armenians. This time the conflict is different, analysts and former diplomats say, because Turkey has offered more direct support to Azerbaijan, and because of the scale of the fighting. Both sides have been using drones and powerful, long-range rocket artillery, they say. Turkey’s direct engagement in support of its ethnic Turkic ally, Azerbaijan, in an area of traditional Russian influence, risks turning the local dispute into a regional one. And the attacks have spread far from the front lines. Cities in Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have been hit by long-range weaponry fired by combatants on both sides. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, has been repeatedly bombarded. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of firing powerful rockets at the country’s second largest city, Ganja, and at a hydroelectric station, suggesting an effort to destroy civilian infrastructure. Even the impetus for the latest hostilities, which began on Sept 27, is in dispute. Azerbaijan said Armenia shelled its positions first, while Armenia says an Azerbaijani offensive was unprovoked. On Oct. 17, the two countries announced  a truce, mediated by France, to allow bodies to be collected and prisoners to be exchanged. But as with a Russian-brokered cease-fire a week earlier, the agreement was violated and fighting has continued. Here’s a guide to the conflict and why it has flared again. Nagorno-Karabakh has long been ripe for renewed local conflict. A war that began in the late Soviet period between Armenians and Azerbaijanis set the stage for the fighting today. At that time, the ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan declared independence and was nearly crushed in the ensuing war before its fighters captured areas of Azerbaijan in a series of victories leading up to a cease-fire in 1994. But the tensions go back further, to at least World War I, during the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when Armenians were slaughtered and expelled from Turkey in what many now consider a genocide. That history, Armenians say, justifies their military defense of their ethnic enclave. The 1994 cease-fire, always meant to be temporary, left about 600,000 Azerbaijanis — who had fled Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts captured by the Armenians — stranded away from their homes. It also left Nagorno-Karabakh, closely aligned with Armenia, vulnerable to attack by Azerbaijan, which vowed to recapture the area. Russia and Turkey had coordinated at times in the past to tamp down tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. But the uneasy cooperation between Turkey and Russia, an ally of Armenia, is starting to fade as both countries become increasingly assertive in the Middle East and as the United States steps back. Relations between all three countries have become more complicated. Turkey has alienated the United States by buying antiaircraft missiles from Russia and cutting a natural gas pipeline deal seen as undermining Ukraine. At the same time, it is fighting proxy wars against Moscow in Syria and Libya. After Russian airstrikes in Syria killed Turkish soldiers earlier this year, Turkey soon appeared on other battlefields where Russia was vulnerable. In May, Turkey deployed military advisers, armed drones and Syrian proxy fighters to Libya to shore up the U.N.-backed government and push back a Russian-supported rival faction in that war. In July and August, it sent troops and equipment to Azerbaijan for military exercises. Armenia has said that Turkey is directly involved in the fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, and that a Turkish F-16 fighter shot down an Armenian jet. Turkey denied those accusations. After satellite images revealed F-16s parked on the apron of an Azerbaijani airfield, Azerbaijan’s president conceded that Turkish planes were in his country but said they had not flown in combat. Russia and France have both supported Armenia’s claim that Turkey deployed Syrian militants to Nagorno-Karabakh, following its playbook in Libya. Distracted by other issues like the pandemic and a popular uprising in Belarus, another former Soviet state, international mediators missed warning signs and possible openings for diplomacy, analysts say. Travel restrictions related to the coronavirus prevented traditional shuttle diplomacy over the summer, said Olesya Vartanyan, a senior Caucasus analyst at the International Crisis Group. For the antagonists in Nagorno-Karabakh, “this is a perfect time” to start a war, she said. When Armenia killed a general and other officers in Azerbaijan’s Army in a missile strike during a border skirmish in July, Turkey immediately offered to help prepare a response, a retired Turkish general, Ismail Hakki Pekin, has said. Turkish and Azerbaijani joint military exercises ensued, raising tensions. The prospects for a broader peace deal appear dim. A cease-fire brokered in Moscow on Oct. 10  failed to hold, and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has threatened a further escalation of his offensive.  A truce mediated by France a week later also broke down, with each side blaming the other for violations. Neither side appears willing to compromise, with rhetoric having grown harsher in recent months. The recent conflict has killed more than 750 Armenian soldiers and, according to the United Nations, more than 50 civilians; Azerbaijan has not revealed its military casualties. The last major American effort to broker peace in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was 20 years ago when the United States invited the sides to talks in Florida, but the issue dropped off the United States agenda after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Earlier that year, the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia had  secretly agreed to swap territory, including some land that Azerbaijan lost in the 1990s war, to settle the conflict. But both backed away from the deal before it could be finalized. The most optimistic outcome in the current fighting, analysts say, would be a return to the same unhappy status quo before the fighting started in September. At least, they say, that would avoid a wider war that might draw in Turkey and Russia.']",Fighting in and around the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh shows signs that a local ethnic dispute could spiral into a regional conflict.
"Trump says he feels better, but his chief of staff says he is ‘still not on a clear path to a full recovery.’",2020-10-03,By Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker,"['President Trump’s vital signs were “very concerning” over the last day and he is not out of danger, the White House chief of staff said on Saturday, contradicting a rosier picture painted by the president’s doctors on television just minutes before. And in a four-minute video posted to Twitter on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump said he was “starting to feel good,” but added that the severity of his case would probably become apparent over the coming days. The video, meant to reassure the nation, showed him sitting at a conference table at the hospital and wearing a suit jacket but no tie. “You don’t know, over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test,” he said. “So we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days.” Mr. Trump said he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, but said “I feel much better now” and that he expected to return to work shortly. The White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said later Saturday night that the president had made “substantial progress since diagnosis.” Mr. Trump was “fever-free and off supplemental oxygen,” Dr. Conley said after he had declined earlier on Saturday to say whether the president had been on oxygen at any point since being diagnosed with Covid-19. “While not yet out of the woods,” Dr. Conley said, “the team remains cautiously optimistic.” While the president’s doctors had maintained earlier Saturday that Mr. Trump was “doing very well” and in “exceptionally good spirits” after his first night in the hospital with the coronavirus, Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, provided a more sober assessment and warned that the next two days would be pivotal in determining the outcome of the illness. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,” Mr. Meadows told reporters outside Walter Reed, where the president was flown on Friday evening and will remain for at least a few days. “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.” Mr. Meadows’s remarks were attributed to a person familiar with the president’s health in a pool report sent to White House journalists in keeping with ground rules that he set for the interview. But a video posted online captured Mr. Meadows approaching the pool reporters outside Walter Reed following the doctors’ televised briefing and asking to speak off the record, making clear who the unnamed source was. The comments infuriated the president, according to people close to the situation, and he intervened directly to counter the perception that he was sicker than the White House has admitted. Within hours, he posted a message on Twitter saying “I am feeling well!” and called his friend and personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to have him convey a message to the outside world. “I’m going to beat this,” Mr. Trump told him. Mr. Meadows called into Fox News on Saturday night, knowing the president was most likely watching, and praised his “unbelievable courage” and “unbelievable improvement.” But he also confirmed that Mr. Trump’s condition on Friday was worse than originally described. “Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,” Mr. Meadows said. “He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.” The mixed messages only exacerbated the confusion and uncertainties surrounding the president’s situation. During their briefing on Saturday, the doctors refused to provide important details and gave timelines that conflicted with earlier White House accounts and left the impression that the president was sick and began treatment earlier than officially reported. Two people close to the White House said in separate interviews with The New York Times that the president had trouble breathing on Friday and that his oxygen level dropped, prompting his doctors to give him supplemental oxygen while at the White House and transfer him to Walter Reed where he could be monitored with better equipment and treated more rapidly in case of trouble. During the televised briefing, Dr. Conley said the president was not currently receiving supplemental oxygen on Saturday but repeatedly declined to say definitively whether he had ever been on oxygen. “None at this moment and yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” he said, seeming to suggest that there was a period on Friday at the White House when he was. Dr. Conley likewise appeared to indicate that the president was first diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday rather than Thursday night, before Mr. Trump disclosed the test on Twitter early Friday morning. While describing what he said was the president’s progress, he said Mr. Trump was “just 72 hours into the diagnosis now,” which would mean midday on Wednesday. Just two hours later, the White House issued a statement it said was written by Dr. Conley trying to clarify. “This morning while summarizing the president’s health, I incorrectly used the term ‘72 hours’ instead of ‘Day 3,’” it said.  Dr. Conley also said that on Thursday afternoon “we repeated testing and, given clinical indications, had a little bit more concern.” Late that night, he said, “we got the P.C.R. confirmation that he was” positive. Mr. Trump attended campaign events on both Wednesday night and Thursday without wearing a mask and gathering hundreds of supporters who likewise were not taking precautions against the virus. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, another physician treating the president, also said that Mr. Trump had received an experimental antibody therapy “about 48 hours ago,” which would have been midday Thursday — before the confirmation test Dr. Conley said came back positive that evening and a full day before the White House disclosed the treatment on Friday. The confusion came from a briefing where Dr. Conley and his team offered a relentlessly positive assessment of Mr. Trump’s condition. “This morning the president is doing very well,” Dr. Conley said. “At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made.” The doctors said Mr. Trump had been free of fever for 24 hours and had blood pressure and heart rates that were normal for him. Asked why he moved Mr. Trump to the hospital, Dr. Conley said, “Because he’s the president of the United States.” Dr. Sean N. Dooley, another physician on the team, said Mr. Trump was feeling optimistic. “He’s in exceptionally good spirits,” Dr. Dooley said. He added that the president told his doctors, “I feel like I could walk out of here today.” In his rambling video statement, Mr. Trump looked wan and sounded less energetic than usual. At one point, he offered a muddled explanation for his behavior that was not entirely clear whether he was talking about his decision to go to the hospital or to keep campaigning in recent months despite the pandemic. “I had no choice,” he said. “I just didn’t want to stay in the White House.” He added: “I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens.

Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Indonesia’s Parliament gave final approval Monday to a sweeping jobs-creation bill that would loosen labor and environmental regulations, moves that critics say would harm workers and permit widespread deforestation. With seven of Parliament’s nine political parties in favor, lawmakers easily passed the 905-page stimulus measure that aims to attract investment by slashing regulations contained in nearly 80 separate laws. Parliament had planned to consider the bill at the end of this week but moved up the vote after labor unions called for a three-day national strike starting Tuesday to protest the legislation. The measure has the backing of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, who is expected to sign it quickly. He is eager to push ahead with the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus, even though the number of cases is rising and large-scale social restrictions remain in place in Jakarta, the capital. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most-populous country, has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic. Its economy is expected to contract this year for the first time since the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s. For more than two weeks, Indonesia has averaged 4,000 new cases a day. On Monday, it reached a total of 307,120 cases and 11,253 deaths. Health experts say many more cases and deaths have gone unreported. Supporters of the omnibus bill say that it will attract investors by cutting regulations on businesses, speeding approval of projects and eliminating many permit requirements. “This bill is meant to create jobs and attract investments, from within the country and abroad, that are expected to increase the prosperity of the people,” Heri Gunawan, a member of Parliament who supports the measure, said during the debate. But opponents argued that slashing regulations on businesses would come at a high cost to workers and the environment. “The job creation bill is said to ease the way for business activities that increase investment and create more jobs, but the bill is full of various agendas that would potentially destroy the environment and violate the rights of the Indonesian people,” said Marwan Cik Asan, a member of Parliament who opposes the measure. Labor unions say that the legislation would harm workers by reducing severance pay, cutting mandatory leave, allowing longer work hours, and permitting the hiring of contract and part-time workers in place of full-time employees. After the vote, the president of the Indonesian Trade Union Confederation, Said Iqbal, vowed to go ahead with a national strike on Tuesday. He predicted that 2 million workers would participate. “Laborers will voice their rejection of the omnibus law,” he said. Environmentalists contend that by eliminating environmental reviews for many new projects, the legislation would lead to the destruction of primary rain forests that are essential in controlling carbon emissions and slowing climate change. Supporters of the measure say they expect it to attract foreign investment. But some foreign investors said that relaxing restrictions on forest burning would have the opposite effect. Hours before the vote, a group of 36 global investors representing more than $4 trillion in assets under management released an open letter calling on the Indonesian government to support the conservation of forests and peatlands and take a long-term approach to recovery from the pandemic. For decades, much of the destruction of Indonesia’s rain forests has been caused by palm oil producers who burn huge swathes of land to clear it for plantations. Indonesia is a major exporter of palm oil. The investors warned that by reversing recent gains in reducing burning, Indonesia could run afoul of restrictions being considered by the European Union on the import of products that result from deforestation. “Protecting tropical forests is vital for combating climate change, the degradation of ecosystems, and biodiversity loss, all of which pose systemic and material risks to our portfolios as well as to the health of our societies, economies, and environment,” the letter said. The human rights group Amnesty International Indonesia also criticized passage of the measure, saying that Parliament acted without consulting labor and rights groups and that the result is a measure that deprives Indonesian workers of their right to work and their workplace rights. Amnesty’s executive director for Indonesia, Usman Hamid, said the measure could violate Indonesia’s commitment to protect human rights as a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. He urged Parliament to reconsider. “This is a catastrophic law,” he said. “It will harm workers’ wallets, job security and their human rights as a whole.” Parliament approved the bill through a process known as “fraksi” in which each party casts a vote, rather than each lawmaker. This method is often used when there is little doubt about the result. About three quarters of Parliament’s members support Mr. Joko. In this case, only two parties opposed the bill, the Democratic Party of former president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party. Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting from Jakarta, Indonesia.']",Parliament moved up a vote on the coronavirus stimulus bill after unions called for a national strike. Critics say it will relax rules to prevent deforestation and protect workers.
"At Afghan Peace Talks, Hoping to End Their Fathers’ War",2020-10-05,By Mujib Mashal,"['DOHA, Qatar — They are here to end their fathers’ war. On both sides of the negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban are nearly a dozen children of men who played key roles in the Soviet conflict in the 1980s that set off four decades of violence and loss. Some of their fathers have since died of old age, insurgents to the end. Some faced more violent deaths, blown up in suicide bombings that have become a trademark of the war’s brutality. Many of the ones who have survived, their chests decked out in the medals and insignia of a conflict that has inflicted misery on millions, grew rich — enjoying palaces, political fortune, massive wealth. But they still play hide and seek with death. Those fathers fought alongside each other to drive out the Soviets, then turned their guns on each other in the power vacuum that followed, waging an atrocity-filled civil war. Now, their children know all too well what is at stake as the United States military continues its withdrawal with the peace talks in Qatar still up in the air: If the Afghan warring sides fail to agree on a formula of power-sharing, Afghanistan could break into another civil war, the conflict dragging on for another generation, with new enemies and new patrons. “If we lose this opportunity, we have lost Afghanistan,” said Fatima Gailani, whose father was one of the leaders of the mujahedeen resistance to the Soviets at the dawn of Afghanistan’s descent into chaos. “If we lose this opportunity, we have betrayed the people of Afghanistan — we have betrayed every child, every woman, above all we have betrayed the people who died in this war.” Ms. Gailani arrived in Doha, Qatar’s capital, in September as one of the 20 negotiators on the government’s side facing the Taliban, who reached a deal in February that started a United States military withdrawal. She got to Qatar just a week after her third surgery for throat cancer, her voice still hoarse. The last time Afghanistan was at such an inflection point, it was in the 1980s. Her father was a leader of the mujahedeen guerrillas against the Soviets, and he persuaded her to abandon her pursuit of a Ph.D. and become a spokeswoman for the mujahedeen factions as the war reached its endgame and the Soviets neared withdrawal. That turned out to be a nightmare that never ended, she said: The guerrillas were soon at one another’s throats, and the extremists among them who saw no place for women in government outnumbered the moderate factions like her father’s. “I am a 66-year-old woman, I cannot afford to be pessimistic,” Ms. Gailani said. “I see it as we are being given another opportunity.” On the Taliban side, too, are several children or relatives of men who were the leaders of the anti-Soviet war. Mawlawi Matiulhaq Khalis, almost 60, is the son of the late Mawlawi Mohammad Yunus Khalis, one of the key ideologues of the resistance. The senior Khalis’s claim to fame was that on a visit to the White House with President Ronald Reagan, who praised the mujahedeen as “freedom fighters,” he invited the American president to convert to Islam. Among the hardened graybeards on the insurgent side of the negotiations in Qatar is an obvious outlier, a young man of just 26, tall with gentle eyes. But he carries a name — Haqqani — that has become synonymous with the deadly bombings that rack Afghanistan’s cities. He is Anas Haqqani, the youngest son of the family patriarch, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who was once an ally of the United States against the Soviets but later founded the infamous Haqqani Network of the Taliban, bent on forcing the Americans out of Afghanistan. One of his other sons, Sirajuddin, became his successor and is now the deputy supreme leader of the Taliban and a central architect of the militants’ resurgence. But even as he represents the Taliban at the negotiating table now, Anas Haqqani insists in personal conversation that he is more interested in being seen as a poet. A sample verse: His ties to politics are out of obligation Anas’s interest is in poetry, sweeter than any throne. He spent five years in an Afghan prison, arrested as a 19-year-old in a joint effort by Afghan and American spies while he was in transit from Qatar in 2014. He was sentenced to death — for his family name and not for any crime he had committed, he says — before being let out in a prisoner exchange last year. When the United States was preparing to invade Afghanistan in 2001, chasing Osama bin Laden — who had close ties to the senior Haqqani, dating back to the mujahedeen struggle — Anas was just 7. The Americans, along with Pakistani middlemen, approached the senior Haqqani to see if he would betray his Taliban allies and Bin Laden by siding with them again. Anas quotes his father, who was already in his 60s at the time, as warning the Americans: “Sort it out through talks. But if you come as invaders, I will shoot you with this same weapon that I fought the Soviets.” The senior Haqqani developed a vast base in the tribal areas of Pakistan, built and buttressed in the lawless region by C.I.A. money from the anti-Soviet war. He lost four of his sons to U.S. drones and assassinations, and died of old age two years ago. His legacy is half a century of insurgency, and an entire infrastructure that trains children to chase glory in the fight against intrusive foreign powers. The example he set is clear, and feels particularly chilling right now: Old friends can always become new foes in somebody else’s war in Afghanistan. “Those in the right might be weaker in weapons, money, numbers — but we can still take the truth, smash the head of falsehood with it, crack its skull and spread its brains,” he is shown saying in a video clip released by the Taliban this year on the second anniversary of his death. He appears frail, with his head trembling, but is still dressed in his military-style fatigues. “This is the truth with which God smashed the skull of Americans.” “They are trying to create covers for their loss,” he continued, speaking about the United States’ search for an exit from Afghanistan. “But the cover is like putting pants on a camel — the pants rip open after the camel takes the first step, and then you see its privates.” Across the table from the youngest Haqqani is the alternative: children of legacy and privilege who are trying to cement what their fathers won by the gun with a softer image of democratic politics. With top-class educations, advisers and resources, they have made it to cabinet positions and parliamentary seats. The youngest, 25-year-old Khalid Noor, received a military degree in Britain and a bachelor’s degree in the United States. His father, the strongman Atta Mohammed Noor, had consolidated his grip as one of the most powerful political forces in northern Afghanistan, in part through his command of militia forces that were accused of abuses. At 31, Batour Dostum has already inherited the leadership of a political party that his father built. His father, Abdul Rashid Dostum, is one of the most notorious civil war strongmen, and perhaps the ultimate survivor of the Afghan conflict. After racking up accusations of human rights abuses over decades, the senior Dostum became a champion for his once-oppressed ethnic Uzbek minority, and rose to the country’s vice presidency. He didn’t stop there: Despite facing an open court case on charges of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a political opponent, he was recently given the honorary military rank of marshal, handed out just three times in the country’s history. Lasting peace would take more than just Afghans agreeing. Havens for guerrilla warfare would need to be dismantled in Pakistan, where they were first set up by the Americans, Pakistanis and Saudis, and where they seem to merely go into hibernation until a new enemy appears. Foreign nations are likely to remain involved — the country remains deeply dependent on aid. But truly helping Afghanistan would require those powers to reach some sort of equilibrium rather than continuing to fight for their interests through proxy battles there. Peace would also require a monumental reckoning among Afghans — if not actual healing from generations of devastation, at least a decision not to perpetuate more. “Unfortunately, all sides have made mistakes in the past 40 years, and you can see everyone is tired — everyone just wants to silence the guns,” Batour Dostum said. “We need to learn from the past, we need to be careful in the future not to repeat the mistakes. We are young, we should not be repeating those mistakes.” When asked what he can do to heal the wounds his side has inflicted on others, Anas Haqqani tried — with a verse, again — to say that his family is accused of more than it has actually done. The blind tell me your face is an ugly face The deaf say what you are saying is wrong. But there is no escaping that his father’s faction, inherited by his sons, has been behind some of the most scarring violence of the war. When pressed, he insisted that his time in prison had softened him: On social media, he can’t look at graphic images of the war — “no matter from which side” — and quickly scrolls past. “On a personal level, I feel sympathy with everyone — that we need to do whatever we can to heal their wounds,” Mr. Haqqani said. “I have seen my own brothers blown up to pieces. I feel the pain, because I have also lost my own.”']",The children of the war against the Soviets carry legacies of loss and determination — and their own generation’s crimes — as they meet to try to break a cycle of devastation.
"Cuomo won’t approve closing businesses in 9 N.Y.C. hot spots, but will close schools in those areas on Tuesday.",2020-10-05,"By Jesse McKinley, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Troy Closson and Daniel E. Slotnik","['Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York refused on Monday to allow New York City to close nonessential businesses in nine hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens where the coronavirus has spiked, pre-empting a plan announced the day before by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The governor suggested that the ZIP codes that were being used to identify hot spots were too imprecise to guide shutdowns. The more pressing problem, he said, lay in schools and houses of worship, including many that cater to Orthodox Jews, rather than businesses that “are not large spreaders.” The dissonance in messages from the state’s two most prominent politicians created confusion for residents, business owners and parents in the affected areas and drew scrutiny to the conflict between city and state over how to tackle early signs of a second wave of the virus in its onetime epicenter. The governor’s announcement also seemed to be yet another manifestation of his long feud with Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo has frequently second-guessed or overruled the mayor, who is also a Democrat, during their tenures. Those clashes were cast in sharp relief during the early days of the pandemic, with the city and state at odds over the timing of shutting down the city’s businesses and its schools, among other issues. On Monday, that disconnect continued, as Mr. Cuomo accelerated the mayor’s plan to close schools in newly hard-hit areas, moving the closure date up a day to Tuesday, and forcing parents in those areas to again rejigger their schedules to accommodate changes in their children’s routines. Mr. Cuomo said he spoke with Mr. de Blasio and Michael Mulgrew, the president of the city’s teachers’ union, among other local officials, on Monday morning and added that all were in agreement on the need for additional data on cases at specific schools. Mr. Cuomo did not rule out closing nonessential businesses or public spaces in the near future, and top aides suggested a state plan could be unveiled as soon as Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo said his administration was reviewing how best to do it without relying on geographic delineations from ZIP codes, which he said were arbitrary and might not accurately capture the areas where new cases are going up. “A ZIP code is not the best definition of the applicable zone,” he said. “If you have to circumscribe an area, make sure you have the right boundaries.” Cuomo administration officials later suggested that the boundaries for business closures could even exceed the ZIP codes where the increases are now occurring. On Monday afternoon, not long after the governor’s news conference, Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference of his own that he still planned to close nonessential businesses in the nine ZIP codes. He added later that “we obviously will follow state law, and if the state does not authorize restrictions we’re not going to act. But I find that very unlikely at this point.” Mr. Cuomo had also announced that the state would take over supervision of enforcement of mask and social-distancing rules in the hot spot clusters, presumably putting the State Police in charge of New York City Police Department officers. He added that local governments would need to provide personnel. The mayor said that he did not believe that the state could seize control of enforcement from local governments but that he agreed with Mr. Cuomo on the need for aggressive enforcement and “stronger restrictions that will allow us to turn the tide.”']",
"President Trump, undergoing an experimental antiviral treatment, spends a third day in the hospital.",2020-10-04,By Marc Santora,"['President Trump entered his third day in the hospital on Sunday after contracting the coronavirus and falling ill last week, even as confusing and contradictory accounts about his medical condition added to the national sense of uncertainty and concern for the 74-year-old president’s well-being. Seeking to project an optimistic image to the world, President Trump released a four-minute video on Saturday evening from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., to say that he is “starting to feel good” and would “be back soon.” Wearing a blue jacket, cuff links and an American flag pin but no necktie, the president looked much paler than he did during his debate in Cleveland on Tuesday with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thanking the staff at Walter Reed, Mr. Trump said that he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he arrived at the hospital on Friday, but that he felt “much better now.” On Saturday night, the White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, released a new statement, saying that Mr. Trump had made “substantial progress” and would be monitored closely as he undergoes a five-day experimental antiviral drug regimen for Covid-19 and continues to receive doses of remdesivir, a drug that has shown some efficacy at speeding recovery. “While not out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,” Dr. Conley noted. But that optimism was not shared by everyone close to the president and just a few hours earlier, Mark Meadows, the president’s chief of staff, had offered a darker picture. “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning,” Mr. Meadows said. “And the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care.” Many doctors stressed the critical period of time — about seven to 10 days after infection — when a patient’s condition can take a turn for the worse. Some people respond to an infection with an overly exuberant immune response that can worsen their illness and even prove fatal. The release of only sketchy information made it difficult for outside medical experts to assess the president’s condition and the lack of clear communication was compounded by the vagaries of a virus that continues to puzzle scientists. Some 7.3 million Americans have been infected since the pandemic swept around the world and more than 208,000 have died. Tens of thousands have suffered serious illness with an untold number dogged by symptoms weeks or even months after infection. It remained unclear when Mr. Trump was infected. But his case is part of a widening outbreak in the nation’s capital, with scores of people the president had contact with in recent days testing positive. At least seven people who attended a White House event on Sept. 26 have since tested positive for the coronavirus. Six of them, including the first lady, sat in the first several rows of a Supreme Court nomination ceremony for Judge Amy Coney Barrett in the White House Rose Garden. The seventh was the president himself. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was in the room with the president as he prepared for the debate last week, was the latest to test positive and fall ill. He was hospitalized on Saturday evening. Mr. Biden tested negative on Friday and said he would be tested again on Sunday. His campaign vowed to make public the results of all future tests.']","A barrage of conflicting accounts created confusion about his medical condition.

Bright Lights of Dubai Beckon Israel’s Arabs but Pose a Quandary,2020-10-04,By David M. Halbfinger and Adam Rasgon,"['JERUSALEM — For Israel’s Arab citizens, the normalization deals that Israel struck with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will mean newfound freedom to stroll through Dubai’s cavernous malls, take lucrative jobs in Abu Dhabi or solicit investments from wealthy Emiratis or Bahrainis. The prospects are dazzling. But some Arab citizens of Israel acknowledge misgivings about exploiting opportunities that could benefit them but undercut the Palestinian national cause. Sajy Khashab, 23, a graduate student in computer science, said he would love to travel to the Persian Gulf, a frequent stop for the travel and food bloggers he follows. “There’s a very small list of Arab countries I can visit,” he said. But he was unwilling to seize the chance just yet. “I would want to first see that Palestinians in the West Bank at least are OK with this, are in agreement with this,” he said. “Then I would start to think about how I myself can benefit from it.” Until the signing of diplomatic agreements between Israel and the U.A.E. and Bahrain in Washington last month, the only Arab countries open to Israel’s 1.9 million Arab citizens were Egypt, a popular tourist destination, and Jordan, where thousands have attended college. For years, the skyscrapers of Dubai, one of the seven emirates in the U.A.E., were omnipresent images in Arab television and social media but largely off limits. Now some people feel an almost uncontrollable urge to see them in person. “It’s like an American who wants to go visit New York,” said Mohammed Darawshe, a leader of an Israeli group that promotes Jewish-Arab coexistence. “It’s a hub and an icon of culture, and accomplishment, and achievement.” It is still impossible to fly directly to the gulf on commercial airlines. But executives from a major meat company, coffee roaster and travel company were among the Arab executives who jumped at the chance to participate in junkets led by Israeli banks. Would-be middlemen from Arab areas of Israel have set up WhatsApp groups and even an office or two in the gulf. And Diaa Sabia, 27, a midfielder on the Israeli national soccer team from the Arab city of Majd al Krum, was lured from a Chinese club to the Al Nasr team in Dubai. “They received us like kings,” he wrote on Instagram in Hebrew. “Words can’t describe it,” he wrote in Arabic. Experts say the biggest immediate economic opportunities in the gulf for Arab citizens of Israel lie in attracting investments for start-ups and landing high-salaried jobs in the Emirates in technology and investment banking. “Everybody’s seeing stars now,” said Ehab Farah, a Tel Aviv-based business lawyer who has advised Arab-owned start-ups in Israel. “A lot of entrepreneurs are saying, ‘We want a piece of the cake.’” Nora Nseir Manassa, the co-founder of Nurami Medical, a Haifa start-up making a surgical patch that relies on nanotechnology, said she belonged to several WhatsApp groups in which Arab entrepreneurs were talking “about how we can leverage this.” Ms. Nseir Manassa said she hoped to raise money in the Emirates and to use the gulf as a gateway to previously closed-off countries. “This can open a new opportunity,” she said, “a new world that we are not aware of and a new market.” At a minimum, Arab-Israeli experts say they hope the availability of gulf capital could help compensate for what they call a debilitating fact of life in Israel: difficulty in obtaining credit from mainstream financial institutions. Ziyad Abuo Habla, an Arab banking expert, said that Arabs in Israel felt as though they had the word “risky” tattooed across their foreheads, and may be charged higher interest rates than Jews. But Emirati banks, he said, would appreciate that an Arab borrower’s family would step in to help if he or she was unable to repay a loan. Further down the road, Mr. Farah said he could envision Emirati investment in Arab start-ups in Israel changing the way those start-ups are seen domestically. If Jewish investors now primarily view them through a “corporate social responsibility” lens, he said, they might now decide to invest in Arab start-ups as a way to forge their own ties to the gulf. Sami Miaari, a labor economist at Tel Aviv University, expressed caution about the chances that Israeli-Arab businesses would be able to penetrate the gulf marketplace, which he said was inordinately expensive. “They’ll be competing with giants in the field,” he said. Raja Khalidi, an economist at a Ramallah-based research institute, said he doubted that gulf Arabs would be interested in making deals with Israeli Arabs, whose biggest businesses they would consider small potatoes. “They didn’t make peace with Netanyahu to deal with the Arabs,” Mr. Khalidi said. “They don’t need the Arabs.” The prospects for Arab citizens on the job market could be far rosier. “The U.A.E. suffers from a chronic shortage of professional human capital, at all levels,” Mr. Miaari said. Israeli Arabs graduating with degrees in information technology who might earn $3,000 to $5,000 a month in Israel could expect to command three to five times that in the Emirates, he said. But the diplomatic deals that created these opportunities have been denounced by Palestinian leaders as a betrayal of the strategy to make ties with Arab countries contingent upon the establishment of a Palestinian state. Some Arab citizens of Israel, many of whom identify as Palestinian, are concerned that they would profit at the expense of Palestinians in the occupied territories. Mr. Khashab, a master’s student at Tel Aviv University who also works for a major American tech company, said the Emirati labor market could vastly expand his horizons. In Israel, the start-up ecosystem is dominated by entrepreneurs who met one another in the military, from which Arabs are exempt, he said. Many Arabs, as a result, gravitate to jobs with multinational tech companies, where they fit in more easily. Emirati investment or job opportunities could be an equalizer, he said. But Mr. Khashab’s hometown, Qalansawe, is about two miles from the West Bank, and he said he was “constantly aware” that an accident of birth could have left him with far fewer opportunities. “I don’t think I could go there if it turns out this is just an arms deal,” he said, alluding to reports tying the U.A.E. agreement to its effort to buy F-35 fighters from the United States. While experts say that a sizable number of Arab citizens may spurn the Emirates altogether on ideological grounds, others said that a wait-and-see approach was in order. Mr. Miaari said the test would be whether the Emiratis’ and Bahrainis’ contention that normalization would benefit the Palestinians in the long run holds true. Mr. Darawshe, however, said that Arab Israelis who see an opportunity in the gulf would seize it, misgivings or not. “The first time an Arab debka group is invited, they’ll say no,” he said, referring to a popular Palestinian folk dance. “The second time, yes.” Jeries Nakhleh, export manager at El Nakhleh Coffee in Shfaram, who went on one of the first Israeli trade missions to the gulf, said he was eager to make his first deal there. “I’m not like my father and grandfather,” he said. “I don’t forget about the Palestinian issue, but I don’t carry it with me everywhere I go.”']",Diplomatic ties with the U.A.E. and Bahrain could create new opportunities. But many say they are loath to undercut the Palestinian cause.
"China Ramps Up a War of Words, Warning the U.S. of Its Red Lines",2020-10-05,By Steven Lee Myers,"['The soldiers run through the forest, through the surf, through smoke and flames, ready to die for the motherland. The video, one of a series that has recently appeared online in China, climaxes with the launch of nine ballistic missiles and a fiery barrage of explosions. “If war breaks out,” a chorus sings, “this is my answer.” Chinese propaganda is rarely subtle or particularly persuasive, but the torrent of bombast online and in state media in recent weeks is striking and potentially ominous. The targets are China’s main adversaries: the United States and Taiwan, which are moving closer and closer together. The propaganda has accompanied a series of military drills in recent weeks, including the test-firing of ballistic missiles and the buzzing of Taiwan’s airspace. Together, they are intended to draw stark red lines for the United States, signaling that China would not shrink from a military clash. While the prospect of war remains remote, the militaristic tone reflects the hawkishness of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping. The risk is that the propaganda could translate into more provocative actions, at a time when the relationship with the United States has sharply deteriorated. The recent military moves in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait raise the possibility of actual clashes, intended or not. In Washington, President Trump’s hospitalization for treatment of Covid-19 has overshadowed everything else, creating the impression that his administration is in chaos and raising fears of a decision-making void. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cut short his trip to Asia this week, although he is expected to push for confronting China when he meets in Tokyo with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan. China is already facing pressure over Taiwan and is pressing other disputed territorial claims, from the South China Sea to the Himalayas. If China feels directly challenged on any of those fronts, Mr. Xi may not be able to back down, having primed the public for a combative stance. One video featured a simulated airstrike on Guam, the American territory in the Pacific, with clips cribbed from two Hollywood films, “The Rock” and “The Hurt Locker.” Global Times, the voice of the Communist Party’s hawks, warned recently that the United States was “playing with fire” by supporting Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of a unified China. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, the editorial went on, would be “wiped out” if she moved against Chinese sovereignty. “I don’t think it’s just bluster, and I don’t think it’s just about venting anger,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who is an expert on Taiwan and China. “I think there is growing pressure — and that Xi Jinping finds that it’s useful to display that pressure.” More bombast is to come. The latest propaganda surge has coincided with the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, also known in China as the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which has long served as an instrument for stoking anti-American sentiment. Chinese forces intervened in the war on Oct. 19, 1950, and, as official narratives here have it, ultimately drove the American-led United Nations forces back to the 38th parallel in a heroic triumph of the newly established People’s Republic of China. With U.S.-China relations at a new low, officials and propagandists are using the anniversary to remind Chinese people that the nation has stood up to the world’s superpower before — and prevailed. A memorial museum dedicated to the conflict recently reopened in Dandong, a Chinese city across the Yalu River from North Korea. A series of films about the war is also rolling out — “to carry forward the great spirit of resisting U.S. aggression,” as the description of one documentary put it. A new war drama stars Wu Jing, the lead actor in the “Wolf Warrior” action film franchise that has given a name to Chinese diplomacy of late. It tells the story of a combat engineering unit keeping a crucial bridge intact during one of the last battles of the Korean conflict. “Never underestimate Chinese people’s determination to safeguard national security,” the editor of Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote on Twitter last week, after a ceremony commemorating the return of the remains of Chinese soldiers who died in South Korea. Mr. Hu, whose views are not official but echo those of the country’s hawks, has been regularly warning the United States that it risked starting a war with China. In his latest unsubstantiated claim, he warned that Mr. Trump could launch a drone attack on Chinese bases in the South China Sea. As always, China’s Communist Party has the ability to dial up propaganda — and to dial it down — to suit its domestic and geopolitical goals. China, for example, has been far less bellicose in its statements about India this summer, despite the lethal clashes along their border. With the United States, however, the tone has sharpened significantly as the Trump administration has moved almost daily to take on the Chinese — from closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston to banning TikTok and WeChat. Chinese propaganda often uses martial language and images. The fight against the coronavirus was declared a People’s War. Mr. Xi, too, evokes the idea of a warlike struggle to overcome threats. Last month he listed five conditions that China would “never accept,” including any effort to divide or bully the Chinese people. The flurry of videos released by the People’s Liberation Army, though, has left little doubt about its message. At least two have included the chorus “if war broke out today,” including one for the secretive submarine service — with details of equipment and geography blurred out. They have been viewed millions of times. Another video was even more explicit. It featured a bombing run with an H6 strategic bomber, zeroing in on a satellite photograph of a runway at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam. After briefly going viral, the post was removed without explanation. The new propaganda campaign has also emerged amid the increased military activity. This summer, China and Taiwan each held annual training exercises that simulated attacks across the Taiwan Strait. In one video, released by China’s Eastern Theater Command, troops rehearsed a landing on a beach on Hainan, the island off China’s southern coast whose geography is similar to Taiwan’s. Since then, China has repeatedly tested Taiwan’s defenses with air and sea patrols. Twice last month, squadrons of fighters and bombers crossed the unofficial median line over the Taiwan Strait, which both Taiwan and China have largely observed for decades. China’s tone boiled over with two visits by American officials, including one in August by Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, who was the most senior official to visit since the United States recognized the People’s Republic of China in 1979. Chinese officials repeatedly denounced American support for Taiwan, saying it nurtured pro-independence sentiment on the island. Beijing seems particularly alarmed by a renewed political debate in Washington about whether the United States should explicitly state its willingness to defend Taiwan from a military attack. The Global Times editorial suggested that a higher-level visit, by the secretary of state or defense, would give China reason to respond with force. A harsher tone has spread not only in state media, but also among Chinese academics and analysts with government-linked think tanks who influence policy debates. Zhu Songling, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said in a telephone interview that the Trump administration was testing “China’s bottom line.” “The United States has been playing the Taiwan cards too often and with too much intensity,” he said. An editorial by the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Unification recounted the wars in Korea, in India in 1962 and in Vietnam in 1979 to warn that China would not be intimidated. “The United States, India, and Vietnam have all experienced strategic misjudgments in their military contests with China, and they have paid irreparable prices,” it said. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, argued in an article that the risks of conflict over the island were rising. He said, in a telephone interview, that China could deter Taiwan and the United States from underestimating its resolve by declaring its willingness to use force if pushed. “The United States unfortunately may mislead Tsai Ing-wen to misjudge the strategic situation,” Professor Shen said. “In an extreme situation, every country has a right to shoot first.” Others are pushing back against escalatory rhetoric, warning that it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “The ‘wolf warrior spirit’ is contrary to Chinese traditional culture,” Yuan Nansheng, a former Chinese diplomat who is now with the China Institute of International Studies, wrote in a paper published in late September. “If it entraps public opinion, the consequences will be worrisome.” Claire Fu and Chris Buckley contributed research and reporting.']","As the United States and Taiwan draw closer, state propaganda is sending the message that China will go to war if necessary."
The U.S. and Europe lag on implementing an essential weapon against the virus: contact tracing.,2020-10-03,By Benjamin Mueller,"['Experts have warned that fall will be a uniquely challenging time for combating the pandemic, yet one of the most essential tools for stemming the spread of the coronavirus still has not been widely deployed in the United States and Europe. While Western nations vowed repeatedly to develop “world-beating” contact tracing and testing operations at the onset of the pandemic, counting and monitoring people who have been exposed to the virus, and who may expose others, has rarely been effectively implemented. Beholden to privacy rules, Western officials largely trusted people to hand over names to contact tracers. But that trust was not repaid, in large part because governments neglected services that were crucial to winning people’s cooperation: a fast and accurate testing system, and guarantees that people would be housed, fed and paid while they isolated. Elected officials presented the system as a critical bridge between lockdown and a vaccine, allowing them to contain small outbreaks without shutting down large parts of society. But construction of that bridge has been rocky at best. “Public health leaders fell in love with the idea of contact tracing as an important tactic — and it is — but that’d be like if you’re going into war and were just talking about the tanks,” said Brian Castrucci, president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a public health charity in Maryland. The West’s public health systems have not matched the success in parts of East Asia where the fear of epidemics became more ingrained after SARS appeared in 2002 and MERS was identified in 2012. In England, people are neither handing over many contacts — about five, on average — nor following the rules. “It suggests there is some degree of skepticism in the population to engagement,” said Professor Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, an adviser to the British government’s tracing program, referring to the proportion of known cases — a fifth — who handed over no other names.

"In U.K.’s Test and Trace: Now You See ’em, Now You Don’t",2020-10-05,By Mark Landler and Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “world beating” test-and-trace program has been dogged by technical glitches, overburdened laboratories and poorly trained contact tracers. Now, add to that a data-entry error more likely to trip up an amateur bookkeeper than the public health service of the world’s sixth-largest economy. Nearly 16,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus between Sept. 25 and Oct. 2 were not recorded in the nation’s daily number of reported cases, producing an artificially low picture of the spread of the virus and delaying efforts to trace those with whom the infected people had been in contact. The disclosure brought a storm of criticism on the Johnson government, which has been on the defensive for its haphazard handling of the pandemic since March, when Mr. Johnson hesitated for days before imposing a nationwide lockdown. More than 57,000 people have died from the virus in Britain, the highest number in Europe, and the country is now facing a second wave of infections. “This incident should never have happened,” the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said to Parliament on Monday, promising that the government would conduct an investigation and upgrade its outmoded computer systems. That did not mollify the opposition Labour Party, which seized on the latest glitch as evidence of the government’s serial incompetence. “This isn’t just a shambles,” said the Labour shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, jabbing his finger at Mr. Hancock. “It is so much worse than this.” For a pandemic-ravaged country, the computer error was not the only bit of unnerving news. Government officials said that fewer than half of Britons should expect to be vaccinated, even after a vaccine was widely available. Britain’s goal is to vaccinate about 30 million people, less than half the population, the head of the government’s vaccine task force, Kate Bingham, told the Financial Times. The priority would be the most vulnerable people, hospital and nursing-home workers, and those over the age of 50. Children and young people, who are considered less at risk from the disease, would not be vaccinated. The data-entry error, officials at Public Health England said, occurred because some of the Excel files containing the names of people who tested positive were too large to transfer to a central computer system. When they were transferred, the system simply lopped off a chunk of the names. Officials said they fixed the problem by splitting up the files and transferring smaller amounts of data. The glitch did not affect when people were informed of their positive test results, according to officials. Nor did the missing data prevent the government from imposing restrictions in hard-hit parts of the country. But it did delay the contact-tracing process, which depends on rapid response to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus. “The timing of it couldn’t be worse,” said Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. “You’re heading into winter, and we already knew that cases were rising. This is really when you’d need your test-and-trace system to do its work.” Instead, she said, virtually every part of the system has broken down. Apart from the data error, people were being sent to testing sites hundreds of miles from where they lived, and tests came back from the labs too slowly amid a huge backlog of untested samples. Public compliance with the program has remained sluggish: In a survey of 32,000 people living in Britain, less than one in five people who reported coronavirus symptoms said they had stayed home. Of those alerted that they had been close to an infected person, only one in 10 said they had complied with orders to self-isolate. Britain reported 12,594 new cases on Monday — a number that did not include the backdated cases, which had been added to Sunday’s numbers. Many of the new cases are in the northwest, in cities like Manchester, where there are large numbers of university students. Officials said that adding back the missing cases brought the rate of spread to within the government’s projections. “To be frank, I think that the slightly lower numbers that we’d seen didn’t really reflect where we thought that the disease was likely to go, so I think these numbers are realistic,” Mr. Johnson said to reporters on Monday. The prime minister’s subdued response belied the dangerous moment Britain faces, with cases rising and the country still unable to get an accurate gauge on where, and how quickly, the virus is spreading. Pouncing on local outbreaks depends on testing and tracking cases down to the level of single office buildings and neighborhoods. But almost since England’s contact tracing program was unveiled in May, it has been bedeviled by problems with access to testing data, making it impossible in some cases for local officials to keep track of the virus. For weeks, a network of privately run testing sites processed tens of thousands of daily tests, and the government did not share detailed results with local officials. Only testing results from public hospitals were being quickly shared. Public health officials said they were left to catch wind of outbreaks from the news. Local council officials pleaded for location-specific testing results, only for the central government to deny them on the grounds that they had not signed the proper data protection agreements. Those delays especially gnawed at local officials in northern England, where infection rates remained higher than in London when the nationwide lockdown was lifted, leaving them exposed to higher risk before an effective data-sharing system was in place. In Leicester, where the central government imposed a second lockdown in late June, officials said that the government had denied them testing data on the grounds that “it hadn’t been cleaned.” Government officials said the data processing had not yet been automated at that point, causing delays, which local officials said led to a surge in cases. Some local officials bristled on Monday at having been denied access to testing results because of data security policies while the contact tracing program was in fact, according to British news reports, storing test results in Excel spreadsheets. The fragile infrastructure behind England’s contact tracing program came into stark relief in mid-August, when a weekly government report revealed that “a temporary infrastructure issue” had created a delay in people with positive test results being entered into the contact tracing system. The magazine New Scientist later reported that an internet outage in southern England had created problems with the contact tracing program’s digital infrastructure, causing delays of up to a week in tracers being able to call the contacts of thousands of newly infected patients.']","Nearly 16,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus disappeared from the records, another embarrassing failure for a much-criticized effort."
"Despite Crises, India Fixes Its Gaze on a Bollywood Tragedy",2020-10-03,By Shalini Venugopal Bhagat,"['NEW DELHI — A rising young movie star meets a tragic end. His family blames his death on his glamorous girlfriend. As she sits in jail, her friends proclaiming her innocence, the police hint at a shadowy network of money laundering and illegal drugs deep within the world of show business. India has been captivated by the story of Sushant Singh Rajput, a 34-year-old actor whose death has been ruled a suicide by the police in Mumbai. News outlets have focused on every twist in a tale that for many encapsulates Bollywood’s hypocrisy and elitism. Three federal agencies are investigating whether his girlfriend, the actress Rhea Chakraborty, gave him marijuana and was involved in Bollywood drug dealing and money laundering. The police are interviewing other Bollywood actresses. Ms. Chakraborty’s attorney said the police had found no evidence to support their allegations. The scandal has puzzled and infuriated social critics. With hard proof lacking, they say, the investigation and coverage appear to be fueled by institutional misogyny, a taboo against discussion of mental health issues and an increasingly partisan news media. In fact, many of the media outlets sympathetic to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have focused on the story at the expense of bigger problems. India may soon surpass the United States as the world leader in Covid-19 infections. Its economy is in a tailspin. An increasingly bellicose China is testing its borders. The investigation has become an election issue in Mr. Rajput’s home state of Bihar, which is controlled by an ally of Mr. Modi. The state’s chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has criticized the police in Mumbai, which is controlled by a rival coalition, and he has promised Bihar voters, who go to the polls in the coming weeks, that he would uncover the truth behind Mr. Rajput’s death. Still, even many outlets critical of Mr. Modi could not resist the story. “I think it suits the government to use news television as a weapon of mass distraction,” said Vir Sanghvi, a journalist, talk-show host and media critic. Nevertheless, he added, high ratings “show that there is a great hunger for this kind of news among viewers.” India is hardly alone in turning to celebrity news to distract from real-world problems. For many Indians, Mr. Rajput’s story also taps into a rising sense of anti-elitism. Many believe he was driven to suicide by a clubby culture of Bollywood insiders. Bihar is one of India’s poorer states, and they see Mr. Rajput as a rare outsider who broke into the industry but was held back from even greater stardom. “The condition of the economy due to the coronavirus or other issues is in front of all of us,” said Jaya Mukherjee, a 28-year-old school counselor in Delhi who has followed the developments. “We are tense, but we can’t avoid injustice, which happened to Sushant.” Others believe Mr. Rajput did not commit suicide. Some people, including his family, believe he was killed. On Saturday, a government medical board ruled his death was by suicide. Ms. Chakraborty’s allies and experts on Indian society say the explanation for Mr. Rajput’s death is simpler than many people believe, but more difficult for them to talk about. Susan Walker, a psychologist in Mumbai and Mr. Rajput’s therapist, has said that he suffered from bipolar disorder and disputed that Ms. Chakraborty had anything to do with his death. “In India, depression is a serious illness that has spread like an epidemic, but there is very little discussion about his illness,” said Ashis Nandy, a psychologist and social critic, referring to Mr. Rajput. “It has been artificially blown up to turn it into a political circus.” Ms. Walker could not be reached for comment. Mr. Rajput’s family has complained to Indian medical officials that she violated patient confidentiality. Mr. Rajput’s family declined to be interviewed. Vikas Singh, their lawyer, said they believed that he had been killed and that the police in Mumbai bungled the initial investigation. He also said they believed that Mr. Rajput had not suffered from mental health issues until he met Ms. Chakraborty. Mr. Rajput, a versatile actor with an easy smile and chiseled chin, appeared in soap operas before winning a role in the 2013 dramatic film “Kai Po Che!” His performance as a gifted but troubled cricketer earned him a nomination for the Filmfare award, Bollywood’s most prestigious prize, for best male actor debut. He then went on to star in films like “Shuddh Desi Romance,” “MS Dhoni” and “Kedarnath,” several of which were commercial and critical successes. He cultivated an image as a wholesome boy-next-door from Bihar. Mr. Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14. The Mumbai police listed the cause of death as asphyxia by hanging. Online, disbelieving fans blamed Bollywood studios. Kangana Ranaut, a popular actress, helped put the industry under a spotlight with a video released the day after Mr. Rajput’s death that disputed the idea that he had been depressed, even as it accused studio bigwigs of driving him to suicide. Ms. Ranaut is a high-profile supporter of Mr. Modi, and her criticism helped galvanize his supporters to press for answers. Mr. Rajput’s death also sent ripples through the news media. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which Mr. Modi leads, has sought to influence and cajole India’s traditionally cacophonous newspapers and broadcasters. Though the government has sometimes shut down outlets critical of its policies, it also uses more subtle ways to direct coverage, like granting or withdrawing government advertising money. Stories about Mr. Rajput nosed out headlines about spreading infections or shuttered shops and factories. The result was ratings gold: Republic Bharat, a new broadcast outlet often sympathetic to Mr. Modi’s party, surged to the top of the Hindi-language news ratings in August. Its editors did not respond to requests for comment. Attention turned to Ms. Chakraborty, who had been dating the actor for more than a year. Mr. Rajput’s father, K.K. Singh, filed a police complaint against Ms. Chakraborty, her parents and her brother alleging abetment to suicide, theft, cheating and wrongful confinement. In India, driving someone to suicide carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.  Ms. Chakraborty became the target of vicious attacks online, including rape and death threats, as well as on TV channels. The coverage prompted the Press Council of India, a self-regulating press watchdog, to warn the media not to “conduct its own parallel trial.” “She was unable to work, to socialize, because she felt that she needed to be with him and look after him,” said one friend, Shibani Dandekar, a singer and actress. “The vicious media trial hasn’t even given her a chance to grieve for him.” Ms. Chakraborty was arrested last month on suspicion of buying and supplying marijuana to Mr. Rajput as well as financing illicit traffic, a nonbailable offense. Satish Maneshinde, Ms. Chakraborty’s lawyer, said that no drugs had been found in her possession and that the police lacked evidence. The police have 180 days to file charges. Some lawyers and women’s groups have come to Ms. Chakraborty’s defense, saying that female defendants often face hostile reactions when their cases become media sensations. “The subtext is always deeply, deeply misogynistic,” said Rebecca John, a lawyer who successfully defended parents accused of murdering their child in an earlier case. “It’s been getting much worse in the past 10 to 12 years, and that’s very disturbing.” And in this case, the coverage has overshadowed issues of national importance. On Aug. 31, the government released data showing the economy had shrunk by nearly a quarter. A talk show broadcast by Republic TV, a Republic Bharat sister station, led with the death of a former president and the disclosure of the contents of Mr. Rajput’s WhatsApp chats, which it labeled “today’s biggest story.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the United States at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

"After 30 Years, East and West Germans Wonder: How United Are We?",2020-10-03,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Robert Hellmundt was born in East Germany in 1989, the year that the Berlin Wall fell. Some two decades later, he decided to quit the East after graduating from university, like so many of his generation looking for brighter futures, and move to the capital of a reunified Germany. But after only three years in Berlin, he moved back to his home state of Thuringia, convinced that it was the best place in Germany for him and his business partner to base their start-up, which offers products aimed at improving hand-sanitizing practices. “We realized that it was much more advantageous in Thuringia,” Mr. Hellmundt said. As Germany commemorates three decades as a united country, most people on both sides of the former border consider the reunification project a success. Living standards have risen. The mass exodus from East to West has been halted and even reversed. Chancellor Angela Merkel, an easterner who embodies the values of Western liberal democracy, has led the country for half of its existence. But while few people call unity itself into question, surveys show that a clear majority living in the East believe the process remains unfinished. Many question whether the expenditure of 1.6 trillion euros, almost $1.9 trillion, to try to raise living standards in the East to those of the West has been worthwhile. Economic growth in the East still lags that of the West, and many easterners are expressing their discontent by supporting the anti-immigrant, far-right Alternative for Germany party. The German government acknowledges that there is still work to be done. “The historically unique challenge of bringing together two long separated parts of a country, was tackled through many projects and measures,” the government said this year in its annual progress report on the state of reunification. “Not all of them proved to be successful and sustainable.” It added: “There was no overall ‘master plan’ for this.” We looked at some of those projects and measures, what they have achieved, and what still needs to be done. The start-up founded by Mr. Hellmundt and his partner in the eastern city of Jena received more than 300,000 euros, or $350,000, in public financial incentives, part of an effort to help strengthen the economy in the East by attracting young companies. After reunification, the East lost a generation of young people fleeing soaring unemployment to seek jobs and a future in the West after 94 percent of state-owned companies in the region were sold or shuttered. Since then, living standards have gradually been catching up with the West, but differences remain. A full-time employee in the states of the former East Germany, where economic output lags the West by 70 percent, earns 15 percent less on average for the same job as a Western counterpart, according to government figures. None of Germany’s publicly traded companies have their headquarters in the East, and the region trails in investment in research, development, machines and factories. The population drain stopped in 2013 and has recently begun to show signs of reversing. But the region lost 1.3 million people in the first decades after reunification, a shortfall that will take years to recover from — if ever. Young families remain scarce, meaning there are fewer people paying taxes or having children. Compounding the problem is a widespread hostility to foreigners in the former East, making it less attractive to asylum-seekers, but also other immigrants looking for work who may have skills that are in demand. Only 8.2 percent of the people living in the former East are minorities, or have an immigrant background, government figures show. In recent years, there has been a spate of racist attacks, like an assault on a synagogue and kebab shop in Halle last year, and anti-immigrant riots in Chemnitz in 2018. “Demographic development is the Achilles’ heel of East Germany,” said Klaus-Heiner Röhl, an economist with the German Economic Institute. To attract more people to the region, the federal government has created thousands of public-service jobs, and is offering incentives to lure entrepreneurs and start-ups like Heyfair, Mr. Hellmundt’s company. “Because of the lower cost of living, we could hire equally qualified employees at lower salaries there than in Berlin or Munich,” Mr. Hellmundt said. “And be part of a growing scene.” The biggest disruption to the political landscape since reunification has been the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has its power base in the former East. Alternative for Germany is the second-largest party in several eastern states, and in both Saxony and Thuringia it is the most popular among voters under 30. Six in 10 Germans overall see reunification as a success, according to a YouGov survey of 2,034 people. But more than eight in 10 people in the former East Germany consider reunification incomplete, and one in three see it as a failure. While Germany as a whole has seen a rise of far-right extremism and activity,  the popularity of Alternative for Germany among voters in the East has helped to shift society there as a whole to the right. It was in the East that the party first won seats in regional legislatures in 2014, and it went on to receive 13 percent of the vote in the 2017 general election, propelled by Eastern voters to become the largest opposition party in Parliament. Those East Germans who do not view reunification as a success reflect the bitterness that remains three decades after the project came into being on Oct. 3, 1990. Many of them look back with nostalgia at what was lost — state protections like guaranteed jobs and free child care — when their freedom was gained. While some who lived in the former East Germany now lament what has been lost to reunification, one area where the norms of the East persisted — and traveled West — is in the role of women in society. East Germany granted women the right to work and equal pay in 1949, and later introduced benefits like a paid year of maternity leave and full-time state-funded child care. But those were ended after West German norms were adopted following reunification. By contrast, women in the former West Germany have struggled to break from traditional gender roles, with men working and women staying home to care for the family. In the East, 74 percent of women work, compared with 68 percent in the West. But a recent study by researchers from University College London and Queen Mary University of London found that as women from the East moved west to find jobs, they brought with them the values of the more egalitarian culture into which they were born. The finding reflects a shift in western German society, making it more socially acceptable for women to balance a family with a career. “We looked at East German women working at firms in the West, and found that they still behaved pretty much like East Germans, despite their environment,” said Anna Raute, an assistant professor at Queen Mary. Since Ms. Merkel took office in 2005, Germany has made considerable investments in shared parental leave and child care, creating new norms to be shared by the generation growing up in a united Germany. Just on Thursday, her party announced that it would earmark 500 million euros to expand after-hours care for elementary schoolchildren. “German reunification, and the peaceful revolution that led to it, is one of the strongest symbols of peace, rationality and reconciliation in the history of the world,” said Mr. Hellmundt, the entrepreneur who moved back to the East. “You would really have to bend reality to not view it as a success.”']","With Germany now an established, reunified democracy, it is taking stock of what is working and what still needs work, especially as the economy continues to lag in the former East."

Trump says he is pulling the plug on stimulus talks.,2020-10-06,By Emily Cochrane,"['President Trump on Tuesday abruptly ended talks with Democrats on an economic stimulus bill, sending the stock market sliding and dealing a final blow to an intensive set of on-again-off-again negotiations to deliver additional pandemic aid to struggling Americans before the November elections. Mr. Trump announced that he was pulling the plug on the effort in a series of afternoon tweets in which he accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California of “not negotiating in good faith"" and urged Senate Republicans to focus solely on confirming his nominee to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks. Instead, Mr. Trump said that he had instructed Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to stop negotiating, sending the S&P 500 down as much as 1 percent in the immediate aftermath of his tweet. It had been up more than half a percent in the moments before. The index closed down 1.40 percent for the day. “Our Economy is doing very well,” Mr. Trump tweeted as the market fell. “The Stock Market is at record levels, JOBS and unemployment also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the World in Economic Recovery, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin, who had previously been scheduled to speak later Tuesday afternoon, briefly spoke after Mr. Trump’s tweet, with Mr. Mnuchin confirming that the president had discontinued talks and Ms. Pelosi expressing disappointment “in the President’s decision to abandon the economic & health needs of the American people,” Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said on Twitter. The president’s move came not long after Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had made his latest urgent plea for additional stimulus, warning that a failure by Congress to inject more federal help into the economy would risk weakening the recovery. The announcement came after the president had spoken by phone with Mr. Mnuchin, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, according to two people briefed on the conversation. Ms. Pelosi had told lawmakers on a private caucus call moments before Mr. Trump’s tweets that Democrats were “waiting for them to approve our language to crush the virus and how we put money in the pockets of the American people,” according to a Democratic aide on the call, who disclosed her remarks on condition of anonymity. In a statement after the president’s tweets, Ms. Pelosi accused him of showing “his contempt for science, his disdain for our heroes — in health care, first responders, sanitation, transportation, food workers, teachers, teachers, teachers and others.” Mr. Trump, in tweets later Tuesday night, appeared to backtrack on his assertion that an agreement would wait until after Nov. 3. at one point urging both chambers to “IMMEDIATELY Approve” reviving a lapsed loan program for small businesses, funds to prevent airlines from furloughing or laying off workers and another round of stimulus checks.']",
Montenegro’s most prominent cleric has tested positive.,2020-10-07,By Isabella Kwai,"['The most prominent religious leader in Montenegro, who once described a pilgrimage as “God’s vaccine,” has tested positive for the coronavirus and is in stable condition, his representatives said on Wednesday. Amfilohije Radovic, the Serbian Orthodox metropolitan bishop of Montenegro and the Littoral, was given the diagnosis Tuesday after a routine health check, and was taken to Podgorica, the capital. The metropolitan, who is 82, was feeling well and was under the “constant care of doctors,” a statement on his website said. The Serbian Orthodox Church, by far the largest Christian denomination in Montenegro, has more than 8 million adherents worldwide, most of them in Bosnia, Montenegro or Serbia. About three-quarters of Montenegrins are Serbian Orthodox. During a sermon in May, as pilgrims honored a 17th-century bishop in Podgorica, Metropolitan Radovic told believers that while a coronavirus vaccine would be welcome, “there’s a vaccine here which has acted through the centuries,” Reuters reported. The metropolitan was seen forgoing a face mask at public events. A controversial figure who wields significant influence, Metropolitan Radovic has clashed with civil authorities in the country over allegations that some religious services have violated coronavirus restrictions. Earlier this year, he organized protests against a much-debated law that gave the state ownership of some religious buildings and estates. Antigovernment feeling roused by the protests played a part in unseating the Democratic Party of Socialists, led by President Milo Djukanovic, in elections in August. The virus is spreading as quickly now in Montenegro as it has at any time during the pandemic.

Kyrgyzstan in Chaos After Protesters Seize Government Buildings,2020-10-06,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan plunged into political chaos on Tuesday after opposition groups seized control of Parliament and released their imprisoned leaders in protests over parliamentary elections they called rigged. Under mounting pressure from the protesters, the country’s Central Electoral Commission annulled the results of the Sunday vote, a day after having awarded the majority of seats to two political parties with ties to the president, Sooronbai Jeenbekov. Overnight, a small group of protesters broke away from the main body and tried to gain entry to the White House, the main government building that houses the Parliament and the presidential administration, in Bishkek, the capital. After the police tried to disperse them, hundreds more joined in the assault and soon took control, according to photos and video footage from the scene. On Tuesday, the streets of Bishkek were littered with burned out cars and piles of stones, while photos emerged of the broken down gates to the White House. Inside the building, videos and photos showed broken glass and piles of debris, including government papers, with protesters wandering the offices. In the city, residents formed volunteer brigades to deter looters. One person was killed and at least 680 injured during the protests, the country’s Health Ministry said. Mr. Jeenbekov, who was elected to a six-year term in 2017, said in a statement that the protesters had attempted to “illegally seize power, ” and he urged them to disperse peacefully. Mr. Jeenbekov also said he was willing to meet with the leaders of all 16 parties that had competed in the election, in an effort to ease the tensions. But the president made no public appearances, his whereabouts were unknown, and it was not clear that he was still in control of the situation, as protesters captured more government buildings, according to reports from local news websites, and started appointing their own government officials. The mayors of Bishkek, and the country’s second leading city, Osh, said they were resigning. The opposition freed Mr. Jeenbekov’s predecessor, Almazbek Atambayev, who had been serving an 11-year sentence on corruption charges he had denounced as politically motivated. The opposition also freed several other incarcerated political figures, including two former prime ministers. The convulsions in Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous landlocked former Soviet republic of 6.3 million people, represent another fracture in a region that Russia considers part of its sphere of influence. Together with the political crisis in Belarus, simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine and new hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, the problems among Russia’s neighbors seem to be spreading. “Russia is interested in maintaining internal stability in Kyrgyzstan, its strategic partner and ally,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a statement aimed at calming the crisis. “We call on all political forces in this critical moment to be wise and responsible in order to preserve internal stability and safety.” Mr. Atambayev had made the decision to close the American military facility in Kyrgyzstan that from 2001 to 2014 supported American military operations in Afghanistan. Under Mr. Atambayev, Kyrgyzstan became a member of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. Like Mr. Atambayev, Mr. Jeenbekov, his successor, also tried to maintain good relations with Moscow. Political analysts attributed the Kyrgyzstan crisis partly to the longstanding political, economic and ethnic cleavage between the country’s agrarian south and more developed north. Disruptions in the fragile north-south coexistence have been a chronic source of upheaval in the country. Arkady Dubnov, a Central Asia analyst and commentary contributor to the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Mr. Jeenbekov, who is from the south, was seen as having essentially broken that coexistence. The parliamentary election results gave 100 of the body’s 120 seats to representatives from the south aligned with him. The critics from the north accused their southern adversaries of a corrupt vote and sent the entire political system off the rails, Mr. Dubnov said. “In Kyrgyzstan, there is no opposition-government dynamics,” he said. “Instead, there is a King of the Hill game. Today you are on top, that means that you are government.” By nightfall, Kyrgyzstan’s government seemed to have descended into near anarchy as political factions failed to unify around a single leader. Different groups claimed to occupy the same government posts. Despite reports that Kubatbek Boronov, the prime minister, had resigned, there was no official confirmation. In a further sign of confusion, parliament members made a failed attempt to choose a new prime minister, frustrated partly by factions that were holding meetings in separate locations — a cinema and a hotel. Two rival politicians declared themselves to be the country’s prosecutor general, even though the official holder of that office theoretically remained on the job. The chaos had an immediate chilling effect on the already struggling economy of the country, where an estimated third of the people live in poverty and a main source of income is remittances from citizens working abroad. Offices of businesses were raided. Banks removed cash from A.T.M.s. Political factions also tried to capture television channels, causing some to stop broadcasting. Bordered by China but strategically aligned with Russia, Kyrgyzstan has been a focus of geopolitical rivalry between Moscow, Beijing and Washington and other players since it gained independence after the Soviet collapse in 1991. Over the past 15 years of Kyrgyzstan’s recurrent political strife, two of its presidents have been toppled in violent revolts. In contrast to other major conflicts in the former Soviet space, however, Kyrgyzstan’s crisis appears to have no broader geopolitical element. “This mess is completely internal,” said Mr. Dubnov. “The only geopolitical dimension has to do with the economy — Kyrgyzstan is broke.”']",The country’s electoral agency annulled the results of Sunday’s disputed parliamentary elections and the president offered to mediate. But it remained unclear who was in control.
‘It Really Was Abandonment’: Virus Crisis Grips British Universities,2020-10-06,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Inside a dormitory now known by students as H.M.P., for Her Majesty’s Prison, trash piled up in shared kitchens. Students washed their clothes in bathroom sinks. Security guards stalked the gates, keeping anyone from leaving or entering. The building had been primed for a coronavirus outbreak since first-year students arrived at Manchester Metropolitan University for Freshers’ Week, Britain’s debaucherous baptism into university life, complete with trips to crowded pubs and dorm room parties. But when the inevitable happened, and the virus tore through chockablock student suites, the university largely left students on their own: It imposed such a draconian lockdown that students had to nurse roommates back to health, parents drove hours to deliver food and lawyers offered pro bono help. To date, roughly 90 British universities have reported coronavirus cases. Thousands of students are confined to their halls, some in suites with infected classmates, and many are struggling to get tested. The government, fearful of students seeding outbreaks far from campus, has warned that they may need to quarantine before returning home for Christmas. Britain had ample warning: The reopening of American colleges weeks earlier reportedly swelled the country’s case count by 3,000 a day and left several students dead. But British universities beckoned students to campus anyway, fueling outbreaks that are seeping into surrounding towns. The infection rate in Manchester is ten times as high as it was in August. The outbreaks have shone a harsh light on Britain’s decade-long campaign to turn higher education into a ruthless market. By cutting state grants and leaving schools dependent on tuition fees and room rents, the government encouraged them to jam more students onto campuses. The pandemic threatened to dry out that income stream. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government largely withheld the rescue money it gave to other industries, so universities carried on as normal, whatever the risks. To academics, the government’s policies reflect not only its erratic and fumbling approach to the coronavirus, but also its longstanding suspicions of universities. Echoing American ideas about the supposed coddling of left-wing students, some Conservative lawmakers in Britain have accused universities of stifling politically incorrect speech, and threatened a crackdown. “There’s a lot of money being splashed around on other parts of the economy, but the government isn’t offering universities any money,” said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. “The relevant people in government see universities as antagonists, political antagonists, and people like me as the enemy.” The situation was complicated by a scandal over university entrance exams this summer. After initially using an algorithm that lowered many students’ scores, the government revised them upward. That created an unexpected influx into more prestigious universities, as students abandoned places in less competitive ones, said Dr. Gavan Conlon, a partner at London Economics, an education economics consulting firm. Some schools abruptly lost enrollment and revenue, but many became more crowded than ever. That made it impossible for Britain’s universities to implement the sort of on-campus social distancing that American colleges have used to try to contain the virus. At Manchester Metropolitan, a 33,000-student campus, at least 137 students were quickly infected and 1,500 freshmen forced to isolate. Supplied with little more than a single mask each, some first-year students watched their food supplies dwindle and trash and laundry accumulate when coronavirus cases forced their suites into isolation. Lucia Dorado, a freshman, recalled leaving meals and tea at a suitemate’s door, and watching students keep partying in the courtyard. “It really was abandonment,” Ms. Dorado said of the university. “They put in barely anything to battle this, and it’s come at the expense of our mental and physical health, really.” The university said in a statement that shortly after the lockdown, it gave students a two-week rent rebate and an online shopping voucher, and later helped send them home testing kits. It said it had reopened in part because “the government places a high priority on universities staying open,” but on Tuesday moved most courses online for October, in keeping with guidance from Manchester public health officials. The British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies forecast the difficulties on Sept. 3, saying it was “highly likely there will be significant outbreaks” at universities. But neither mass testing nor additional government money was in the offing, and universities feared losing students to competitors if they shut campuses or mandated online classes. “The government has been deafeningly silent,” said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester, “and has been looking to basically foist the initiative back on universities.” The financial pressures on universities grew out of a Conservative-led overhaul of British higher education in 2010, when the government slashed subsidies and tripled the cap on tuition fees to 9,000 pounds, or $11,600. The government later lifted a limit on how many students a university could recruit, transforming a higher education system that had once been the reserve of the middle and upper classes and creating fierce competition for students. Rental fees rose as universities scrambled to build dormitories, often with loans: From 2012 to 2019, the overall average student rent rose by 31 percent, to 147 pounds, or $190, a week. And universities began aggressively recruiting higher-paying foreign students, especially from China, to compensate for the government keeping its cap on domestic students’ tuition virtually unchanged since 2010. The growing reliance on student payments left universities dangerously exposed when the coronavirus landed, said Peter Dolton, an economics professor at the University of Sussex. Fearing that huge numbers of students would stay home this fall, or demand lower fees if classes moved online, almost all universities reopened. The decision left professors demoralized; some have felt pressure to teach in-person classes and others have described feeling uneasy about a semester that they say is being staged for transparently financial reasons. Students, too, said it had become all too clear why they were on campus. “Students are money in the bank, and as long as we’re on campus they’ll worry about the consequences later,” said Aslan Warburton, a freshman at Manchester Metropolitan. “The financial side has taken priority over student well-being and the greater good.” When freshmen arrived at Manchester Metropolitan last month, some were taken aback by what they described as lax coronavirus precautions. Security guards in residence halls were not wearing masks. Nor did the university seem to be enforcing any kind of social distancing on the constant drumbeat of dormitory parties. While university-sanctioned events moved online, parties and drinking did not. At the time, the British government was encouraging people to patronize restaurants and pubs — limited, in theory, to groups of six or fewer — and students eagerly complied. “There was the six-person rule,” said Grace Davis, a Manchester Metroplitan freshman, “but the bars were quite lenient about it. You could bend the rules a little bit. It was normal.” Some students fully expected to get sick. Tom Gleave, a Manchester Metropolitan freshman, said he and his suite mates discussed it before they got to campus, where they all caught the virus. “I think we all had the same concerns: It’s going to happen, and if it does, we’d rather all get it at the same time,” he said. “It’d be a lot more disruptive later.” With 10 freshmen to a suite in many cases, sharing a kitchen and bathrooms, students’ living arrangements have made stopping the virus’s spread virtually impossible. Nationwide shortages of tests meant that even students self-isolating with infected classmates struggled to get tested. For Britain, where the Covid-19 death toll stands at 58,000, the highest in Europe, the pandemic has forced a reckoning with the government’s treatment of higher education, even as the country’s universities make crucial advances in the race for a vaccine. “The question is, is the market an appropriate means to operate higher education?” Prof. Fielding said. “These assumptions about students as consumers fueled the imperative to get them on campus.” Despite calls from the opposition Labour Party to halt in-person classes, most British universities have resisted moving all classes online. But in the hardest-hit cities, there are signs that universities are beginning to restrict classroom teaching. And with the fees for many students becoming ineligible for refunds soon, some professors suspect that universities may wait until students’ money is in hand before taking more aggressive precautions.

2 Men Found Guilty of Aiding 2013 Kenya Mall Attack,2020-10-07,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — A court in Kenya on Wednesday found two men guilty for their role in an assault on an upscale mall in the capital, Nairobi, that killed 67 people in 2013, the first convictions in one of the deadliest terror attacks in the country’s history. The men — Mohamed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafah — were found guilty of charges including conspiracy to commit terrorism and aiding the Qaeda-linked Shabab terrorist group. A third man, Liban Abdullah Omar, was acquitted of all charges. A fourth, Adan Dheq, was released last year because of a lack of evidence. The ruling comes seven years after the attack on the Westgate mall, in which Shabab gunmen killed 67 people from 13 countries, wounding 175 others. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi of the Milimani law courts in Nairobi delivered the judgment, which had been delayed multiple times. A court translator gave the verdict, which took four hours to read, in Somali to the accused, who are all ethnic Somalis. “Their defenses and denials that they had any links that were associated with the act that were committed by the attackers is without substance and I dismiss it,” the chief magistrate said. “They were acting in concert with the attackers.” The Westgate mall was a symbol of Kenya’s growing middle class, a place where affluent couples and families shopped, dined and caught the latest Hollywood and Bollywood movies. But it became a scene of terror on a Saturday afternoon in 2013 when it was stormed by militants who fired indiscriminately at the crowds inside and detonated grenades, sending terrified people fleeing for the exits. The mall’s shiny floors were smeared with blood and scattered with lifeless bodies. Witnesses later said that the assailants had picked out non-Muslims for killing. During a four-day siege to clear out the militants, the Kenyan authorities were criticized for an inefficient and disjointed response, with the police and military forces deployed in the mall even firing at each other. Soldiers were caught on camera stealing goods from shops in the ruined mall. Security officers also fired a rocket, leading to the collapse of entire floors in the five-story building, including the rooftop parking lot. Kenyan and Western officials have said that four gunmen from Somalia were involved in the attack, and that all were killed during the siege. But an independent report by the New York Police Department suggested that some of the gunmen might have escaped during the siege. The two convicted on Wednesday were found by the court to have provided support to the gunmen who carried out the attack. Those activities included communicating with the assailants, knowingly supporting the commission of a terrorist act and possessing materials connected to a terrorism offense. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 22 and face decades in prison. The Shabab said that the attack was a reprisal for Kenya’s deployment of troops in Somalia in 2011 as part of the United Nations-backed African Union peacekeeping mission. The assault established the Shabab as a lethal enemy capable of carrying out attacks across Kenya on both civilian and military targets. In 2015, the group killed 148 people, a majority of them students, at a university in northeastern Kenya. That was the country’s deadliest terror attack since Qaeda-linked militants bombed the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people. In 2019, 21 people were killed after the Shabab targeted a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi. In January, Shabab fighters killed three Americans and destroyed a surveillance plane when they stormed a Kenyan military post where U.S. troops were based. On Tuesday, local news media reported that at least eight people had been wounded after attackers suspected of belonging to the Shabab targeted a bus in a town in northeastern Kenya near the border with Somalia. The Shabab have also continued to wreak havoc in Somalia, bombing foreign military bases, killing civilians and striking hotels and restaurants. In December, the group was accused of detonating an explosives-laden truck in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, that killed 82 people, including university students. Last month, another truck bombing linked to the group in southern Somalia killed three Somali military officers and wounded three others, including an American service member. For many Kenyans, the siege on Westgate and the subsequent attacks on Kenyan soil highlight how the Shabab remains a potent threat, willing to advance its ambitions at whatever cost, said Murithi Mutiga, project director for the Horn of Africa at the nonprofit International Crisis Group. But while “today’s verdict will offer a measure of solace to the victims,” Mr. Mutiga said, many people in Kenya were still hoping for “a more permanent end to the threat of militancy.”']",The verdicts came seven years after 67 people were killed by Shabab militants at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi.
"Venezuela, Once an Oil Giant, Reaches the End of an Era",2020-10-07,"By Sheyla Urdaneta, Anatoly Kurmanaev, Isayen Herrera and Adriana Loureiro Fernandez","['CABIMAS, Venezuela — For the first time in a century, there are no rigs searching for oil in Venezuela. Wells that once tapped the world’s largest crude reserves are abandoned or left to flare toxic gases that cast an orange glow over depressed oil towns. Refineries that once processed oil for export are rusting hulks, leaking crude that blackens shorelines and coats the water in an oily sheen. Fuel shortages have brought the country to a standstill. At gas stations, lines go on for miles. Venezuela’s colossal oil sector, which shaped the country and the international energy market for a century, has come to a near halt, with production reduced to a trickle by years of gross mismanagement and American sanctions. The collapse is leaving behind a destroyed economy and a devastated environment, and, many analysts say, bringing to an end the era of Venezuela as an energy powerhouse. “Venezuela’s days as a petrostate are gone,” said Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. The country that a decade ago was the largest producer in Latin America, earning about $90 billion a year from oil exports, is expected to net about $2.3 billion by this year’s end — less than the aggregate amount that Venezuelan migrants who fled the country’s economic devastation will send back home to support their families, according to Pilar Navarro, a Caracas-based economist. Production is the lowest in nearly a century  after sanctions forced most oil companies to stop drilling for or buying Venezuelan oil — and even that trickle could dry up soon, analysts warn. “Without drilling, without services companies and without money, it’s very difficult to maintain even the current levels of production,” said David Voght, head of IPD Latin America, an oil consulting firm. “If the political situation in the country doesn’t change, you could go to zero.” The decline has diminished beyond recognition a country that just a decade ago rivaled the United States for regional influence. It is also unraveling a national culture defined by oil, a source of cash that once seemed endless; it financed monumental public works and pervasive graft, generous scholarships and flashy shopping trips to Miami. Crippling gasoline shortages have led to an outbreak of dozens of daily protests across most Venezuelan states in recent weeks.  In the capital, Caracas, periodic fuel shipments from Iran, paid for with the country’s remaining gold reserves, provide a semblance of normality for a few weeks at a time. But in the countryside, residents have defied the pandemic lockdown to block roads and clash with police amid their desperate demands for the modicum of fuel they need to survive. Across Venezuela’s oil towns, the sticky black crude that once provided jobs and social mobility is poisoning residents’ livelihoods. In Cabimas, a town on the shores of Lake Maracaibo that was once a center of production for the region’s prolific oil fields, crude seeping from abandoned underwater wells and pipelines coats the crabs that former oil workers haul from the lake with blackened hands. When it rains, oil that has oozed into the sewage system comes up through manholes and drains, coursing with rainwater through the streets, smearing houses and filling the town with its gaseous stench. Cabimas’s desolation marks a swift downfall for a town that just a decade ago was one of the richest in Venezuela. During the boom years, PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, showered the residents of oil towns such as Cabimas with benefits including free food, summer camps and Christmas toys. It built hospitals and schools. Now, the bankrupt company’s tens of thousands of workers have been reduced to dismantling oil facilities for scrap metal and selling their distinctive coveralls, emblazoned with the company logo, to make ends meet. “We used to be kings because we lived on the shores of PDVSA,” said Alexander Rodríguez, a Cabimas fisherman, whose two boat motors have been spiked by an oil spill. “Now we’re cursed.” PDVSA’s social club, where locals used to gather to drink whiskey, play tennis and watch movies, is in ruins, and, like so much in town, smeared in oily, black residue. “There are no jobs, no gasoline, but the oil is spilling everywhere,” said Francisco Barrios, a baker. The end of oil’s central role in Venezuela’s economy is a traumatic reversal for a nation that in many ways defined a petrostate. After major reserves were tapped near Lake Maracaibo in 1914, oil workers from the United States poured into the country. They helped build many Venezuelan cities, and instilled in the country a love of baseball, whiskey and big gas-guzzling cars, differentiating it forever from its South American neighbors. As a driving force in the founding of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960, Venezuela helped Arab nations take control of their oil wealth, shaping the global energy market and the geopolitical order for decades to come. Even in those heady days, Venezuela’s prominent oil minister, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, warned there were pitfalls to sudden oil wealth: It could lead to excessive debt and the destruction of traditional industries. “It is the devil’s excrement,” Mr. Perez Alfonzo famously declared. “We are drowning in the devil’s excrement.” In the years that followed, despite abundant oil revenues, Venezuela faced a roller coaster of recurring debt and financial crises. The wealth also did nothing to diminish corruption or inequality, and when a former paratrooper, Hugo Chávez, appeared on the national stage in the 1990s promising a revolution that would put Venezuela’s oil to work for its poor majority, he captivated the nation. Soon after he was elected president in 1998, Mr. Chávez commandeered the country’s respected state oil company for his radical development program. He fired nearly 20,000 oil professionals, nationalized foreign-owned oil assets and allowed allies to plunder the oil revenues. The troubled industry went into a free fall last year, when the United States accused Mr. Chavez’s successor and protégé, President Nicolás Maduro, of election fraud and enacted severe economic sanctions to force him from power. Soon, Venezuela’s oil partners, bankers and customers broke ties, and output plunged at a pace that has outstripped Iraq’s downturn during both Gulf Wars and Iran’s after its Islamic Revolution. The sanctions forced the last American oil companies in the country to stop drilling. They may leave the country entirely in December, if the Trump administration ends their exemptions from sanctions. Mr. Maduro’s Russian and Chinese partners have not filled the breach, downsizing production and cutting the oil trade, according to workers at the ventures. Venezuela’s opposition, which last year with Western backing challenged Mr. Maduro for the country’s leadership, claims it can rebuild the oil industry once in power by ending American sanctions and offering investors attractive terms. But analysts say Venezuelan oil industry is unlikely to attract the level of investment needed for a full recovery. In an era of stagnating global demand, weak prices and growing environmental concerns, the country’s extra heavy oil is particularly polluting and expensive to process. To compensate for the loss of revenue, Mr. Maduro has turned to illicit gold mining and drug trade to stay in power, according to the United States government. Mr. Maduro’s retreat from oil  has left the shrinking Venezuelan economy comparable to that of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has been plagued by civil strife since independence. But the transition has allowed Mr. Maduro to keep the loyalty of the military and weather the punishing American sanctions, said Ms. Grais-Targow, the analyst. The costs of this economic contraction have been borne by the Venezuelan people, she said. More than five million Venezuelans, or one in six residents, have fled the country since 2015, creating one of the world’s greatest refugee crises, according to the United Nations. The country now has the highest poverty rate in Latin America, overtaking Haiti this year, according to a recent study by Venezuela’s three leading universities. Near Venezuela’s massive coastal refineries, residents forage for firewood and trawl their fishing nets on foot to find food. Their fishing boats are beached without gasoline, and their kitchens have long run out of cooking gas. “If we haven’t reached the rock bottom yet, we’re centimeters from it,” said José Giron, who used to ferry tourists in the beach town of Tucacas, near Venezuela’s three largest refineries. PDVSA has kept minimal production going by sacrificing basic maintenance of equipment, at a growing environmental cost. The country’s Caribbean coast, a great source of national pride with its turquoise water and white-sand beaches, has been damaged by at least four large oil spills this year — an unprecedented number, according to Venezuelan biologists. Gasoline shortages and the pandemic have already emptied Tucacas’s beaches of tourists. Now, the fish that many here rely on for survival are being decimated by the oil. “These spills are the ultimate affront to the people,” said Luis Vargas, who used to sell seafood cocktails to tourists. The great, creeping oil stains are also ravaging Cabimas, in the country’s west, where residents fish the polluted lake on inflated inner tubes and scour decaying oil facilities for a little gasoline. Three people died last month when a scuffle over a leaking gasoline pipeline led to an explosion. For generations, Cabimas residents said they were the proud champions of Venezuela’s oil. They now, too, call it “the devil’s excrement.” Tibisay Romero contributed reporting from Tucacas, Venezuela, and María Ramírez from Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela.']",
"Israel’s Coronavirus Lockdown Fuels Protests, Violence and Confusion",2020-10-05,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM —\xa0Fractured by internal political conflicts, confusing instructions and a lack of public trust in the government, Israel seems to be fraying further under a second national lockdown as the country struggles to cope with a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths that, relative to the size of the population, are among the worst in the world. With new daily cases of the coronavirus reaching up to 9,000 recently, here are some of the main factors contributing to the sense of chaos and loss of control. For months, tens of thousands of demonstrators have been calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is standing trial on corruption charges and has been the focus of blame for many Israelis over the country’s handling of the pandemic. Mr. Netanyahu, a polarizing conservative, has portrayed the protesters as left-wing anarchists and has accused them, without evidence, of spreading the virus in mass gatherings outside his Jerusalem residence. After coronavirus regulations were tightened late last month, the government approved temporary restrictions on the demonstrations, confining protests to groups of up to 20 people wearing masks, standing two meters apart, and gathering no farther than a kilometer, or just over half a mile, from their homes. Critics considered the curbs antidemocratic and found ways to fight back. On Saturday night, hundreds of smaller protests took place all over the country, with the largest gatherings shifting to Tel Aviv.  Protest leaders have vowed to continue. Urging Mr. Netanyahu to resign, many have adopted the Hebrew word for “Go!” as a rallying cry. But there has also been an increase in attacks by those who oppose the demonstrations. In television interviews with anti-Netanyahu protesters, a woman said she had been punched in the face in Tel Aviv and a man said he had been left with a broken arm in Pardes Hana-Karkur, in the north. The police were also accused of violence as they detained or dispersed protesters. On Sunday, the police said that they had detained 38 protesters in the Tel Aviv area overnight and that many had been fined for offenses such as not wearing masks, blocking roads or breaching social distancing orders. Ron Huldai, the 76-year-old mayor of Tel Aviv, who had joined the city’s main protest, went home with a bloodied arm. The government had placed the police in an “impossible position” and turned them into “a political tool,” Mr. Huldai said on Israeli television, adding that the scene had been calm and orderly until officers had moved in with force. Preventing large gatherings, especially in Israel’s crowded ultra-Orthodox areas, was always going to be a challenge during the Jewish High Holy Days, which began on Sept. 18 and extend until Oct. 11. Dr. Ronni Gamzu, Israel’s coronavirus czar, said last week that 40 percent of those testing positive came from the ultra-Orthodox community, even though it makes up only about 13 percent of the population. Even so, some Hasidic sects insisted on holding indoor prayers and large gatherings to celebrate Sukkot, the Jewish harvest holiday. Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, 92, a leading ultra-Orthodox authority, tested positive for the virus last week. The police said that they had closed at least 22 synagogues that were operating illegally over the weekend. Stormy confrontations broke out on Sunday in some ultra-Orthodox areas. In the West Bank settlement of Beitar Illit, police officers were shown on video throwing a bucket at and then aggressively dragging away a boy who was accused of throwing a chunk of concrete at a police vehicle. The police said they would investigate the officers’ conduct. In the cities of Bnei Brak and Jerusalem, crowds clashed with the police overnight. Two officers were wounded when objects were thrown at them, the police said on Monday. One rabbi of an extremist ultra-Orthodox branch told his followers not to fear the authorities and to perform all the usual holiday customs. In a less confrontational scene — which drew much online criticism — police officers received a blessing from a Hasidic rabbi after they arrived to ensure compliance with the lockdown. Even Israelis who have tried to adhere to the regulations have found them confusing. Pressured by interest groups, a largely dysfunctional governing coalition made changes in the dead of night, just before the lockdown took effect in September: A 500-meter limit on movement was extended to 1,000 meters (albeit with a copious list of exceptions), and Israelis were told that they could travel abroad but only with tickets purchased before the lockdown. And no one was given authority to enforce the flight rules. The temporary huts traditionally erected for Sukkot — a weeklong Jewish holiday that comes five days after Yom Kippur — were only to be used by members of the same household. But a last-minute change allowed huts with two of their four sides left open to be considered as outdoor space, allowing groups of up to 20 to enter. The large weddings that were blamed for a surge of infections among Israel’s Arab minority over the summer have subsided, after Arab mayors acted to enforce restrictions on large gatherings. There has been a significant decline in new cases among Arab citizens of Israel, part of a broader downward trend in the rate of new infections in the general population, except in the ultra-Orthodox community, according to Eran Segal, a scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. On Sunday however, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List of predominantly Arab parties and a prominent opposition figure, said he had tested positive for the virus. Just a month ago, Arabs, who make up a fifth of the Israeli population, accounted for about 30 percent of newly infected people. They now only make up about 10 percent of that infection figure, said Aiman Saif, an official working on the response to the virus in the Arab community. Mr. Saif, who called the numbers “encouraging,” attributed the decrease to the general lockdown measures that, among other things, had closed schools. Israel’s governing coalition, led by Mr. Netanyahu in partnership with his defense minister and prime-minister-in-waiting, Benny Gantz, a centrist rival, was formed in May to respond to the pandemic after months of political stalemate. But the government is widely considered a failure. Political differences have prevented a budget from being passed for 2020, and if a deadline in late December is not met, the government will automatically fall and Israelis will be heading back to the polls for the fourth time in two years. The lockdown has only exacerbated the tensions and deepened cracks in the coalition. Asaf Zamir, the tourism minister from Mr. Gantz’s party, resigned on Friday, citing the crackdown on the protests and accusing Mr. Netanyahu of putting his personal interests ahead of the country’s. In a stinging Facebook post, Mr. Zamir wrote that he was unable to serve in a government where he did not “have a shred of trust in the person standing at its head.” “I fear for the country,” he said. “Fear that it is on the edge of absolute rupture.” Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.']","Last month, the country became the first to reimpose nationwide measures. But the decision has led to chaotic scenes and criticism of how its fragile coalition is handling the crisis."
Pompeo’s Message in Japan: Countering China Is Worth Meeting Face to Face,2020-10-06,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — For Japan, it was the first time its new prime minister hosted international emissaries. For the United States, it was the first trip to Asia by its top diplomat in more than a year. So when Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo greeted each other in front of a bank of American and Japanese flags on Tuesday in Tokyo, they exchanged what was surely the longest fist bump in their nations’ seven-decade alliance, a nearly 15-second joining of knuckles. The physicality of the gesture highlighted the importance that both sides put on meeting in person to demonstrate the solidity of their bond in the face of rising challenges from China, even amid a widening coronavirus outbreak inside the White House and Japan’s cautious approach to opening its borders to foreign travelers. The Tokyo gathering, which included the foreign ministers of Australia and India — the other two members of a strategic partnership known as the Quad — was scheduled before President Trump contracted the coronavirus. The fact that it went ahead, even as many summits have moved online during the pandemic, signaled that parts of the Trump administration value multilateral relationships despite his “America First” agenda. “Given all the insanity that is going on in Washington, D.C., right now, this is a really positive development,” said Gordon Flake, chief executive of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. “The fact that the U.S. is showing up despite all the other problems in the world and domestic problems in the White House right now shows the level of importance that even the U.S. places on these three key partners,” he added. “Without Japan, India and Australia, there really is no regional response to the security challenges of the coming decades.” There is little question about from where those challenges are coming. With Chinese military aggression rising in the region and Beijing cracking down on Hong Kong, the four countries are looking for ways to cooperate in military, economic and technological realms — and deliver a message of solidarity to a watchful Beijing. As Mr. Trump has pulled the United States back from the global stage, China has had a “remarkably fertile environment for growing Chinese influence in the region and undermining the U.S. influence, which is the Chinese objective,” Mr. Flake said. Instead, its deepening hawkishness and authoritarianism have “served to alarm the region as a whole.” Yet only the United States, which has taken an especially hard line against China — pushing relations to their lowest point in decades — seemed willing to name the threat explicitly in Tokyo. In Mr. Pompeo’s remarks on Tuesday evening, he said that the Quad’s members needed to protect their people from China’s “exploitation, corruption and coercion,” and he blamed China for a cover-up of the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. A statement about Mr. Pompeo’s meeting with the Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, described their discussions of “China’s malign activity in the region.” Ms. Payne’s comments on Facebook about the meeting with Mr. Pompeo did not call out China by name, but her implication was clear. “Whether it is individual human rights, market-based economies, countering disinformation or building greater resilience into our supply chains,” she wrote, “our common values and interests mean we share a vision for a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific.” Diplomats and analysts know well that variations on the catch phrase “free and open Indo-Pacific” — which was invoked in remarks by Ms. Payne; Japan’s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi; and India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar — are all directed at China. American officials have followed the bellicose example set by Mr. Trump, who has bashed China to improve his re-election prospects. The Quad’s other members, mindful of their geographic proximity and economic reliance on China, were more circumspect in their criticisms. A day before the foreign ministers arrived in Tokyo, Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, said that “stable relationships with both the U.S. and China, the two largest economic powers, are extremely important in the international community.” Japan, aware of the economic might of its largest trading partner and its own limited military options, needs to pursue a delicate balancing act, experts said. “When we talk about the Quad, some people express their concern about what China might think about it,” said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “If we talk about China in this setting, China would regard this as a containment conspiracy, so this sentiment still remains.” The Quad, Mr. Michishita said, is “about China, but we say it’s not about China. Everybody knows it. China knows it. We don’t have to say it too much.” Cooperation between the four countries, formally known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, began in 2004 to coordinate disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in the wake of the devastating tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands across Indonesia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. But as the grouping evolved into a diplomatic and security partnership that Beijing perceived as a direct effort to contain its rise, Australia and India grew wary of a backlash from China, and the group collapsed. “It was too early,” said Lavina Lee, a senior lecturer in international relations at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. The early version of the Quad “was pre-empting and creating a security dilemma where none existed.” “But now we’re in a very different phase of history,” Dr. Lee said. “Since 2012, China has become much more clearly assertive and aggressive in terms of its territorial aggression and ambitions of where it sees itself in the region, and under Covid conditions that is not letting up at all.” In June, China and India engaged in their worst border clash in 40 years, and relations between Australia and China have deteriorated since Australia attributed a surge of cyberattacks to Beijing and launched an investigation into allegations of a Chinese government plot to manipulate the country’s politics. Japan has also grown more vigilant as China has repeatedly sent ships to patrol waters around the Senkakus, islands administered by Japan but contested by China. “If you had Venn diagrams and put together all of their definitions, I think you would see a fairly large overlap in how each of those four countries think about security in the region — that there should be freedom of navigation and open trade, and that countries should not be coerced into accepting outcomes that are against their interests,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. While no joint statement was on the agenda for the four nations, they were expected to discuss the possible development of an investment fund to help developing Asian countries with infrastructure projects, a counter to China’s Belt and Road initiative; cooperation on supply chains to reduce reliance on China; the development of 5G networks that do not depend on the Chinese technology giant Huawei; and an invitation to Australia to join naval war exercises with the other three countries. The allies “have enough heft and are willing to do these things together,” said Tanvi Madan, the director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington, “and take the heat that might come from Beijing for working with each other.” Makiko Inoue and Hikari Hida contributed research.']","The American diplomat’s willingness to meet with allies in Asia, despite the crisis embroiling the White House, speaks to fears of China’s rise."
"Cuomo won’t approve closing businesses in 9 N.Y.C. hot spots, but will close schools in those areas on Tuesday.",2020-10-06,"By Jesse McKinley, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Troy Closson and Daniel E. Slotnik","['Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York refused on Monday to allow New York City to close nonessential businesses in nine hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens where the coronavirus has spiked, pre-empting a plan announced the day before by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The governor suggested that the ZIP codes that were being used to identify hot spots were too imprecise to guide shutdowns. The more pressing problem, he said, lay in schools and houses of worship, including many that cater to Orthodox Jews, rather than businesses that “are not large spreaders.” The dissonance in messages from the state’s two most prominent politicians created confusion for residents, business owners and parents in the affected areas and drew scrutiny to the conflict between city and state over how to tackle early signs of a second wave of the virus in its onetime epicenter. The governor’s announcement also seemed to be yet another manifestation of his long feud with Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo has frequently second-guessed or overruled the mayor, who is also a Democrat, during their tenures. Those clashes were cast in sharp relief during the early days of the pandemic, with the city and state at odds over the timing of shutting down the city’s businesses and its schools, among other issues. On Monday, that disconnect continued, as Mr. Cuomo accelerated the mayor’s plan to close schools in newly hard-hit areas, moving the closure date up a day to Tuesday, and forcing parents in those areas to again rejigger their schedules to accommodate changes in their children’s routines. Mr. Cuomo said he spoke with Mr. de Blasio and Michael Mulgrew, the president of the city’s teachers’ union, among other local officials, on Monday morning and added that all were in agreement on the need for additional data on cases at specific schools. Mr. Cuomo did not rule out closing nonessential businesses or public spaces in the near future, and top aides suggested a state plan could be unveiled as soon as Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo said his administration was reviewing how best to do it without relying on geographic delineations from ZIP codes, which he said were arbitrary and might not accurately capture the areas where new cases are going up. “A ZIP code is not the best definition of the applicable zone,” he said. “If you have to circumscribe an area, make sure you have the right boundaries.” Cuomo administration officials later suggested that the boundaries for business closures could even exceed the ZIP codes where the increases are now occurring. On Monday afternoon, not long after the governor’s news conference, Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference of his own that he still planned to close nonessential businesses in the nine ZIP codes. He added later that “we obviously will follow state law, and if the state does not authorize restrictions we’re not going to act. But I find that very unlikely at this point.” Mr. Cuomo had also announced that the state would take over supervision of enforcement of mask and social-distancing rules in the hot spot clusters, presumably putting the State Police in charge of New York City Police Department officers. He added that local governments would need to provide personnel. The mayor said that he did not believe that the state could seize control of enforcement from local governments but that he agreed with Mr. Cuomo on the need for aggressive enforcement and “stronger restrictions that will allow us to turn the tide.”']",
‘Then I Heard a Boom’: Heavy Weapons Take Toll on Civilians in Armenia-Azerbaijan Clash,2020-10-05,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Ruzanna Avagyana, a 53-year-old social worker from the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, was taking stock Monday of the region’s rapidly escalating military conflict with Azerbaijan from inside her basement. The fighting, the worst in Nagorno-Karabakh since a vicious ethnic war erupted in the region in the early 1990s, began a week ago and drove Ms. Avagyana underground. She counted a half-dozen or so explosions in each of the first days she hid out in the basement, more on Sunday and so many on Monday she could hardly keep track. Then the apartment building on top of her took a direct hit. “People are afraid,” Ms. Avagyana said in a telephone interview. “I heard whistling this way and that,” she said, recalling the artillery strikes on her city, Stepanakert, earlier in the day. “I couldn’t understand where they were falling. And then I heard a boom.” As her building burned, she escaped unharmed, Ms. Avagyana said. Skirmishes have been common for years along the front lines of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is run by ethnic Armenian separatists but internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. But this conflict is distinct, analysts and former diplomats say, for the more direct support that Turkey has offered to Azerbaijan and for the scale of the fighting. Both sides have been using armed drones and powerful, long-range rocket artillery, they say. Turkey has denied offering anything more than training, weapons sales and political support to Azerbaijan. Stepanakert, once a city of well-tended boulevards and stately stone homes, is now scattered with the ruins of bombarded buildings. On Monday, it came under heavy bombardment for a second day, Armenia’s military said. On the Azerbaijani side, the authorities said rockets had landed in a residential area of Ganja, the country’s second-largest city. At least 250 people have died in the recent fighting, including dozens of civilians on both sides, according to official reports. The long-range artillery fire of the type that destroyed Ms. Avagyana’s apartment building, which she said was across a street from a military headquarters and thus in a vulnerable location, has alarmed observers and former diplomats. The weapons raise the risks of a direct conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, two former Soviet states divided by a poisonous and long-running ethnic dispute and competing claims to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. So far, the fighting along the front has been muddled and inconclusive; reports from both sides are impossible to independently verify. Azerbaijan has reported capturing, and then recapturing again, several villages in seesaw fighting over small strips of land. Those accounts have been denied by Armenia, which has accused the other side of targeting civilians and Turkey of shooting down one of its planes. Both countries have in the past threatened to target strategic infrastructure with long-range weapons, raising worries that the conflict may intensify. Over the weekend and on Monday, both sides fired large-caliber, Russian-made rockets of a type known as Smerch, or Tornado, saying they were aiming for military targets. Russia has for decades sold the same weapons systems to both parties to the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh vowed to fire back into Azerbaijan to retaliate for its shelling of Stepanakert.  “We are not targeting the civilian population but military facilities permanently deployed in large cities,” Vahram Poghosyan, a spokesman for the enclave’s president, told the Armenian news agency Arka. He said civilians should leave their homes to escape harm. Rockets had already landed in Ganja, Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, on Sunday. Nagorno-Karabakh said it had fired at the city’s military airport, but photographs published in Azerbaijani media showed demolished houses. A Russian television channel posted pictures of a Smerch rocket that did not explode sticking out of a parking lot of an Azerbaijani hydroelectric station at a jaunty angle, suggesting the targeting of strategic infrastructure. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of firing the rockets from its territory, rather than from the disputed enclave, and said it was a tactic intended to provoke a retaliation that might trigger Armenia’s mutual defense pact with Russia. Armenia denied the charge. The cause of the fighting is disputed. Azerbaijan said it responded to artillery fire across the frontline on Sept. 27. Armenia said the Azerbaijani offensive was unprovoked. Armenia has said it is open to negotiating a cease-fire. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, on Sunday told Al Arabiya television in an interview that the offensive would continue until Armenia withdrew support for the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave — something that is highly unlikely to happen. “They must give us a timetable, or withdraw from the occupied territories,” Mr. Aliyev said. “Their prime minister who said ‘Karabakh is Armenia’ should now say that ‘Karabakh is not Armenia’ and after that, of course, we will be ready to put an end to hostility.” Negotiating a cease-fire now will be harder than it was during a previous escalation in 2016, said Olesya Vartanyan, a Caucasus analyst with the International Crisis Group, because Azerbaijan felt misled by that settlement. After the 2016 escalation, Russia brokered a truce with an assurance to return to Azerbaijan some territory occupied by ethnic Armenians in the 1990s fighting, but that never happened. “Even if Moscow calls on Baku to stop fighting, they have nothing to propose” now because the earlier promises never panned out, Ms. Vartanyan said, referring to the Azerbaijani government in the capital, Baku. The bombardments suggest that a wider conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is possible, said Carey Cavanaugh, a former American ambassador and mediator in previous peace talks. “We can see in Syria how fragile cities can be” in artillery barrages, he said. Wider fallout from the fighting may also be looming. If Armenia targets oil and natural gas pipelines in Azerbaijan, neighboring Georgia could lose fuel just as winter sets in, Mr. Cavanaugh said. There is also the risk of a coronavirus outbreak as troops hunker down in trenches and bunkers, he said. A deadly flu virus spread under such conditions in World War I. And prolonged shelling could result in a flow of refugees as civilians flee the fighting, Mr. Cavanaugh said. Ms. Avagyana has already left. Moments after the explosion rocked her building Monday, the people huddling in the basement rushed out, she said. Smoke was billowing from a top floor. She left Stepanakert later in the day, driving past a grocery store in flames and another apartment building with a gaping hole in it. Water from broken pipes was pouring through the ruined block, she said. Though it is one of six unrecognized splinter states of the former Soviet Union, which are typically rundown places, Stepanakert had in recent years become a remarkably well- developed city. Money had poured in from the Armenian diaspora in the United States, France and Russia to help construct well-paved roads and presentable municipal buildings. Seeing the city after the bombardments, Ms. Avagyana said, “was very painful.”']","Stepanakert, the capital of the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under bombardment on Monday as both sides used powerful, long-range weapons."
"The White House outbreak grows as Kayleigh McEnany, the press secretary, tests positive for the virus.",2020-10-05,"By Michael Crowley, Maggie Haberman and Eileen Sullivan","['The coronavirus outbreak in the West Wing continued to spread on Monday, as the White House press secretary and two of her deputies joined the list of aides close to President Trump who have tested positive for the virus, heightening fears that more cases are still to come.  The press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, announced on Twitter that she had tested positive and would be quarantining. Ms. McEnany said she had previously tested negative several times, “including every day since Thursday,” but health experts said she may have been infectious for days — including when she spoke briefly to reporters without a mask outside the White House on Sunday. Two other members of the press team, Karoline Leavitt and Chad Gilmartin, who is Ms. McEnany’s relative, also tested positive — but learned about their status before Ms. McEnany, according to two people familiar with the diagnoses. The revelations came amid many unanswered questions about whether Mr. Trump could relocate to the White House without endangering himself and others and suggested that the White House does not have control of the virus.  Vice President Mike Pence, who tested negative on Sunday, was scheduled to travel to Utah ahead of Wednesday night’s vice-presidential debate. Mr. Pence also plans to attend campaign events in Arizona and Florida this week before stopping in his home state of Indiana to vote early.  His doctor said in a statement on Friday that Mr. Pence was not quarantining because, as of that time, he had not been close enough to any individuals known to have the coronavirus for long enough to qualify as “a close contact” at high risk of infection.']",
New Zealand Stamps Out the Virus. For a Second Time.,2020-10-07,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['The first time New Zealand thought it had eliminated the coronavirus from its isolated shores, a mysterious outbreak in its largest city shattered any sense of victory over a tenacious foe. Now, after a second round of strict lockdown, the country believes — if a bit more tentatively this time — that it has effectively stamped out the virus once again. On Wednesday, New Zealand moved to lift the last of its restrictions in Auckland after 10 days with no new cases linked to a cluster that first surfaced in August. The government will now allow unrestricted gatherings, and trips on public transit without social distancing or masks, in the city of 1.6 million people. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is facing re-election next week, called the reopening a validation of the country’s “go hard, go early” response. The strategy is aimed at eradicating the virus with a swift science-based policy, one that trades weeks of lockdown and sacrifice for an emergence to full economic activity. “Our team of five million, a little more battle-weary this time, did what national teams do so often. We put our heads down, and we got on with it,” Ms. Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Monday as she announced that the restrictions would be loosened, referring to the total number of people in New Zealand. “You only had to look around the world to see the alternative to our approach here in New Zealand,” she said, adding that there was a 95 percent probability that the country had eliminated local transmission of the virus. Experts cautioned that New Zealand’s small population and isolation meant it was uniquely positioned to manage the disease. But its success presents a stark contrast to many other parts of the world as deaths from the pandemic have surpassed one million. India is being devastated by the virus after proceeding with its economic reopening even as a second wave washed over the country. In the United States and Brazil, leaders have continued to play down the pandemic’s dangers even as they themselves have been infected. The word “elimination” in relation to the virus, said Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, “might stick in the throat for some politicians, because it seems too tough, but as we found in New Zealand, it’s a goal you aim for, and you accept you might have outbreaks.” Professor Baker helped devise the country’s elimination strategy. He said that despite early fears that severe lockdowns would irreparably damage the economy, New Zealand’s approach had proved that the best economic response was a strong public health response, including a blitz of testing, contact tracing and quarantining. Much of the rest of the Western world, Professor Baker added, has “adopted the approach of complacent exceptionalism — that they wouldn’t get the virus, or it wouldn’t be as severe as they thought, and the pandemic has proved them wrong.” In Auckland, where gatherings had been restricted to 100 people and masks had been mandated on public transport, the rules were eased at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday. People are no longer required to wear masks in public, but must continue to sign in at and keep records of locations they visit, maintain good hygiene practices and, if unwell, remain at home and get tested for the virus. The national border remains closed to almost all travelers except New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. While residents said they were relieved, they did not expect an immediate return to normal life. “People have stayed in their suburbs and supported their local restaurants, so where in the past I was in a really good spot, now not so much,” said Yael Shochat, who has run Ima Cuisine, a restaurant in downtown Auckland, for almost two decades. “But the most important thing is we have eliminated the virus again, and that makes people confident to come out,” Ms. Shochat said. “I’m hoping that as Christmas comes, people will really want to go out and party — it’s been a horrible year.” Others said they had been frustrated at restrictions that seemed too stringent, preventing them from applying for visas or doing work considered nonessential by the government. And some who acknowledged that the measures were necessary said they felt that not enough had been done to assist them. “I can’t get any help from the government,” said Sherrie Edwards, 51, who after losing her job as an importer in recent months said she feared that she might have to sell her home to make ends meet. Ms. Edwards said she was feeling “quite depressed.” While the economic pain has been acute for many, New Zealand has kept the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus low. The country has had 1,505 confirmed cases and 25 deaths in total, and as of Wednesday, just three new cases of the virus had been recorded, all of them people still in quarantine after arriving from overseas. The numbers have worked in Ms. Ardern’s favor, placing her ahead in the polls before the country’s elections on Oct. 17. “I was always leaning toward Labor, but this has well and truly solidified it for me,” said Christopher Carroll, a 31-year-old primary school teacher in Auckland, referring to the party Ms. Ardern leads. “I feel like we’re in a better situation than in other parts of the world, where this thing is going on and on.” Two months ago, however, many in the country wondered whether that success would continue. The Auckland cluster, the country’s largest, involved 179 cases. At the same time in neighboring Australia, its second-largest city, Melbourne, was in the grip of a severe second wave from which it is only now emerging. And though disease detectives struggled to pin down the origins of the Auckland outbreak, the country was ultimately able to quash it through a citywide lockdown that began the day after the first cases emerged. New Zealand is not alone in successfully pursuing an elimination strategy, with Taiwan among those following the model. And other places, including Hong Kong and Vietnam, have stamped out second or third waves. But experts said this approach would not necessarily work everywhere. “They’ve never had a major outbreak where the number of cases have overwhelmed their public health capacity,” Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor of global health at the University of Sydney, said of New Zealand. He added that even though the country’s size, isolation and disaster preparedness gave it distinct advantages, an elimination strategy may not be viable in the absence of a vaccine. Michael Plank, a mathematics and statistics professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, said that until that time, it would be wise for New Zealanders to continue wearing masks —\xa0even if the virus appeared to have been defeated. “We need to be really careful not to let our guard down,” Professor Plank said. “We think we’ve got a high chance now that we’ve eliminated community transmission of the virus. But that doesn’t mean it won’t come back.”']","Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is facing re-election, called the country’s reopening a validation of its “go hard, go early” response."
"As the virus consumes the U.S. government’s elite, Trump presides over a capital in chaos.",2020-10-06,By Michael Cooper and Maggie Haberman,"['As the coronavirus upended the top echelons of the U.S. government on Tuesday — leaving President Trump convalescing in the White House, the Capitol eerily empty after lawmakers tested positive and most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in quarantine — the president abruptly ended talks on a stimulus bill intended to shore up the nation’s pandemic-stricken economy. Mr. Trump’s announcement Tuesday that he was ending talks with Democrats on the bill, which aimed to send more aid to Americans grappling with high unemployment and to help state and local governments stay afloat as tax collections plummet, sent the stock market sliding. It came after Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that failing to inject more federal help into the economy would risk weakening the tenuous recovery. In multiple tweets later Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to backtrack on his assertion that an agreement would wait until after Election Day, at one point urging both chambers to “IMMEDIATELY Approve” a lapsed loan program for small businesses, funds to prevent airlines from furloughing or laying off workers and another round of stimulus checks. It was unclear if his tweets, which came after stocks fell, reflected a willingness to restart negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Both provisions have bipartisan support, but several lawmakers have pushed for them to be included in a broader package. Taken together, the events showed the extent to which the coronavirus is continuing to dominate life in America with less than a month to go before the presidential election. The outbreak at the White House has raised concerns in the city that surrounds it. New cases are surging in the upper Midwest. The average of new reported infections across the country is creeping up again, after a late-summer decline. In New York, which was the center of the pandemic early on but has since seen a marked decline in cases, several worrisome outbreaks led Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to temporarily close nonessential businesses and schools in some parts of New York City and its northern suburbs. And Mr. Trump, who left the hospital to convalesce at a White House that has become a virus hot spot, announced on Twitter that he wants to face off against his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., in person next week — when he could still be contagious. Mr. Trump said he planned to attend the debate in Miami, which is scheduled for Oct. 15. It was unclear if the debate commission would permit the debate to go ahead, given his illness, or whether Mr. Biden would agree to share the stage with him. And as both campaigns prepared for a vice-presidential debate on Wednesday, aides to Vice President Mike Pence raised objections to plans to put plexiglass dividers between him and his opponent, Senator Kamala Harris of California. Mr. Biden, in a speech in Gettysburg, Pa., where a Civil War battlefield serves as a symbol of a country divided against itself, called for national unity and said that what “we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal.” Facebook removed a post from Mr. Trump on Tuesday that violated its policy against sharing misinformation about the virus, one of the few times that the social network had taken down one of his posts. In Mr. Trump’s message, he falsely suggested that the flu was deadlier than the coronavirus. And hopes that a new vaccine could be authorized by Election Day — which Mr. Trump has relentlessly pushed for — faded after the Food and Drug Administration released updated, stricter guidelines for vaccine developers. The guidelines had been blocked by White House officials, including Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. In pulling the plug until after the election on talks for a new bill to send aid to needy Americans, Mr. Trump accused Ms. Pelosi in a tweet of “not negotiating in good faith” and urged Senate Republicans to focus solely on confirming his nominee to the Supreme Court in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said that he had instructed Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to stop negotiating, sending the S&P 500 down as much as 1 percent in the immediate aftermath of his tweet. It had been up more than half a percent in the moments before. The index closed down 1.40 percent for the day. “Our Economy is doing very well,” Mr. Trump tweeted as the market fell. “The Stock Market is at record levels, JOBS and unemployment also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the World in Economic Recovery, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” Mr. Biden countered on Twitter that “the President has turned his back on you.” Mr. Trump was recovering in the White House residence, as a number of advisers and other officials stayed home, because they had either contracted the coronavirus or been near people who had. On Tuesday night, senior administration officials confirmed that Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s top speechwriter and policy adviser, had tested positive for the virus. The Capitol, normally a beehive of a workplace for 535 legislators and thousands of staff members, was eerily empty on Tuesday after Senate leaders agreed to adjourn for two weeks beginning Monday, even as Republicans were trying to fast-track Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. More than 40 senators, along with more than a dozen congressional aides and reporters, have been tested for the coronavirus since late last week, officials said on Tuesday. Three Republican senators — Mike Lee of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — have tested positive in recent days. At the highest level of the military, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several of the Pentagon’s most senior uniformed leaders were quarantining after being exposed to the coronavirus, a Defense Department official said Tuesday. The official said that almost the entirety of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Gen. James C. McConville, the Army chief of staff, was quarantining after Adm. Charles Ray, the vice commandant of the Coast Guard, tested positive for the virus.']",
Killer in Canada Who Dismembered Rich Relative Gets 10-Year Sentence,2020-10-05,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — It was a quiet Saturday in 2015 in one of Vancouver’s wealthiest enclaves, when a Chinese immigrant told police he snapped. He shot dead his bullying, philandering relative outside the victim’s $6 million hillside mansion. Then he chopped the body into 108 pieces. On Monday, Judge Terence Schultes of the Supreme Court of British Columbia sentenced Zhao Li, now 60, to 10 years and six months in prison after his conviction for manslaughter and interfering with human remains. In January, the judge surprised Canadian legal experts when he ruled that Mr. Zhao was not guilty of murder. Under Canadian law, he could have been sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. Mr. Zhao had been in custody for more than five years after killing Yuan Gang, his business partner and a family member. With each day in custody counting as 1.5 days toward his sentence, Mr. Zhao has two years, four months and eight days left to serve, the judge said. Chris Johnson, a lawyer who represented the estate of Mr. Yuan, called the lurid case, which generated headlines in Canada and China, a cautionary tale about revenge and the corruptibility of money. “This offense was particularly shocking to Canadians because of the brazen nature of the crime, in broad daylight in one of Vancouver’s wealthiest neighborhoods,” he said. “The method of the killing was brutal.” Justice Schultes on Monday noted the violence of the crime, and observed that the dismemberment of the body was “unquestionably bizarre,” adding that its “clinical dispassion” and “coldness” were “very morally blameworthy.” He said his sentence was predicated on Mr. Zhao’s not having a criminal record and the remorse he had shown. When announcing the verdict in January, the judge said that while the crime was gruesome, he had been left with reasonable doubt over whether Mr. Zhao intended to kill Mr. Yuan. Intent to kill  is the prerequisite for a murder verdict in Canada. The trial, which took place in front of a judge rather than a jury, as agreed to by both the defense and the prosecution, shined a spotlight on how Vancouver has become host to rich foreigners, who use it as a sanctuary for cash and kin. In the case of Mr. Yuan, he had been ensnared in a corruption scandal in China before gaining permanent residency in Canada. The case presented two contrasting narratives. In the first, Mr. Zhao, whose wife was Mr. Yuan’s cousin, was characterized by the defense as a meek and law-abiding man who exploded when Mr. Yuan asked to marry his daughter. But prosecutors portrayed Mr. Zhao as a vengeful and violent aggressor. He cut up the body with an electric hand saw and concealed the right arm in a meat freezer in the garage at the mansion. Apart from its grisly nature, the case riveted Canadians because of the lavish lifestyle of the victim. At the mansion where he was shot, in a rarefied mountainside neighborhood, he had installed a stuffed black panther posing on a rock in its grand entrance. He also bought a stately 10-bedroom Tudor revival home, valued at about $13 million, in another exclusive area. Mr. Yuan owned a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce, as well as a private island and a yacht. He bought 48 parcels of land in Saskatchewan, valued at about $6 million, which Mr. Zhao managed. The case also attracted attention because of its colorful cast of characters. Among them was Mr. Zhao’s daughter, Florence Zhao, a fashion designer known as “Flo-Z,” who appeared in a popular reality show on YouTube, “Ultra Rich Asian Girls.” which showcased Vancouver’s wealthy second-generation Chinese.  During the sentencing, Justice Schultes recalled that Mr. Zhao’s father was imprisoned by the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution, consigning the son to a childhood of hardship and poverty. The judge also noted that Mr. Zhao had disapproved of Mr. Yuan’s mistreatment of his girlfriends — estimated at as many as 100 — according to testimony in a separate civil case. On May 2, 2015, Mr. Yuan told Mr. Zhao that he wanted to marry Florence, the court heard. Mr. Zhao became irate. He called Mr. Yuan “worse than a pig or a dog,” and then shot him twice with a licensed rifle after, he said, Mr. Yuan tried to harm him with a hammer. Then he began to chop up the body, and wash away evidence of blood from the crime scene. In the aftermath of the killing, seven women from China claimed that their children had been fathered by Mr. Yuan and deserved part of his $21 million estate. A Canadian judge ruled that five were entitled to split Mr. Yuan’s possessions. Mr. Johnson said Mr. Yuan’s family was disappointed in the Canadian justice system, believing that Mr. Zhao had “gotten away with murder.”']","Zhao Li shot his business partner outside a Vancouver mansion, and then chopped him into 108 pieces."
"Nerve Agent Was Used to Poison Navalny, Chemical Weapons Body Confirms",2020-10-06,By Michael Schwirtz,"['The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed on Tuesday that the substance used to poison the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny had “similar structural characteristics” to the Novichok family of highly potent nerve agents. The finding from the world’s leading chemical weapons body adds additional weight to the conclusions of laboratories in Germany, France and Sweden, and increases the likelihood that Russia, which has been accused of using a similar poison in at least one previous assassination attempt, will be punished, likely with targeted financial sanctions. “These results constitute a matter of grave concern,” the organization said in a statement. “The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances,” it said, is “reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community.” Mr. Navalny, the most prominent figure in Russia’s political opposition, fell ill on a flight from Siberia on Aug. 20 and slipped into a coma. The Russian authorities initially prevented his family from transporting him abroad for treatment, but he was eventually brought to Berlin, where he was treated at the Charité hospital. He was discharged on Sept. 23 and has vowed to return to Russia to continue his work after a period of rehabilitation in Germany. The German authorities said they never doubted the conclusions of military scientists in Germany, who had reported discovering traces of Novichok in biological samples taken from Mr. Navalny, as well as on a plastic water bottle from his hotel that was smuggled out of Russia by his aides. But the findings of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons add an authoritative and independent assessment that the Germans could use as ammunition in the pursuit of punishment, most likely in the form of financial sanctions against Russian officials. By doing so, Germany would be following a playbook used in 2018, when the British government relied on the chemical weapons body to bolster its conclusions that Russian operatives had used a Novichok poison in an attempt to murder Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer who had spied for Britain. In that case, the organization’s findings helped assure Britain’s allies and justify a mass expulsion of Russian officials in the weeks after the poisoning. Steffen Seibert, the spokesman for the German government, said in a statement Tuesday that “in the coming days” the countries of the European Union together with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would discuss “next steps.” “The German government renews its call on Russia to explain what has happened,” Mr. Seibert said. “Any use of chemical weapons is a serious process and cannot be without consequences.” Separately, forty-four signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention, including the United States, Britain and every country of the European Union issued a joint statement on Tuesday calling on Russia to investigate the poisoning and cooperate with technical experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon in the Russian Federation on 20 August,” the statement said. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for its efforts to whittle away the world’s stocks of chemical weapons, but its record as the world’s watchdog for such weapons has become clouded in recent years. In 2017, an official from the organization traveled to Moscow to certify that Russia had fulfilled its obligations as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroyed its remaining declared stocks of chemical weapons. Less than six months later, a pair of Russian operatives traveled to Britain, armed with a Novichok-class chemical weapon that had apparently been produced secretly, under the noses of weapons inspectors, according to the British government. The operatives used it to poison Mr. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, in southern England. Three other people in Salisbury were also poisoned, and one of them, Dawn Sturgess, died. Two years after that, it was used on Mr. Navalny. Russian officials have denied involvement in both attacks. On Sept. 15, the head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, gave a rare news conference in which he said that all stocks of Novichok had been destroyed in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. “To say that on the territory of Russia there is production or stocks of military-grade poisons is of course disinformation,” Mr. Naryshkin said. Western intelligence services say otherwise, though Mr. Naryshkin’s comment, even if inaccurate, was revealing — a rare acknowledgment that Russia had, at least at one time, possessed stocks of Novichok. The nerve agent was developed in the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and ’90s and was so highly classified that before the Skripal attack it was not even listed as a banned substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Before Mr. Naryshkin’s comment, Russian officials had denied that the Novichok program existed, though some of the Russian scientists involved in it had spoken about it publicly. Despite Russian denials, a small group of Western countries have known about the Kremlin’s Novichok program for decades, including where the substance is produced and stored, said Andrew Weber, a senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks. Western officials pressed their Russian counterparts on several occasions to cease production of the weapons, though for years the West resisted including the Novichok class on the Chemical Weapons Convention list of banned substances, Mr. Weber said. The weapons were considered so dangerous that publicly acknowledging them was judged a proliferation risk, said Mr. Weber, who was an assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs during the Obama administration. Russia never possessed large stockpiles of Novichok, but was able to produce small amounts on demand, he said. Even low quantities, he added, would be sufficient to kill thousands of people. It was only after the Salisbury poisonings that Western officials accused the Russians publicly and successfully pushed to have three forms of Novichok nerve agent added to the list of banned substances, though not all of them. The nerve agent used on Mr. Navalny, according to the German authorities, is a novel form of Novichok that until now was unknown to Western experts. In an interview posted Monday on a popular Russian YouTube channel, Mr. Navalny struggled to explain what it felt like to be poisoned with Novichok, saying it was like nothing he had ever experienced. “Normally when you’re not feeling well, you can assess yourself and figure out what’s happening — my heart hurts, my stomach hurts, my leg hurts, or I’ve got a cold,” he told the interviewer, Yuri Dud. “But in this case you can’t understand it.” He said it was something like being kissed by a dementor, the ghoulish soul-sucking monsters from the Harry Potter series. “It doesn’t hurt,” he said, “but life escapes you.”']","The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons bolstered the assessments of European countries that a form Novichok sickened Aleksei A.

The Pressure to Be Perfect Turns Deadly for Celebrities in Japan,2020-10-05,By Motoko Rich and Hikari Hida,"['TOKYO — From the outside, Yuko Takeuchi seemed to have a golden life. She had won Japan’s top acting award three times and had recently given birth to her second child. A graceful beauty, she appeared in a box-office favorite last year and advertisements for a top ramen brand. Ms. Takeuchi, 40, died late last month, apparently in a suicide. No one can fully know what private torment might have lurked beneath the surface, but in a Japanese society that values “gaman” — endurance or self-denial — many feel pressure to hide their personal struggles. The burden is compounded for celebrities whose professional success depends on projecting a flawless ideal. Ms. Takeuchi is the latest in a succession of Japanese film and television stars who have taken their own lives this year. Her death came less than two weeks after the suicide of another actress, Sei Ashina, 36, and two months after Haruma Miura, 30, a popular television actor, was found dead in his home, leaving a suicide note. Earlier this year, Hana Kimura, a professional wrestler and star of “Terrace House,” a reality show, took her own life after relentless bullying on social media. Aside from Ms. Kimura, none of the other celebrities who died in suicides had shown any public signs of emotional distress. Their deaths have been echoed by an alarming rise in suicides within Japan’s general public during the coronavirus pandemic, after a decade of hard-won decline from some of the highest rates in the world. The authorities reported a nearly 16 percent increase in suicides in August compared with a year earlier, with the number spiking by 74 percent among teenage girls and women in their 20s and 30s. “As a society, we feel like we cannot show our weaknesses, that we must hold all of it in,” said Yasuyuki Shimizu, director of the Japan Suicide Countermeasures Promotion Center. “It’s not just that people feel like they can’t go to a counselor or a therapist, but many feel like they cannot even show their weaknesses to the people they are close to.” The reasons for any individual suicide are complex. And many of the strains felt by the Japanese are universal: They, like many others, feel the ruthless demands of social media, where people feel they must cultivate a narrative of eternal success and happiness. “This can definitely be a cause for spiraling into a depression” if your reality does not match someone else’s curated portrait, Mr. Shimizu said. Even away from social media, the Japanese tend to project a positive public front. There is a strict division between “uchi” (the home or inside) and “soto” (outside), with emotions — particularly messy ones — restricted to the private sphere. People also feel that they must conform to rules and not stand out in ways that could be perceived as burdening others. During the pandemic, this social tendency has actually helped the country avoid a surge in cases and deaths, because the public followed suggestions about wearing masks, avoiding crowded indoor venues, and practicing good hygiene and social distancing without the imposition of a strict lockdown. “So in this sense, a not-so-great quality was an advantage,” said Toshihiko Matsumoto, director of the drug addiction center at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health. “However, this also means that in terms of mental health, people don’t want to seek help and stick out from the crowd.” Yet help is exactly what many people have needed during the pandemic: Some have lost work or experienced drastic changes in their jobs, while many others have been unable to spend time with friends or have been cut off from visiting extended family. Women, especially, have been thrown into stressful situations. During the period when schools were closed and many employees worked from home, families were crammed together in small homes. While some men who have suddenly spent more time at home have pitched in on housework and child care, others have still left the bulk of it to their wives. “There are women at home with husbands working at home, and this can be very suffocating for the women,” Dr. Matsumoto said. In the 1990s, after a devastating economic recession caused hundreds of thousands of layoffs, suicides in Japan began to rise dramatically as mostly middle-aged men took their lives out of the shame and stress of sudden unemployment. Now strains have been growing on women, an increasing proportion of whom are juggling work and home life. The stress may be translating into more suicides among women, said Junko Kitanaka, a medical anthropologist at Keio University. For celebrities, the normal societal pressures can be magnified by the expectations of millions of fans. And unlike in the United States, where celebrities now talk more openly about seeking out psychological help, such behavior is largely taboo in Japan, which has been slower to develop mental health services, despite some improvement. “If you are a person in the spotlight and the media finds out that you are receiving mental health support, that would play badly for you and your career,” said Tamaki Tsuda, a television producer. “If you go out once for mental illness, that’s the image that will be tacked on to your brand forever. And when that happens, fewer and fewer job offers will come in.” The pandemic has been particularly tough for those in show business, as television and film production has been suspended or altered because of virus protection protocols. “People in the entertainment industry lost their gigs in an instant when the coronavirus hit, so it’s been an extreme blow,” Ms. Tsuda said. “A lot of these actors were given blank schedules over the past few months from their management companies.” Even a temporary halt in work can fuel insecurity about losing out to a new crop of performers waiting to be minted as the latest stars. “Unfortunately, with the Japanese mentality, we have the tendency to blame ourselves,” said Hiromichi Shizume, another television producer. The entertainers think “‘maybe I’m not getting hired because I’m not good enough.’” Still, public sympathy can be limited, with stars quickly criticized for any behavior that fans deem insufficiently grateful for their celebrity. Even in death, Ms. Takeuchi, an award-winning actress, has been subjected to condemnation, including references to her wealth and material comfort. “Yuko Takeuchi, I cannot believe that you would be so irresponsible as to have a child, then commit suicide only a few months later,” one person wrote on Twitter. “The rent of Yuko Takeuchi’s apartment cost 1.85 million yen,” or about $17,600, another posted. “Does this mean that money can’t make us happy?” At a news conference the day after her death, Katsunobu Kato, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, said he was concerned that reports of the celebrity suicides themselves might prompt others to take their lives. “In order for people not to feel isolated with their own worries, we must work together to build a society where we can warmly support and watch over each other,” he said. Experts on suicide said they were wary of vague government promises. “They say we should create a society where nobody feels lonely,” said Michiko Ueda, a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo who has researched suicide. “But as is typical with any Japanese government plan, there is no concrete plan.” She added: “We can’t change society in one day.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. In Japan, call TELL Lifeline at 03-5774-0992 or go to telljp.com/lifeline/.']",A succession of suicides has shown the burdens of a society where many feel that they must conceal their personal struggles.
"North Korean Diplomat, Missing Since 2018, Is in Seoul, Lawmaker Says",2020-10-07,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — A senior North Korean diplomat who disappeared from Italy in late 2018 has been living secretly in South Korea since July of last year, members of the intelligence committee of the South Korean Parliament said on Wednesday. The diplomat, Jo Song-gil, then 48, was North Korea’s acting ambassador to Rome when he and his wife disappeared days before he was scheduled to return home to Pyongyang in November 2018. His whereabouts had since remained a mystery, prompting speculation that he had become one of the most senior diplomats to desert the totalitarian North. The revelation about Mr. Jo could further aggravate North-South relations, which have been in a downward spiral for months after the North blew up a jointly run liaison office and its troops killed a South Korean government official during a sea patrol. Diplomats’ defections are a sensitive issue for Pyongyang because they are often interpreted in the outside world as a possible sign of fraying loyalty among the privileged\u200b class. They also raise the possibility that the South Korean autho\u200brities could glean a wealth of information, especially about smuggling and other illicit ways in which North Korean diplomats earn foreign currency in violation of United Nations sanctions. Ha Tae-keung, a member of the main opposition party in South Korea, said on Facebook on Wednesday that Mr. Jo had arrived in the South 15 months ago and remained under government protection. \u200bMr. Ha is a senior member of the intelligence committee of the South’s National Assembly\u200b and often briefs the news media \u200bon closed-door parliamentary reports from the country’s National Intelligence Service. Mr. Ha went public with his revelation hours after JTBC, a South Korean cable channel, reported that Mr. Jo had defected to \u200bthe \u200bSouth. JTBC cited anonymous intelligence sources as confirming Mr. Jo’s defection, and other South Korean news outlets followed up with similar stories\u200b. The National Intelligence Service said on Wednesday that it “will not confirm” the news report\u200bs\u200b or Mr. Ha’s statement. The agency has \u200boften used such a stock phrase when it wants to keep secret the defection of a prominent North Korean for fear of consequences in inter-Korean relations \u200bor to help protect the defector’s relatives in the North. But Jeon Hae-cheol, a lawmaker affiliated with the governing Democratic Party and head of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Jo had arrived in Seoul on his own volition but that the government kept his defection secret to protect his relatives in the North. During a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, a lawmaker asked Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha what role her ministry had played in Mr. Jo’s defection. Ms. Kang said her ministry “did what it could,” but did not clarify whether he was in Seoul. Mr. Jo is the most senior North Korean government official to flee to the South since H\u200bw\u200bang Jang-yop, a former secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, defected to Seoul through the South Korean Embassy in Beijing in 1997. \u200b The last senior North Korean diplomat to defect to the South was Thae Yong-ho, a minister in the North Korean Embassy in London, \u200b who\u200b f\u200bled to Seoul in 2016 with his wife and two sons. Over the years, some prominent North Koreans like Mr. Hwang and Mr. Thae have led public lives after their defections to the South. But many others have wanted to keep their defections secret to protect their relatives in the North, and the South Korean intelligence authorities have abided by their wishes. When its diplomats are posted abroad, North Korea requires them to leave some of their children in the North in order to discourage defections. Mr. Jo and his wife lived with their daughter in Rome. But when they escaped, they could not bring the daughter with them. Italy later said that the daughter had been taken home by the North Korean authorities. After Mr. Jo disappeared from Italy, Mr. Thae, who defected with his wife and all his children, issued an open letter appealing to the acting ambassador to defect to South Korea. But after Mr. Jo’s daughter was taken to the North, Mr. Thae said it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Jo to settle in the South. “His daughter would suffer a more severe retaliatory punishment if he chose to defect to South Korea” rather than to other countries, Mr. Thae told reporters last year. “He may have to remain silent and keep his whereabouts secret to protect his daughter.” On Wednesday, Mr. Thae, now a lawmaker affiliated with the main opposition party in South Korea, issued a statement worrying that the revelation in the news media of Mr. Jo’s whereabouts would further jeopardize the fate of Mr. Jo’s daughter in the North. It remains unclear exactly why Mr. Jo decided to flee North Korea. He was posted in Rome in May 2015. He served as the North’s acting ambassador after Italy expelled the ambassador, Mun Jong-nam, in 2017 in protest\u200b over the North’s sixth nuclear test\u200b. Mr. Jo’s disappearance was kept secret until a South Korean newspaper reported last year that he was seeking asylum in the West. South Korean lawmakers later briefed by the National Intelligence Service confirmed his disappearance. \u200bIn August of last year, the spy agency told lawmakers in \u200bSeoul that Mr. Jo was safe “somewhere” outside Italy. North Korea has yet to comment on Mr. Jo’s case. \u200bMore than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the mid-1990s. The North typically calls them “human scum” and “traitors,” or claims that they were kidnapped by the South Korean spy agency. North Korea diplomats are usually children of elite families. \u200b Mr. Jo’s father and father-in-law both had been ambassadors, Mr. Thae said.']","Jo Song-gil was the North’s acting ambassador to Rome when he vanished, raising the possibility that he had become the highest-ranking official to defect to the South since 1997."
Saudi Prince Accuses Palestinian Leaders of Failing Palestinians,2020-10-06,By Isabel Kershner and Ben Hubbard,"['JERUSALEM — In a surprising televised monologue, a senior member of the Saudi royal family and former ambassador to Washington accused Palestinian leaders of betraying their people, signaling an erosion of Saudi support for an issue long considered sacrosanct. “The Palestinian cause is a just cause but its advocates are failures, and the Israeli cause is unjust but its advocates have proven to be successful,” the royal, Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, said in the first episode of a three-part program, which aired Monday on the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya satellite channel. “That sums up the events of the last 70 or 75 years,” the prince said. Prince Bandar’s 40-minute program on Monday and a sequel that aired Tuesday appeared to be a way for the kingdom to shift its narrative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without having to put it in the mouths of any current officials. Prince Bandar, 71, holds no current government position, but he served as the Saudi ambassador to Washington from 1983 to 2005, when he grew so close to the Bush family that he was jokingly called “Bandar Bush.” He later headed the Saudi intelligence agency, and a person familiar with the relationship said that he had overseen Saudi Arabia’s clandestine relationship with Israel. Two of his children are now Saudi ambassadors, Princess Reema bint Bandar in Washington and Prince Khalid bin Bandar in London. Experts said that Prince Bandar would not have received so much airtime on Al Arabiya, which is based in Dubai, had his message not jibed with the wishes of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Bandar said his remarks were a response to the Palestinian leadership’s condemnation of the recent American-brokered agreements to normalize relations between Israel and two close Saudi allies, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The agreements, signed at a ceremony on the White House lawn last month, laid the groundwork for the two Gulf countries to establish open diplomatic and economic ties with Israel after years of under-the-table contacts. The accords did not address the future of the Palestinians, whose demand for statehood had long been considered a prerequisite for further Israeli acceptance by the Arab world. Prince Bandar’s extraordinary indictment came amid a broader shift in Israel’s relationship with Arab states, some of which now see the Israelis less as usurpers of Arab lands than as valuable partners in trade and in the rivalry with Iran. Saudi Arabia has no diplomatic relations with Israel, and Saudi, Israeli and American officials have said that they do not expect the kingdom to normalize ties soon. But Saudi Arabia, long seen as an unwavering supporter of the Palestinians, has softened its stance toward Israel in recent years, which many in the Middle East expect could pave the way for eventual normalization. Driving the shift is Crown Prince Mohammed, who has said that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to their own land and that Israel’s security and economic interests overlap with those of Arab states. The kingdom greenlighted the Emirati and Bahraini moves, and the state-controlled Saudi news media praised the accords. Saudi media have also produced content recently about Israel and Jewish history in the Middle East, topics formerly considered taboo. Palestinian officials denounced the agreements as a betrayal, and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority accused Gulf leaders of turning their backs on the Palestinians. On the television program, Prince Bandar dismissed the Palestinian response as a “lowly level of discourse,” adding that it was not surprising since that was how rival Palestinian factions dealt with each other. He emphasized the decades of Saudi support for the Palestinians, which he characterized as a one-way street. “I believe that we in Saudi Arabia, acting on our good will, have always been there for them,” he said. “Whenever they asked for advice and help, we would provide them with both without expecting anything in return, but they would take the help and ignore the advice.” He added, “I think it is only fair to the Palestinian people to know some truths that have not been discussed or have been kept hidden.” The initial Palestinian response to the prince’s statements was muted. Saeb Erekat, a senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organization and its veteran chief negotiator, shared the Bandar program on Twitter, saying it was everyone’s right to watch and that the Palestinian response would come after the third episode. That response, Mr. Erekat said, would be factual and “scientific” and would not demonize anybody. Prince Bandar offered a rambling and selective history of the Palestinian struggle, saying that the Palestinians “always bet on the losing side.” His survey, interspersed with archival images and footage, cited the contacts between Haj Amin al-Husseini, the grand mufti of Jerusalem and an early Palestinian nationalist leader, and the Nazis in the 1930s, adding, “we all know what happened to Hitler and Germany.” The prince also blasted Yasir Arafat, the late Palestinian leader, for embracing the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, despite Kuwait’s record of welcoming the Palestinians. And he accused Mr. Arafat’s P.L.O. of working harder to take over Jordan and Lebanon than to liberate Palestine. While there is broad agreement that Mr. al-Husseini collaborated with the Nazis against Zionism, historians differ on the significance of his relationship with Nazi leaders. Prince Bandar also appeared to criticize Palestinians who fled or were forced to leave during the war surrounding Israel’s establishment in 1948, saying that Saudi Arabia had urged them to stay and offered them money and weapons. In the second installment of the program on Tuesday night, he continued his diatribe about the Palestinians’ history of missed opportunities, declaring, “It is not our fault that God gave them such leaders.” A Palestinian official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivities involved, criticized what he called the prince’s distorted history. The official said the Palestinian refugees had run for their lives, as in any war. Martin S. Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel who was responsible for Middle East policy during the Clinton administration and who worked closely with Prince Bandar when he was ambassador to Washington, said the prince had never forgiven the Palestinians for siding with Saddam Hussein after he invaded Kuwait. “For Prince Bandar, that was the original betrayal,” Mr. Indyk said. “He clearly could not stand by when they accused the U.A.E. of betrayal.” Mr. Indyk said he doubted the program foreshadowed an imminent Saudi move to normalize relations with Israel. “But Bandar is an important representative of the old guard in the Saudi royal family,” he said. “So it’s an indication that there will be a supportive environment for such a move,” whenever the Saudi leadership decides to make it. Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut.']","The remarks by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, a senior member of the royal family, signaled an erosion of Saudi support for the Palestinian cause."
"On Capitol Hill, the prospects for a stimulus deal before the election remain murky.",2020-10-05,By Lauren Hirsch,"['Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that President Trump’s positive test for coronavirus “changes the dynamic of stimulus talks.” But developments since suggest that the sides are still far apart on negotiating a new pandemic aid package, according to today’s DealBook newsletter. Those pushing hard for a bill include the White House. Mr. Trump tweeted from the hospital on Saturday that the country “wants and needs” more stimulus. For Mr. Trump, a deal would serve as a sign of his authority, taking attention away from his health and unfavorable polls. Congressional leaders, though, are still haggling. When asked Sunday whether Mr. Trump’s comments meant the two parties were closer to a deal, Ms. Pelosi demurred: “No, it means that we want to see that they will agree on what we need to do to crush the virus so that we can open the economy and open our schools safely.” She said that the parties were “making progress” toward a deal, but with Mr. Biden ahead in the polls, Democrats may feel they have the upper hand in negotiations. On the Senate side, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is balancing competing interests among his Republican colleagues — some want a deal to bring home to constituents and others are worried about approving another large spending deal. Adding to the difficulties, the Senate has delayed its next sitting until Oct. 19, to account for positive coronavirus tests among Republican members. Hanging in the balance are jobs and the economy. The longer people are out of the work, the harder it is for them to come back, suggesting that we may be entering the slow, grinding phase of a recovery that could tip into recession. There are still about twice as many people out of work now than before the pandemic, and without aid akin to what was in the first stimulus bill, weaker consumer spending, missed rent payments and other factors could ripple through the economy and the financial system.

"In Canada, Kamala Harris, a Disco-Dancing Teenager, Yearned for Home",2020-10-05,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — There were heirs to Canadian fortunes who lived in hillside mansions and arrived at their high school in luxury cars. There were children of Caribbean immigrants who commuted by bus or subway from a historically Black neighborhood. There were Anglophones, Francophones and kids from Chinatown. And then there was Kamala Harris, an extroverted American teenager who had moved to Montreal from California at age 12, dreamed of becoming a lawyer and liked dancing to Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. Thrown into one of Montreal’s most diverse public high schools, the young Ms. Harris — whose father was from Jamaica and mother from India — identified as African-American, her friends from high school recalled. At the same time, they said, she deftly navigated the competing racial and social divisions at the school. “In high school, you were either in the white or the Black group,” said Wanda Kagan, her best friend from Westmount High School, who had a white mother and an African-American father. “We didn’t fit exactly into either, so we made ourselves fit into both.” The future senator spent her formative adolescent years in a multicultural environment typical of many Canadian public schools. As she makes history as the first woman of color on a presidential ticket, Canadians have claimed her as a native daughter, seeing her as an embodiment of the country’s progressive politics. “Joe Biden’s new running mate, Kamala Harris, is a Westmount High graduate,” gushed the CBC, the Canadian national broadcaster. Such is the Kamala mania here that the school has designated an official to field media calls, which have come from across Canada as well as Latin America and Japan. Some also have a sense that if her ticket wins, it could mend Canada’s fraught ties with a once dependable ally. “She got educated in her earliest years through a Canadian lens and that was bound to have rubbed off,” said Bruce Heyman, a former ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama. Ms. Harris came to Montreal with her sister, Maya, and her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a breast cancer researcher who was divorced from the girls’ father, an eminent economist, and moved the family to pursue her career. Ms. Harris, who was born in 1964, has downplayed her time in Canada amid a racist misinformation campaign that she was not born American. She declined to comment for this article. But in her memoir, “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,” she described the culture shock of the move. “I was 12 years old, and the thought of moving away from sunny California in February, in the middle of the school year, to a French-speaking foreign city covered in 12 feet of snow was distressing,” she wrote. “My mother tried to make it sound like an adventure, taking us to buy our first down jackets and mittens, as though we were going to be explorers of the great northern winter,” she wrote. “But it was hard for me to see it that way.” Her mother initially sent the sisters to a Francophone school. It was a tumultuous time in Quebec, with an ascendant nationalist party and culture wars over language. “I used to joke that I felt like a duck, because all day long at our new school I’d be saying, ‘Quoi? Quoi? Quoi?’” — What? What? What? — Ms. Harris wrote in her memoir. At age 13, childhood friends said, Kamala mobilized local children to demonstrate in front of their apartment building because the owner had banned children from playing on the lawn. He backed down. Eventually the family settled on the top floor of a spacious Victorian home in an affluent neighborhood bordering Westmount, one of Canada’s wealthiest districts. “It was a comfortable home, with high ceilings, hardwood floors, Persian carpets,” recalled Ms. Kagan, who first met Ms. Harris in eighth grade and lived with her family for a time to escape an abusive stepfather. In September, Ms. Harris wrote a tweet about her friend’s abuse, saying, “One of the reasons I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her.” Westmount High, which counts Leonard Cohen among its alumni, was founded in 1874. Its catchment included not only the moneyed Westmount municipality, but also Little Burgundy — once known as “the Harlem of the North” — whose Black churches, Black community center and storied jazz clubs made it a center for Black culture. The school was roughly 60 percent white and 40 percent Black in 1978 to 1981, when Ms. Harris attended it, said Garvin Jeffers, a former principal who then led the math department. Still, Ms. Kagan said the school’s divisions “were more about who had the latest Jordache jeans than about race.” Ms. Harris straddled the school’s diverse worlds, her friends said. Hugh Kwok, the child of Chinese immigrants, can be seen in a 1981 yearbook photo with Ms. Harris’s arm leaning on his shoulder. Ms. Harris, he said, “melted in with everyone.” Anu Chopra Sharma, who was in Ms. Harris’s French and math classes, recalled the two bonding over having Indian names. “She said to me, ‘You have an Indian name but you don’t look Indian,’ and I said the same to her,” she said. “You couldn’t easily label her,” Ms. Sharma added. Although Ms. Harris mingled widely, Ms. Kagan said “she identified as being African-American.” She found belonging in the Black community, and “was drawn to the Little Burgundy kids.” She recalled that she and Ms. Harris attended Black community dance parties and griped about having to be home by 11 p.m. Above all, she found sisterhood in an all-female dance troupe, Super Six, later Midnight Magic. The girls wore glittering homemade costumes and performed aerobically charged disco moves in front of the school and at homes for the elderly. Ms. Harris was called Angel. Ms. Kagan said she and Ms. Harris spent long hours rehearsing, inspired by “Solid Gold,” a 1980s pop music television show featuring performers lip-syncing, surrounded by writhing dancers in shiny Lycra. “We were six girls with big personalities who were every shade of brown and Black, and Kamala could hold her own on the dance floor,” Ms. Kagan said. Trevor Williams, a former basketball player on the Canadian Olympic team, dated Maya Harris in high school. He recalled Maya as more bookish and shy, and Kamala as more outgoing. “Maya was more of the brainiac, every test 100 percent, Kamala was a bit more laid back,” he said. “They were always so organized compared to the rest of us.” He recalled that the Harris sisters played down their relative affluence. “I didn’t even realize at the time that their mother was this high-powered doctor.” Ms. Harris was prepared and forceful in intellectual discussions, her classmates recalled. She was also active — performing in fashion shows, working on the yearbook and part of the Pep Club, whose members yelled and sang at school events accompanied by a rabbit mascot, Purple Peter. At the heart of it all, however, was her family life. Ms. Harris’s mother was an abiding influence. Ms. Kagan recalled the warmth of their home, where Indian rice dishes simmered and studying was mandatory. “Her mom was strong and instilled that in Kamala,” she said. Every summer, the girls filled a freezer chest with blanched tomatoes in plastic bags, sucking the air out with straws. The tomatoes were used for soups and sauces. Dr. Gopalan Harris, who had a doctorate in endocrinology and nutrition from Berkeley, spent 16 years in Montreal, at the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University Faculty of Medicine. She developed a method for assessing cancerous breast tissue that became a standard procedure nationwide. As high school drew to a close, the Canadian version of the prom arrived. Ms. Harris was part of a group of girls who attended without dates so that girls who hadn’t been asked out wouldn’t feel excluded. “We decided that we were going to change the culture,” Ms. Kagan said. “Kamala was, like, ‘Let’s do it!’” The next step for Ms. Harris was Howard University in Washington. She had already been pining for home. In the high school yearbook she described her most cherished memory as a 1980 trip to Los Angeles. She thanked her mother and encouraged her sister: “Be cool MA YA!” Her favorite expression? “Naw, I’m just playing.” “By the time I got to high school, I had adjusted to our new surroundings,” she wrote in her memoir. “What I hadn’t gotten used to was the feeling of being homesick for my country. I felt this constant sense of yearning to be back home.”\u3000']",
The Pilgrimage Must Go On: Senegal Holds Festival That Could Draw Millions,2020-10-06,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — All roads to the holy city of Touba were bumper-to-bumper. Buses packed with pilgrims inched along, their roofs piled high with foam mattresses. Tollbooth attendants smiled in greeting and held out ungloved hands for change, all day long. Many people wore masks. Many did not. Huge throngs of people traveled in recent days to Touba, 120 miles east of Senegal’s capital of Dakar, for West Africa’s largest religious gathering — the Magal — which commemorates the exile of a Muslim spiritual leader. It is expected to be one of the biggest events to be held anywhere in the world since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In a typical year, as many as four or five million attend the Magal, though no estimates were yet available this year. The leader of the Mourides, the Muslim sect that organizes the event, issued the annual call for pilgrims to come, despite the pandemic. The government of Senegal, which has been heaped with praise for its handling of the outbreak, did not try to ban it. And the levels of traffic suggested that most people were going ahead, despite the risks. One of the beauties of the Magal, in normal years, is its emphasis on community and hospitality. Pilgrims do not book hotel rooms: Touba’s residents open up their homes and travelers bed down, many to each room. Lunch and dinner, in the Senegalese tradition, are usually eaten off a communal plate. “My family lives in Touba. I host a lot of people at home. That’s why I couldn’t stay in Dakar,” said Serigne Diop, a 31-year-old mechanic who spoke by phone from Touba. He said he was surrounded by people not wearing masks and took an overcrowded bus from the capital to get there. Many government ministers and dignitaries joined the pilgrimage too. The event is officially taking place on Tuesday but lasts about a week. It has already been well documented that Magal pilgrims are particularly susceptible to viruses, because of the event’s inherent lack of social distancing. A study released last year showed that the prevalence of respiratory tract infection symptoms among pilgrims increased fivefold following the pilgrimage. This year, the authors of that study released a letter warning older people and those with chronic medical conditions to stay away from the Magal, and urged those who attended to wear masks and wash hands. “During the event, streets around the Grand Mosque and the general market present an extremely high density of population,” the letter said. “All these conditions are very likely to favor the transmission of respiratory pathogens among pilgrims.” Washing hands may be difficult. The number of people using Touba’s water multiplies during the Magal, and most years, there are water shortages. This year too, faucets are running dry, the local press has reported, except for a dribble late at night. Many African countries have reported caseloads and deaths linked to Covid-19 that are much lower than in other continents, particularly in Europe and North America. Although many cases may have been missed because of low testing levels, epidemiologists say that the young median age of the continent is likely a significant factor, and that some countries’ hot weather and tendency to live much of life outdoors may play a role. Studies are underway to test the hypothesis that previous exposure to other coronaviruses may have strengthened some people’s immune systems. Like many West African countries, Senegal had good protocols in place for contact tracing, partly as a result of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and can turn tests for the coronavirus around fast. It never reported many more than 100 new coronavirus cases a day, and over the past two months, its caseload has fallen. On Tuesday, that was only 19 of 777 tests done, the health ministry said. But not everyone with Covid-like symptoms receives a test in Senegal, and with over 80 percent of Covid-19 cases in Africa being asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization, many cases may go under the radar. On a trip to Touba last Thursday, Senegal’s health minister told local journalists that he would be deploying 5,000 health ministry officials to Touba to monitor it and respond if necessary. He did not respond to calls or text messages requesting an interview, or answer questions about why the Magal had not been canceled and why many ministers were attending. The Magal commemorates the exile of the Mourides’ founder, Sheikh Amadou Bamba, to Gabon. French colonial authorities sent him there in 1895, fearful of his pacifist struggle against them. And the government would have a hard time overruling the Mourides, who wield great power in Senegal, a country of about 16 million people. One young marabout — a religious leader — said he was in Touba because their leader had issued a ndiguel, or order. “We are aware of the national and international context, but we couldn’t do otherwise, because of the order coming from the Caliph, who asked all followers to come,” said Cheikh Cissé, 28, who runs a Koranic school, and trades religious books in Dakar. “That’s why I decided, whatever the situation, to go to Touba.” Most years, there is a ceremony at Sheikh Amadou Bamba’s mausoleum. But that element has been canceled this year, while other events are going ahead. In one, broadcast on Facebook on Monday, dozens of men gathered in a large room, sitting on silver couches and a carpeted floor. Microphones were passed around, and the men took turns greeting each other. Masks were worn, some covering the nose, but some only covering the mouth or even the chin. The Magal is not the only mass global religious event currently taking place. In Iraq’s holy city of Karbala, tens of thousands of worshipers have been arriving for the Arbaeen, another of the world’s biggest religious pilgrimages. And Saudi Arabia began lifting coronavirus restrictions in Mecca on Sunday, welcoming pilgrims for the first time since March. In August, hundreds of thousands attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and thousands marched against coronavirus restrictions in Berlin. This year, closed borders for Covid-19 prevented some would-be Magal pilgrims living abroad from going to Touba. And others were put off by concerns that they could catch or spread the virus. But not all. “I can’t say that Covid does not exist, but as a Bamba follower I’m not scared, because Bamba’s spiritual path and teaching is stronger than Covid-19,” said Khady Seye, a 45-year-old fish trader, speaking by telephone from Touba. “If I don’t wear a mask, I might get in trouble with the police. That’s why I’m wearing one — not because I’m scared.” Ousmane Balde contributed reporting from Dakar.']","Pilgrims from across the West African country flocked to the holy city of Touba, where they slept, ate and prayed together for the Magal religious festival — despite coronavirus concerns."
Far-Right Extremism Taints German Security Services in Hundreds of Cases,2020-10-06,By Christopher F. Schuetze and Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Germany’s security services recorded more than 1,400 cases of suspected far-right extremism among soldiers, police officers and intelligence agents in the three years ending in March, according to a government report released Tuesday. The report, compiled by the domestic intelligence service, is a first attempt to document the extent of far-right infiltration of the security services. It comes as the number of cases of extremists found in police forces and the military has multiplied. Dozens of police officers have been suspended for joining far-right chat groups and sharing neo-Nazi propaganda. In June, the defense minister disbanded a whole company of Germany’s special forces after explosives, a machine gun and SS memorabilia were found on the property of a sergeant major. Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister who presented the new report flanked by intelligence and police chiefs, said Tuesday that there should be “no tolerance” for extremists and that every case was “shameful.” But Mr. Seehofer insisted that there was no “structural problem,” and said the vast majority of people in the security services were loyal to the German Constitution. “We are dealing with a small number of cases,” he said. “The overwhelming majority of the employees at our security agencies — over 99 percent — are firmly rooted in our Constitution.” The 98-page report, which covers a period beginning in January 2017, took a less sanguine tone. It said the real number of extremists was almost certainly higher than that reported and warned that even a relatively small number of highly trained officers who are radicalized constituted “a significant danger for the state and for society.” Identifying extremists remains a “high priority” for the security service, the report said. For years, German politicians and security chiefs rejected any suggestion that the security services had been infiltrated by the far right, acknowledging only “individual cases.” The idea of networks was routinely dismissed, and the superiors of those identified as extremists were protected. That has been changing. Last month, the head of the military counterintelligence agency, Christof Gramm, was dismissed because the agency on his watch had repeatedly failed in its mission to monitor and detect extremism in the armed forces. “We are getting away from ‘individual cases’ and are able to get an overview,” Thomas Haldenwang, the head of the domestic intelligence, said Tuesday. He said his agency would keep investigating “if we are facing networks of far-right extremists who are expanding their connections.” Mr. Haldenwang, whose agency was founded after World War II and is known as the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, has warned that far-right extremism and terrorism constitute the biggest risk for Germany’s democracy today. Over the past 15 months, Germany has witnessed three deadly terrorist attacks by far-right extremists. A regional politician was shot on his front porch, a synagogue was attacked and nine people of immigrant descent were shot. Tuesday’s report compiled cases of extremism recorded by the state and federal police authorities, the intelligence services and, separately, by the armed forces. Most cases by far — 1,069 — were reported by the military. In civilian law enforcement agencies, the report listed 377 cases. The western state of Hesse, which was in the news after private data used in neo-Nazi death threats was traced back to a police computer, reported the biggest number of suspected extremists. The report noted that the number of cases didn’t directly correspond to individuals, as a single individual can be involved in several cases and cases can involve several individuals. Some cases reported on Tuesday had already been dismissed after investigation or resolved, the report said. The number of cases has continued to rise since data for the report was collected. Last month, the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia suspended 29 police officers suspected of sharing images of Hitler and violent neo-Nazi propaganda in online chat groups. Last week, another group, this time intelligence agents responsible for monitoring far-right extremists, was found to have shared xenophobic and anti-Islamic videos. In Berlin, the police commissioner announced that 25 officers had participated in chats in which they likened Muslims to primates. Mr. Seehofer, the interior minister, has resisted repeated calls to order a nationwide study on the prevalence of racism in the country’s police forces.']","A report by the domestic intelligence agency listed more than 1,400 instances in which soldiers, police officers and intelligence officials were suspected of extremist actions, posing “a significant danger.”"
"Hurricane Delta Moves Into Gulf After Striking, but Mostly Sparing, Mexico",2020-10-07,By Kirk Semple,"['Go here for the latest on Hurricane Delta MEXICO CITY — Hurricane Delta made landfall in southeastern Mexico near the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula early Wednesday, knocking out power, felling trees, shattering windows and causing scattered flooding in cities and towns along the Caribbean coast. But regional and federal officials said they had received no reports of deaths. The storm hit near the port town of Puerto Morelos, just south of a major Mexican tourism destination, Cancún, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern time, with maximum winds estimated at 110 miles per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. By early afternoon, the center of the storm had crossed the peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Mexico, north of the Dzilam de Bravo State Reserve. The hurricane had been downgraded from a Category 4, making landfall as a weaker Category 2. But forecasters predicted that the storm would again gather strength as it barreled across the warm waters of the southern and central Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday before approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on Friday. As of late Wednesday, Delta was moving northwest at about 17 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of about 90 miles per hour and higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The governors of Alabama and Louisiana declared states of emergency on Tuesday, and several coastal areas began mandatory evacuations on Wednesday. College football officials said Wednesday morning that Saturday’s game between Louisiana State University and the University of Missouri would be moved from Baton Rouge, La., to Columbia, Mo. The Southeastern Conference, whose membership includes both schools as well as 12 other universities, also left open the possibility that the storm would affect other athletic events in the coming days. In Mexico, Luís Alberto Ortega Vázquez, a top official with the national civil protection agency, said Wednesday morning that there had been no immediate accounts of deaths from the storm but said that the authorities had received reports of fallen trees and damage to the Yucatán Peninsula’s electrical grids. Though the hurricane’s impact in Mexico was apparently not as severe as anticipated when it reached Category 4 status on Tuesday night, the storm will almost certainly set back the Yucatán Peninsula’s efforts to revive its tourism industry, which has been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “What we have to do is get back on our feet quickly,” Carlos Orvañanos Rea, spokesman for the government of the state of Quintana Roo, said on Wednesday in an interview with the FOROtv cable news channel. “We are on a path of economic reactivation.” Visitors to the region were breathing a sigh of relief on Wednesday as the hurricane delivered a lesser punch than many had feared. Luis González, 35, a publicist for musicians, was holed up in a hotel in the coastal city of Playa del Carmen, south of Puerto Morelos, as the storm lashed the region Wednesday morning. He had been visiting the beach town of Tulum and had planned to fly back to Mexico City on Tuesday night, but learned late Tuesday afternoon that the flight had been canceled. He knew one of the owners of a hotel in Playa del Carmen “where people shelter in hurricanes,” he said, so he made a beeline there. He and other guests were given rooms in the rear of the hotel, away from the water, and were provided with a dinner buffet and a box lunch for the morning. Mr. González likened the hurricane to a normal, intense storm with periods marked by “continuous wind gusts with rain.” Preparations for the storm’s arrival began earlier in the week as the hurricane drew a bead on Mexico, with activity growing feverish on Tuesday as residents across the Yucatán Peninsula stocked up on groceries, hardware materials and gasoline, and pulled boats from the water and moved them inland. Government officials ordered nonessential businesses to close as emergency crews helped evacuate inhabitants from low-lying coastal areas and islands and relocate them inland. Scores of hotels along the Caribbean Coast — including in popular tourism destinations like Cancún, Playa del Carmen and Tulum — moved their guests to shelters. “The most important thing is to take care of everyone’s life so that we don’t lose anybody,” said Carlos Joaquín, the governor of the state of Quintana Roo, which borders the Caribbean coast of the peninsula. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Ortega Vázquez, the federal civil protection official, said that more than 39,000 people, including residents and tourists, had been evacuated from hotels and homes in the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán as the storm approached, with many seeking refuge in scores of temporary storm shelters. While the exact track of the hurricane remained uncertain, there is a risk of dangerous storm surge, wind and rainfall along the coast from Louisiana to the western portions of the Florida Panhandle beginning Thursday night or Friday. Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said the conditions would be ideal for the storm to strengthen back to a Category 4 as it passed through the southern Gulf of Mexico and approach the United States as a “major hurricane.” It has been a brutal year for hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which was heavily battered by Laura in September. That hurricane caused more than two dozen deaths and extensive property damage. Delta is the sixth named storm to put Louisiana in its potential path. While the state largely avoided wide-scale destruction from Cristobal, Marco, Sally and Beta, each storm brought to the area a fresh round of evacuations and fear. The process started anew this week. Orange Beach, a city in Alabama, offered sand bags to residents on Tuesday, while residents again anxiously prepared for evacuations and watched ominous weather forecasts. About four to eight inches of rain are expected in some areas of the central Gulf Coast, with up to 12 inches in some areas, along with flash flooding, the Hurricane Center said. “Folks there should make sure they have their hurricane plan in place, have their supplies and monitor the updates to the forecasts,” Mr. Feltgen said. “I know there’s a lot of hurricane weariness out there with Laura and Sally so fresh on everybody’s minds, but here we go again.” The Hurricane Center recommended that people monitor forecasts frequently, as storms can quickly slow down, grow stronger or shift track, he said. This hurricane season has been one of the most active on record. Last month, meteorologists ran out of names after a storm named Wilfred formed in the Atlantic. Subtropical storm Alpha, the first of the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet, quickly formed thereafter, becoming the 22nd named storm since May. Forecasters have resorted to the Greek alphabet only once before, in 2005, when meteorologists used six Greek names in a season that had 28 storms, Mr. Feltgen said. Reporting was contributed by Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor from London, Marie Fazio and Concepción de León from New York, Mike Ives from Hong Kong, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.']",The Category 2 storm passed over the Yucatán Peninsula and was expected to reach the Gulf Coast of the United States by Friday.

"Putin, Long the Sower of Instability, Is Now Surrounded by It",2020-10-07,By Anton Troianovski,"['YEREVAN, Armenia — In Russia’s self-proclaimed sphere of influence, Russia is losing its influence. Concurrent crises in Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus region have blindsided the Kremlin, leaving it scrambling to shore up Russian interests in former Soviet republics and undermining President Vladimir V. Putin’s image as a master tactician on the world stage. “There is nothing good about these conflicts for Moscow,” Konstantin Zatulin, a senior Russian lawmaker and Putin ally who specializes in relations with what Russians call their “near abroad.” Mr. Putin has spent years building up Russia as a global power, with a hand in hot spots from Latin America to the Middle East, and even meddling in presidential elections in the United States. But after working for years to destabilize the West, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by instability; once seen as sure-handed in foreign affairs, he seems to have lost his touch. In Belarus, Mr. Putin responded to a street uprising in August by propping up the country’s unpopular autocrat, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, turning public opinion against Russia in what had previously been Europe’s most Russia-friendly country. In Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, protesters this week appeared on the verge of toppling President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, less than two weeks after Mr. Putin pledged to him in a rare in-person meeting that “we will do everything to support you as the head of state.” And in the Caucasus, the long-simmering conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted last week into the worst fighting since the 1990s, threatening to undo the balancing act that had allowed Russia to cultivate diverse links to the region. “Russia was doing all it could to maintain ties both with Azerbaijan and Armenia,” Mr. Zatulin said. “Every day of conflict in Karabakh is, effectively, helping zero out Russia’s authority.” The spate of new challenges to Russian influence strikes at the heart of Mr. Putin’s yearslong effort to cast himself as the leader who restored the great-power status that the nation lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as the Kremlin denied Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election, Russian state television gleefully reported on the American allegations of that interference as a sign that Moscow was being reckoned with again on the world stage. Now, rather than react decisively to emergencies close to home, Mr. Putin sounds ambivalent about Russia’s role. “We hope the conflict will end very soon,” he said of Nagorno-Karabakh, in a television interview broadcast Wednesday. Minutes later, referring to Kyrgyzstan, he said, “We hope that everything will be peaceful.” The confluence of crises in Russia’s own neighborhood is such that some pro-Kremlin commentators are already accusing the West of an organized campaign to sow discord in the post-Soviet regions. More balanced analysts, however, have singled out one constant factor in the growing unrest. Both Russia and its neighbors, they say, have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed distrust in institutions and in out-of-touch leaders across the region. It helped undo the fragile truce between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in Belarus and in Kyrgyzstan, the disease set the stage for public uprisings by exposing the ruling elite as disconnected from people’s suffering. Mr. Lukashenko angered Belarusians by playing down the danger of the virus, joking that vodka would cure it; in Kyrgyzstan, critics blamed officials for using coronavirus aid money to enrich themselves. Within Russia, the economic hardship caused by the pandemic has helped deepen public anger against Mr. Putin. In the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk, for example, thousands of protesters angry over the arrest of a popular governor spilled into the streets last Saturday for the 13th week in a row. Some analysts say that public discontent within Russia means that Mr. Putin needs to turn more of his focus to domestic issues such as economy hardship, pollution and poor health care, rather than delving into global geopolitics. But developments in recent weeks have given Mr. Putin more reason to focus on the latter. “For Putin, practically his entire mission and his vision of Russian greatness and success revolve around his foreign-policy agenda,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research organization focused on politics and policy. The new series of crises, she went on, “will very much distract Putin from domestic problems.” The centrality of the former Soviet lands to Mr. Putin’s foreign policy was evident in the Kremlin’s list of world leaders who called Mr. Putin to wish him a happy birthday on Wednesday, when he turned 68. Of the 12 who called, only three leaders — those of Israel, India and Cuba — head countries outside the former Soviet Union. In Armenia, which hosts a Russian military base, some hope for a more forceful stance by Russia in the conflict, which has already killed at least 250 people, according to official reports. But Russia’s ability to influence events in the Caucasus now appears limited, despite its past role as a mediator in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey, Azerbaijan’s most important ally, has taken on a more assertive regional stance. “Turkey, indeed, in this current situation probably should be considered as a balance to unilateral Russian interference,” said Farid Shafiyev, chairman of the Center of Analysis of International Relations in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the Caucasus, he added, “the Russian role is probably diminishing.” Across the former Soviet Union, Russian remains the lingua franca, and the proliferation of mostly uncensored internet access across the region means that protests in one country can easily inspire a disenchanted populace in another. Some protesters in Belarus carried signs supporting the demonstrations in Khabarovsk, over 4,000 miles away. And ahead of Kyrgyzstan’s parliamentary elections last Sunday, government critics were keeping an eye on Belarus, where it was a blatantly falsified election in August that sparked the uprising against Mr. Lukashenko. “In Kyrgyzstan it was often said that we will copy the Belarusians,” said Aybek Sultangaziyev, director of a news agency in Kyrgyzstan, K-News. “In fact, we surpassed the Belarusians in effectiveness and precision.” Mr. Sultangaziyev said that if his country’s uprising succeeds, the new leadership will seek to maintain close ties with Moscow. In Armenia, too, the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan retained its alliance with Russia after the prime minister came to power in a popular uprising in 2018. “We have never been pro-Western or pro-Eastern,” said Ruben Rubinyan, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Armenian Parliament. “Russia has been and is an ally of Armenia, a very important ally.” But, for Moscow, recent events in Belarus offer a cautionary tale that illustrates the fragility of Russia’s standing among its neighbors — carrying echoes of Ukraine’s more violent departure from Russia’s orbit in 2014. Some Belarusians who had been well disposed toward Mr. Putin turned against him after he propped up Mr. Lukashenko in the face of the protests. Mr. Zatulin, the Russian lawmaker, said officials “at the highest levels of the Russian Federation” believed that Mr. Lukashenko would need to step down “sooner or later.” But Mr. Lukashenko had argued to Russian officials, Mr. Zatulin said, that his stepping down in the face of street protests could set a dangerous precedent for what might happen to Mr. Putin himself. “By unconditionally supporting Lukashenko, we are creating an enormous problem for ourselves in the future with the majority or a significant part of the Belarusian population,” Mr. Zatulin said. “We are creating a problem for ourselves with the other Belarusian politicians and public figures, who are increasingly forced to seek sympathy in the West. Russia wants that least of all.” Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.']","Fueled by the pandemic, uprisings in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan and a war in the Caucasus region are undermining the influence of the Russian leader."
Paris will close its bars and many cafes for at least two weeks starting on Tuesday.,2020-10-05,By Aurelien Breeden and Constant Méheut,"['Bars in Paris will close for two weeks starting on Tuesday, the authorities there announced on Monday, as France tries to stem a surge of coronavirus cases in its capital. The measure will also affect most cafes, which in many cases serve alcohol, but little or no food. Restaurants will be able to remain open if they follow a strict health protocol. Paris joined a handful of other French areas that have been placed on maximum alert because of a continued rise in infections, especially among older people. Local health authorities said the capital had been above the thresholds for the top alert level — more than 250 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people generally, more than 100 per 100,000 in the elderly, and more than one-third of intensive care beds used for Covid-19 patients — since last Thursday. On average, there are over 3,500 new infections a day in Paris and 203 active clusters, especially among young people for whom the incidence rate is over 500 infections per 100,000 people. In France generally, the seven-day average for new daily cases is above 11,000. The Paris region has as many patients hospitalized for coronavirus as it did in May, when the country was just exiting its two-month lockdown. Mayor Anne Hidalgo and the head of the Paris police said at a news conference on Monday that the bar closures would apply to Paris and the surrounding suburbs. Gyms, dancing halls and enclosed swimming pools will be closed to adults, though minors will be allowed to use gyms and pools. “The epidemic is going too fast,” said Didier Lallement, the Paris police chief. “We need to brake now before our health system is submerged.” Restaurants will have to keep registers of customers for contact-tracing, distance tables by one meter, keep seating to no more than six per table and take payments at the table. Those restaurant rules will also apply in other maximum-risk areas, including the southern cities of Aix-en-Provence and Marseille, where the authorities had closed restaurants under a tightening of restrictions last month. But bars in those two cities will remain closed for at least another week. Starting on Tuesday, new restrictions will also apply to universities in areas on high alert, with classrooms and lecture halls operating at half capacity or below. Retirement home visits will become appointment-only, and with a maximum of two people per visit. “Living with it and protecting, that’s the goal we must have,” Ms. Hidalgo said, adding that she hoped she would be able to come back in 15 days with good news about “the epidemic’s front line.”']",
Distrust of China Jumps to New Highs in Democratic Nations,2020-10-06,By Chris Buckley,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Xi Jinping celebrates China’s battle against the coronavirus as a success. But in the United States and other wealthy democracies, the pandemic has driven negative views of China to new heights, a survey published on Tuesday showed. The illness, deaths and disruption caused by the coronavirus in those countries have intensified already strong public distrust of China, where the virus emerged late last year, the results from the Pew Research Center’s survey indicated. “Unfavorable opinion has soared over the past year,” said the survey on views of China taken this year in 14 countries including Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany, Italy and other European nations. “Today, a majority in each of the surveyed countries has an unfavorable opinion of China.” The results illustrate how much negative opinions of China have taken hold around the world in recent years. To China’s leaders, such wary attitudes could present obstacles for the Communist Party’s ambitions of expanding Beijing’s influence. The tide of public distrust could make cooperation harder even on issues where national interests align. “Public opinion is a powerful constraint,” said Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat who is a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, where she studies public opinion and foreign policy. “We can see in both Australia and the United States, for example, souring public opinion has served as a powerful driver for governments to be particularly vocal” about China. The U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was in Tokyo on Tuesday for meetings with his counterparts from Japan, Australia and India — all nations that have had icy relations with China. Mr. Pompeo is often condemned by Chinese officials as an ideological warrior bent on subduing Beijing. In many Western countries, the coronavirus crisis appears to have deepened public unease about China and Mr. Xi, China’s proudly authoritarian leader. Across the 14 countries surveyed, an average of 61 percent of respondents said China had done a bad job of responding to the outbreak. In the United States, negative views about China increased by 13 percentage points compared to a similar survey last year. Close to three-quarters of 1,003 American respondents surveyed in June and July said they now had a somewhat or very unfavorable view of China. Distrust of Mr. Xi’s international intentions reached new highs in every country surveyed, except for Japan and Spain. In the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and several Western European nations, roughly half of the respondents said they had “no confidence at all” in Mr. Xi. “I think this sentiment is likely to persist because of longer-term trends in China toward growing repression,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, an associate professor of government at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy. “As long as its order of priorities remains in place, it will be difficult for the Chinese Communist Party to really turn around the trends in public opinion overseas.” The rise in disapproving opinions of China was starkest in Australia, which has been mired in diplomatic flare-ups with Beijing in recent months. Australia has protested the detention in China of Cheng Lei, an Australian news anchor working for Chinese state-run television, and Yang Hengjun, an Australian businessman and writer born in China who is accused of espionage, charges that his supporters say are baseless. The number of Australian respondents with negative views of China grew by 24 percentage points compared to a year ago, so that 81 percent said they saw China unfavorably. That was a drastic turn from 2017, when 64 percent of Australian respondents said they had a favorable view of China. “Until two years ago, the Australian public very much saw China as an economic opportunity,” said Ms. Kassam, the Australian researcher. China’s response to the outbreak has only deepened skepticism in Australia, she said. In interviews, several Sydney residents said that China could not be held entirely responsible for the global spread of the coronavirus, but that the crisis had shown how exposed Australia, and the rest of the world, was to Chinese power. “As far as I’m concerned, we should move away from China as quickly as possible. They’re too strong, and they can just outrun us,” said Edward Davis, a semiretired commercial lawyer. “We should do our best to trade with them, but we also need to diversify.” At home, the Communist Party has tried to turn the coronavirus crisis into a political asset by assiduously censoring criticism of its early missteps in the outbreak and highlighting its later success in sharply reducing infections. But abroad, the Chinese government’s sometimes-triumphant rhetoric and claims of selfless altruism during the crisis have grated in societies struggling to cope with outbreaks or lockdowns. European governments were irritated when China pressed European officials to praise China for medical supplies that it had sent, when Beijing had been muted about the help it provided in the first months of the pandemic. The combative language used by Chinese officials in international disputes has also irked many in Australia, Canada and other countries. “Many Chinese people seem to have forgotten the first few scary weeks that we experienced, but other countries have not forgotten,” Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said by telephone. “It would be better if China had been more low-key and humble.” The Chinese government has pushed back against the negative sentiment, asserting that it has been unfairly maligned by Western news outlets and politicians who want to escape responsibility for mishandling the crisis. The Pew survey usually covers many more countries in Asian, Latin America and Africa where the public often offers more upbeat views about China. But the pandemic made it impossible to organize safe and reliable face-to-face polling, reducing the international scope of the survey, said Laura Silver, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center. The survey was conducted by telephone, with calls lasting about 15 minutes. Public opinion in countries closely aligned with Beijing was likely to remain favorable to China despite the pandemic, Ms. Kassam said. “I think China’s handling of Covid has not so much changed any minds, but entrenched existing perceptions.” Chinese leaders may feel some consolation that many respondents in the Pew survey took an even dimmer view of how the United States has handled the pandemic. An average of 84 percent of the people surveyed across the 14 countries said the United States had done a bad job with the coronavirus. “In the end, this is more damaging for America than for China,” said Professor Shen, the scholar in Shanghai. “China cannot be used to explain away the 210,000 American people who have died from this.”']","The sharpest rise in negative views was in Australia, while unfavorable opinions jumped in the United States and Europe, a Pew survey found."
Interpol Issues ‘Red Notice’ for Thai Red Bull Heir,2020-10-05,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Interpol has issued a new “red notice” for the fugitive heir to the Red Bull fortune who fled Thailand after his Ferrari struck and killed a police officer in 2012, the police in Thailand said. The notice by the global police agency, its highest-level alert, comes after the police in Thailand reopened the case. The authorities, widely criticized for dropping charges against Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the inventor of the energy drink, are seeking Interpol’s help in arresting him, a police spokesman said on Monday. “We will do whatever it takes to bring him back,” said Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen, deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police. “We have been working around the clock to get him back to the country.” The case against Mr. Vorayuth, 37, who goes by the nickname Boss, had long been cited as evidence of the special treatment Thailand’s elite receives. The decision to drop charges against him in July was held up as a further example of impunity. Soon after the crash, Mr. Vorayuth’s family paid the police officer’s family nearly $100,000 in compensation. Mr. Vorayuth resumed his jet-set lifestyle, traveling around the world on private Red Bull jets, keeping a Porsche in London and staying in luxury hotels. After much public outrage over the decision to drop the case, the police reversed themselves in August, saying they had obtained new information and would reopen it. Colonel Kissana declined to discuss the new evidence, saying, “According to the law, if we receive new evidence, we are entitled to reopen the case.” He said Interpol issued the red notice on Wednesday. It has gone out to the international police agency’s other 193 member countries requesting help in locating Mr. Vorayuth, but the agency has yet to receive any new information on his whereabouts. Interpol previously issued a red notice for the Red Bull heir, but it did not lead to his arrest and was canceled after the Thai police dropped the case in July. The collision that killed the police officer, Wichean Glanprasert, occurred just before dawn in September 2012. The driver fled the scene, but a trail of leaking engine fluid led the police to Mr. Vorayuth’s door and to a damaged Ferrari nearby. The police initially arrested the family’s driver and were accused of trying to force him to take the blame. Bangkok’s police commissioner at the time, who took over the investigation, said it had been an attempt at a cover-up. The police also acknowledged that the wealthy playboy had been intoxicated and had admitted that his car hit the officer. But Mr. Vorayuth told them the officer, who was riding a motorcycle, had swerved in front of him. He was released on bail. During the investigation, Mr. Vorayuth repeatedly ignored police summonses. He fled the country in 2017, shortly before the first warrant for his arrest was issued. The statute of limitations has expired for some of the original charges, but he still faces a charge of reckless driving resulting in someone’s death, among other possible charges.']","The police in Thailand, widely criticized for dropping charges against the wealthy playboy in July after he was accused of a fatal hit-and-run, are seeking the agency’s help to arrest him."
"Indonesia’s Parliament Approves Jobs Bill, Despite Labor and Environmental Fears",2020-10-05,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Indonesia’s Parliament gave final approval Monday to a sweeping jobs-creation bill that would loosen labor and environmental regulations, moves that critics say would harm workers and permit widespread deforestation. With seven of Parliament’s nine political parties in favor, lawmakers easily passed the 905-page stimulus measure that aims to attract investment by slashing regulations contained in nearly 80 separate laws. Parliament had planned to consider the bill at the end of this week but moved up the vote after labor unions called for a three-day national strike starting Tuesday to protest the legislation. The measure has the backing of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, who is expected to sign it quickly. He is eager to push ahead with the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus, even though the number of cases is rising and large-scale social restrictions remain in place in Jakarta, the capital. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most-populous country, has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic. Its economy is expected to contract this year for the first time since the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s. For more than two weeks, Indonesia has averaged 4,000 new cases a day. On Monday, it reached a total of 307,120 cases and 11,253 deaths. Health experts say many more cases and deaths have gone unreported. Supporters of the omnibus bill say that it will attract investors by cutting regulations on businesses, speeding approval of projects and eliminating many permit requirements. “This bill is meant to create jobs and attract investments, from within the country and abroad, that are expected to increase the prosperity of the people,” Heri Gunawan, a member of Parliament who supports the measure, said during the debate. But opponents argued that slashing regulations on businesses would come at a high cost to workers and the environment. “The job creation bill is said to ease the way for business activities that increase investment and create more jobs, but the bill is full of various agendas that would potentially destroy the environment and violate the rights of the Indonesian people,” said Marwan Cik Asan, a member of Parliament who opposes the measure. Labor unions say that the legislation would harm workers by reducing severance pay, cutting mandatory leave, allowing longer work hours, and permitting the hiring of contract and part-time workers in place of full-time employees. After the vote, the president of the Indonesian Trade Union Confederation, Said Iqbal, vowed to go ahead with a national strike on Tuesday. He predicted that 2 million workers would participate. “Laborers will voice their rejection of the omnibus law,” he said. Environmentalists contend that by eliminating environmental reviews for many new projects, the legislation would lead to the destruction of primary rain forests that are essential in controlling carbon emissions and slowing climate change. Supporters of the measure say they expect it to attract foreign investment. But some foreign investors said that relaxing restrictions on forest burning would have the opposite effect. Hours before the vote, a group of 36 global investors representing more than $4 trillion in assets under management released an open letter calling on the Indonesian government to support the conservation of forests and peatlands and take a long-term approach to recovery from the pandemic. For decades, much of the destruction of Indonesia’s rain forests has been caused by palm oil producers who burn huge swathes of land to clear it for plantations. Indonesia is a major exporter of palm oil. The investors warned that by reversing recent gains in reducing burning, Indonesia could run afoul of restrictions being considered by the European Union on the import of products that result from deforestation. “Protecting tropical forests is vital for combating climate change, the degradation of ecosystems, and biodiversity loss, all of which pose systemic and material risks to our portfolios as well as to the health of our societies, economies, and environment,” the letter said. The human rights group Amnesty International Indonesia also criticized passage of the measure, saying that Parliament acted without consulting labor and rights groups and that the result is a measure that deprives Indonesian workers of their right to work and their workplace rights. Amnesty’s executive director for Indonesia, Usman Hamid, said the measure could violate Indonesia’s commitment to protect human rights as a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. He urged Parliament to reconsider. “This is a catastrophic law,” he said. “It will harm workers’ wallets, job security and their human rights as a whole.” Parliament approved the bill through a process known as “fraksi” in which each party casts a vote, rather than each lawmaker. This method is often used when there is little doubt about the result. About three quarters of Parliament’s members support Mr. Joko. In this case, only two parties opposed the bill, the Democratic Party of former president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party. Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting from Jakarta, Indonesia.']",Parliament moved up a vote on the coronavirus stimulus bill after unions called for a national strike. Critics say it will relax rules to prevent deforestation and protect workers.
"At Afghan Peace Talks, Hoping to End Their Fathers’ War",2020-10-05,By Mujib Mashal,"['DOHA, Qatar — They are here to end their fathers’ war. On both sides of the negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban are nearly a dozen children of men who played key roles in the Soviet conflict in the 1980s that set off four decades of violence and loss. Some of their fathers have since died of old age, insurgents to the end. Some faced more violent deaths, blown up in suicide bombings that have become a trademark of the war’s brutality. Many of the ones who have survived, their chests decked out in the medals and insignia of a conflict that has inflicted misery on millions, grew rich — enjoying palaces, political fortune, massive wealth. But they still play hide and seek with death. Those fathers fought alongside each other to drive out the Soviets, then turned their guns on each other in the power vacuum that followed, waging an atrocity-filled civil war. Now, their children know all too well what is at stake as the United States military continues its withdrawal with the peace talks in Qatar still up in the air: If the Afghan warring sides fail to agree on a formula of power-sharing, Afghanistan could break into another civil war, the conflict dragging on for another generation, with new enemies and new patrons. “If we lose this opportunity, we have lost Afghanistan,” said Fatima Gailani, whose father was one of the leaders of the mujahedeen resistance to the Soviets at the dawn of Afghanistan’s descent into chaos. “If we lose this opportunity, we have betrayed the people of Afghanistan — we have betrayed every child, every woman, above all we have betrayed the people who died in this war.” Ms. Gailani arrived in Doha, Qatar’s capital, in September as one of the 20 negotiators on the government’s side facing the Taliban, who reached a deal in February that started a United States military withdrawal. She got to Qatar just a week after her third surgery for throat cancer, her voice still hoarse. The last time Afghanistan was at such an inflection point, it was in the 1980s. Her father was a leader of the mujahedeen guerrillas against the Soviets, and he persuaded her to abandon her pursuit of a Ph.D. and become a spokeswoman for the mujahedeen factions as the war reached its endgame and the Soviets neared withdrawal. That turned out to be a nightmare that never ended, she said: The guerrillas were soon at one another’s throats, and the extremists among them who saw no place for women in government outnumbered the moderate factions like her father’s. “I am a 66-year-old woman, I cannot afford to be pessimistic,” Ms. Gailani said. “I see it as we are being given another opportunity.” On the Taliban side, too, are several children or relatives of men who were the leaders of the anti-Soviet war. Mawlawi Matiulhaq Khalis, almost 60, is the son of the late Mawlawi Mohammad Yunus Khalis, one of the key ideologues of the resistance. The senior Khalis’s claim to fame was that on a visit to the White House with President Ronald Reagan, who praised the mujahedeen as “freedom fighters,” he invited the American president to convert to Islam. Among the hardened graybeards on the insurgent side of the negotiations in Qatar is an obvious outlier, a young man of just 26, tall with gentle eyes. But he carries a name — Haqqani — that has become synonymous with the deadly bombings that rack Afghanistan’s cities. He is Anas Haqqani, the youngest son of the family patriarch, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who was once an ally of the United States against the Soviets but later founded the infamous Haqqani Network of the Taliban, bent on forcing the Americans out of Afghanistan. One of his other sons, Sirajuddin, became his successor and is now the deputy supreme leader of the Taliban and a central architect of the militants’ resurgence. But even as he represents the Taliban at the negotiating table now, Anas Haqqani insists in personal conversation that he is more interested in being seen as a poet. A sample verse: His ties to politics are out of obligation Anas’s interest is in poetry, sweeter than any throne. He spent five years in an Afghan prison, arrested as a 19-year-old in a joint effort by Afghan and American spies while he was in transit from Qatar in 2014. He was sentenced to death — for his family name and not for any crime he had committed, he says — before being let out in a prisoner exchange last year. When the United States was preparing to invade Afghanistan in 2001, chasing Osama bin Laden — who had close ties to the senior Haqqani, dating back to the mujahedeen struggle — Anas was just 7. The Americans, along with Pakistani middlemen, approached the senior Haqqani to see if he would betray his Taliban allies and Bin Laden by siding with them again. Anas quotes his father, who was already in his 60s at the time, as warning the Americans: “Sort it out through talks. But if you come as invaders, I will shoot you with this same weapon that I fought the Soviets.” The senior Haqqani developed a vast base in the tribal areas of Pakistan, built and buttressed in the lawless region by C.I.A. money from the anti-Soviet war. He lost four of his sons to U.S. drones and assassinations, and died of old age two years ago. His legacy is half a century of insurgency, and an entire infrastructure that trains children to chase glory in the fight against intrusive foreign powers. The example he set is clear, and feels particularly chilling right now: Old friends can always become new foes in somebody else’s war in Afghanistan. “Those in the right might be weaker in weapons, money, numbers — but we can still take the truth, smash the head of falsehood with it, crack its skull and spread its brains,” he is shown saying in a video clip released by the Taliban this year on the second anniversary of his death. He appears frail, with his head trembling, but is still dressed in his military-style fatigues. “This is the truth with which God smashed the skull of Americans.” “They are trying to create covers for their loss,” he continued, speaking about the United States’ search for an exit from Afghanistan. “But the cover is like putting pants on a camel — the pants rip open after the camel takes the first step, and then you see its privates.” Across the table from the youngest Haqqani is the alternative: children of legacy and privilege who are trying to cement what their fathers won by the gun with a softer image of democratic politics. With top-class educations, advisers and resources, they have made it to cabinet positions and parliamentary seats. The youngest, 25-year-old Khalid Noor, received a military degree in Britain and a bachelor’s degree in the United States. His father, the strongman Atta Mohammed Noor, had consolidated his grip as one of the most powerful political forces in northern Afghanistan, in part through his command of militia forces that were accused of abuses. At 31, Batour Dostum has already inherited the leadership of a political party that his father built. His father, Abdul Rashid Dostum, is one of the most notorious civil war strongmen, and perhaps the ultimate survivor of the Afghan conflict. After racking up accusations of human rights abuses over decades, the senior Dostum became a champion for his once-oppressed ethnic Uzbek minority, and rose to the country’s vice presidency. He didn’t stop there: Despite facing an open court case on charges of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a political opponent, he was recently given the honorary military rank of marshal, handed out just three times in the country’s history. Lasting peace would take more than just Afghans agreeing. Havens for guerrilla warfare would need to be dismantled in Pakistan, where they were first set up by the Americans, Pakistanis and Saudis, and where they seem to merely go into hibernation until a new enemy appears. Foreign nations are likely to remain involved — the country remains deeply dependent on aid. But truly helping Afghanistan would require those powers to reach some sort of equilibrium rather than continuing to fight for their interests through proxy battles there. Peace would also require a monumental reckoning among Afghans — if not actual healing from generations of devastation, at least a decision not to perpetuate more. “Unfortunately, all sides have made mistakes in the past 40 years, and you can see everyone is tired — everyone just wants to silence the guns,” Batour Dostum said. “We need to learn from the past, we need to be careful in the future not to repeat the mistakes. We are young, we should not be repeating those mistakes.” When asked what he can do to heal the wounds his side has inflicted on others, Anas Haqqani tried — with a verse, again — to say that his family is accused of more than it has actually done. The blind tell me your face is an ugly face The deaf say what you are saying is wrong. But there is no escaping that his father’s faction, inherited by his sons, has been behind some of the most scarring violence of the war. When pressed, he insisted that his time in prison had softened him: On social media, he can’t look at graphic images of the war — “no matter from which side” — and quickly scrolls past. “On a personal level, I feel sympathy with everyone — that we need to do whatever we can to heal their wounds,” Mr. Haqqani said. “I have seen my own brothers blown up to pieces. I feel the pain, because I have also lost my own.”']",The children of the war against the Soviets carry legacies of loss and determination — and their own generation’s crimes — as they meet to try to break a cycle of devastation.
"Cuomo won’t approve closing businesses in 9 N.Y.C. hot spots, but will close schools in those areas on Tuesday.",2020-10-05,"By Jesse McKinley, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Troy Closson and Daniel E. Slotnik","['Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York refused on Monday to allow New York City to close nonessential businesses in nine hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens where the coronavirus has spiked, pre-empting a plan announced the day before by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The governor suggested that the ZIP codes that were being used to identify hot spots were too imprecise to guide shutdowns. The more pressing problem, he said, lay in schools and houses of worship, including many that cater to Orthodox Jews, rather than businesses that “are not large spreaders.” The dissonance in messages from the state’s two most prominent politicians created confusion for residents, business owners and parents in the affected areas and drew scrutiny to the conflict between city and state over how to tackle early signs of a second wave of the virus in its onetime epicenter. The governor’s announcement also seemed to be yet another manifestation of his long feud with Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo has frequently second-guessed or overruled the mayor, who is also a Democrat, during their tenures. Those clashes were cast in sharp relief during the early days of the pandemic, with the city and state at odds over the timing of shutting down the city’s businesses and its schools, among other issues. On Monday, that disconnect continued, as Mr. Cuomo accelerated the mayor’s plan to close schools in newly hard-hit areas, moving the closure date up a day to Tuesday, and forcing parents in those areas to again rejigger their schedules to accommodate changes in their children’s routines. Mr. Cuomo said he spoke with Mr. de Blasio and Michael Mulgrew, the president of the city’s teachers’ union, among other local officials, on Monday morning and added that all were in agreement on the need for additional data on cases at specific schools. Mr. Cuomo did not rule out closing nonessential businesses or public spaces in the near future, and top aides suggested a state plan could be unveiled as soon as Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo said his administration was reviewing how best to do it without relying on geographic delineations from ZIP codes, which he said were arbitrary and might not accurately capture the areas where new cases are going up. “A ZIP code is not the best definition of the applicable zone,” he said. “If you have to circumscribe an area, make sure you have the right boundaries.” Cuomo administration officials later suggested that the boundaries for business closures could even exceed the ZIP codes where the increases are now occurring. On Monday afternoon, not long after the governor’s news conference, Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference of his own that he still planned to close nonessential businesses in the nine ZIP codes. He added later that “we obviously will follow state law, and if the state does not authorize restrictions we’re not going to act. But I find that very unlikely at this point.” Mr. Cuomo had also announced that the state would take over supervision of enforcement of mask and social-distancing rules in the hot spot clusters, presumably putting the State Police in charge of New York City Police Department officers. He added that local governments would need to provide personnel. The mayor said that he did not believe that the state could seize control of enforcement from local governments but that he agreed with Mr. Cuomo on the need for aggressive enforcement and “stronger restrictions that will allow us to turn the tide.”']",
"China Ramps Up a War of Words, Warning the U.S. of Its Red Lines",2020-10-05,By Steven Lee Myers,"['The soldiers run through the forest, through the surf, through smoke and flames, ready to die for the motherland. The video, one of a series that has recently appeared online in China, climaxes with the launch of nine ballistic missiles and a fiery barrage of explosions. “If war breaks out,” a chorus sings, “this is my answer.” Chinese propaganda is rarely subtle or particularly persuasive, but the torrent of bombast online and in state media in recent weeks is striking and potentially ominous. The targets are China’s main adversaries: the United States and Taiwan, which are moving closer and closer together. The propaganda has accompanied a series of military drills in recent weeks, including the test-firing of ballistic missiles and the buzzing of Taiwan’s airspace. Together, they are intended to draw stark red lines for the United States, signaling that China would not shrink from a military clash. While the prospect of war remains remote, the militaristic tone reflects the hawkishness of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping. The risk is that the propaganda could translate into more provocative actions, at a time when the relationship with the United States has sharply deteriorated. The recent military moves in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait raise the possibility of actual clashes, intended or not. In Washington, President Trump’s hospitalization for treatment of Covid-19 has overshadowed everything else, creating the impression that his administration is in chaos and raising fears of a decision-making void. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cut short his trip to Asia this week, although he is expected to push for confronting China when he meets in Tokyo with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan. China is already facing pressure over Taiwan and is pressing other disputed territorial claims, from the South China Sea to the Himalayas. If China feels directly challenged on any of those fronts, Mr. Xi may not be able to back down, having primed the public for a combative stance. One video featured a simulated airstrike on Guam, the American territory in the Pacific, with clips cribbed from two Hollywood films, “The Rock” and “The Hurt Locker.” Global Times, the voice of the Communist Party’s hawks, warned recently that the United States was “playing with fire” by supporting Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of a unified China. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, the editorial went on, would be “wiped out” if she moved against Chinese sovereignty. “I don’t think it’s just bluster, and I don’t think it’s just about venting anger,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who is an expert on Taiwan and China. “I think there is growing pressure — and that Xi Jinping finds that it’s useful to display that pressure.” More bombast is to come. The latest propaganda surge has coincided with the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, also known in China as the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which has long served as an instrument for stoking anti-American sentiment. Chinese forces intervened in the war on Oct. 19, 1950, and, as official narratives here have it, ultimately drove the American-led United Nations forces back to the 38th parallel in a heroic triumph of the newly established People’s Republic of China. With U.S.-China relations at a new low, officials and propagandists are using the anniversary to remind Chinese people that the nation has stood up to the world’s superpower before — and prevailed. A memorial museum dedicated to the conflict recently reopened in Dandong, a Chinese city across the Yalu River from North Korea. A series of films about the war is also rolling out — “to carry forward the great spirit of resisting U.S. aggression,” as the description of one documentary put it. A new war drama stars Wu Jing, the lead actor in the “Wolf Warrior” action film franchise that has given a name to Chinese diplomacy of late. It tells the story of a combat engineering unit keeping a crucial bridge intact during one of the last battles of the Korean conflict. “Never underestimate Chinese people’s determination to safeguard national security,” the editor of Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote on Twitter last week, after a ceremony commemorating the return of the remains of Chinese soldiers who died in South Korea. Mr. Hu, whose views are not official but echo those of the country’s hawks, has been regularly warning the United States that it risked starting a war with China. In his latest unsubstantiated claim, he warned that Mr. Trump could launch a drone attack on Chinese bases in the South China Sea. As always, China’s Communist Party has the ability to dial up propaganda — and to dial it down — to suit its domestic and geopolitical goals. China, for example, has been far less bellicose in its statements about India this summer, despite the lethal clashes along their border. With the United States, however, the tone has sharpened significantly as the Trump administration has moved almost daily to take on the Chinese — from closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston to banning TikTok and WeChat. Chinese propaganda often uses martial language and images. The fight against the coronavirus was declared a People’s War. Mr. Xi, too, evokes the idea of a warlike struggle to overcome threats. Last month he listed five conditions that China would “never accept,” including any effort to divide or bully the Chinese people. The flurry of videos released by the People’s Liberation Army, though, has left little doubt about its message. At least two have included the chorus “if war broke out today,” including one for the secretive submarine service — with details of equipment and geography blurred out. They have been viewed millions of times. Another video was even more explicit. It featured a bombing run with an H6 strategic bomber, zeroing in on a satellite photograph of a runway at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam. After briefly going viral, the post was removed without explanation. The new propaganda campaign has also emerged amid the increased military activity. This summer, China and Taiwan each held annual training exercises that simulated attacks across the Taiwan Strait. In one video, released by China’s Eastern Theater Command, troops rehearsed a landing on a beach on Hainan, the island off China’s southern coast whose geography is similar to Taiwan’s. Since then, China has repeatedly tested Taiwan’s defenses with air and sea patrols. Twice last month, squadrons of fighters and bombers crossed the unofficial median line over the Taiwan Strait, which both Taiwan and China have largely observed for decades. China’s tone boiled over with two visits by American officials, including one in August by Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, who was the most senior official to visit since the United States recognized the People’s Republic of China in 1979. Chinese officials repeatedly denounced American support for Taiwan, saying it nurtured pro-independence sentiment on the island. Beijing seems particularly alarmed by a renewed political debate in Washington about whether the United States should explicitly state its willingness to defend Taiwan from a military attack. The Global Times editorial suggested that a higher-level visit, by the secretary of state or defense, would give China reason to respond with force. A harsher tone has spread not only in state media, but also among Chinese academics and analysts with government-linked think tanks who influence policy debates. Zhu Songling, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said in a telephone interview that the Trump administration was testing “China’s bottom line.” “The United States has been playing the Taiwan cards too often and with too much intensity,” he said. An editorial by the Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Unification recounted the wars in Korea, in India in 1962 and in Vietnam in 1979 to warn that China would not be intimidated. “The United States, India, and Vietnam have all experienced strategic misjudgments in their military contests with China, and they have paid irreparable prices,” it said. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, argued in an article that the risks of conflict over the island were rising. He said, in a telephone interview, that China could deter Taiwan and the United States from underestimating its resolve by declaring its willingness to use force if pushed. “The United States unfortunately may mislead Tsai Ing-wen to misjudge the strategic situation,” Professor Shen said. “In an extreme situation, every country has a right to shoot first.” Others are pushing back against escalatory rhetoric, warning that it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “The ‘wolf warrior spirit’ is contrary to Chinese traditional culture,” Yuan Nansheng, a former Chinese diplomat who is now with the China Institute of International Studies, wrote in a paper published in late September. “If it entraps public opinion, the consequences will be worrisome.” Claire Fu and Chris Buckley contributed research and reporting.']","As the United States and Taiwan draw closer, state propaganda is sending the message that China will go to war if necessary."
"Hidden Beneath the Ocean’s Surface, Nearly 16 Million Tons of Microplastic",2020-10-07,By Tiffany May,"['Plastic waste has long been a visible — and growing — problem in oceans around the world, with refuse littering the shorelines of once-pristine beaches, stretching out across a wide expanse of sea in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and threatening sea life that ingest it. A new report offers a glimpse of the scale of microplastics building up on the ocean floor. In what researchers called the first such global estimate, Australia’s national science agency says that 9.25 million to 15.87 million tons of microplastics — fragments measuring between five millimeters and one micrometer — are embedded on the sea floor. That is far more than on the ocean’s surface, and it’s the equivalent of 18 to 24 shopping bags full of small plastic fragments for every foot of coastline on every continent except for Antarctica. It is an issue that activists have long warned about even as the fight to clean up the ocean has focused largely on the eradication of single-use plastic products like shopping bags. The findings were published on Monday in a new study by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or C.S.I.R.O. “It really points to the ubiquity of the problem. It is really everywhere all the time and increasing,” Britta Denise Hardesty, a principal scientist for C.S.I.R.O. and an author of the study, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Microplastics are not confined to the ocean. They are also found in air particles and can be spread by wind. A variety of microplastics was even detected in the human gut. Scientists believe that 4.4 million to 8.8 million tons of plastic enter the sea every year. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a gyre of refuse between California and Hawaii that is estimated to be more than twice the size of Texas, carries over 87,000 tons of trash. In recent years, hundreds of plastic objects have been found in the bellies of dead whales around the world. While cities have banned plastic bags and straws, the use of disposable plastic packaging has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic as consumers grow more concerned about hygiene and contamination. Over time, some plastics break down into smaller pieces and sink into the ocean. More buoyant types of plastic do not sink by themselves and either wash up on beaches or end up in deepwater. Microbes and mussel colonies growing on floating plastic often cause the entire mass to sink from the added weight. Dr. Hardesty said that microplastics could be ingested by smaller plankton and fish on the seabed. Once eaten by fish, the microplastics can end up in the human food chain.  The aim of the study, Dr. Hardesty said, was to put a scale to the problem. She described it as the first such accounting. Using a robotic submarine, the scientists collected 51 deepwater samples of sand and sediment in the Great Australian Bight in 2017, hundreds of miles from the shore, and determined the global estimate based on the average number and size of the particles. The study found zero plastic particles in some deep-ocean sediment, but up to 13.6 particles per gram in others, a figure up to 25 times larger than what had been found in earlier deep-sea studies of microplastics. The scientists said they made conservative estimates to take into account the full range of samples. They also eliminated fibers or other materials from their count to rule out the potential contamination of the samples. Dr. Hardesty said that it was important to prevent plastic from ending up in the ocean in the first place.

Golden Dawn Found Guilty of Running Criminal Organization in Greece,2020-10-07,By Niki Kitsantonis and Iliana Magra,"['ATHENS — In a landmark verdict in Greece’s highest-profile political trial in decades, an Athens court on Wednesday found the neo-fascist party Golden Dawn guilty of running a criminal organization as it rose to prominence during the country’s financial crisis, systematically targeting migrants and left-wing critics. The ruling came more than five years after the trial began in a makeshift courtroom in Greece’s largest high-security prison near Athens, and as at the beginning of the trial, none of the party officials were in the courtroom where the verdict was announced. But thousands of Greek citizens had gathered outside the court on Wednesday, waving banners reading, “They are not innocent,” “Nazis out” and “Life terms to the murderers,” as some 2,000 police officers patrolled the area and helicopters and drones circled above. The three-judge criminal court tied the party to a string of attacks including the fatal stabbing in 2013 of a left-wing rapper, Pavlos Fyssas. The party member who stabbed Mr. Fyssas, Giorgos Roupakias, was found guilty of murder on Wednesday.  Another five Golden Dawn supporters or members were found guilty of attempted murder over assaults on three Egyptian fishermen in 2012, while four were found guilty of causing bodily harm over assaults on members of Greece’s Communist Party trade union in 2013. “Today is an important day for democracy,” the country’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, said. “Today’s decision is a confirmation of the fact that democracy and its institutions are always capable of fending off any attempt to undermine them.” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the ruling brought an end to “a traumatic cycle in the country’s public life.” “After the ballot box, the Nazi entity was also condemned in court,” he said, referring to Golden Dawn’s failure to re-enter Greece’s Parliament last year. “Democracy won today.” Formed in the 1980s by a former Greek army commando, the Golden Dawn party was catapulted from obscurity to become Greece’s third largest political party at the peak of the country’s financial crisis in 2012, tapping into public discontent against austerity and a growing influx of immigrants. During its time in Greek Parliament from 2012 to 2019, the party maintained public support by casting itself as patriotic and fighting the system from within, but it retained links with neo-fascist parties in other European countries and the United States. A spate of violent attacks in 2013, culminating in the fatal stabbing of Mr. Fyssas, precipitated the party’s unraveling. A few days after the killing, police arrested the entire party leadership as a judicial investigation began into suspicions that Golden Dawn had conducted criminal activities under its military-style leadership. The trial eventually began in April 2015 with a 3,000-page case file, 69 defendants — one has since died — and 120 witnesses for the prosecution. Although Golden Dawn’s legislators avoided appearing in court whenever possible, the proceedings took their toll on the party’s appeal. Once at the forefront of Greek politics, Golden Dawn failed to win re-election to Greek Parliament last year. But despite the party’s fall, the threat of neo-Nazism in Greece has not receded. Former members of Parliament including Ilias Kasidiaris, Golden Dawn’s one-time spokesman, have formed their own parties espousing similar views. And less extreme right-wing parties have also sprung up in the party’s wake, including the nationalist Greek Solution. Golden Dawn, for its part, has systematically denied any direct link to the attacks and has described the trial and charges brought against the party’s leadership as “politically motivated” and a “conspiracy.” “All supporters await an acquittal tomorrow, a decision that will trigger an even more vociferous nationalist campaign to reclaim our country,” the party said in a statement released on the eve of the trial. The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Monday that a guilty verdict would boost efforts to crack down on hate crimes. “The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,” said Nils Muiznieks, Europe director at Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.” When the news of the guilty verdict was announced, the thousands outside the court erupted in cheers that echoed out from the avenue and the surrounding balconies overlooking the court. The Greek Police said two people were detained after scuffles broke out between protesters and police officers shortly before the verdict was issued. A group of around 600 people broke off from the crowd of about 20,000 people, and lobbed some 150 firebombs and stones at officers, a police statement said, adding that 10 police vehicles were vandalized by protesters trying to gain access to the court building. The police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd, the statement said. Speaking before the decision, Elena Karvouni, 68, who was among those gathered, said that it was important for her to be at the court, despite the pandemic. Some wore masks and gloves and some were attempting to maintain social distance in the crowd. “As a mother and as a citizen of this country that has fought with blood against fascism, it wasn’t possible that I wouldn’t be here,” she said. Elena Kritikou, 50, said that the throngs of young people crowing Alexandras Avenue in Athens and the area outside the court made her feel exhilarated. “I feel like there is hope for a better tomorrow,” she said. While waiting for the verdict, people chanted antifascist slogans — “Pavlos lives, crush the Nazis,” and “No acquittal for the Nazis” — while the Italian resistance song “Bella Ciao” played in the background. “It is my duty to be here,” said Giannis, a 19-year-old computing student who did not want to give his last name. “I didn’t know Pavlos Fyssas personally but someone else could have also been in his place, it could have been me.” “We don’t tolerate groups like Golden Dawn — it needs to be condemned,” he added.']","The court tied the far-right party to a string of attacks, including the fatal stabbing of a left-wing rapper."
"In U.K.’s Test and Trace: Now You See ’em, Now You Don’t",2020-10-05,By Mark Landler and Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “world beating” test-and-trace program has been dogged by technical glitches, overburdened laboratories and poorly trained contact tracers. Now, add to that a data-entry error more likely to trip up an amateur bookkeeper than the public health service of the world’s sixth-largest economy. Nearly 16,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus between Sept. 25 and Oct. 2 were not recorded in the nation’s daily number of reported cases, producing an artificially low picture of the spread of the virus and delaying efforts to trace those with whom the infected people had been in contact. The disclosure brought a storm of criticism on the Johnson government, which has been on the defensive for its haphazard handling of the pandemic since March, when Mr. Johnson hesitated for days before imposing a nationwide lockdown. More than 57,000 people have died from the virus in Britain, the highest number in Europe, and the country is now facing a second wave of infections. “This incident should never have happened,” the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said to Parliament on Monday, promising that the government would conduct an investigation and upgrade its outmoded computer systems. That did not mollify the opposition Labour Party, which seized on the latest glitch as evidence of the government’s serial incompetence. “This isn’t just a shambles,” said the Labour shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, jabbing his finger at Mr. Hancock. “It is so much worse than this.” For a pandemic-ravaged country, the computer error was not the only bit of unnerving news. Government officials said that fewer than half of Britons should expect to be vaccinated, even after a vaccine was widely available. Britain’s goal is to vaccinate about 30 million people, less than half the population, the head of the government’s vaccine task force, Kate Bingham, told the Financial Times. The priority would be the most vulnerable people, hospital and nursing-home workers, and those over the age of 50. Children and young people, who are considered less at risk from the disease, would not be vaccinated. The data-entry error, officials at Public Health England said, occurred because some of the Excel files containing the names of people who tested positive were too large to transfer to a central computer system. When they were transferred, the system simply lopped off a chunk of the names. Officials said they fixed the problem by splitting up the files and transferring smaller amounts of data. The glitch did not affect when people were informed of their positive test results, according to officials. Nor did the missing data prevent the government from imposing restrictions in hard-hit parts of the country. But it did delay the contact-tracing process, which depends on rapid response to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus. “The timing of it couldn’t be worse,” said Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. “You’re heading into winter, and we already knew that cases were rising. This is really when you’d need your test-and-trace system to do its work.” Instead, she said, virtually every part of the system has broken down. Apart from the data error, people were being sent to testing sites hundreds of miles from where they lived, and tests came back from the labs too slowly amid a huge backlog of untested samples. Public compliance with the program has remained sluggish: In a survey of 32,000 people living in Britain, less than one in five people who reported coronavirus symptoms said they had stayed home. Of those alerted that they had been close to an infected person, only one in 10 said they had complied with orders to self-isolate. Britain reported 12,594 new cases on Monday — a number that did not include the backdated cases, which had been added to Sunday’s numbers. Many of the new cases are in the northwest, in cities like Manchester, where there are large numbers of university students. Officials said that adding back the missing cases brought the rate of spread to within the government’s projections. “To be frank, I think that the slightly lower numbers that we’d seen didn’t really reflect where we thought that the disease was likely to go, so I think these numbers are realistic,” Mr. Johnson said to reporters on Monday. The prime minister’s subdued response belied the dangerous moment Britain faces, with cases rising and the country still unable to get an accurate gauge on where, and how quickly, the virus is spreading. Pouncing on local outbreaks depends on testing and tracking cases down to the level of single office buildings and neighborhoods. But almost since England’s contact tracing program was unveiled in May, it has been bedeviled by problems with access to testing data, making it impossible in some cases for local officials to keep track of the virus. For weeks, a network of privately run testing sites processed tens of thousands of daily tests, and the government did not share detailed results with local officials. Only testing results from public hospitals were being quickly shared. Public health officials said they were left to catch wind of outbreaks from the news. Local council officials pleaded for location-specific testing results, only for the central government to deny them on the grounds that they had not signed the proper data protection agreements. Those delays especially gnawed at local officials in northern England, where infection rates remained higher than in London when the nationwide lockdown was lifted, leaving them exposed to higher risk before an effective data-sharing system was in place. In Leicester, where the central government imposed a second lockdown in late June, officials said that the government had denied them testing data on the grounds that “it hadn’t been cleaned.” Government officials said the data processing had not yet been automated at that point, causing delays, which local officials said led to a surge in cases. Some local officials bristled on Monday at having been denied access to testing results because of data security policies while the contact tracing program was in fact, according to British news reports, storing test results in Excel spreadsheets. The fragile infrastructure behind England’s contact tracing program came into stark relief in mid-August, when a weekly government report revealed that “a temporary infrastructure issue” had created a delay in people with positive test results being entered into the contact tracing system. The magazine New Scientist later reported that an internet outage in southern England had created problems with the contact tracing program’s digital infrastructure, causing delays of up to a week in tracers being able to call the contacts of thousands of newly infected patients.']","Nearly 16,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus disappeared from the records, another embarrassing failure for a much-criticized effort."
Battle Over Mink Fur Almost Brings Down the Polish Government,2020-10-07,By Marc Santora,"['KASZEWSKA WOLA, Poland — When the European Union condemned Poland’s government for demonizing gays and lesbians, the country’s governing coalition defiantly stood together. When state media was accused of spreading hate speech that fueled violence, the governing parties brushed off concerns. And when protests erupted against efforts to control the judicial system, they pressed ahead regardless. Then came the minks. Proposed legislation that would ban the farming of minks, semiaquatic mammals prized for their fur, and put in place a range of protections for other animals, opened deep divisions in the coalition that almost brought down the government. It took the intervention of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the dominant Law and Justice Party, to quell the uprising for now by taking on a formal role that allowed him to act as a buffer between opposing factions. The bill, which gained momentum after a documentary aired on Polish television showing minks living in deplorable conditions on one farm, has widespread public support and the leaders of the country’s foremost opposition party support the legislation. But the conservative governing coalition is divided over the issue, waging increasingly furious internal battles at a time when the nation is consumed with the coronavirus. All that has raised questions about the long-term viability of the government. In the face of those concerns, Mr. Kaczynski, the most powerful politician in Poland and the architect of the government’s agenda, stepped in Tuesday to be sworn in as deputy prime minister after five years of ruling from behind the scenes. Apart from separating feuding coalition partners, one of his main tasks will be trying to grow public support for the Law and Justice Party, whose candidate for president, Andrzej Duda, only managed a narrow election victory in July. It will be a difficult challenge since Mr. Kaczynski has been the driving force behind efforts by his party to marginalize the L.G.B.T. community, a campaign that has turned off many young voters. And his government has spent years at war with the European Union, despite broad support in Poland for membership in the bloc, especially among the generation born after the end of communist rule in 1989. The government also has a dismal record on environmental issues — from logging in the country’s ancient forests to failing to curb a reliance on coal. But in championing animal rights, Mr. Kaczynski sees an opportunity. “This is a pivotal moment for the party,” said Wojciech Przybylski, the editor in chief of Visegrad Insight, a policy journal focused on Central Europe. Mr. Kaczynski, he said, knows he needs to expand his political base to include younger, more moderate voters by sending “a message of concern about nature and animals.” The issue also seems personal for Mr. Kaczynski, who has long been known for his affection for animals. When his beloved cat, Alik, died, it was national news. The 71-year-old, who shuns nearly all requests for interviews outside of supportive media outlets, even went on TikTok to post a video promoting the #StopFurChallenge. Since coming to power in 2015, Mr. Kaczynski has rarely been challenged. But observers say the division within the coalition over the law reflects a much more profound split between factions that want to take control over the country’s conservative movement. While Mr. Kaczynski’s Law and Justice Party has long been the dominant force in the United Right coalition, it depends on the support of two junior conservative partners to stay in power: the Agreement and United Poland parties. United Poland is led by the country’s powerful justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, who has made no secret of his desire to become the leader of the country’s conservative movement. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki sees himself as the heir apparent. Mr. Kaczynski’s emergence as deputy prime minister was partly aimed at keeping the two men apart. Mr. Morawiecki quickly aligned himself with Mr. Kaczynski on the animal issue, posting his own video on TikTok supporting a ban on fur. Mr. Ziobro opposes the legislation and, until Mr. Kaczynski’s intervention, his party was threatening to withdraw from the coalition over it, a move that would have erased the government’s parliamentary majority. Mr. Ziobro’s opposition to the ban on mink farming reflects the industry’s deep roots in Poland. The country is home to the largest mink farms left in Europe and the third largest in the world. The bill, which is still being debated, calls for the fur farms to be closed in a year. The law would also end the use of wild animals in circuses, restrict the tethering of dogs on chains — a common practice in the countryside — and restrict the ritual slaughter of animals for meat. The bill has been loudly condemned by politicians from the far right, which has made greater inroads into politics during the five years of rule by the Law and Justice Party. Mr. Kaczynski has often used more extreme factions to push certain messages, and build his party’s power base. The far right was critical in directing public outrage at migrants, helping the Law and Justice Party rise to power in 2015. More recently, as the party cast “L.G.B.T. ideology” as a threat to the nation, ultraconservatives have been driving the messaging. Now Mr. Kaczynski risks losing some of that support. Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, a conservative cleric who has strong connections to Law and Justice and controls a vast media empire, used his Radio Maryja station to attack the legislation. “They feel pity now over these little furs,” Father Rydzyk said recently, adding that the government should be focused on things like further limiting abortion rights. “Let’s not animalize man and humanize animals.” The bill is also opposed by the meat industry, which says its export business to markets with halal and kosher requirements would be badly hit. Jacek Zarzycki, president of the Polish Association of Beef Cattle Breeders and Producers, said that if the bill were passed, his members could lose 30 percent of their income. “We cannot afford that; we will lose the best export markets for Polish beef, which is the export star of Polish agriculture,” he told TVN24.  But it is the minks that have drawn the most attention. And it has turned Szczepan Wojcik, who along with his four brothers controls the vast majority of the mink farms in the country, into a national figure. “I’m the most attacked person in Poland,” he said in an interview at one of his farms some 60 miles outside of Warsaw. He sees the attacks as part of a broader cultural war in Poland. “The people who started the debate in Poland about animal rights, banning the use of animals by man, for example, for furs, are exactly the same people who promote L.G.B.T., same-sex marriage, abortion, euthanasia and so on,” he said. While he has supported Law and Justice in the past, he said his thinking was now more in line with the more conservative groups led by Mr. Ziobro and Father Rydzyk. Recent polls indicate overwhelming support for the ban, however. Much of that is a result of the documentary co-produced by the animal rights organization Open Cages, showing gruesome footage of minks attacking each other, gnawing off limbs of other caged animals and even feasting on their remains. “Poles don’t want fur farms,” said Bogna Witkowska, one of the group’s leaders. Mr. Wojcik said the footage in the documentary was manipulated, adding that it was in his interest to keep animals well cared for since the condition of their fur determined their value. In an average year, 6.5 million minks are slaughtered in Poland, putting it just behind China and Denmark in terms of fur production. Walking past rows of cages filled with minks scheduled to be slaughtered in a few weeks, he said he saw nothing wrong with his trade. “People should take care of animals, but in the end it’s the animals who should serve people, not the other way round,” he said.

E.U. Court Rules Against Hungary Law Targeting Soros-Funded University,2020-10-06,By Benjamin Novak,"['BUDAPEST — The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that Hungary had violated E.U. rules by changing legislation in 2017 that effectively expelled an American university founded by the billionaire financier George Soros from the country. “The conditions introduced by Hungary to enable foreign higher education institutions to carry out their activities in its territory are incompatible with E.U. law,” the court’s ruling said. The decision was the latest effort by the European Union to curb growing authoritarianism by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, but is unlikely to have much impact on the ground in Hungary. The ruling leaves no room for appeal, and requires Mr. Orban’s government to change the legislation to come in line with E.U. laws. If Hungary does not amend the law, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, could request that the high court impose fines on the Hungarian government until it does so. But the expelled institution, Central European University, is unlikely to restore its former setup in Hungary. Michael Ignatieff, the university’s rector, has said that it will be anchored in Vienna, where it has moved the bulk of its operations.  “We cannot return to Hungary, because its prevailing laws don’t meet the requirements of academic freedom,” Mr. Soros said in a statement on Tuesday. “The Hungarian government continues to trample E.U. law, with the latest victim being the world-renowned University of Theatre and Arts,” he added, referring to a Hungarian university that was the site of student protests last month over the increasing influence of Mr. Orban’s government in the school’s affairs. Andras Lederer, a program coordinator with the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization in Budapest, said the Central European University case highlighted the need for the European Commission to step in early and suspend legislation it objected to until the bloc’s high court could give a ruling on the matter. “If that would have happened in the case of C.E.U., the university would still be here,” he said. Founded and endowed by Mr. Soros after the fall of communism, Central European University was a hub of liberal thought in a region long under authoritarian rule. But after Mr. Orban’s government amended Hungary’s Act on Higher Education to force the university to meet an array of new requirements, Central European University found itself in legal limbo. The new legislation essentially stripped the university of its ability to grant U.S. diplomas in Hungary, thereby largely preventing it from being able to operate within the country. Central European University currently conducts only a few academic and archiving activities in Budapest. In its ruling on Tuesday, the European Court of Justice said the law’s requirements constituted “a means of arbitrarily discrimination” against institutions like Central European University. Mr. Orban’s government has vigorously defended the legislation, with one minister saying in 2017 that it was not in Hungary’s interest “to allow international influence attempts aimed at making life difficult for the democratically elected government or president.” Mr. Orban, whose coalition has controlled Hungary’s government since 2010, was a rising liberal politician during the country’s democratic transition in the early 1990s. He even received a scholarship from Mr. Soros in 1989 to study at the University of Oxford. But his political ideology turned to the far right over the next three decades. When he assumed power in 2010, he and his allies overhauled the country’s democratic framework, rewriting election laws to favor their party and consolidating control over the courts and much of the news media. The restructuring has extended into education and culture, and has included crackdowns on human rights groups. The state’s huge media system fuels conspiracy theories and far-right nativist messaging. Mr. Orban also set his sights on Mr. Soros, an American of Hungarian origin, and his philanthropic efforts in Hungary, which includes funding for Central European University as well as an array of nongovernmental organizations, many of them involved in the promotion of democracy. “The next year will be about squeezing out Soros and the powers that he symbolizes,” Mr. Orban said in December 2016. To Central European University faculty members and their students, the past decade has been a painful reminder of how fragile democracy is — even in the European Union, which Hungary joined in 2004. Zoltan Miklosi, an associate professor who is the chairman of the university’s political science department, now commutes between Budapest and Vienna, where he teaches classes at the new campus. He said he could not have imagined 20 years ago that democratic backsliding would be an issue in the European Union. He noted that Mr. Orban had initially focused on taking control of legal and constitutional structures in Hungary, whereas “what is happening now is going down to the more granular level,” including the cultural, academic and media spheres. The European court’s ruling reflects growing concern in the bloc over the state of democracy in countries like Hungary and Poland. The European Parliament has been pressing to link E.U. funding to adherence to the rule of law, an issue of increasing concern in Hungary as it grapples with the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the judgment is unlikely to bring significant change within Hungary, Mr. Miklosi said. “I think the E.U. was totally asleep at the wheel in the beginning,” he said. “By the time the E.U. sort of woke up to the seriousness of the problem, from Hungary’s point of view, it was clearly too late.”']","The ruling comes as the bloc pushes back against a growing authoritarianism by the government of Viktor Orban, but is unlikely to have much effect on the ground."
Contact tracing efforts are restricted to the two days before Trump’s diagnosis.,2020-10-06,By Apoorva Mandavilli and Tracey Tully,"['Despite almost daily disclosures of new coronavirus infections among President Trump’s close associates, the White House is making little effort to investigate the scope and source of its outbreak. According to a White House official familiar with the plans, the administration has decided not to trace the contacts of guests and staff members at the Sept. 26 Rose Garden celebration for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. At least 11 people who attended the event, including the president and the first lady, have since tested positive. Instead, it has limited its efforts to notifying people who came in close contact with Mr. Trump in the two days before his Covid diagnosis on Thursday evening. The White House official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the matter, said that the administration was following guidelines from the C.D.C. The contact tracing efforts have consisted mostly of emails notifying people of potential exposure, rather than the detailed phone conversations necessary to trace all contacts of people who have been exposed. These efforts, typically conducted by the C.D.C., are being run by the White House Medical Unit, a group of about 30 doctors, nurses and physician assistants, headed by Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician. “This is a total abdication of responsibility by the Trump administration,” said Dr. Joshua Barocas, a public health expert at Boston University, who has advised the city of Boston on contact tracing. “The idea that we’re not involving the C.D.C. to do contact tracing at this point seems like a massive public health threat.”']",
Berlin Trial Opens for Man Charged With Murder on Behalf of Russia,2020-10-07,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The trial opened on Wednesday for a Russian man accused of murdering a former Chechen field commander in a Berlin park last year, allegedly at the behest of the Russian state. The killing, which occurred in August 2019 in a park just over a mile away from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office, occurred amid increasingly bold provocations from Russia. German investigators blame Moscow for a 2015 cyberattack on Parliament and for a disinformation campaign on German-language Russian news media targeting Berlin’s policy on refugees the following year. This August, the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny arrived in Berlin for treatment after being poisoned with what German experts found to be a military-grade chemical substance. These events have led to a hardening of Germany’s traditionally open stance toward Moscow. In the indictment over the Berlin murder, federal prosecutors charged that the “state agencies of the central government of the Russian Federation ordered the accused to liquidate” the victim, a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who was said to be an opponent of the Russian state. Germany’s federal prosecutors have identified the accused Russian man, who followed the trial through a Russian interpreter, as Vadim N. Krasikov, 55, although his lawyer read a statement from the defendant naming him as Vadim A. Sokolov, 50. The latter name matches the information in a passport found on him when he was arrested on Aug. 23, but German investigators have said they believe the name is an alias. “I will refer to you as ‘the defendant,’” Judge Olaf Arnoldi said as the trial opened, acknowledging the confusion over the man’s identity. Moscow has denied any link between the killing and “official Russia.” But Germans officials say that the Russian authorities have refused to cooperate in the investigation, despite several formal requests. A guilty verdict for Mr. Sokolov would mean a sentence of life in prison. But it could have even larger implications for German-Russian relations, as Ms. Merkel’s government would be under increased pressure to react, given the brazenness of the killing and the opportunity to send a clear message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. A ruling is not expected until next year. The trial opened one day after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed the findings of experts in Germany that the substance used to poison Mr. Navalny had “similar structural characteristics” to the Novichok family of highly potent nerve agents. The German government said in a statement on Tuesday that the European Union and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would discuss their next steps in the coming days. Weeks after the murder, Ms. Merkel’s government expelled two Russian diplomats, and Moscow retaliated with a tit-for-tat move. Since then, no further action has been taken, but Ms. Merkel’s tone has grown harsher. In May, she stood before the German Parliament and called Russia out. “There is a strategy from Russia that we must take into account — we cannot simply ignore it: the strategy of hybrid warfare, which includes cyberwarfare and distortion of the facts,” she told lawmakers. “This is not just somehow a random product, but it is definitely a strategy that is being applied.” It is a far cry from the more pro-Russian stance shaped by her junior coalition partners in government, the Social Democrats. “Of course, we retain the right to take action against Russia,” Ms. Merkel told Parliament. The killing on Aug. 23, 2019, shocked Berlin. The victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist commander, had been living in Germany since December 2016, when he applied for asylum after arriving. Russia considered him an enemy of the state and a terrorist, accusing him of membership in the Caucasus Emirate, the most active militant group in Russia, according to the indictment. He had fought the Russians in Chechnya from 2000 to 2004, when separatists in the predominantly Muslim region were seeking independence. He was on his way to a mosque for prayers in central Berlin when a man riding a bicycle approached him from behind and shot him. The victim fell to ground, and the gunman fired two more shots to his head with a Glock 26 pistol that was equipped with a silencer. The gunman then fled the park toward the nearby Spree River, where he threw the bike and other objects into the water and quickly changed his clothes, prosecutors said. Two teenagers spotted him and called the police. The police then arrested the defendant as he attempted to rent an electric scooter. The officers found 3,720 euros in cash (nearly $4,000) and a newly issued non-biometric Russian passport without a memory chip. That document identified the arrested man as Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, the name the defendant insists is his true identity.']",German prosecutors accused the defendant of the killing of a former Chechen commander at a time when Berlin is losing patience with Moscow.
Maduro Wins Chance of New Ruling Over Billions in Gold Held in U.K.,2020-10-06,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British court gave another chance to President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in a tug of war over about $2 billion of gold stored at the Bank of England in a contentious case that pivots on whom Britain recognizes as the South American country’s leader. In the ruling, the Court of Appeal set aside a decision by the High Court in July that had denied Mr. Maduro’s administration access to the gold reserves on the basis that the British government recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s president. Mr. Maduro has promised to sell about $1 billion of the bullion to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. According to the official tally in Venezuela, at least 650 people out of a population of about 30 million have died of the coronavirus, but the true scope of the pandemic is nearly impossible to determine: Most who die with Covid-19 symptoms are never included in the official statistics, and doctors and journalists who have questioned the government figures say they have been threatened. Even before the coronavirus struck, Venezuela’s economy was in ruins and its health care system in tatters. Under those strains, Mr. Maduro has treated the pandemic as a national security threat, calling Venezuelans who have come into contact with the coronavirus “bioterrorists.” Thousands who tried to return home after losing jobs in neighboring countries have been held in makeshift containment centers out of fear that they may be infected. Lawyers representing Mr. Maduro’s administration argued that the Bank of England had “needlessly tied up” resources that were “desperately required” by refusing to release the gold reserves to the Bank of Venezuela. On Monday, three judges at Court of Appeal in London ruled that it was unclear whether the British government considered Mr. Guaidó the leader of Venezuela for all purposes or whether it recognized that Mr. Maduro did in fact still exercise some or all of the powers of president. In the ruling, one of the judges in the case, Lord Justice Males, cited a British government statement from 2019 that called Mr. Maduro’s government “illegitimate” and “kleptocratic,” and recognized Mr. Guaidó as the interim president of Venezuela. But he pointed out that Britain had in practice maintained diplomatic relationships with the Maduro administration, mostly through its ambassador in London, and had kept its embassy open in Venezuela. At the same time, the judge wrote, the British government has declined to establish diplomatic relations with Mr. Guaidó, or to grant diplomatic status to his representatives in Britain. The judge said that the British government would have to clarify the position before a court could decide who could gain access to the funds. If it declined to do so, he ruled, the Commercial Court in Britain, which handles complex national and international business disputes, would decide. Mr. Maduro claimed to have won re-election in 2018, and was sworn in for a second term in January 2019, but the election was widely seen as rigged and Mr. Guaidó, president of the National Assembly, declared himself the country’s interim leader. Mr. Guaidó was recognized by most countries in Europe and in the Americas, including Britain and the United States, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, at least temporarily. Since Mr. Maduro was first elected in 2013, Venezuela’s health care system has all but collapsed and the economy has been described as the worst outside of wars in decades. Mr. Maduro has been trying to withdraw the gold from the Bank of England since 2018, relying on the fact that medical supplies and humanitarian efforts are not subject to the British sanctions on his government. His administration filed a complaint when the Bank of England refused to release the bullion. The gold reserves are one of the last major financial leftovers from Venezuela’s days as an oil superpower, and they have been at the center of the dispute between Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaidó. Mr. Guaidó’s team has argued that Mr. Maduro would squander the money and has urged the British government to withhold the gold.  But lawyers representing Mr. Maduro’s administration welcomed the ruling on Monday and said that they were confident their client would soon gain control of the reserves. Mr. Maduro has called for parliamentary elections in Venezuela in December, hoping to unseat Mr. Guaidó from the head of the National Assembly. Mr. Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to boycott the elections, but in recent weeks, two other opposition leaders have broken ranks and said that they would take on Mr. Maduro at the ballot box. The United States has unequivocally sided with Mr. Guaidó. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted on Twitter that the parliamentary elections would be “unfair and unfree.”']","President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has been trying since 2018 to gain access to bullion deposited at the Bank of England, running into a dispute over whether Britain considers him the country’s leader."

Kamala Harris calls Trump’s virus response the ‘greatest failure of any presidential administration.’,2020-10-08,By Reid J. Epstein and Maggie Astor,"['At the vice-presidential debate on Wednesday night, Senator Kamala Harris of California wasted no time in prosecuting the case against the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. “The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” she said in her opening remarks on Wednesday. Ms. Harris, in her debate debut as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate, accused President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence of hiding the truth of the pandemic from the American people. “They knew what was happening and they didn’t tell you,” she said. “They knew and they covered it up.” Ms. Harris said a Biden administration would put in place a “national strategy” for contact tracing and coronavirus testing, which she said would be free for all Americans. Mr. Trump, she said, does not deserve any more chances to solve the problem. “This administration has forfeited their right to re-election,” she said. Mr. Pence, for his part, sought to highlight China’s role in the coronavirus pandemic, saying, “First and foremost, China is to blame for the coronavirus, and President Trump is not happy about it.” As he has before, Mr. Pence praised Mr. Trump’s decision early in the pandemic to suspend travel from China, though he incorrectly characterized it as a ban on “all” travel from China. The virus ended up reaching the United States primarily through Europe. The coronavirus hung over Wednesday’s debate as it has hung over all of American life for months. There was no handshake. The candidates were seated 12 feet apart. Two plexiglass dividers stood between them, providing an illusion of protection that scientists said would not actually do anything against an airborne virus. After Mr. Trump was hospitalized for the coronavirus, Ms. Harris’s team had been pushing for stronger safety measures, including the plexiglass, in case Mr. Pence was infected. (He has tested negative, but tests are not always accurate until several days after exposure.) Aides to Mr. Pence had criticized the plans, but after negotiations, his staff accepted the placement of the dividers.']",
Hong Kong officials warn of a new wave of infections.,2020-10-08,By Austin Ramzy,"['A Hong Kong health official said Thursday that the city was considering options for mandatory testing as it prepared for a new wave of coronavirus infections. “From a public health perspective, if we think that if testing is needed and people are not willing to take a test, that hinders our work,” said Sophia Chan, the health secretary. She said the authorities were considering legal options for mandating testing if necessary, while acknowledging that members of the public might have concerns about any such arrangement. Last month Hong Kong eased some restrictions, allowing gyms and spas to reopen and expanding the limit on group gatherings to four people. But health authorities say they are preparing for another possible spike in infections. “We don’t think the situation is looking good because of the increased number of confirmed cases,” said Ms. Chan. She noted that research by the University of Hong Kong showed the rate of the coronavirus spread was increasing once again. On Thursday, Hong Kong reported 18 new coronavirus cases, 14 of which were locally transmitted. Hong Kong has reported 5,143 cases since the start of the pandemic, which works out to 69 cases per 100,000 people, according to a Times database. Of those cases, 56 were reported in the last seven days, a rate of less than 1 case per 100,000 people. For comparison, the per capita rate in the United States is 2,285 per 100,000. ']",
Militants in Mali Free 4 Hostages After Government Releases Prisoners,2020-10-09,By Ruth Maclean and Elian Peltier,"['DAKAR — Four hostages held by armed insurgents in Mali were freed on Thursday, days after the country’s newly-formed government released around 200 prisoners, including some suspected of being jihadists. The four hostages released included Soumaïla Cissé, a prominent Malian politician, Sophie Pétronin, a French aid worker who had been held for almost four years, and two Italians: Pierluigi Maccalli, a priest abducted in neighboring Niger in 2018, and Nicola Chiacchio, who was kidnapped last year during a solo bicycle trip. The government, which took power in September following a military coup, announced the releases Thursday evening. It said they had been secured thanks to the efforts of the country’s intelligence services, the armed forces, Mali’s partners and a special crisis unit led by a former prime minister, but it did not provide details of the conditions under which the hostages were released. The government’s release of prisoners last weekend had led to speculation in Mali that a deal to free the hostages had been struck. The freeing of the hostages was greeted with joy in Mali. Mr. Cissé, a 70-year-old former opposition leader who ran for president three times, had been kidnapped by armed men in March as he was campaigning for legislative elections. The releases were also welcomed in France, where Ms. Pétronin’s case has been closely followed. President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a statement that he was “immensely relieved” to learn that Ms. Pétronin, 75, had been freed after the Malian authorities announced that the hostages were en route to the country’s capital, Bamako. “The president of the Republic especially thanks the Malian authorities for this release,” a statement issued by the French presidency said. “He assures them of France’s entire will to support Mali in the fight it is waging with perseverance against terrorism.” The French authorities said they were unaware of whether a ransom had been paid for the hostages, and gave few other details about the operation. “It is the Malian authorities who have entirely handled this situation and this liberation,” Gabriel Attal, the French government’s spokesman, told the broadcaster France 2. “I have no information regarding compensation that would have been provided for this release.” Over 5,000 French soldiers are deployed in the Sahel region to fight Islamist insurgent groups. Last year, two French soldiers were killed in a raid in Burkina Faso that freed four hostages, two of them French. In Italy, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio welcomed the “good news” of the release. “Father Pier Luigi Maccalli and Nicola Chiacchio are finally free and well,” Mr. Di Maio said in a tweet. The Malian authorities said the four hostages had been held by Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, or the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, a coalition of Al-Qaeda-aligned groups in Mali. Mr. Cissé received a hero’s welcome at home in Badalabougou, a Bamako neighborhood, where he stood out of the sunroof of a car, waving at a crowd of supporters blowing vuvuzelas and waving cellphones. “I spent six months under conditions that, as you know very well, were extremely difficult, in almost total isolation,” Mr. Cissé told Malian television. “But I must admit that I never experienced any violence, physical or verbal.” Mr. Cissé’s release had been a key demand of protests against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta that escalated over the summer, before he was overthrown in the military coup. Ms. Pétronin, who ran a charity for malnourished children in Mali, narrowly escaped a first kidnapping in the eastern city of Gao in 2012 and fled the country, but returned soon after. She was then kidnapped in Gao on Dec. 24, 2016, and had been held ever since. Ms. Pétronin returned to France on Friday and was welcomed by Mr. Macron. “Deep down, I was certain that I would come back,” Ms. Pétronin told the French radio station RFI after she landed in Bamako on Thursday and was greeted with a hug by her son, Sébastien Chadaud-Pétronin. “I never gave up,” she said. Ms. Pétronin said that after spending some time in France, she would go back to Mali at some point. “I’m going to come back to see what’s going on here,” she said, looking frail but in good spirits. Standing next to her, her son sounded more cautious. “We have to be reasonable,” Mr. Chadaud-Pétronin said. “You won’t go wherever you want to.” Ruth Maclean reported from Dakar and Elian Peltier from London. Constant Méheut contributed reporting from Paris and Cheick Amadou Diouara from Bamako, Mali.']","The freed hostages included Sophie Pétronin, 75, a French aid worker held for nearly four years, and Soumaïla Cissé, 70, a former opposition leader."
Montenegro’s most prominent cleric has tested positive.,2020-10-07,By Isabella Kwai,"['The most prominent religious leader in Montenegro, who once described a pilgrimage as “God’s vaccine,” has tested positive for the coronavirus and is in stable condition, his representatives said on Wednesday. Amfilohije Radovic, the Serbian Orthodox metropolitan bishop of Montenegro and the Littoral, was given the diagnosis Tuesday after a routine health check, and was taken to Podgorica, the capital. The metropolitan, who is 82, was feeling well and was under the “constant care of doctors,” a statement on his website said. The Serbian Orthodox Church, by far the largest Christian denomination in Montenegro, has more than 8 million adherents worldwide, most of them in Bosnia, Montenegro or Serbia. About three-quarters of Montenegrins are Serbian Orthodox. During a sermon in May, as pilgrims honored a 17th-century bishop in Podgorica, Metropolitan Radovic told believers that while a coronavirus vaccine would be welcome, “there’s a vaccine here which has acted through the centuries,” Reuters reported. The metropolitan was seen forgoing a face mask at public events. A controversial figure who wields significant influence, Metropolitan Radovic has clashed with civil authorities in the country over allegations that some religious services have violated coronavirus restrictions. Earlier this year, he organized protests against a much-debated law that gave the state ownership of some religious buildings and estates. Antigovernment feeling roused by the protests played a part in unseating the Democratic Party of Socialists, led by President Milo Djukanovic, in elections in August. The virus is spreading as quickly now in Montenegro as it has at any time during the pandemic. With a population of about 625,000 people, the country has reported 12,584 coronavirus cases —\xa02,009 of them in the last week —\xa0and 188 deaths, according to a New York Times database.']",
Indian Police Accuse Popular TV Station of Ratings Fraud,2020-10-09,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Hari Kumar and Shalini Venugopal Bhagat","['NEW DELHI — Ever since it hit the airwaves three years ago, Republic TV has been one of India’s most-watched, most-talked-about and most-contentious television news channels. Its lead anchor, Arnab Goswami, has made a name for himself shouting down opponents, embracing right-wing causes and aggressively backing up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-leaning administration. In turn, Republic TV’s ratings have soared. But this week, police officials in Mumbai accused Republic TV and two smaller channels of rigging the ratings system by paying poor people the equivalent of a few dollars a month to tune into the station and leave their televisions on. In some cases, police officials said, people being bribed to watch the English-language channel did not speak English and were annoyed to tie up their television sets with programming that they couldn’t even understand. Those viewership levels are not just a source of pride: They are also a major factor in a station’s ad revenue, therefore fueling its continuing ability to shape the public discourse. Republic TV’s dominance has emerged at a time when many Indian journalists say that their freedoms have been eroded under Mr. Modi’s government and that he has tried to manipulate the country’s news media, especially the airwaves, like no other prime minister in decades. Mr. Goswami, a co-founder of the channel, has strongly denied the accusations of bribery, saying that he was being targeted because of recent coverage that was critical of the Mumbai police. He seems to thrive on confrontation and has used this moment to rally his millions of viewers. “Come to my house, come to my office, if you have the guts,” he taunted the police on Thursday night. “Come and arrest me!” He called Mumbai’s police chief, Param Bir Singh, “a spineless man” and “a pliable tool.” The news that Republic TV had fallen under investigation struck like an earthquake among the country’s media elite. Mr. Goswami is one of India’s best-known darlings on the political right, and throughout Friday, other news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of the investigation. A free press has played a crucial role in protecting India’s democracy since the country’s independence from Britain in 1947. But under Mr. Modi, liberal media outlets have been repeatedly targeted by senior government officials, who have berated editors, cut off advertising and ordered tax investigations. At the same time, right-leaning media organizations like Republic TV, which some refer to as the Fox News of India, are often given preferential treatment. In Mumbai, the tables are somewhat turned. The state government is controlled not by Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party but by an alliance of parties, including the Indian National Congress, that are rivals to Mr. Modi. So even though Mr. Goswami is a friend to the central government, in Mumbai he plays the role of the opposition, hammering state officials and wearing down interviewees in a barrage of loud invective. He recently unleashed a tirade against the Mumbai police, accusing them of bungling an investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, a popular actor who died in June, apparently by suicide. Media commentators said that it was difficult to determine exactly what was behind the bribery accusations, and that the ratings system had been flawed for years. Sevanti Ninan, a media columnist in New Delhi, said that if Republic TV did tamper with its ratings, it would indicate that their sensational coverage is less of a draw. “It would show that their so-called success is not a reflection of the success of their journalism,” she said. There is also suspicion, especially in the Modi camp, that the police are going after Mr. Goswami because of his political views. “Targeting of the media by #Congress and its allies is against all principles of democracy and is unacceptable,” Mr. Modi’s broadcast minister, Prakash Javadekar, wrote on Twitter. Ms. Ninan said, “Seeing that the investigation has barely begun, the alacrity with which the Mumbai police called a press conference certainly raises questions, especially given the way Republic TV has been attacking the Mumbai police on their channel for the past few months.” To determine television viewership in India, certain households are selected to have a meter attached to their television to monitor which channels they watch. These findings are then aggregated to gauge various channels’ popularity, which can make or break them: The more viewers a channel can draw, the more money it can demand for commercials. The most recent ratings showed Republic TV as the No. 1 English-language news channel. Its Hindi version attracted an even bigger audience — approximately 40 times as many viewers. Police officials said that a former employee of a research company hired by the Broadcast Audience Research Council, India’s ratings agency, admitted to having paid households to keep their sets tuned to Republic TV for a specific period each day. “We have interrogated such customers who were approached and manipulated,” Mr. Singh, Mumbai’s police chief, said in a news conference on Thursday. “They admitted that they were paid money to operate that particular channel.” Police officials said they were investigating “suspicious trends” from two other smaller channels, Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema. One of the police documents also mentioned another channel, India Today, though the police later said they had no solid evidence against it. The charges under investigation include breach of trust, cheating and conspiracy. Police officials said they had arrested four people and were preparing to interrogate executives of Republic TV. Mr. Goswami’s position: Bring it on. “If you have the guts, Param Bir Singh,” he said in his taunt directed at the police chief on Thursday, “face me in an interview.”']",Republic TV has torn down critics and bolstered the Indian government. Now it is under a criminal investigation.
Jobless claims in the U.S. remain well above pre-pandemic levels.,2020-10-08,By Ben Casselman,"['Applications for jobless benefits in the United States remained high last week, even as the collapse of stimulus talks in Washington raised fears of a new wave of layoffs. More than 804,000 Americans filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That is up from 799,000 the week before, before accounting for seasonal patterns. Another 464,000 people applied for benefits under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which covers freelancers, self-employed workers and others left out of the regular unemployment system. For the second week in a row, the reported number will carry an asterisk: California last month announced that it would temporarily stop accepting new unemployment applications while it addresses a huge processing backlog and puts in place procedures to weed out fraud. In the absence of up-to-date data, the Labor Department is assuming California’s claim number was unchanged from its pre-shutdown figure of more than 225,000 applications, or more than a quarter of the national total. The state began accepting new filings this week, and is expected to resume reporting data in time for next week’s report, though it isn’t yet clear how the backlog of claims filed this week will be reflected. While the lack of data from California makes week-to-week comparisons difficult, the larger trend is clear: After falling swiftly from a peak of more than 6 million last spring, weekly jobless claims have stalled at a level far higher than the worst weeks of past recessions. “The level of claims is still staggeringly high,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor. “We’re seeing evidence that the recovery is slowing down, whether it’s in slowing payroll gains or in the sluggish improvement in jobless claims.”']",
"Hong Kong Heist Snares $645 Million in Valuables, Including Mao Scrolls",2020-10-08,By Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — The thieves hauled away $645 million in artifacts from a Hong Kong apartment while the owner was in mainland China. Then they left by taxi. Among the stolen items were 24,000 vintage stamps, 10 bronze coins and seven calligraphy scrolls that the owner, Fu Chunxiao, said had been written by Mao Zedong. The majority of the stolen items remain missing, but the scroll, measuring three yards, found its way to a buyer before it was recovered by the police. It was not in its original state. “He found the calligraphy piece too long and difficult to display for viewers, so he cut it in two,” Ho Chun-tung, a police superintendent, told reporters this week, referring to the man who allegedly bought the stolen scroll. “Whether he knows the authenticity and value of the calligraphy is something we have to continue investigating.” The police said the break in the case came when a cabdriver who picked up the men on the day of the burglary in September came forward with information. On Thursday, the police charged a 44-year-old suspect identified only as Wu with burglary. He was arrested in Hong Kong, along with another man identified as Tan, 47, who was accused of harboring “an offender.” The alleged buyer, a 49-year-old man identified only as Lin, was arrested last month, just after the heist. He was accused of handling stolen goods. Local news outlets said he had paid a mere $65 for the recovered scroll. The collector, Mr. Fu, told The South China Morning Post newspaper that he was devastated by the burglary — and by the damage to the scroll. He said it was the most valuable item among his stolen possessions. Mr. Fu put his total losses at $645 million, according to the police. “It was heartbreaking to see it torn into two pieces,” he is quoted as saying about the scroll. “It will definitely affect its value, but the impact remains to be seen.” A police spokeswoman said by phone that the authorities had not independently determined the value of the scroll. Auction houses dealing in Chinese art did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Mr. Fu, who is originally from Sichuan Province, according to local news reports, could not immediately contacted. He is known as a collector of items from the Mao era. In 2018, Mr. Fu organized a Hong Kong exhibition of 200 stamps bearing the face of Mao. (The founding father of the People’s Republic of China, Mao ruled as the chairman of the Communist Party from 1949 until his death in 1976.) The authorities are still looking for two other suspects. The three men arrested so far are originally from mainland China, the police said. Burglaries have recently increased in Hong Kong, rising from 786 cases in 2019 to 1,156 cases in the first half of 2020, according to police statistics. Robberies have also increased fourfold, from 44 cases in 2020 to 186 in the first six months of 2020. The official residence of the Australian consul general was broken into last Friday. In June, two men scaled 19 stories of bamboo scaffolding to steal a safe deposit box in a wealthy neighborhood of Hong Kong in June. In September, a group robbed a man who was carrying millions of dollars in cash in his backpack. Burglars have more often targeted unoccupied homes on the Chinese territory, Mr. Ho, the senior police superintendent, said. But they are not limited to items of high commercial value. At the start of the coronavirus outbreak in February, as consumers bought toilet paper in bulk for fear it would run out, three masked robbers stole more than $100 worth of toilet paper outside a supermarket while holding up a deliveryman by knife point.']",The burglars also stole coins and vintage stamps from a Hong Kong apartment.

Protests Spread Across Indonesia Over Jobs Law,2020-10-08,By Dera Menra Sijabat and Richard C. Paddock,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — Riot police officers fired tear gas and water cannons in Indonesia’s capital on Thursday as they tried to disperse large crowds of people protesting a sweeping new law that slashes protections for workers and the environment. In cities and towns throughout Indonesia’s vast archipelago, tens of thousands of workers took part in the third day of a national strike against the deregulation law. Workers marched on foot and rode in motorbike parades as sound trucks blared protest messages. Union leaders denounced Parliament and President Joko Widodo for pushing the measure through. In the center of Jakarta, the capital, protesters assembled in defiance of a city ban on gathering during the pandemic and tried to march to the presidential palace. Some threw rocks at the police and set fires in the city center, burning a police post and two transit stops. The police said officers had detained more than 800 people in Jakarta, while leaders of the national strike distanced themselves from the violence and said that the city’s protests were not affiliated with the labor action. Around the country, the strike has been largely peaceful, although protesters clashed with the police in some cities. Organizers said protests were held in more than 60 locations, stretching from Aceh Province in the west to Papua Province more than 3,000 miles east. They estimated that about one million people joined the walkouts each day, though that figure could not be verified. Opponents of the new statute, a 905-page omnibus measure that amends more than 75 laws, say that it benefits the wealthy elite by allowing companies to cut workers’ pay, eliminate days off and hire contract workers in place of permanent employees.  “The president is paying back the financiers who helped him win the election, not ordinary people who voted for him,” said Ermawati, 37, a leader of a factory strike in East Java who like many Indonesians uses one name. “They are killing us with the omnibus law.” Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, has the largest economy in Southeast Asia but has found itself at a disadvantage when competing with some of its neighbors for foreign investment, particularly Vietnam, a centralized Communist state that can move swiftly to offer investors land and incentives. Indonesia, which has been a democratic country since the fall of the Suharto dictatorship more than two decades ago, every five years holds the world’s largest direct presidential elections. But its decentralized government is notoriously bureaucratic and difficult to navigate. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the country harder than any other in the region, infecting more than 320,000 people and throwing an estimated six million out of work, adding to the seven million already unemployed. The government expects the economy to contract this year for the first time since the Suharto era. Bahlil Lahadalia, the head of the government’s Investment Coordinating Board, said the new law would make it easier for jobseekers to find work, including another three million people who enter the work force annually. He said that 153 companies were ready to invest in Indonesia once the law takes effect, creating many new jobs. “This is a law for the future, not the past,” he said. “There are complaints from businesspeople that it is difficult to get permits due to overlapping regulations, expensive land and expensive workers,” he said. “This job creation law is the answer to that.” President Joko, a onetime furniture manufacturer and mayor, casts himself as a man of the people who has their interests at heart. As president, he has focused on economic development, particularly building roads, ports and airports. But many opponents of deregulation feel betrayed by Mr. Joko, who won a second term last year, and are urging him to issue a regulation canceling the most damaging provisions of the law. Workers say their viewpoint was not considered during deliberations. The deregulation law is also opposed by environmentalists who say it will exempt many projects from environmental review, derailing efforts to halt the burning of rain forests and adding to carbon emissions that fuel climate change. Disappointment was evident after Parliament approved the law, and the phrase #pindahnegara — shorthand for “move to another country” in the Indonesian language — trended on Twitter. Major news outlets posted tips on how to emigrate. Last year, opponents staged mass protests against another omnibus bill that would have criminalized sex between unmarried people — effectively outlawing gay relations — and succeeded in getting Mr. Joko to withdraw that measure. But persuading the president to withdraw this year’s bill is unlikely, since it was Mr. Joko and his government who pushed for the law’s approval, ending with its easy passage on Monday. Opponents are urging Mr. Joko either to not sign the law or to use his power to prevent the contentious provisions from taking effect. If Mr. Joko does not yield, the union will go to court and try to block the law’s implementation, said Said Iqbal, the president of the Indonesian Trade Union Confederation and a leader of the strike. On Batam, an island near Singapore, Djafri Rajab, a machinist, helped lead a three-day walkout of 60 workers, nearly a third of the employees at PT Djitoe Mesindo, which makes machines for manufacturing cigarettes. He worries about the potential loss of his job as the economy sinks and a provision in the law that would allow companies to reduce severance pay from 32 months’ to 19 months’ pay. “There’s no worker who’s not afraid of layoffs, especially in this time of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mr. Djafri, who has three children, including a 5-month-old baby. “Indonesia is in recession. Getting a new job is very difficult.” He is also concerned about younger workers who may not be able to find jobs that provide pensions and other benefits as they enter the work force. “We also hope as many as possible investors come to Indonesia, but don’t castrate the workers’ rights,” he said. “Government exists to guarantee the rights of every citizen to have a decent life.”']",The government hopes the measure will draw investment. Opponents say the move to slash regulations will harm workers and the environment.
"The next presidential debate will be virtual, but Trump says he won’t participate.",2020-10-08,"By Michael M. Grynbaum, Maggie Haberman and Eileen Sullivan","['President Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in a virtual debate, speaking on Fox Business Network minutes after the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the next debate would be virtual because of virus concerns. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were scheduled to debate on the same stage in Miami on Oct. 15, but the commission is now preparing for the candidates and moderators to appear remotely. Mr. Trump, who tested positive for the virus last week, has said he planned to go to the debate, even as health experts say he may not be fully recovered from Covid-19. Mr. Biden has said he would not debate Mr. Trump in Miami if the president was still infected. “The second presidential debate will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations,” the commission said in a statement, citing “the health and safety of all involved.” But Mr. Trump immediately dismissed the concept in a television interview on Thursday morning, saying: “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate, that’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous.” “That’s not acceptable to us,” Mr. Trump told the anchor Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business of the virtual debate format. “I’m not going to do a virtual debate.” Mr. Trump said he only learned of the debate commission’s decision on Thursday morning, minutes before he got on the phone for an interview. He accused the commission of “trying to protect Biden.” “For the swamp creatures at the Presidential Debate Commission to now rush to Joe Biden’s defense by unilaterally canceling an in-person debate is pathetic,” Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement on Thursday. “Here are the facts: President Trump will have posted multiple negative tests prior to the debate, so there is no need for this unilateral declaration.” Mr. Stepien’s claim about Mr. Trump testing positive over the next week is unsubstantiated, because the virus is notoriously unpredictable. Mr. Biden’s campaign issued a more receptive statement on Thursday. “Vice President Biden looks forward to speaking directly to the American people,” said Kate Bedingfield, a Biden deputy campaign manager. The moderator, Steve Scully of C-SPAN, will still conduct the proceedings from Miami at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, the commission said. ']",
Hawaii will stop requiring quarantine for travelers who have recent negative tests.,2020-10-08,By Ruth Graham,"['The state of Hawaii is preparing to loosen some of the strict pandemic restrictions that have hammered its tourism industry, including the requirement that arriving travelers spend 14 days in quarantine. Starting on Oct. 15, travelers will be allowed to skip the quarantine if they can show a negative virus test result from an approved source, taken no more than 72 hours before departure. The pre-travel testing program had been set to begin over the summer, but was postponed when the virus surged on the islands. Travelers who do not want to be tested can still opt to quarantine instead, raising concerns that untested travelers could infect tested passengers on flights to the islands. A negative test is not a guarantee of lack of infection: It can take several days after exposure for the amount of virus in an infected person’s body to rise high enough to produce a positive result. The state said it would randomly test 10 percent of incoming passengers four days after arrival to assess the plan’s effectiveness. Hawaii has reported more than 13,000 cases of the virus, and more than 160 deaths, according to a New York Times database. The state will continue to require wearing a mask in public, and some inter-island travel will remain restricted. The new measures are meant to help revive the state’s tourism industry, which makes up about a quarter of its economy. The Hawaii Tourism Authority reported in August that travel to the islands the previous month was down almost 98 percent compared with the same month in 2019. “It’s important that people know we welcome them as long as they’ve gotten their test,” Lt. Gov. Josh Green told The Associated Press. Mr. Green, an emergency room doctor, is heading the new testing program. He recently recovered from Covid-19.']",
2 Men Found Guilty of Aiding 2013 Kenya Mall Attack,2020-10-07,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — A court in Kenya on Wednesday found two men guilty for their role in an assault on an upscale mall in the capital, Nairobi, that killed 67 people in 2013, the first convictions in one of the deadliest terror attacks in the country’s history. The men — Mohamed Ahmed Abdi and Hussein Hassan Mustafah — were found guilty of charges including conspiracy to commit terrorism and aiding the Qaeda-linked Shabab terrorist group. A third man, Liban Abdullah Omar, was acquitted of all charges. A fourth, Adan Dheq, was released last year because of a lack of evidence. The ruling comes seven years after the attack on the Westgate mall, in which Shabab gunmen killed 67 people from 13 countries, wounding 175 others. Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi of the Milimani law courts in Nairobi delivered the judgment, which had been delayed multiple times. A court translator gave the verdict, which took four hours to read, in Somali to the accused, who are all ethnic Somalis. “Their defenses and denials that they had any links that were associated with the act that were committed by the attackers is without substance and I dismiss it,” the chief magistrate said. “They were acting in concert with the attackers.” The Westgate mall was a symbol of Kenya’s growing middle class, a place where affluent couples and families shopped, dined and caught the latest Hollywood and Bollywood movies. But it became a scene of terror on a Saturday afternoon in 2013 when it was stormed by militants who fired indiscriminately at the crowds inside and detonated grenades, sending terrified people fleeing for the exits. The mall’s shiny floors were smeared with blood and scattered with lifeless bodies. Witnesses later said that the assailants had picked out non-Muslims for killing. During a four-day siege to clear out the militants, the Kenyan authorities were criticized for an inefficient and disjointed response, with the police and military forces deployed in the mall even firing at each other. Soldiers were caught on camera stealing goods from shops in the ruined mall. Security officers also fired a rocket, leading to the collapse of entire floors in the five-story building, including the rooftop parking lot. Kenyan and Western officials have said that four gunmen from Somalia were involved in the attack, and that all were killed during the siege. But an independent report by the New York Police Department suggested that some of the gunmen might have escaped during the siege. The two convicted on Wednesday were found by the court to have provided support to the gunmen who carried out the attack. Those activities included communicating with the assailants, knowingly supporting the commission of a terrorist act and possessing materials connected to a terrorism offense. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 22 and face decades in prison. The Shabab said that the attack was a reprisal for Kenya’s deployment of troops in Somalia in 2011 as part of the United Nations-backed African Union peacekeeping mission. The assault established the Shabab as a lethal enemy capable of carrying out attacks across Kenya on both civilian and military targets. In 2015, the group killed 148 people, a majority of them students, at a university in northeastern Kenya. That was the country’s deadliest terror attack since Qaeda-linked militants bombed the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people. In 2019, 21 people were killed after the Shabab targeted a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi. In January, Shabab fighters killed three Americans and destroyed a surveillance plane when they stormed a Kenyan military post where U.S. troops were based. On Tuesday, local news media reported that at least eight people had been wounded after attackers suspected of belonging to the Shabab targeted a bus in a town in northeastern Kenya near the border with Somalia. The Shabab have also continued to wreak havoc in Somalia, bombing foreign military bases, killing civilians and striking hotels and restaurants. In December, the group was accused of detonating an explosives-laden truck in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, that killed 82 people, including university students. Last month, another truck bombing linked to the group in southern Somalia killed three Somali military officers and wounded three others, including an American service member. For many Kenyans, the siege on Westgate and the subsequent attacks on Kenyan soil highlight how the Shabab remains a potent threat, willing to advance its ambitions at whatever cost, said Murithi Mutiga, project director for the Horn of Africa at the nonprofit International Crisis Group. But while “today’s verdict will offer a measure of solace to the victims,” Mr. Mutiga said, many people in Kenya were still hoping for “a more permanent end to the threat of militancy.”']",The verdicts came seven years after 67 people were killed by Shabab militants at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi.
World Food Program Awarded Nobel Peace Prize for Work During Pandemic,2020-10-09,By Megan Specia and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['The World Food Program was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its efforts to combat a surge in global hunger amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has swept around the world with devastating impact.  The Nobel committee said that work by the organization, a United Nations agency, to address hunger had laid the foundations for peace in nations ravaged by war. “In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Program has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said as she announced the prize in Oslo. “The combination of violent conflict and the pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the number of people living on the brink of starvation,” she added. In many nations, particularly those at war, the combination of conflict and the pandemic has sharply increased the number of people on the brink of starvation. As the global fallout from the pandemic began this spring, the World Food Program estimated that the number of people experiencing life-threatening levels of food insecurity could more than double this year, to 265 million. The World Food Program — the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security internationally — last year provided assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries.  The Nobel committee’s recognition of a United Nations agency comes as the United States under President Trump has very publicly pulled back support for the global organization.  Since he took office in 2017, the United States has withdrawn from several United Nations bodies and slashed funding for others, although World Food Program contributions have increased. Mr. Trump has contended that the United States is shouldering an outsized financial responsibility for the global body as compared with other countries. In the spring, Mr. Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency that has been coordinating the global response to the pandemic.  The World Food Program, established in 1961 after a proposal by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, has been a major behind-the-scenes player helping people affected by some of the world’s most devastating humanitarian disasters, including famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s, wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Several United Nations and World Food Program leaders mentioned in their responses to the Nobel Peace Prize that the program depended on voluntary funding to be able to carry out its work.  The organization has long faced problems funding some of its largest operations, such as in South Sudan, where seasonal rains and conflict have disrupted food availability for as long as the program has existed. Most recently, it began a campaign to fund its Yemen operations, where a yearslong conflict has led to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “The world is in danger of experiencing a hunger crisis of inconceivable proportions if the World Food Program and other food assistance organizations do not receive the financial support they have requested,” the Nobel committee said.  The Nobel Peace Prize comes with a cash award of 10 million Swedish kroners, about $1.1 million. Yet the agency has met with criticism that its food sourcing methods hamper already weak local food markets. The organization buys most supplies on the global market, and development experts have criticized it for offering contracts to major donors — like the United States — in what has come to be known as “tied aid,” or the practice of tying humanitarian donations to purchasing contracts. In response, it has pledged to eventually 10 percent of its supplies from smaller local farms. Its employees have at times also been accused by investigators, journalists and local groups of malpractice, such as stealing and selling food that is meant to be distributed for free. In a major operation in Uganda last year where the organization tried to feed thousands of refugees, four died and hundreds became sick, leading to internal investigations.  The program’s workers also risk their lives to carry out the program’s mission, however, and several lost their lives — sacrifices that António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, noted after the award was announced.  “The women and men of the W.F.P. brave danger and distance to deliver lifesaving sustenance to those devastated by conflict, to people suffering because of disaster, to children and families uncertain about their next meal,” he said in a statement on Friday.  Mr. Guterres also said there was “a hunger in our world for international cooperation,” noting that the program relies on contributions from U.N. member states and the public. One of the program’s key messages is that, in most cases hunger is the result of human actions rather than nature’s whims. Yemen is a case in point: Food exists, but hyperinflation and conflict make it practically unavailable to those who need it most, including children. In a telephone interview, David Beasley, the program’s executive director, said the prize had turned an important spotlight on the millions who go hungry around the world and on the devastating consequences of conflict. “It’s the first time in my life I’m speechless,” he said, adding that it was both wonderful and bad news to receive, because it highlighted not only the work being done, but also the depth of the need for it.  Mr. Beasley said it was an “indictment of humanity” that anyone could want for food “in a time when there is so much wealth in the world.”  “It’s a call to action,” he said of the prize. “The world is suffering more than in any time period, and we literally will be facing famines of biblical proportions if we don’t act.”  Elisabetta Povoledo and Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting.']",The Nobel committee said the U.N. agency’s work to address hunger had laid the foundations for peace in nations ravaged by war.
"Venezuela, Once an Oil Giant, Reaches the End of an Era",2020-10-07,"By Sheyla Urdaneta, Anatoly Kurmanaev, Isayen Herrera and Adriana Loureiro Fernandez","['CABIMAS, Venezuela — For the first time in a century, there are no rigs searching for oil in Venezuela. Wells that once tapped the world’s largest crude reserves are abandoned or left to flare toxic gases that cast an orange glow over depressed oil towns. Refineries that once processed oil for export are rusting hulks, leaking crude that blackens shorelines and coats the water in an oily sheen. Fuel shortages have brought the country to a standstill. At gas stations, lines go on for miles. Venezuela’s colossal oil sector, which shaped the country and the international energy market for a century, has come to a near halt, with production reduced to a trickle by years of gross mismanagement and American sanctions. The collapse is leaving behind a destroyed economy and a devastated environment, and, many analysts say, bringing to an end the era of Venezuela as an energy powerhouse. “Venezuela’s days as a petrostate are gone,” said Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. The country that a decade ago was the largest producer in Latin America, earning about $90 billion a year from oil exports, is expected to net about $2.3 billion by this year’s end — less than the aggregate amount that Venezuelan migrants who fled the country’s economic devastation will send back home to support their families, according to Pilar Navarro, a Caracas-based economist. Production is the lowest in nearly a century  after sanctions forced most oil companies to stop drilling for or buying Venezuelan oil — and even that trickle could dry up soon, analysts warn. “Without drilling, without services companies and without money, it’s very difficult to maintain even the current levels of production,” said David Voght, head of IPD Latin America, an oil consulting firm. “If the political situation in the country doesn’t change, you could go to zero.” The decline has diminished beyond recognition a country that just a decade ago rivaled the United States for regional influence. It is also unraveling a national culture defined by oil, a source of cash that once seemed endless; it financed monumental public works and pervasive graft, generous scholarships and flashy shopping trips to Miami. Crippling gasoline shortages have led to an outbreak of dozens of daily protests across most Venezuelan states in recent weeks.  In the capital, Caracas, periodic fuel shipments from Iran, paid for with the country’s remaining gold reserves, provide a semblance of normality for a few weeks at a time. But in the countryside, residents have defied the pandemic lockdown to block roads and clash with police amid their desperate demands for the modicum of fuel they need to survive. Across Venezuela’s oil towns, the sticky black crude that once provided jobs and social mobility is poisoning residents’ livelihoods. In Cabimas, a town on the shores of Lake Maracaibo that was once a center of production for the region’s prolific oil fields, crude seeping from abandoned underwater wells and pipelines coats the crabs that former oil workers haul from the lake with blackened hands. When it rains, oil that has oozed into the sewage system comes up through manholes and drains, coursing with rainwater through the streets, smearing houses and filling the town with its gaseous stench. Cabimas’s desolation marks a swift downfall for a town that just a decade ago was one of the richest in Venezuela. During the boom years, PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, showered the residents of oil towns such as Cabimas with benefits including free food, summer camps and Christmas toys. It built hospitals and schools. Now, the bankrupt company’s tens of thousands of workers have been reduced to dismantling oil facilities for scrap metal and selling their distinctive coveralls, emblazoned with the company logo, to make ends meet. “We used to be kings because we lived on the shores of PDVSA,” said Alexander Rodríguez, a Cabimas fisherman, whose two boat motors have been spiked by an oil spill. “Now we’re cursed.” PDVSA’s social club, where locals used to gather to drink whiskey, play tennis and watch movies, is in ruins, and, like so much in town, smeared in oily, black residue. “There are no jobs, no gasoline, but the oil is spilling everywhere,” said Francisco Barrios, a baker. The end of oil’s central role in Venezuela’s economy is a traumatic reversal for a nation that in many ways defined a petrostate. After major reserves were tapped near Lake Maracaibo in 1914, oil workers from the United States poured into the country. They helped build many Venezuelan cities, and instilled in the country a love of baseball, whiskey and big gas-guzzling cars, differentiating it forever from its South American neighbors. As a driving force in the founding of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960, Venezuela helped Arab nations take control of their oil wealth, shaping the global energy market and the geopolitical order for decades to come. Even in those heady days, Venezuela’s prominent oil minister, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, warned there were pitfalls to sudden oil wealth: It could lead to excessive debt and the destruction of traditional industries. “It is the devil’s excrement,” Mr. Perez Alfonzo famously declared. “We are drowning in the devil’s excrement.” In the years that followed, despite abundant oil revenues, Venezuela faced a roller coaster of recurring debt and financial crises. The wealth also did nothing to diminish corruption or inequality, and when a former paratrooper, Hugo Chávez, appeared on the national stage in the 1990s promising a revolution that would put Venezuela’s oil to work for its poor majority, he captivated the nation. Soon after he was elected president in 1998, Mr. Chávez commandeered the country’s respected state oil company for his radical development program. He fired nearly 20,000 oil professionals, nationalized foreign-owned oil assets and allowed allies to plunder the oil revenues. The troubled industry went into a free fall last year, when the United States accused Mr. Chavez’s successor and protégé, President Nicolás Maduro, of election fraud and enacted severe economic sanctions to force him from power. Soon, Venezuela’s oil partners, bankers and customers broke ties, and output plunged at a pace that has outstripped Iraq’s downturn during both Gulf Wars and Iran’s after its Islamic Revolution. The sanctions forced the last American oil companies in the country to stop drilling. They may leave the country entirely in December, if the Trump administration ends their exemptions from sanctions. Mr. Maduro’s Russian and Chinese partners have not filled the breach, downsizing production and cutting the oil trade, according to workers at the ventures. Venezuela’s opposition, which last year with Western backing challenged Mr. Maduro for the country’s leadership, claims it can rebuild the oil industry once in power by ending American sanctions and offering investors attractive terms. But analysts say Venezuelan oil industry is unlikely to attract the level of investment needed for a full recovery. In an era of stagnating global demand, weak prices and growing environmental concerns, the country’s extra heavy oil is particularly polluting and expensive to process. To compensate for the loss of revenue, Mr. Maduro has turned to illicit gold mining and drug trade to stay in power, according to the United States government. Mr. Maduro’s retreat from oil  has left the shrinking Venezuelan economy comparable to that of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has been plagued by civil strife since independence. But the transition has allowed Mr. Maduro to keep the loyalty of the military and weather the punishing American sanctions, said Ms. Grais-Targow, the analyst. The costs of this economic contraction have been borne by the Venezuelan people, she said. More than five million Venezuelans, or one in six residents, have fled the country since 2015, creating one of the world’s greatest refugee crises, according to the United Nations. The country now has the highest poverty rate in Latin America, overtaking Haiti this year, according to a recent study by Venezuela’s three leading universities. Near Venezuela’s massive coastal refineries, residents forage for firewood and trawl their fishing nets on foot to find food. Their fishing boats are beached without gasoline, and their kitchens have long run out of cooking gas. “If we haven’t reached the rock bottom yet, we’re centimeters from it,” said José Giron, who used to ferry tourists in the beach town of Tucacas, near Venezuela’s three largest refineries. PDVSA has kept minimal production going by sacrificing basic maintenance of equipment, at a growing environmental cost. The country’s Caribbean coast, a great source of national pride with its turquoise water and white-sand beaches, has been damaged by at least four large oil spills this year — an unprecedented number, according to Venezuelan biologists. Gasoline shortages and the pandemic have already emptied Tucacas’s beaches of tourists. Now, the fish that many here rely on for survival are being decimated by the oil. “These spills are the ultimate affront to the people,” said Luis Vargas, who used to sell seafood cocktails to tourists. The great, creeping oil stains are also ravaging Cabimas, in the country’s west, where residents fish the polluted lake on inflated inner tubes and scour decaying oil facilities for a little gasoline. Three people died last month when a scuffle over a leaking gasoline pipeline led to an explosion. For generations, Cabimas residents said they were the proud champions of Venezuela’s oil. They now, too, call it “the devil’s excrement.” Tibisay Romero contributed reporting from Tucacas, Venezuela, and María Ramírez from Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela.']",
Migrant Boy Dies After Confinement on Italian Quarantine Ship,2020-10-08,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['Italian authorities are investigating the death of a 15-year old boy from Ivory Coast who spent days on a “quarantine vessel” where migrants are being confined as a measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The boy, Abou Diakite, died Monday at a hospital in Palermo, in the north of Sicily, after being evacuated from the Allegra, a cruise ship used by Italian authorities to quarantine migrants arriving this year. The cause of death has yet to be determined. “We will see what the autopsy reveals, but it is painful that this young boy died here alone, while he was looking for hope of a better life,” said Michele Calantropo, a human rights advocate and lawyer for Abou’s guardian. A boat carrying Abou and fellow migrants was rescued off the coast of Libya on Sept. 10 by the nonprofit organization Proactiva Open Arms. Many migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who hope to reach Europe must pass through Libya, where militias control the cross-Mediterranean smuggling routes. Abou showed symptoms of “strong malnutrition, common to the majority of people on the boat,” Open Arms said in a statement. “They all arrive in terrible conditions after going through horrendous tortures in Libya,” Mr. Calantropo said. “The pandemic only exacerbated that.” Alessandra Puccio, Mr. Diakite’s legal guardian, assigned by the authorities from a list of volunteers, said the quarantine ship had space to isolate migrants, but little capacity for testing. “I am waiting to hear from prosecutors whether these ships have enough doctors and medical staff, because they host hundreds of people,” she said. Italy began putting migrants on board the vessels this summer after concerns emerged, often pushed by far-right politicians, that they were spreading the coronavirus. Data shows, however, that most of the cases in the second wave of infections in Italy originated either in neighboring European countries or domestically. A week after Abou’s rescue, when he and migrants accompanying him were still on the Open Arms vessel, he started having a temperature and lower back pain, and the medical staff gave him antibiotics. The staff also discovered marks on his body that could have been the result of torture, the aid group said. He told the medical staff through a friend acting as an interpreter that they were old wounds from childhood. An ultrasound performed on the boat did not show any “evident problem,” Open Arms said. He tested negative for Covid-19 twice. The following day, he was transferred to the quarantine ship, and his medical file was handed over to the Red Cross doctor aboard the Allegra. Abou could walk by himself and was able to communicate. It was only in late September, almost at the end of his quarantine, that he fell sick again and was hastily transported to the hospital in Palermo. “We are deeply saddened by Abou’s death and await to understand why it happened,” Open Arms said on its website. “The people that we rescue are all in precarious health conditions and went through violence and abuse.” The organization called on the authorities to allow the migrants to disembark in “a safe port as soon as possible and spend the quarantine in adequate facilities.” An inspection of the Italian cruise ships hosting migrants, conducted by a government-funded group, has found onboard living conditions to be adequate. “Migrants have a cabin each and those who test positive are hosted on a separate deck from the others, and that is already remarkable considering the crowded centers on the mainland,” said Mauro Palma, president of the group, the National Guarantor for the Rights of Persons Detained or Deprived of Liberty. He added that he had not examined Abou’s medical records and could not speak specifically about his case. Mr. Palma, whose group is tasked with conducting independent assessments of the living conditions, said that he met qualified Red Cross personnel and that migrants reported being treated well. “Culturally, we tend to observe these people’s conditions superficially, we underestimate their journey, the lives they had to live before and what being held prisoner in Libya means,” he said. “And that terrible past can hide any form of illness.”']",The 15-year-old from Ivory Coast died in a hospital after being evacuated from one of the cruise ships where Italian authorities are keeping migrants as part of efforts to limit the spread of Covid-19.
An Afghan Boy’s Rape and Death Prompt a Rare Response: Arrests,2020-10-09,By David Zucchino and Taimoor Shah,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — It started as a dispute between boys: Naseebullah Barakzai, 13, was irked when a neighbor boy stole fruit and ripped limbs from his family’s pomegranate tree, and he shoved the younger boy to the ground, relatives say. Just two days later, Naseebullah was dead, and his village, in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, was in an uproar. His family and other residents accuse an influential police checkpoint commander of taking the other boy’s side and abducting and raping Naseebullah, fatally injuring him. It is the kind of sexual assault that has run rampant within the Afghan security forces. And in other forms, child abuse has become ritualized: One practice, in which powerful men molest young boys and force them to dress and dance in girls’ clothing, is widely known as bacha bazi, or boy play. Poor families have suffered for years as commanders and their men have preyed on them, part of a broader culture of corruption in the security forces that led to efforts to reform the military and police. But officials have been reluctant to acknowledge, much less confront, the endemic issue of sexual abuse of children — including bacha bazi and minors forced into marriage — though those practices have been officially outlawed. In the case of Naseebullah, though, public outrage appears to be forcing a rare reckoning. Naseebullah’s family, backed by a throng of elders from the village of Karezak, marched into the offices of Kandahar’s governor, Hayatullah Hayat, to demand justice and the arrest of the police commander, First Lt. Mullah Roozi Khan, last month. And it worked: The government quickly arrested Lieutenant Khan and six of his officers, who are in jail while an official investigation is underway to determine whether to charge them. Naseebullah’s mother and brother said that Lieutenant Khan and his men abducted, beat and raped the sixth-grader, who was dumped the next day at a hospital. They said hospital officials told them that Naseebullah had suffered severe internal injuries before he died, on Sept. 18, and that the men who dropped him off claimed that he had fallen from a roof. But the doctor who operated on the boy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he had observed extensive internal injuries consistent with forced penetration. The allegations against the commander test the jurisdiction of Afghanistan’s American-backed government, which holds limited sway in provinces outside the capital, Kabul. As Afghan and Taliban negotiators discuss a possible peace deal, the militants are still conducting attacks nationwide, exposing the government’s inability to protect its citizens in violently contested provinces like Kandahar. Under these circumstances, the dead boy’s family and neighbors are demanding government action in a district nominally under government control. “I want President Ghani to give us justice — nothing else,” Naseebullah’s mother, Bibi Amina, 50, said of President Ashraf Ghani. “This crime defamed the name of Islam.” Naseebullah’s brother, Ehsanullah Barakzai, 26, said the governor had assured the family that no one, not even a powerful police commander, was above the law. But he said the guilty often go unpunished if they are rich or influential. “We still don’t know whether this criminal will be punished or set free,” Ehsanullah said of the jailed commander. The lieutenant and his men could not be reached for comment, and in recent days were transferred to a prison in Kabul as the investigation continued. Wali Mohammad Askar, the Criminal Investigation director for Kandahar, said his office would conduct a thorough investigation and publicly announce the results. “We assure all the people of Kandahar, and especially the relatives of the victim, that no one who is guilty will be spared justice,” Mr. Askar said. But in similar cases nationwide, authorities have promised to investigate, only to quietly release suspects after interest fades. “When powerful people are involved, often we don’t hear about the investigation again after the first few days,” said Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Ms. Akbar said families often don’t report child sex crimes because of shame or fear of official retribution. But in Naseebullah’s case, the family asked the human rights group’s office in Kandahar to monitor the case and consult with authorities to ensure transparency, she said. In Logar Province, south of Kabul last November, a local child advocacy group publicized statements from 165 schoolboys who said they had been raped by teachers, principals or police officers. Afghanistan’s national intelligence agency quickly detained the two leaders of the advocacy group and coerced them to publicly recant the allegations. After the American Embassy in Kabul and human rights groups intervened, the two advocates were released; one has since fled Afghanistan. Twenty suspects have been arrested and charged with raping the boys, and trials have begun for four of them, Ms. Akbar said. Jamshid Rasuli, spokesman for Afghanistan’s attorney general, said the office had conducted “a comprehensive and extended investigation” in Logar and would announce the results soon. In July, four Afghan security force members, including a company commander, were jailed after they were accused of raping and beating a 13- and a 14-year old boy inside a battalion headquarters base in Takhar Province in northern Afghanistan. The 13-year-old’s cousin, Qurban Ali Hairat, said he found the boys in a room on the battalion base, both injured so badly that they were unable to walk. He said they told him they had been raped by soldiers. Brig. Gen. Mohammad Ali Yazdani, commander of the 217th Pamir Corps in Takhar, said military prosecutors were investigating the case while the soldiers remained in custody, In 2015, an investigation by The New York Times found widespread sexual assault of boys by Afghan security force members, and that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. The investigation prompted a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the military’s reluctance to confront bacha bazi, a practice centuries old. Afghanistan made bacha bazi and similar offenses violations of the national criminal code in 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up the three years in prison — three to five years if the dancing is “a public event.” But human rights advocates say the codes are rarely enforced. In Kandahar, the spokesman for the governor promised that justice would be done for Naseebullah. “Nobody is above the law, and we are committed to following the rule of law and we will complete the investigation soon,” the spokesman, Baher Ahmadi, said. The dead boy’s mother was not convinced. “The government puts innocent people in prison, but the criminals and culprits remain free,” Ms. Amina said. Mohammad Nazem, a neighbor in the Dand district where Naseebullah lived, said hundreds of people turned out for the boy’s funeral and railed against government officials. He said a failure to punish those responsible would only harden the hatred that many residents harbor toward the government. “We cannot imagine a human being doing such a thing to a teenage boy,” Mr. Nazem said. “We would prefer that he be shot and killed, not murdered in this cruel way.” David Zucchino reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Kabul.']","Villagers confronted officials, and seven police officers are now in jail, in a rare official action to investigate child sexual abuse accusations in Afghanistan."
He’s Sorry for His Bad Reviews. He May Now Avoid Prison.,2020-10-09,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — He’s very, very sorry. But the hotel in Thailand that threatened an American guest with prison for his bad reviews may end up with bigger regrets. Wesley Barnes, the American guest, publicly apologized on Friday for his blunt online reviews of the Sea View Koh Chang resort in Thailand. In exchange, the hotel promised it would drop the complaint that led the authorities in Thailand to file criminal defamation charges against him. More than wounded pride was on the line. In Thailand, criminal defamation charges can result in a prison term of up to two years. Mr. Barnes had already spent two days in jail after his arrest on those charges last month before posting bail. The question now for the Sea View resort — and for Thailand’s tourism industry, which is struggling under the coronavirus travel freeze — is whether it can recover from the considerable damage its reputation has suffered by threatening Mr. Barnes with prison. The resort, on the Koh Chang island on Thailand’s southeastern coast, has been excoriated online for using the country’s tough defamation laws against a guest who didn’t enjoy his stay and decided to write about it. Mr. Barnes struck a decidedly different tone on Friday, in a statement filled with stilted official language reminiscent of a forced confession. “All of the statements that I made are completely untrue,” the statement said. “These reviews and comments were written out of anger and malice. Now, I, Mr. Barnes, have regretted my actions and would like to apologize to Sea View Koh Chang, and its staff.” As required by the settlement with the hotel, Mr. Barnes also sent the statement to news outlets that covered his case, including The New York Times. He apologized “for my repeatedly false and untrue statements/reviews made to maliciously defame Sea View Koh Chang.” Kitti Maleehuan, the Koh Chang police chief, whose office brought the charges, attended a settlement meeting on Thursday, according to the police. The resort on Koh Chang island, an hour’s flight from Bangkok, said by email that it would drop its complaint if Mr. Barnes complied with the terms of the agreement by Oct. 30. “After all conditions are met, the hotel will then withdraw the charges against the offender,” said Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen, deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police. Mr. Barnes did not respond to a request for further comment. Mr. Barnes’s arrest and the filing of criminal charges last month over reviews he posted on TripAdvisor and Google alarmed many travelers, who have long felt free to post blunt and critical online reviews in Thailand and elsewhere. The move also called into question the judgment of the Thai authorities for pursuing the criminal case just as Thailand is desperately trying to revive its tourist industry. One of the government’s strategies is to encourage residents, including foreigners like Mr. Barnes who live in Thailand, to travel within the country. Tourism accounts for about a fifth of the country’s economy. Human rights advocates have long criticized Thailand’s defamation law, which can lead to criminal charges for speaking out and is sometimes used by companies to silence critics. The dispute began in June when Mr. Barnes, a hotel guest, objected to paying what he saw as an excessive $15 corkage fee so that he could drink from a bottle of gin he had brought to the hotel restaurant. A manager eventually waived the fee. Mr. Barnes said in a statement after his arrest that he saw the same manager later harshly criticizing an employee and concluded that “there was some master/slave mentality going on.” That inspired him to post a series of negative reviews on TripAdvisor and Google, including one in which he wrote, “Avoid this place as if it was the Coronavirus!” The hotel said it repeatedly asked him to take down the reviews and posted its own detailed rebuttals online. The hotel said it had no choice but to go to the police after Mr. Barnes ignored their requests. An “official statement” included in the settlement agreement said that the Sea View had decided in August to “protect its rights” by filing the criminal complaint. “This decision was not taken lightly by the management team,” it said. The settlement required Mr. Barnes to make a “sincere apology” for his reviews, including for mention of “using slave labor, xenophobic comments against hotel staff, and comparing the hotel to coronavirus on multiple occasions and website platforms.” In his statement, Mr. Barnes expressed gratitude to the hotel for allowing him to avoid prison. “The hotel has forgiven me and agreed to withdraw the complaint,” the statement said. “I would like to sincerely thank the hotel and its staff and take this opportunity to announce this news to the general public.”']","An American who went to jail for disparaging a hotel in Thailand online apologized profusely as part of a deal to avoid prosecution, in an episode that laid bare that country’s harsh defamation laws."
A Low-Income Quarter Needs to Grow. A Prized Forest Could Pay the Price.,2020-10-08,By Myra Noveck,"['JERUSALEM — On a blistering afternoon in the hills west of Jerusalem, Israelis from all walks of life swam in spring-fed pools and picnicked in the shade of fig trees in a bucolic refuge known as Ein Lavan, as they have done for years. But they may not have much longer to enjoy it. Developers want to build a neighborhood of 5,000 homes, a hotel and a business district atop Lavan Ridge, a stone’s throw away. This is no ordinary land-use battle between builders and conservationists. Supporters of the project insist they are motivated not by profit but by the desire to finance sorely needed urban renewal in Kiryat Menachem, an overcrowded, low-income neighborhood nearby. And the battle could set a precedent for similar fights. Israel, a country with the developed world’s highest fertility rate, crams 200,000 more people each year into a nation the size of New Jersey, half of it uninhabitable desert. The resulting housing crunch is creating enormous pressure to build in the dwindling green spaces. The preferred alternative is to add housing in Israel’s cities by replacing decrepit low-rise apartments with modern high-rises — building up, rather than out to prevent urban sprawl. Builders profit by selling the additional new apartments on upper floors, effectively using air rights to subsidize the new housing. In Jerusalem’s neighborhoods, 86 percent of the 142,000 units expected to be approved by 2040 have been earmarked as urban-renewal projects. But that doesn’t work everywhere. Renewing Kiryat Menachem, opponents say, would come at the expense of a place that Jerusalemites treasure. Kiryat Menachem, on Jerusalem’s southwestern edge, is within the borders that predate the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem. A national planning body in May fast-tracked a plan to renew Kiryat Menachem’s 28-acre Hanurit complex, which currently has 646 substandard apartments, and turn it into 1,700 new units. But the planners were not able to include enough additional apartments for developers to make a profit, officials say. And adding more units is not an option: The area is already too dense. Seemingly stuck, the planners cast their eyes on the virgin hills of Lavan Ridge. They worked out a deal with the Israel Lands Authority to subsidize the renewal of Hanurit by allowing builders to buy publicly owned land on Lavan Ridge at an 80 percent discount. This purchase will allow the builders to put up a new neighborhood there of 5,000 homes at a hefty profit. The new homes would be a sweetener for the developers, not for Kiryat Menachem residents, who would unlikely be able to afford them. But developing open countryside, rather than air rights, would pay for the urban renewal. Ortal Matzliah, 33, has lived in her parents’ 580-square-foot apartment in the Hanurit complex almost her whole life. As a girl, she shared a bedroom with two siblings. Families with five or six children get by in leaky, run-down apartments of just 430 square feet, she said. Under the planned renewal of her complex, present owners would get an additional 270 square feet per apartment, she said. Elevators would spare her what is now a four-flight walk-up. “We’re not only talking about a personal change but also a social change: to bring a better-off population into the neighborhood,” Ms. Matzliah said. “They’ll only come if you have good buildings — not the way it looks today.” Ms. Matzliah said she was torn. She, too, loves hiking Lavan Ridge. “We want to see that the green will remain,” she said. “But, you know, we want to live the way other people live — a good life.” Opponents call it a devastating blow: Thousands of trees would be chopped down. Wildlife would be endangered. Construction could destroy the mountain aquifer that feeds the springs. And Jerusalem’s 930,000 residents would have one less place to cool off and escape from the concrete and tumult of the city. “We are not like on the coast; we don’t have a beach,” said Odelya Robins-Morgenstern, 16, who runs a WhatsApp group opposing the project. She called Ein Lavan a “sacred space.” “We don’t have a Sea of Galilee,” she said. “This is where we go. You can go to Ein Lavan on Friday, and there are 200 people there. It’s where I go with friends. It’s where I go sometimes for some peace and quiet.” Odelya acknowledged that officials had promised that construction on the ridge was supposed to leave the natural pools undisturbed. But they would no longer serve as an escape, she said. “Who’s going to want to go into a spring when you’re going to be watched by people standing on their balconies?” There is another option, some critics say, which would be for the government subsidize Kiryat Menachem’s urban renewal directly instead of ceding green space to developers. “We won’t accept this demagogy that the need for supplementary land justifies harmful plans,” says Dror Boymel, head of the planning at the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, a conservation group. He said the plan was just the latest foray in Jerusalem’s westward expansion into the virgin hills. A better solution, he said, was for the government to “put its hand in its pocket” and give the builders a cash subsidy. But Amit Poni-Kronish, head of the Jerusalem Urban Renewal Initiative, says there is simply no budget for such payments, especially given the current global economic crisis. “If we have to choose between nature and rebuilding these old housing projects which are not safe for earthquakes, don’t have safe rooms, and if Lavan Ridge could help that, I’m for Lavan Ridge,” he said. “I think this is the only justification to hurt nature.” Planners insist that they have worked mightily to mitigate environmental harm. They said that they had shrunk the project, leaving parkland near the springs and a hiking trail unmolested, and that they would plant a tree to replace each that is uprooted. Even the deer that live in the woods would be given a special corridor of their own. As for the aquifer, if it is damaged, officials have vowed to pipe in tap water to let bathers keep enjoying Ein Lavan’s pools. Opponents have appealed the project to the National Planning and Building Council. Its decision is expected soon. But even the opponents are torn. Chanan Sack, 18, has been one of the more vocal activists on the issue, updating 1,600 people on a WhatsApp group and lobbying lawmakers and city officials. He said he felt for the residents of Kiryat Menachem, where he lived as a young boy. “We were seven siblings in that little house, and we had to divide the living room with a bookcase,” he recalled. “Those people deserve better conditions. But you don’t solve one social blight by creating another.”']","With Jerusalem bursting at the seams, 5,000 new homes could wreck a popular getaway in the hills. “You don’t solve one social blight by creating another,” said one opponent of the project."
New Zealand Stamps Out the Virus. For a Second Time.,2020-10-07,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['The first time New Zealand thought it had eliminated the coronavirus from its isolated shores, a mysterious outbreak in its largest city shattered any sense of victory over a tenacious foe. Now, after a second round of strict lockdown, the country believes — if a bit more tentatively this time — that it has effectively stamped out the virus once again. On Wednesday, New Zealand moved to lift the last of its restrictions in Auckland after 10 days with no new cases linked to a cluster that first surfaced in August. The government will now allow unrestricted gatherings, and trips on public transit without social distancing or masks, in the city of 1.6 million people. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is facing re-election next week, called the reopening a validation of the country’s “go hard, go early” response. The strategy is aimed at eradicating the virus with a swift science-based policy, one that trades weeks of lockdown and sacrifice for an emergence to full economic activity. “Our team of five million, a little more battle-weary this time, did what national teams do so often. We put our heads down, and we got on with it,” Ms. Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Monday as she announced that the restrictions would be loosened, referring to the total number of people in New Zealand. “You only had to look around the world to see the alternative to our approach here in New Zealand,” she said, adding that there was a 95 percent probability that the country had eliminated local transmission of the virus. Experts cautioned that New Zealand’s small population and isolation meant it was uniquely positioned to manage the disease. But its success presents a stark contrast to many other parts of the world as deaths from the pandemic have surpassed one million. India is being devastated by the virus after proceeding with its economic reopening even as a second wave washed over the country. In the United States and Brazil, leaders have continued to play down the pandemic’s dangers even as they themselves have been infected. The word “elimination” in relation to the virus, said Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago, “might stick in the throat for some politicians, because it seems too tough, but as we found in New Zealand, it’s a goal you aim for, and you accept you might have outbreaks.” Professor Baker helped devise the country’s elimination strategy. He said that despite early fears that severe lockdowns would irreparably damage the economy, New Zealand’s approach had proved that the best economic response was a strong public health response, including a blitz of testing, contact tracing and quarantining. Much of the rest of the Western world, Professor Baker added, has “adopted the approach of complacent exceptionalism — that they wouldn’t get the virus, or it wouldn’t be as severe as they thought, and the pandemic has proved them wrong.” In Auckland, where gatherings had been restricted to 100 people and masks had been mandated on public transport, the rules were eased at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday. People are no longer required to wear masks in public, but must continue to sign in at and keep records of locations they visit, maintain good hygiene practices and, if unwell, remain at home and get tested for the virus. The national border remains closed to almost all travelers except New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. While residents said they were relieved, they did not expect an immediate return to normal life. “People have stayed in their suburbs and supported their local restaurants, so where in the past I was in a really good spot, now not so much,” said Yael Shochat, who has run Ima Cuisine, a restaurant in downtown Auckland, for almost two decades. “But the most important thing is we have eliminated the virus again, and that makes people confident to come out,” Ms. Shochat said. “I’m hoping that as Christmas comes, people will really want to go out and party — it’s been a horrible year.” Others said they had been frustrated at restrictions that seemed too stringent, preventing them from applying for visas or doing work considered nonessential by the government. And some who acknowledged that the measures were necessary said they felt that not enough had been done to assist them. “I can’t get any help from the government,” said Sherrie Edwards, 51, who after losing her job as an importer in recent months said she feared that she might have to sell her home to make ends meet. Ms. Edwards said she was feeling “quite depressed.” While the economic pain has been acute for many, New Zealand has kept the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus low. The country has had 1,505 confirmed cases and 25 deaths in total, and as of Wednesday, just three new cases of the virus had been recorded, all of them people still in quarantine after arriving from overseas. The numbers have worked in Ms. Ardern’s favor, placing her ahead in the polls before the country’s elections on Oct. 17. “I was always leaning toward Labor, but this has well and truly solidified it for me,” said Christopher Carroll, a 31-year-old primary school teacher in Auckland, referring to the party Ms. Ardern leads. “I feel like we’re in a better situation than in other parts of the world, where this thing is going on and on.” Two months ago, however, many in the country wondered whether that success would continue. The Auckland cluster, the country’s largest, involved 179 cases. At the same time in neighboring Australia, its second-largest city, Melbourne, was in the grip of a severe second wave from which it is only now emerging. And though disease detectives struggled to pin down the origins of the Auckland outbreak, the country was ultimately able to quash it through a citywide lockdown that began the day after the first cases emerged. New Zealand is not alone in successfully pursuing an elimination strategy, with Taiwan among those following the model. And other places, including Hong Kong and Vietnam, have stamped out second or third waves. But experts said this approach would not necessarily work everywhere. “They’ve never had a major outbreak where the number of cases have overwhelmed their public health capacity,” Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor of global health at the University of Sydney, said of New Zealand. He added that even though the country’s size, isolation and disaster preparedness gave it distinct advantages, an elimination strategy may not be viable in the absence of a vaccine. Michael Plank, a mathematics and statistics professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, said that until that time, it would be wise for New Zealanders to continue wearing masks —\xa0even if the virus appeared to have been defeated. “We need to be really careful not to let our guard down,” Professor Plank said. “We think we’ve got a high chance now that we’ve eliminated community transmission of the virus. But that doesn’t mean it won’t come back.”']","Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is facing re-election, called the country’s reopening a validation of its “go hard, go early” response."
"After testing positive, Notre Dame’s president faces outrage over a failure to wear a mask.",2020-10-08,By Kathleen Gray and Shawn Hubler,"['The Rev. John I. Jenkins, the University of Notre Dame’s president and a 66-year-old Catholic priest, was among the first college leaders to invite students back to campus, arguing in a New York Times Op-Ed in May that the college had a moral obligation to not be crippled by fear of the virus. He also seemed humble about the challenge: When he forgot social-distancing rules as he posed for pictures with students returning to the South Bend, Ind., campus in August, he issued a public apology. Now Father Jenkins faces a storm of protest over the news that he not only violated his own health rules — appearing without a mask at a White House reception last month for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a Supreme Court nominee and former Notre Dame Law School professor — but also is infected with the coronavirus himself. Students have petitioned for his resignation, angry over what they consider his hypocrisy, as well as the rising tide of infections on campus. Others have reported him to a coronavirus hotline for violating his own mask mandate. And the faculty senate stopped one vote short on Tuesday night of considering a vote of no confidence in his leadership. “I haven’t seen people this outraged in my whole career, and I’ve been here since 2001,” said Eileen Hunt Botting, a political-science professor. In a statement posted last week on the Notre Dame website, Father Jenkins said: “I regret my error of judgment in not wearing a mask during the ceremony and by shaking hands with a number of people in the Rose Garden.” Some faculty members have expressed empathy for Father Jenkins, who is certainly not the first college president to get the virus. “Father Jenkins is already sick,” one person wrote. “That is enough punishment.” But many others bristled with resentment that he visited Washington when their own travel has been forbidden. “I have not seen my aging parents in over a year,” one faculty member said. Others said they had canceled research trips and vacations. One had missed the birth of a first grandchild.']",
"From Hiding, Kyrgyzstan’s Leader Declares State of Emergency",2020-10-09,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Four days after vanishing during a wave of attacks on government buildings by opposition protesters, the president of Kyrgyzstan declared a state of emergency in the capital of his Central Asian country on Friday, ordering the military into the city to halt unrest, confining residents to their homes and banning public gatherings. The beleaguered president, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, announced the measures in a decree issued from an undisclosed location and posted on his official website. But it was unclear whether Mr. Jeenbekov, who went into hiding after violent protests over a disputed parliamentary election on Sunday, would be able to enforce the state of emergency in the absence of a functioning government. Bowing to pressure from the street, Mr. Jeenbekov earlier on Friday formally dismissed the prime minister, the head of the armed forces and the country’s security chief. The dismissed officials had already given up their posts and decrees announcing their departure merely acknowledged a fait accompli dictated by the president’s foes. In a separate statement early on Friday, the president indicated that he, too, could leave office, saying that he was ready to resign once a new cabinet was appointed and “we are back on the path of lawfulness.” His subsequent declaration of a state of emergency, however, suggested he might try to hang on to power, but many welcomed the move as necessary to prevent the turmoil from escalating into a wider conflict. He named a deputy interior minister as “commandant” of the capital, responsible for enforcing the emergency measures. Mr. Jeenbekov, seeking to reassert his battered authority, reappeared later Friday to attend a meeting in Bishkek with the military leadership and is scheduled to meet with members of Parliament on Saturday to try and hammer out an agreement on a new prime minister. The prospects of an orderly transfer of power have dimmed in recent days, largely because the opposition is deeply divided. Lawmakers, who have responsibility for naming a prime minister, have held rival meetings in a hotel and cinema but have been unable to agree on a new lawful government that could fill the power vacuum. On Friday, supporters of two rival would-be new prime ministers — both of whom were freed from prison earlier in the week — clashed violently in Bishkek. The country’s former president, Almazbek Atambayev, who was broken out of jail by protesters and joined the opposition, said he had been the victim of an assassination attempt. The turmoil in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic and the only country in Central Asia with a modicum of democracy, follows two months of unrest in Belarus, another former Soviet land, and comes as a military conflict is underway between two other former republics, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The simultaneous crises have blindsided the Kremlin and left President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia scrambling to reassert some order in a zone of influence that Moscow calls its “near abroad” and views as vital to the country’s stability. Russia has military bases in Kyrgyzstan and also in Armenia, but has so far refrained from flexing its muscle on the ground in favor of one side or another in what are deeply entrenched local quarrels. The head of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B., spoke by telephone earlier this week with the acting head of the Kyrgyz security service and offered help to curb the chaos in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. But that Kyrgyz official, Omurbek Suvanaliyev, lost his job on Thursday. In a separate attempt to rein in the turmoil in former Soviet lands, Russia’s foreign ministry is hosting a meeting in Moscow on Friday between the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan over a possible truce in their fighting over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Bishkek fell under mob rule this week after protesters rampaged through buildings housing the Parliament and the presidential administration and stormed detention centers, freeing Mr. Atambayev, two former prime ministers and other detainees. The violence followed allegations by the opposition of vote buying and other irregularities in parliamentary elections on Sunday that handed victory to pro-government parties. Protesters seized government buildings and Mr. Jeenbekov went into hiding, while insisting he was still running the country. Mr. Jeenbekov is the second president of a former Soviet republic now struggling to survive after a disputed election. But unlike the authoritarian president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Mr. Jeenbekov presides over a country that, at least until Friday’s state of emergency, which imposed restrictions on media, has had a vibrant free press and many opposition parties. Instead of bringing stability, however, Kyrgyzstan’s relatively democratic system has opened the way to regular bouts of political unrest in a country bedeviled by clan rivalries and deep divisions between north and south. Two of Mr. Jeenbekov’s predecessors were toppled in violent revolutions and fled abroad to escape arrest. His immediate predecessor, Mr. Atambayev, who is from the north, served out his term but was thrown in jail after leaving office, a fate that Mr. Jeenbekov, a southerner, now wants to avoid. But securing a deal that guarantees his future freedom will be difficult as Mr. Atambayev, freed from jail earlier this week by his supporters, has been busy rallying opposition to his successor with demands that Mr. Jeenbekov be prosecuted. Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.']","Earlier on Friday, after protesters besieged government buildings, President Sooronbai Jeenbekov said he was willing to leave office.

A devastated Native American community shows the virus’s deadly toll on tribal nations.,2020-10-08,By Mark Walker,"['The coronavirus has torn through the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians unabated, sickening more than 10 percent of the tribe’s 10,000 residents and killing at least 81 people. Now the tribe is bracing for a second wave and more devastation. Since April, the cases have kept rising, along with the death toll. In May, 30 people died. In June, another 33. Through last month, Neshoba County, where most of the tribe’s residents live, had the highest death rate per capita in Mississippi from the coronavirus, according to data tracked by The New York Times. And despite making up 18 percent of the county’s residents, tribal members have accounted for more than half of the county’s virus cases and about 64 percent of the deaths. “We aren’t just losing family members or an aunt or uncle, we are losing parts of our culture,” said Mary Harrison, interim health director for the Choctaw Health Center. “We’ve lost dressmakers, we’ve lost artists, elders who are very fluid in our language — so when you think about an individual we’ve lost, these are important people in our community.” The Choctaw have been among the hardest hit in the state — like many other tribal nations across the United States. The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest reservation, has recorded at least 560 deaths — a tally larger than the coronavirus-related deaths in 13 states and a death rate higher than every state. While communities of color have been disproportionately affected by the virus, it appears to be especially deadly in some tribal nations, where poverty, multigenerational housing and underlying health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease have been contributing factors.']",
"‘Eventually, slowly, it comes back’: The U.S. Northeast sees signs of a second wave.",2020-10-09,By Sarah Mervosh and Julie Bosman,"['The Northeastern United States, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and then held up as a model of infection control by the summer, is now seeing the first inklings of what might become a second wave of the virus. The rise in case numbers has prompted state and local officials to reverse course, tightening restrictions on businesses, schools and outdoor spaces. In Boston, plans to bring children back to school have been halted as cases climb precariously. New virus clusters are emerging in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In New York City, the number of new cases each day now averages more than 500 for the first time since June, and the city is putting strict rules in place in some neighborhoods. In New Jersey, where hospitalizations are on the rise and the rate of infection has almost doubled, towns have closed public parks and picnic areas to discourage people from gathering. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island extended restaurant capacity rules for another month. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, said that early in the nation’s outbreak, New York and much of the Northeast had successfully tamped down transmission of the virus with physical distancing and masking, as much of Europe had done. “The point is, once you let up on the brake, then eventually, slowly, it comes back,” Dr. Osterholm said. By many measures, the Northeast is still doing quite well, particularly compared with virus hot spots elsewhere in the country, including the Midwest and Great Plains. Still, the number of people in the hospital — a clear measure of those most seriously affected by an outbreak — is starting to trend slightly upward again in the Northeast. There may be a number of reasons for the upward trend in cases. The air turned suddenly chilly in past few weeks, sending people who had been lounging in sunny parks indoors. Students returned to schools and college campuses. But it may also be that Northeasterners, who were among the first to take the virus seriously, are simply growing weary. “We’re all kind of exhausted with it,” said Danielle Ompad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at New York University. “We have to acknowledge that this is not easy.”']",
Kamala Harris’s ‘Canadian Dream’,2020-10-09,By Dan Bilefsky,"['Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky, a Canada correspondent for The New York Times based in Montreal, where Senator Kamala Harris spent her oft-overlooked teenage years. During Wednesday’s U.S. vice-presidential debate, Ms. Harris, a former California attorney general, prosecuted her case against the Trump presidency. But for the past month, I’ve been trying to understand a different Kamala: the disco-dancing adolescent shaped by her formative years at a multicultural high school in Montreal in the late 1970s. [Read: In Canada, Kamala Harris, a Disco-Dancing Teenager, Yearned for Home]. The assignment had particular resonance for me because my childhood intersected with Ms. Harris’s. While I didn’t know Ms. Harris, I grew up in Montreal near Westmount, a few blocks from where she lived with her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, and her sister, Maya. I was in high school around the same era as Ms. Harris. And my father, a kidney specialist, worked at the Jewish General Hospital, where her mother did pioneering breast cancer research. We also share another connection: While young Kamala was channeling Diana Ross in an all-girl troupe in which her nom de disco was “Angel,” I was pretending to be John Travolta, clumsily twirling my older sister to the soundtrack of “Saturday Night Fever.” Two themes stood out as I was reporting the story. One is the infinite influence of mothers in shaping who we become. The other was how the Canadian model of multiculturalism — in which we are part of a mosaic of different cultures rather than a melting pot — embraced a young American girl homesick for California. Ms. Harris’s mother, born in India, had divorced her Jamaican-born husband, a Stanford economist, by the time the family arrived in Montreal when Ms. Harris was 12 years old. In Montreal, Dr. Gopalan Harris had her own laboratory and worked 10-hour days and on weekends. I discovered a 1985 article in the Montreal Gazette on leading female scientists in Canada in which she was profiled. “Researchers live under terrible pressure. It’s very difficult not to take their work home at night,” she told the paper. “Children don’t understand work pressures,” she added. She credited young Kamala and her sister for forcing her to “turn off at least for a few hours when I got home.” Dr. Richard Margolese, a professor of surgical oncology at McGill University in Montreal, who worked with Dr. Gopalan Harris, told me that she asked to be called Shyamala. Her independent streak left an impression. “Here she was in this strange country, a single mother with two young daughters, doing important breast cancer research in a field where there were not a lot of women at the time,” he recalled. Wanda Kagan, Ms. Harris’s best friend from high school, went to live with her family for a time to escape an abusive stepfather. She told me that Dr. Gopalan Harris made sure she received counseling, and treated her like family, including making certain that she and the Harris sisters studied every day after school. “Her mom sometimes wore ’70s bell-bottom jeans. She was sassy but also strict,” Ms. Kagan told me. “She was a proud Indian woman.” Ms. Kagan said Ms. Harris was largely sheltered from Quebec’s political upheaval when she was at Westmount High from 1978-1981. But she said she believed her friend’s progressive politics were influenced by having come of age in a humanistic country with universal health care and less racial strife than the United States. Her childhood friends recalled a confident young woman who showed seeds of activism, found cultural affirmation in her Black identity and complained about French class. Mara Rudzitis, an art teacher at Westmount High for 22 years, recalled Kamala sometimes spent her lunch hour making art in the arts and crafts studio, where students would come to paint and make ceramic masks. “We didn’t get the cream of the crop at Westmount High — many of those kids would go to private schools — we got more of the sour cream,” she told me. “Kids are very impressionable at that age and Kamala was exposed to people from all walks of life and nationalities.” Ms. Kagan told me that while Ms. Harris was a diligent student, her limited exposure to French before coming to Canada disadvantaged her at a high school where the students in the French immersion section received more attention and resources. Ms. Harris arrived in Montreal knowing a handful of French words learned from ballet classes and was placed in the English section, Ms. Kagan said. Now, however, Ms. Harris is one of Westmount High’s most celebrated alumni (Leonard Cohen also studied there). During a recent politics class there, students debated Ms. Harris’s record as California attorney general, including whether she had done enough to mitigate racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system. Members of the class were also giddy that she had walked the same halls. “The students, especially the Black girls, are motivated by seeing a Black woman from Westmount High running for one of the highest political offices in the world,” Robert Green, who teaches the class, told me. This week, I reported on a bizarre case whose lurid details have grabbed headlines in Canada and China: a Chinese immigrant who killed his family member and chopped him into 108 pieces. Some observers say his sentence of 10 years and six months in prison is too short. A Toronto producer wants to bring “Blindness” to theater-starved Toronto.

Manila orders karaoke silence for students’ sake.,2020-10-08,By Jason Gutierrez and Monika Pronczuk,"['Manila’s mayor, the former actor Francisco Domagoso, banned the daytime use of “karaokes, videokes and other sound producing devices” beginning Thursday, after complaints from irate parents home-schooling their children amid the pandemic. Mr. Domagoso said his office had received multiple calls from parents who said their children could not concentrate with the noise. “I pity our parents and students who are trying to go through online schooling while being disturbed by karaoke noise in the background,” Mr. Domagoso, more popularly known by his movie name Isko Moreno, told The New York Times. The sound machines have long been a blight among Manila’s tightly packed communities. The pastime, however, has gained a new popularity of late, with many taking to singing to while away the boredom of isolation. Mr. Domagoso said that those caught violating the ordinance would be fined up to 3,000 pesos (about $61).

More than 2,300 new cases were also reported, with the total number of cases now at 331,869, according to the Department of Health.

"North Korean Diplomat, Missing Since 2018, Is in Seoul, Lawmaker Says",2020-10-07,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — A senior North Korean diplomat who disappeared from Italy in late 2018 has been living secretly in South Korea since July of last year, members of the intelligence committee of the South Korean Parliament said on Wednesday. The diplomat, Jo Song-gil, then 48, was North Korea’s acting ambassador to Rome when he and his wife disappeared days before he was scheduled to return home to Pyongyang in November 2018. His whereabouts had since remained a mystery, prompting speculation that he had become one of the most senior diplomats to desert the totalitarian North. The revelation about Mr. Jo could further aggravate North-South relations, which have been in a downward spiral for months after the North blew up a jointly run liaison office and its troops killed a South Korean government official during a sea patrol. Diplomats’ defections are a sensitive issue for Pyongyang because they are often interpreted in the outside world as a possible sign of fraying loyalty among the privileged\u200b class. They also raise the possibility that the South Korean autho\u200brities could glean a wealth of information, especially about smuggling and other illicit ways in which North Korean diplomats earn foreign currency in violation of United Nations sanctions. Ha Tae-keung, a member of the main opposition party in South Korea, said on Facebook on Wednesday that Mr. Jo had arrived in the South 15 months ago and remained under government protection. \u200bMr. Ha is a senior member of the intelligence committee of the South’s National Assembly\u200b and often briefs the news media \u200bon closed-door parliamentary reports from the country’s National Intelligence Service. Mr. Ha went public with his revelation hours after JTBC, a South Korean cable channel, reported that Mr. Jo had defected to \u200bthe \u200bSouth. JTBC cited anonymous intelligence sources as confirming Mr. Jo’s defection, and other South Korean news outlets followed up with similar stories\u200b. The National Intelligence Service said on Wednesday that it “will not confirm” the news report\u200bs\u200b or Mr. Ha’s statement. The agency has \u200boften used such a stock phrase when it wants to keep secret the defection of a prominent North Korean for fear of consequences in inter-Korean relations \u200bor to help protect the defector’s relatives in the North. But Jeon Hae-cheol, a lawmaker affiliated with the governing Democratic Party and head of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Jo had arrived in Seoul on his own volition but that the government kept his defection secret to protect his relatives in the North. During a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, a lawmaker asked Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha what role her ministry had played in Mr. Jo’s defection. Ms. Kang said her ministry “did what it could,” but did not clarify whether he was in Seoul. Mr. Jo is the most senior North Korean government official to flee to the South since H\u200bw\u200bang Jang-yop, a former secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, defected to Seoul through the South Korean Embassy in Beijing in 1997. \u200b The last senior North Korean diplomat to defect to the South was Thae Yong-ho, a minister in the North Korean Embassy in London, \u200b who\u200b f\u200bled to Seoul in 2016 with his wife and two sons. Over the years, some prominent North Koreans like Mr. Hwang and Mr. Thae have led public lives after their defections to the South. But many others have wanted to keep their defections secret to protect their relatives in the North, and the South Korean intelligence authorities have abided by their wishes. When its diplomats are posted abroad, North Korea requires them to leave some of their children in the North in order to discourage defections. Mr. Jo and his wife lived with their daughter in Rome. But when they escaped, they could not bring the daughter with them. Italy later said that the daughter had been taken home by the North Korean authorities. After Mr. Jo disappeared from Italy, Mr. Thae, who defected with his wife and all his children, issued an open letter appealing to the acting ambassador to defect to South Korea. But after Mr. Jo’s daughter was taken to the North, Mr. Thae said it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Jo to settle in the South. “His daughter would suffer a more severe retaliatory punishment if he chose to defect to South Korea” rather than to other countries, Mr. Thae told reporters last year. “He may have to remain silent and keep his whereabouts secret to protect his daughter.” On Wednesday, Mr. Thae, now a lawmaker affiliated with the main opposition party in South Korea, issued a statement worrying that the revelation in the news media of Mr. Jo’s whereabouts would further jeopardize the fate of Mr. Jo’s daughter in the North. It remains unclear exactly why Mr. Jo decided to flee North Korea. He was posted in Rome in May 2015. He served as the North’s acting ambassador after Italy expelled the ambassador, Mun Jong-nam, in 2017 in protest\u200b over the North’s sixth nuclear test\u200b. Mr. Jo’s disappearance was kept secret until a South Korean newspaper reported last year that he was seeking asylum in the West. South Korean lawmakers later briefed by the National Intelligence Service confirmed his disappearance. \u200bIn August of last year, the spy agency told lawmakers in \u200bSeoul that Mr. Jo was safe “somewhere” outside Italy. North Korea has yet to comment on Mr. Jo’s case. \u200bMore than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the mid-1990s. The North typically calls them “human scum” and “traitors,” or claims that they were kidnapped by the South Korean spy agency. North Korea diplomats are usually children of elite families. \u200b Mr. Jo’s father and father-in-law both had been ambassadors, Mr. Thae said.']","Jo Song-gil was the North’s acting ambassador to Rome when he vanished, raising the possibility that he had become the highest-ranking official to defect to the South since 1997."
What if Local and Diverse Is Better Than Networked and Global?,2020-10-09,By Damien Cave,"['MULLUMBIMBY, Australia — Helena Norberg-Hodge strolled into the farmers’ market that she helped start long before it was fashionable. She had come to shop but also to check on friends — especially the farmers living out her ideas about prizing localism and rejecting globalization, for the health of the environment and the happiness of humanity. A few steps into the market near the New South Wales coast, she found Andrew Cameron, 38, a cattle rancher with a thick beard and a cooler full of grass-fed meat. He said Covid-19 had made Ms. Norberg-Hodge’s message even more vital. “We’ve just been shown how fragile and not resilient it all is,” Mr. Cameron said, referring to global supply chains that spread the coronavirus worldwide, then struggled to deliver medical supplies. “Our resilience now” — “yeah, yeah,” Ms. Norberg-Hodge said, goading him on — “comes from local producers.” “There has been such a huge shift in awareness,” she said, her blue eyes filled with energy. “It has been good,” he said. The back and forth perfectly captured how Ms. Norberg-Hodge — an activist-scholar who started promoting localism decades ago — has become a lodestar, now more than ever, for people all over the world who are demanding an alternative to the global system of trade. At 74, she still interrupts with the urgency of an eager student, determined to win over every skeptic or amplify her message alongside the converted. And it’s quite a crowd she has gathered. Her vocal supporters include the Dalai Lama, the British comedian Russell Brand, the San Francisco chef Alice Waters, and Iain McGilchrist, the Oxford literary scholar and psychiatrist. “Whether or not our civilization survives, Helena’s work is of prime importance,” said Dr. McGilchrist, whose groundbreaking 2009 book, “The Master and His Emissary,” argued that each half of the brain generates a fundamentally different way of experiencing the world. “Encouraging local communities is a vital antidote to universal globalism.” “And if civilization should break down,” he added, “it will be our only hope for survival. We need to be acting on her ideas now.” Those ideas can be found in books and in documentaries, along with conferences and regular lectures tied to her nonprofit organization, Local Futures, which has offices in Australia, Britain and the United States. It boils down to two concepts that sound simple but have profound implications: First, shorter distances are healthier than longer distances for commerce and human interaction; second, diversification — one farmer growing a dozen crops, for example — is healthier than monoculture, which is what globalization tends to create, whether it’s bananas or mobile phones. “My big thing is helping to make this grow all over the world,” she said, pointing to shoppers and farmers chatting over produce. “It just makes sense.” But the status quo is stubborn. She said she was heartbroken by the news on Friday that the World Food Program won the Nobel Peace Prize because, like many critics, she believes the organization undermines local economies by favoring big business and destructive supply chains. “It’s so sad,” she said. “Despite the best of intentions, the W.F.P. is still promoting an outdated form of agriculture that’s based on monocultures for export, rather than diversification for local and national consumption. The end result is actually a loss of livelihoods and an increase in divisiveness.” *** A linguist by training who studied with Noam Chomsky in the 1970s, Ms. Norberg-Hodge says she landed in Byron Bay 20 years ago, at least part-time, because her husband, John Page, an English lawyer, seemed to benefit from the favorable climate. The home they share is modest, surrounded by trees, strewn with Asian rugs and overrun by books with titles like “Silencing Dissent” and “The Capitalism Papers.” In many ways, she fits right in around Byron Bay, where she helped start all four farmers’ markets in the area. Though now known as a celebrity hangout, the coastal town has been a haven for surfers, back-to-the-landers and backpackers since the 1960s. Not that Ms. Norberg-Hodge, wild gray hair notwithstanding, sees herself as a hippy. At the market, she winced after encountering a baby boomer American in a long flowing dress who started going on about how Ms. Norberg-Hodge should pitch her latest documentary to this very interesting film festival called Sundance. She was much more comfortable talking to Lance Powell, 67, an organic farmer who reported that after he stopped selling to supermarkets and shifted to organic local sales, his business soared and his stress level collapsed. “What it is,” she said, “is rebuilding human interdependence.” It’s an interesting critique coming from such a peripatetic citizen of the world. Ms. Norberg-Hodge was born in New York City, but her parents were Swedish, and after growing up in Stockholm she studied and traveled her way into speaking six languages before she turned 30. In 1975, on the strength of those skills, her plans for life were thrown into disarray when a German film crew invited her to Ladakh, a mostly-Buddhist mountain enclave in northwest India, which was just starting to open up to tourism and the international economy. She became one of the first visitors to learn Ladakhi, which helped her see how the unquestioned pursuit of economic growth corroded local competency and cohesion. The path to “development” for Ladakhis meant ending centuries of self-reliance, where they found everything they needed around them, except salt, which they traded for. It also meant accepting policies that favored choices they would not have made on their own. India subsidized fossil fuels, for example. But Ladakh featured relentless sunshine. Ms. Norberg-Hodge tried to fight back — early on, she started a pilot program for solar power. She also tried to maintain self-esteem among local young people by helping them see that the Hollywood images they devoured did not capture the full picture of consumerist reality. Along with shiny products, she emphasized that life in the West also included depression, divorce and social strife. Her first book, “Ancient Futures,” and a film of the same title, has been translated into 40 languages. Together, they amount to a cri de coeur about Ladakh, warning the world to stop assuming that progress is one-size-fits-all. “She got the opportunity to see a different world, and she was smart enough to understand that she wasn’t looking at a relic, she was looking at a vision of a working future,” said Bill McKibben, an author and founder of the environmental activism group 350.org. “And she has kept that vision close over many decades, helping all of us see that the metrics we’re used to — G.D.P., say — are not the only possibilities.” Over tea one afternoon, Ms. Norberg-Hodge argued that G.D.P., or gross domestic product, the accepted benchmark of national economic output, should be redefined. “You must know this, but G.D.P. is a measure of the breakdown of society and ecosystems,” she said. “If the water is so polluted that we are providing bottled water, it benefits G.D.P. If you and I plant a garden and say, eat most or half of our vegetables from there, G.D.P. goes down. If you and I stay healthy, G.D.P. goes down. If you need chemotherapy every year, G.D.P. goes up.” She shook her head in quiet scorn, as if saying it out loud was enough to reignite her outrage. *** What she would like to see instead, she said, is what she calls an “economics of happiness,” where the cost of environmental damage is included for products shipped over long distances; where intangible benefits like community are more deeply valued in policy. Food — despite the Nobel Peace Prize going to the World Food Program — is where she has won over the most converts. Alice Waters, who brought local, healthy cuisine alive at her Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, called her “tireless and single-minded.” “I have completely internalized her vision of how we can come back to our senses,” Ms. Waters said. Ms. Norberg-Hodge said the coronavirus pandemic may even help over the long term — as a disruptive force that could lead people to more “medium-sized” lifestyles in smaller communities, even within cities. Perhaps, she said, there are reasons for optimism being planted in otherwise dark times. “I think this moment has meant that a lot of people have developed an appetite for having a little more time, being a bit closer to home, learning the names of their neighbors, becoming interested in where their food is coming from and even developing an appetite for actually growing food.” For a moment, she stopped lecturing. “It’s so heartwarming for me to see,” she said.']","Helena Norberg-Hodge has been arguing for localism since the 1970s, but the pandemic is making the Australian activist-scholar’s ideas more relevant than ever."
"Hurricane Delta Moves Into Gulf After Striking, but Mostly Sparing, Mexico",2020-10-07,By Kirk Semple,"['Go here for the latest on Hurricane Delta MEXICO CITY — Hurricane Delta made landfall in southeastern Mexico near the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula early Wednesday, knocking out power, felling trees, shattering windows and causing scattered flooding in cities and towns along the Caribbean coast. But regional and federal officials said they had received no reports of deaths. The storm hit near the port town of Puerto Morelos, just south of a major Mexican tourism destination, Cancún, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern time, with maximum winds estimated at 110 miles per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. By early afternoon, the center of the storm had crossed the peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Mexico, north of the Dzilam de Bravo State Reserve. The hurricane had been downgraded from a Category 4, making landfall as a weaker Category 2. But forecasters predicted that the storm would again gather strength as it barreled across the warm waters of the southern and central Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday before approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on Friday. As of late Wednesday, Delta was moving northwest at about 17 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of about 90 miles per hour and higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The governors of Alabama and Louisiana declared states of emergency on Tuesday, and several coastal areas began mandatory evacuations on Wednesday. College football officials said Wednesday morning that Saturday’s game between Louisiana State University and the University of Missouri would be moved from Baton Rouge, La., to Columbia, Mo. The Southeastern Conference, whose membership includes both schools as well as 12 other universities, also left open the possibility that the storm would affect other athletic events in the coming days. In Mexico, Luís Alberto Ortega Vázquez, a top official with the national civil protection agency, said Wednesday morning that there had been no immediate accounts of deaths from the storm but said that the authorities had received reports of fallen trees and damage to the Yucatán Peninsula’s electrical grids. Though the hurricane’s impact in Mexico was apparently not as severe as anticipated when it reached Category 4 status on Tuesday night, the storm will almost certainly set back the Yucatán Peninsula’s efforts to revive its tourism industry, which has been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “What we have to do is get back on our feet quickly,” Carlos Orvañanos Rea, spokesman for the government of the state of Quintana Roo, said on Wednesday in an interview with the FOROtv cable news channel. “We are on a path of economic reactivation.” Visitors to the region were breathing a sigh of relief on Wednesday as the hurricane delivered a lesser punch than many had feared. Luis González, 35, a publicist for musicians, was holed up in a hotel in the coastal city of Playa del Carmen, south of Puerto Morelos, as the storm lashed the region Wednesday morning. He had been visiting the beach town of Tulum and had planned to fly back to Mexico City on Tuesday night, but learned late Tuesday afternoon that the flight had been canceled. He knew one of the owners of a hotel in Playa del Carmen “where people shelter in hurricanes,” he said, so he made a beeline there. He and other guests were given rooms in the rear of the hotel, away from the water, and were provided with a dinner buffet and a box lunch for the morning. Mr. González likened the hurricane to a normal, intense storm with periods marked by “continuous wind gusts with rain.” Preparations for the storm’s arrival began earlier in the week as the hurricane drew a bead on Mexico, with activity growing feverish on Tuesday as residents across the Yucatán Peninsula stocked up on groceries, hardware materials and gasoline, and pulled boats from the water and moved them inland. Government officials ordered nonessential businesses to close as emergency crews helped evacuate inhabitants from low-lying coastal areas and islands and relocate them inland. Scores of hotels along the Caribbean Coast — including in popular tourism destinations like Cancún, Playa del Carmen and Tulum — moved their guests to shelters. “The most important thing is to take care of everyone’s life so that we don’t lose anybody,” said Carlos Joaquín, the governor of the state of Quintana Roo, which borders the Caribbean coast of the peninsula. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Ortega Vázquez, the federal civil protection official, said that more than 39,000 people, including residents and tourists, had been evacuated from hotels and homes in the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán as the storm approached, with many seeking refuge in scores of temporary storm shelters. While the exact track of the hurricane remained uncertain, there is a risk of dangerous storm surge, wind and rainfall along the coast from Louisiana to the western portions of the Florida Panhandle beginning Thursday night or Friday. Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said the conditions would be ideal for the storm to strengthen back to a Category 4 as it passed through the southern Gulf of Mexico and approach the United States as a “major hurricane.” It has been a brutal year for hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which was heavily battered by Laura in September. That hurricane caused more than two dozen deaths and extensive property damage. Delta is the sixth named storm to put Louisiana in its potential path. While the state largely avoided wide-scale destruction from Cristobal, Marco, Sally and Beta, each storm brought to the area a fresh round of evacuations and fear. The process started anew this week. Orange Beach, a city in Alabama, offered sand bags to residents on Tuesday, while residents again anxiously prepared for evacuations and watched ominous weather forecasts. About four to eight inches of rain are expected in some areas of the central Gulf Coast, with up to 12 inches in some areas, along with flash flooding, the Hurricane Center said. “Folks there should make sure they have their hurricane plan in place, have their supplies and monitor the updates to the forecasts,” Mr. Feltgen said. “I know there’s a lot of hurricane weariness out there with Laura and Sally so fresh on everybody’s minds, but here we go again.” The Hurricane Center recommended that people monitor forecasts frequently, as storms can quickly slow down, grow stronger or shift track, he said. This hurricane season has been one of the most active on record. Last month, meteorologists ran out of names after a storm named Wilfred formed in the Atlantic. Subtropical storm Alpha, the first of the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet, quickly formed thereafter, becoming the 22nd named storm since May. Forecasters have resorted to the Greek alphabet only once before, in 2005, when meteorologists used six Greek names in a season that had 28 storms, Mr. Feltgen said. Reporting was contributed by Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor from London, Marie Fazio and Concepción de León from New York, Mike Ives from Hong Kong, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.']",The Category 2 storm passed over the Yucatán Peninsula and was expected to reach the Gulf Coast of the United States by Friday.

‘Rural Surge’ Propels India Toward More Covid-19 Infections Than U.S.,2020-10-08,By Karan Deep Singh and Jeffrey Gettleman,"['MASLI, India — Sliding out of their rickshaw, masks on, fresh sanitizer smeared across their hands, a team of health workers approached one of the mud-walled homes in Masli, a remote village in northeast India surrounded by miles of mountainous rainforest. “Are you Amit Deb?” they asked a lean, shirtless man standing in his yard. Mr. Deb nodded cautiously. Five days earlier, he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Now his family members needed to be tested. They all refused. “We can’t afford to quarantine,” explained Mr. Deb, a shopkeeper. If anyone else in his family was found positive, they would all be ordered to stay inside, which would mean even more weeks of not working, which would push the family closer to running out of food. The medical team moved on to the next house. But they kept meeting more refusals.  The defiance of the coronavirus rules is being reflected across rural India, and it is propelling this nation’s virus caseload toward the No. 1 spot globally. Infections are rippling into every corner of this country of 1.3 billion people. The Indian news media is calling it “The Rural Surge.” In the Indian megacities where the pandemic first hit, vigorous public awareness campaigns have left the populace mostly on guard. But when it comes to government efforts to contain the virus, rural India is resisting. In many villages, no one is wearing masks. There is no social distancing. People are refusing to get tested and they are hiding their sick. Hospitals are straining; in the coronavirus ward of one hospital here in the state of Tripura, insects were left to crawl over corpses, according to photos from a former government official. In recent trips to more than a dozen rural areas spread across several states, from Tamil Nadu in the south to West Bengal in the far east, to Tripura, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the north, the reaction to the pandemic appeared to be completely different from that of the big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Out in the rural areas, many people behave as if there is no coronavirus. Even many police officers who have been empowered to enforce the pandemic rules are not wearing masks. This intransigence has helped India catch up with the United States in terms of total infections. U.S. cases are near 7.6 million, compared with India’s 6.8 million, according to a New York Times database. But India outpaces new American cases by 30,000 or so each day, putting it on a path to potentially surpass the United States in the coming weeks. Many people in Indian villages believe their government is overstating the severity of the pandemic and showing no sensitivity to the economic hardship that they are suffering. Government officials have tried to reassure them that they are containing the virus while striking the best possible balance between protecting lives and livelihoods. The officials say India’s caseload is rising because nearly one million tests are being performed each day, five times the number a few months ago. They also point to India’s relatively low death rate, about an eighth or ninth of those of the United States, Spain, Brazil and Britain. Scientists say this is mainly because India’s population is younger and leaner, though they caution that most deaths in India, from any cause, are not investigated. And India’s deaths are steadily ticking up, by about 1,000 a day, now totaling about 105,000. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “spoken on all available platforms and underlined the need and importance of wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing,” said Manisha Verma, a spokeswoman for India’s health ministry. The government’s focus, she said, has been on changing behavior rather than enforcement. In fact, even as the coronavirus spreads through the rural regions, other parts of India are loosening containment restrictions to help the stricken economy. This month, the central government is allowing movie theaters to open. Schools can soon reopen if state governments agree. Mr. Modi locked down the country this spring, with four hours’ notice, to buy time for India to scale up its production of masks and other protective equipment and to open treatment centers. But the severe lockdown spawned an exodus of millions of migrant laborers who could not afford to stay in urban areas. Their movement to rural communities helped spread the virus to nearly every corner of India. “We are still in the first wave,” said Rajib Acharya, a New Delhi-based research associate at the Population Council, a nonprofit that works on health and development issues. “I don’t see any new strategy for the rural areas,” he added. Rural areas are not well positioned to cope. Nearly two-thirds of all hospital beds in the country are in urban areas, which are home to only one-third of the population. Hospitals around the country are struggling to provide enough oxygen for the rising number of patients. Many people, both in cities and in the countryside, have struggled to find beds for sick family members. “Families in India are living in fear, grief, sadness, depression, anxiety and food insecurity, delaying their care from other health conditions,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. “It is a tragic time.” She attributed the spread of the virus to “habituation, desensitization, fatalism, fatigue, denial.” The remote northeastern state of Tripura, heavily forested and largely rural, is a case study in the virus’s spread. Before mid-June, the state of about four million people had reported a total of fewer than 1,000 infections. Now, the total is 27,545, according to state data. Many experts believe that is a fraction of the true number. The state’s death rate is also steadily increasing, from its first reported death in June to more than 300 deaths now. In Tripura’s small towns and villages, many people are scared to get tested because of the social stigma. Neighbors shout at people believed to be positive to stay indoors and to not even look out the window. During a walk through one neighborhood near Chawmanu, where many of the indigenous Tripuri people grow rice, tea and vegetables for a living, villagers pointed toward a small house with a rusty tin roof. One person inside was sick, they said. Aparna Saha, a woman with a penetrating gaze, opened the door. She acknowledged that her 72-year-old father had tested positive and had breathing problems. But, she was quick to add, in a shrill voice, “He’s absolutely fine.” A few days earlier, health workers had arrived to take Ms. Saha’s father to a coronavirus facility in a neighboring town. Ms. Saha blocked them. “Who knows what they will do to him?” Ms. Saha said. “There’s no corona.” Even the families that have followed the rules and taken loved ones to hospitals say the experience was horrifying. On a muggy September evening, Rupam Bhattacharyajee broke down outside the Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital, Tripura’s only critical care health facility, in the state capital of Agartala. Mr. Bhattacharyajee’s elderly father was inside, sprawled on a mattress on the floor — there were no spare beds — fighting for his life. “I am totally helpless,” Mr. Bhattacharyajee said. A local court is investigating Tripura’s pandemic response, following news reports about conditions at the hospital. A photograph believed to have been taken recently in the hospital’s coronavirus care center, which was shared with The New York Times by Sudip Roy Barman, a former state health minister, showed a dead body with insects crawling on it. Debashish Roy, the hospital’s medical superintendent, declined to comment. After seeing the conditions inside the hospital, Mr. Bhattacharyajee brought his father back home. He paid more than $200 for a private ambulance and made the bumpy six-hour journey sitting in the back, swapping out oxygen cylinders continuously to keep his father breathing. Mr. Bhattacharyajee said that his recovering father is lucky to be alive. “People are dying, one after another,” Mr. Bhattacharyajee said. “Nobody cares.” Karan Deep Singh reported from Masli, India, and Jeffrey Gettleman from New Delhi. Reporting was contributed by Hari Kumar, Sameer Yasir and Shalini Venugopal from New Delhi, and Mrinal Banik from Agartala, India.']","The contagion is hitting towns and villages where resources are scant and people are skeptical of lockdown efforts.

The virus dominates the vice-presidential debate between Pence and Harris.,2020-10-08,"By Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Russell Goldman","['Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday night, with Mr. Pence defending the White House’s record without addressing its fundamental failures, while Ms. Harris accused him and President Trump of presiding over a catastrophic failure in public-health policy. At the end of the debate, Mr. Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, broke policies set by the debate commission and Salt Lake County when she stepped onstage without wearing a face mask, flouting health precautions, as the candidates were joined by their spouses. Ms. Harris’s husband, Douglas Emhoff, wore a face mask. It was unclear whether Ms. Pence removed it in the moments before appearing on television, or had refused to wear it throughout the debate, as Mr. Trump’s family did last week.  The commission updated its protocols for the debate after Mr. Trump and several members of his staff tested positive for the coronavirus in the days after last week’s presidential debate between Mr. Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. For Wednesday’s debate, the commission required “everyone in the debate hall” to wear a mask and submit to testing for the coronavirus, according to an updated fact sheet it released on Monday. The commission also installed plexiglass dividers between Mr. Pence and Ms. Harris. During the debate, as Ms. Harris, the California Democrat, attacked Mr. Trump’s record as the vice president sought to recast the president’s handling of the pandemic and other issues, often in plain defiance of the facts. Ms. Harris opened the debate by calling the White House’s response to the disease “the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country” and saying Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump had “forfeited their right to re-election.”']",
"Putin, Long the Sower of Instability, Is Now Surrounded by It",2020-10-07,By Anton Troianovski,"['YEREVAN, Armenia — In Russia’s self-proclaimed sphere of influence, Russia is losing its influence. Concurrent crises in Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus region have blindsided the Kremlin, leaving it scrambling to shore up Russian interests in former Soviet republics and undermining President Vladimir V. Putin’s image as a master tactician on the world stage. “There is nothing good about these conflicts for Moscow,” Konstantin Zatulin, a senior Russian lawmaker and Putin ally who specializes in relations with what Russians call their “near abroad.” Mr. Putin has spent years building up Russia as a global power, with a hand in hot spots from Latin America to the Middle East, and even meddling in presidential elections in the United States. But after working for years to destabilize the West, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by instability; once seen as sure-handed in foreign affairs, he seems to have lost his touch. In Belarus, Mr. Putin responded to a street uprising in August by propping up the country’s unpopular autocrat, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, turning public opinion against Russia in what had previously been Europe’s most Russia-friendly country. In Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, protesters this week appeared on the verge of toppling President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, less than two weeks after Mr. Putin pledged to him in a rare in-person meeting that “we will do everything to support you as the head of state.” And in the Caucasus, the long-simmering conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted last week into the worst fighting since the 1990s, threatening to undo the balancing act that had allowed Russia to cultivate diverse links to the region. “Russia was doing all it could to maintain ties both with Azerbaijan and Armenia,” Mr. Zatulin said. “Every day of conflict in Karabakh is, effectively, helping zero out Russia’s authority.” The spate of new challenges to Russian influence strikes at the heart of Mr. Putin’s yearslong effort to cast himself as the leader who restored the great-power status that the nation lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even as the Kremlin denied Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election, Russian state television gleefully reported on the American allegations of that interference as a sign that Moscow was being reckoned with again on the world stage. Now, rather than react decisively to emergencies close to home, Mr. Putin sounds ambivalent about Russia’s role. “We hope the conflict will end very soon,” he said of Nagorno-Karabakh, in a television interview broadcast Wednesday. Minutes later, referring to Kyrgyzstan, he said, “We hope that everything will be peaceful.” The confluence of crises in Russia’s own neighborhood is such that some pro-Kremlin commentators are already accusing the West of an organized campaign to sow discord in the post-Soviet regions. More balanced analysts, however, have singled out one constant factor in the growing unrest. Both Russia and its neighbors, they say, have been destabilized by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed distrust in institutions and in out-of-touch leaders across the region. It helped undo the fragile truce between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in Belarus and in Kyrgyzstan, the disease set the stage for public uprisings by exposing the ruling elite as disconnected from people’s suffering. Mr. Lukashenko angered Belarusians by playing down the danger of the virus, joking that vodka would cure it; in Kyrgyzstan, critics blamed officials for using coronavirus aid money to enrich themselves. Within Russia, the economic hardship caused by the pandemic has helped deepen public anger against Mr. Putin. In the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk, for example, thousands of protesters angry over the arrest of a popular governor spilled into the streets last Saturday for the 13th week in a row. Some analysts say that public discontent within Russia means that Mr. Putin needs to turn more of his focus to domestic issues such as economy hardship, pollution and poor health care, rather than delving into global geopolitics. But developments in recent weeks have given Mr. Putin more reason to focus on the latter. “For Putin, practically his entire mission and his vision of Russian greatness and success revolve around his foreign-policy agenda,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research organization focused on politics and policy. The new series of crises, she went on, “will very much distract Putin from domestic problems.” The centrality of the former Soviet lands to Mr. Putin’s foreign policy was evident in the Kremlin’s list of world leaders who called Mr. Putin to wish him a happy birthday on Wednesday, when he turned 68. Of the 12 who called, only three leaders — those of Israel, India and Cuba — head countries outside the former Soviet Union. In Armenia, which hosts a Russian military base, some hope for a more forceful stance by Russia in the conflict, which has already killed at least 250 people, according to official reports. But Russia’s ability to influence events in the Caucasus now appears limited, despite its past role as a mediator in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey, Azerbaijan’s most important ally, has taken on a more assertive regional stance. “Turkey, indeed, in this current situation probably should be considered as a balance to unilateral Russian interference,” said Farid Shafiyev, chairman of the Center of Analysis of International Relations in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. In the Caucasus, he added, “the Russian role is probably diminishing.” Across the former Soviet Union, Russian remains the lingua franca, and the proliferation of mostly uncensored internet access across the region means that protests in one country can easily inspire a disenchanted populace in another. Some protesters in Belarus carried signs supporting the demonstrations in Khabarovsk, over 4,000 miles away. And ahead of Kyrgyzstan’s parliamentary elections last Sunday, government critics were keeping an eye on Belarus, where it was a blatantly falsified election in August that sparked the uprising against Mr. Lukashenko. “In Kyrgyzstan it was often said that we will copy the Belarusians,” said Aybek Sultangaziyev, director of a news agency in Kyrgyzstan, K-News. “In fact, we surpassed the Belarusians in effectiveness and precision.” Mr. Sultangaziyev said that if his country’s uprising succeeds, the new leadership will seek to maintain close ties with Moscow. In Armenia, too, the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan retained its alliance with Russia after the prime minister came to power in a popular uprising in 2018. “We have never been pro-Western or pro-Eastern,” said Ruben Rubinyan, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Armenian Parliament. “Russia has been and is an ally of Armenia, a very important ally.” But, for Moscow, recent events in Belarus offer a cautionary tale that illustrates the fragility of Russia’s standing among its neighbors — carrying echoes of Ukraine’s more violent departure from Russia’s orbit in 2014. Some Belarusians who had been well disposed toward Mr. Putin turned against him after he propped up Mr. Lukashenko in the face of the protests. Mr. Zatulin, the Russian lawmaker, said officials “at the highest levels of the Russian Federation” believed that Mr. Lukashenko would need to step down “sooner or later.” But Mr. Lukashenko had argued to Russian officials, Mr. Zatulin said, that his stepping down in the face of street protests could set a dangerous precedent for what might happen to Mr. Putin himself. “By unconditionally supporting Lukashenko, we are creating an enormous problem for ourselves in the future with the majority or a significant part of the Belarusian population,” Mr. Zatulin said. “We are creating a problem for ourselves with the other Belarusian politicians and public figures, who are increasingly forced to seek sympathy in the West. Russia wants that least of all.” Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.']","Fueled by the pandemic, uprisings in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan and a war in the Caucasus region are undermining the influence of the Russian leader."
A wave of death in Sweden’s nursing homes has exposed holes in a famously generous safety net.,2020-10-08,By Peter S. Goodman and Erik Augustin Palm,"['In the popular imagination, Sweden does not seem like the sort of country prone to accepting the mass death of grandparents to conserve resources in a pandemic. Swedes pay some of the highest taxes on earth in exchange for extensive government services, including state-furnished health care.   Yet among the nearly 6,000 people whose deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in Sweden, 2,694, or more than 45 percent, had been among the country’s most vulnerable citizens — those living in nursing homes.  That tragedy is in part the story of how Sweden has, over decades, gradually yet relentlessly downgraded its famously generous social safety net. Since a financial crisis in the early 1990s, Sweden has slashed taxes and diminished government services. It has handed responsibility for the care of older people — mostly living at home — to strapped municipal governments, while opening up nursing homes to for-profit businesses. They have delivered cost savings by relying on part-time and temporary workers, who typically lack formal training in medicine and elder care.  Sweden has also substantially reduced its hospital capacity over the last two decades. During the worst of the initial outbreak, elderly people in nursing homes were denied access to hospitals for fear of overwhelming them. Some nursing home operators assert that residents have been the victims of the government’s failure to limit the spread of the virus. The country avoided the lockdowns imposed in much of the rest of Europe. Though the government recommended social distancing, it kept schools open along with shops, restaurants and nightclubs. It did not require that people wear masks. “There’s been more society transmission, and it’s been more difficult to hinder it from entering the care homes,” said Joacim Rocklov, an epidemiologist at Umea University. “The most precious time that we lost, our mistake was in the beginning.”']",
How do you lose an ‘S.N.L.’ gig? Ask Morgan Wallen.,2020-10-08,By Dave Itzkoff,"['Morgan Wallen, a country musician who was scheduled to perform on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, won’t be appearing on the show after all, citing its coronavirus protocols. Mr. Wallen made the announcement Wednesday in an Instagram post after he was seen in videos last weekend showing him celebrating in Tuscaloosa after a football victory by the University of Alabama. In these clips, which appeared on TikTok and elsewhere, Mr. Wallen can be seen drinking shots, kissing fans and mingling in groups while not wearing a mask or following other social-distancing guidelines. In the video he posted to Instagram on Wednesday, Mr. Wallen said that he was speaking from a hotel room in New York. “I got a call from the show letting me know that I will no longer be able to play, and that’s because of Covid protocols, which I understand,” Wallen said. “I’m not positive for Covid, but my actions this past weekend were pretty shortsighted and they have obviously affected my long-term goals and my dreams. ” “Saturday Night Live,” which is broadcast from NBC’s headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza, halted its live episodes in March amid the pandemic.

Spain uses emergency powers to lock down Madrid.,2020-10-09,By Raphael Minder,"['Spain’s government on Friday decreed a state of emergency for the Madrid region, overruling Madrid’s own regional politicians, who had applied a limited lockdown on specific neighborhoods to try to stop a second wave of Covid-19. The government decided to use its emergency powers to lock down Madrid after suffering a major legal defeat on Thursday, when Madrid’s top regional court declared illegal its earlier effort to isolate Madrid from the rest of Spain. The intense feuding between the government and the regional administration of Madrid is highlighting the failure of Spain’s politicians to coordinate their response to the coronavirus, amid party polarization and fragmentation. At a cabinet meeting on Friday, the government decided that the state of emergency should come into force immediately, in a bid to stop about 4.8 millions of residents of the Madrid region from leaving for a long weekend, as Monday is a holiday in Spain. Police officers were expected to set up new checkpoints by 3 p.m. Friday. Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the regional health minister of Madrid, said that his administration would “ask every day for the state of emergency to be lifted because the numbers back us,” in insisting that locking down specific neighborhoods was sufficient to rein in the latest wave of Covid-19 in Madrid. The residents of Madrid, he added, “will not understand” the intervention of the central government, given the recent improvement in Madrid’s Covid-19 data. According to the regional government, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospitals of Madrid has fallen to about 2,800 from 3,300 on Sept. 21, when selective lockdowns were introduced. However, Madrid’s lockdown strategy also triggered social tensions, because the restrictions affected mostly poorer areas of Madrid.']",
"Nevada halts use of rapid coronavirus tests in nursing homes, citing inaccuracies.",2020-10-08,By Katherine J. Wu,"['The coronavirus tests kits are small and fast — they produce results in as a little as 15 minutes — and when they were first distributed to nursing homes around the country in August by the federal government, they were welcomed with open arms. At last it seemed, there was a solution to the delays and equipment shortages that had stymied efforts to use laboratory-based tests to curb outbreaks. But now Nevada has ordered its nursing facilities to immediately suspend the use of two of the rapid virus tests after their performance was found to be lacking, according to a directive issued by the state’s department of health. The order was prompted by a spate of false-positive results, in which the tests mistakenly found that healthy people were infected. The state directed that use of the kits be discontinued “until the accuracy of the tests can be further evaluated,” the Nevada document said. The rapid tests are manufactured by two companies: Quidel, and Becton, Dickinson and Company, Representatives for the companies defended their products and said they were conducting investigations into the reports of false positives in Nevada. Lisa Sanders, director of media relations at LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of aging services, said that several nursing homes in other states had been experiencing issues with BD and Quidel’s tests and reporting them to her organization and the American Health Care Association in recent weeks.  In submitting their applications to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency clearance, both BD and Quidel declared that their tests had no false positives. But shortly after the tests were rolled out across the state this summer, nursing homes began to report that people who had been evaluated by both the rapid tests and a slower but highly reliable laboratory test, called P.C.R., were getting conflicting results. Among 39 positive antigen test results from both BD and Quidel, 23 were found by P.C.R. to be negative — an error rate of nearly 60 percent. The results, which were collected from a dozen facilities where thousands of tests had been performed, prompted the state to pivot away from antigen tests like BD’s and Quintel’s to viral RNA tests such as P.C.R., according to the directive. Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, said the findings in Nevada could be emblematic of a larger issue: the use of tests in ways for which they were not designed or validated. Both BD’s and Quidel’s tests received F.D.A. clearance for use “within the first five days of the onset of symptoms.” The instructions that come with BD’s test have noted that “the performance of this test has not been evaluated for use in patients without signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and performance may differ in asymptomatic individuals.” Shannon Litz, a spokeswoman for Nevada’s department of health and human services, said in an email that the agency would be re-evaluating the tests’ performance before resuming their use.']",
"Fire Engulfs South Korea High-Rise, Forcing Hundreds to Evacuate",2020-10-08,By The New York Times,"['A fire broke out at a high-rise apartment building in southeastern South Korea late Thursday, quickly engulfing multiple floors and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people, according to news agency reports and social media posts. At least 80 people were being treated for smoke inhalation from the blaze, at a 33-story building in the city of Ulsan, according to the Yonhap news agency. No deaths were immediately reported. Major fires linked to lax safety standards have plagued South Korea for decades. In April, fire raged through an enormous warehouse in Icheon, southeast of Seoul, becoming an inferno that killed 38 workers. In 2018, a fire at a hospital that also served as a nursing home killed 37. Tragedies to the families, these disasters have also become an embarrassment for President Moon Jae-in, who promised to end the catastrophic fires. In Thursday’s fire, heavy winds in Ulsan fanned the flames, helping it spread from its origin on the middle floors. Yonhap reported that the exterior walls of the building contained insulation that burns quickly, although that could not be independently corroborated. About 40 residents were evacuated from the rooftop, Yonhap reported.']",Dozens were said to have suffered smoke inhalation in Thursday’s blaze.

"In Spain, Madrid’s highest court annuls a federal lockdown.",2020-10-08,By Raphael Minder,"['Madrid’s highest regional court on Thursday annulled a lockdown imposed by Spain’s central government on the capital region in order to contain its Covid-19 infections. In its ruling, the court said that the central government did not have jurisdiction to institute restrictions that affected fundamental rights and the freedom of movement. The ruling is a major setback for the central government, and underlines both the political tensions and legal uncertainty in Spain over how to respond to the latest wave of virus cases. The central government issued a decree imposing new nationwide restrictions last Friday, after a dispute with the regional government of Madrid, which had instead introduced a limited lockdown on about one million residents of some of its worst-affected areas, in mostly working-class neighborhoods. Spain was put under full lockdown last March, under a state of emergency that gave the central government full authority to decide how to handle the virus. But since late June, when the state of emergency was lifted, Spain’s 17 regional administrations have regained control over how to manage their health care. After Thursday’s ruling, Salvador Illa, Spain’s health minister, called on Madrid’s regional government to hold emergency talks over how to resolve the standoff, which comes ahead of a long holiday weekend in Spain. Mr. Illa said it was essential to have judicial decisions that “best protect health.” The central government’s decree had meant that about 4.8 million residents of the Madrid region were forbidden to travel to another part of Spain, unless for work or other exceptional reasons.']",
Prince William Announces New Prize Aimed at ‘Repairing’ the Planet,2020-10-08,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Prince William on Thursday announced the establishment of an environmental prize worth 50 million pounds, or $65 million, that will reward climate change solutions over the next 10 years, saying it was an effort to “turn the current pessimism surrounding environmental issues into optimism.” Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist behind dozens of documentaries chronicling the planet’s biodiversity, has joined a council overseeing the prize and helped promote its launch through promotional videos and joint interviews with Prince William. Prince William said the “Earthshot Prize” was inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s launch in 1961 of a decade-long research program, “Moonshot,” to send the first person to the moon. It will comprise five awards of £1 million each for each of the next 10 years, centered on “earthshots,” or goals — fixing the climate, cleaning the air, protecting and restoring nature, reviving oceans, and tackling waste. “We have to have a decade of change, a decade of repairing the planet so we can hand it on to the next generation and future generations,” Prince William said, adding that he didn’t want to “let down” his children by not acting. “They don’t want to inherit a world that is full of doom and gloom,” he said. The prize joins a long list of distinctions aimed at rewarding initiatives to tackle climate change. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, promised to donate $500 million last year to close every coal-fired power plant in the United States. Prince William launched the prize through the Royal Foundation, which supports charitable initiatives engaged in by him and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. It will be supported by a network of donors that include the Aga Khan Development Network, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the Jack Ma Foundation, among others.  The Royal Foundation declined to offer additional information on the amount offered by each donor funding the prize, and did not say whether the British royal family would be donating any of its own money to the award.  In addition to Mr. Attenborough, other high-profile figures have also joined the prize council, including Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief, the actress Cate Blanchett, the Brazilian soccer star Dani Alves and the Colombian singer Shakira. The prize comes amid growing concerns over climate change worldwide. Droughts have intensified in regions like the Middle East and Africa, and many areas keep registering their hottest months on record — September was just the latest example. Wildfires and heat waves are expected to increase, and rising sea levels are set to affect hundreds of millions across the world as experts predict that by 2050, the Arctic’s ice could melt entirely in the summer. Scientists have also predicted that global warming could trigger the greatest wave of global migration the world has seen, and warned that it might be too late to reverse the course of climate change. Prince William said that although the planet was at a tipping point, he hoped that the prize would encourage innovators to find solutions quickly. “If we don’t get our act together in the next 10 years, by 2030, it’s too late,” he said. In an interview with the BBC announcing the launch of the prize, Prince William said it was time for him to campaign for the environment the way his father, Prince Charles, has long done. “I’ve always listened to and learned and believed in what he was saying,” Prince William said about his father’s longstanding commitment to environmental causes such as organic farming and finding alternatives to plastics. The inaugural recipients of the prize will be announced next year in London, and could include individuals or groups of people, businesses, cities and countries, the Royal Foundation said. Mr. Attenborough told the BBC that he hoped that there would be many applications for the prize, even those with “crackpot ideas.” In a tweet, he called it “the most prestigious environment prize in history.” In a similar spirit to the “Moonshot” program, Prince William said the prize would reward “simple but ambitious goals for our planet which, if achieved by 2030, will improve life for us all, for generations to come.” Experts say that tackling climate change requires changing people’s behaviors, and most important, galvanizing political will. “We found over £190 billion worth to fix and help the recovery through Covid,” Prince William told the BBC about the British government’s spending on the pandemic, as he announced the creation of the prize. “We can do the same for the environment. It really isn’t that difficult.”']",The goal is to award 50 projects more than $1 million each over the next 10 years for coming up with innovative solutions to address climate change and other environmental issues.
"As Virus Surges in Europe, Resistance to New Restrictions Also Grows",2020-10-09,By Marc Santora and Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — France has placed cities on “maximum alert” and ordered many to close all bars, gyms and sports centers on Saturday. Italy and Poland have made masks compulsory in public. The Czech Republic has declared a state of emergency, and German officials fear new outbreaks could soon grow beyond the control of their vaunted testing and tracing. Across Europe and beyond, Covid-19 has come roaring back, and, as happened last spring, officials are invoking restrictions to try and suppress it. But this time is different. Still reeling from the economic, emotional and physical toll of nationwide lockdowns that brought the Continent to a virtual standstill, government officials are finding that the public might not be so compliant the second time around. In some places new restrictions are accepted, albeit grudgingly, because the alternative — new nationwide lockdowns — would only be worse. But there is widening skepticism that the public would even go along with such a drastic step. Instead, as exhaustion and frustration with pandemic restrictions sets in, governments are trying to thread a narrowing course between keeping the virus in check and what their publics and economies will tolerate. That is especially so in democracies, where governments are ultimately answerable to the voters. “It is going to be a lot more difficult this time,” said Cornelia Betsch, Heisenberg-Professor of Health Communication at Erfurt University, in Germany, citing “pandemic fatigue.” As the crisis deepens, the once-solid consensus in many countries to join in sacrifices to combat the virus is showing signs of fracturing. New rules are challenged in courts. National and local leaders are sparring. In Spain, the government on Friday decreed a state of emergency in the Madrid area. The step was taken over the heads of the highest regional court and objecting local politicians, and within hours the nation’s main opposition leader called on the prime minister to appear in Parliament to justify it. The intense feuding in Spain reflects a broader political resistance confronting national leaders worldwide. Business groups are issuing dire warnings that whole industries could collapse if restrictions go too far. Sporadic protests, usually though not always, limited to a political fringe, have broken out. Public skepticism is fueled in many countries by the failure of governments to fulfill grand promises on measures like contact tracing, testing and other measures. In perhaps the most telling indication that people are either confused or done listening to guidance, cases continue to explode, including in places where new measures have already been promulgated. Portugal ordered new restrictions last month, but on Thursday recorded more than 1,000 daily infections for the first time since April. In the northern England, where new rules have come and gone and come again, the most tangible result has been sowing confusion, not slowing contagion. Officials are now warning that hospitals could face a greater flood of patients than at the height of the pandemic in April. The World Health Organization on Thursday announced a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases. Europe, as a region, is now reporting more cases than India, Brazil or the United States.  The pitfall of imposing stricter new measures has already been witnessed in Israel, the only country to order a second nationwide lockdown. It has led to chaos and rampant protests. “People view the decisions as political, and not health-based,” said Ishay Hadas, a protest organizer in Israel, arguing that masked outdoor gatherings carried minimal risk. “The main problem is the lack of public trust.” While issues around mask wearing and other prudent measures remain far less politicized in Europe, especially compared to America, the prospect of a winter under tight restrictions or even lockdowns is stirring new frustration and dividing political parties. With Britain expected to announce even more sweeping measures on Monday, many focused on curbs to drinking and carousing, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer has challenged the government to produce any scientific evidence showing that the early pub closings help slow transmission. Even people responsible for advising the British government cannot keep up and are at a loss to explain some of the measures. “People are very confused,” said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University of College London. Mr. West is a subcommittee member of SAGE, a scientific body advising the government on policy. “I couldn’t put my hand on my heart and say I know what the rules are,” he said. In part of the eurozone region that the W.H.O. team has studied in detail, about half the population is experiencing pandemic fatigue, Ms. Betsch said. These people were searching for less information about the virus, less concerned about the risks and less willing to follow recommended behaviors.  Slowing the spread of the virus, which thrives on human contact, still depends on individuals changing their behavior. “The only other option is to lock us up again,” said Francesca Del Gaudio, 24, as she and a friend, wearing masks like nearly everyone around them, walked through Rome’s Piazza Trilussa on Thursday, the first day of Italy’s expanded measures. “And we do not want that.” But if people choose not to listen to guidance, it remains to be seen if steep punishments will chasten them. Violators in Italy now face a 1,000-euro fine. Surveys in countries across Europe reviewed by the health officials show that a clear majority of people are willing to comply with regulations if they are well explained and easy to follow. People may also be more willing to submit to new restrictions if they see hospitals fill and death tolls rise, Ms. Betsch said. But Europe’s regulatory landscape is shifting so quickly that governments risk undermining basic guidance in their contortions to avoid further lockdowns Some steps have seemed simply nonsensical. In Spain, restaurants in Madrid were ordered to stop serving after 10 p.m., and to close by 11 p.m. — when many people are just considering sitting down to eat. “Everybody knows that we dine in Spain much later than in other countries, so not being able to stay open until midnight is pure economic nonsense,” said Florentino Pérez del Barsa, a Madrid restaurateur, who no longer professionally uses his legal name, Florentino Pérez Rato, to avoid confusion with the head of the Real Madrid soccer club. While public attention often focuses on those who shout the loudest — like the thousands who protested recently outside the Reichstag in Berlin and in London’s Trafalgar Square, calling the pandemic a hoax and a government-driven plot — they represent only about 10 percent of the public, according to a study from Germany. About 20 percent of people are against regulations, presumably for personal, emotional and financial reasons. But Ms. Betsch, who has been working with the W.H.O. research group, said the larger concern is roughly half the population — the “fence-sitters.” They are open to regulations but need to be listened to and educated, she said, and new government policies that are fragmented only compound the frustration. The choices facing national governments are onerous. The French government, watching anxiously as hospital beds fill up, extended its maximum-alert ‘‘red zone’’ to many major metropolitan areas including Lyon, Grenoble, Lille and Saint-Etienne in addition to Paris, Marseille and Aix-en-Provence. Residents of Toulouse protested on Friday, fearing their city would be included. Xavier Lencou, an engineering student queuing for a coronavirus test near Les Halles, in central Paris, said that more people around him were respecting measures like mask-wearing, unlike in the spring. But he worried stricter measures would push people past their limit. “If we have a new lockdown it might be worse, because people wouldn’t respect it.” he said. Jérôme Fourquet, a political analyst at France’s IFOP polling institute, said that managing the economy and epidemic was like “squaring the circle,” even more so now that “our maneuvering room is not at all what it was last March.” He said France’s government now has less to spend to prop up businesses and people are less accepting of any new restrictions. For Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, too, fears that a second lockdown would doom the fragile economic recovery have led to increasing pushback from citizens and companies. Ms. Merkel said this week that she does not “want a situation like the one in spring to repeat itself” — meaning another lockdown — and warned on Friday that the next 10 days would be critical. But the country’s mass-circulation Bild newspaper reflected the feelings of many Germans in its lead editorial on Friday, warning that a lockdown would lead to “mass unemployment, bankruptcies and never-ending strains on families and children.” “It is not a case of what Merkel wants, however — she MUST, together with the states and towns and cities, prevent a second lockdown!” the Bild editors warned. “In a free country the majority cannot be made to pay for the behavior of a few idiots.” In Germany, like in other countries, the focus is on changing the behavior of young people. “Isn’t it worth it to be a bit patient now?” Ms. Merkel beseeched them. “Everything will return — partying, going out, fun without corona rules. But right now, something else matters most, being mindful of one another and sticking together.” But public patience, in Germany and elsewhere, is precisely what is waning. It is important to follow rules like mask-wearing and hand washing, said June Nossin, 32, a Belgian-born therapist sitting at the terrace of a Parisian cafe. But there was a limit to what people could take. “If everything is banned,’’ she said, ‘‘people are going to go crazy.” Reporting was contributed by Raphael Minder from Spain, Christopher Schuetze and Melissa Eddy from Berlin, Adam Nossiter, Aurelien Breeden and Antonella Francini from France, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, and Elizabeth Povoledo and Emma Bubola from Italy.']",Public health officials say “pandemic fatigue” presents a real challenge to countries trying to enforce new measures meant to slow the virus while avoiding national lockdowns.
"Brazil surpasses 5 million virus cases, even as the pace of confirmed infections slows.",2020-10-08,By Manuela Andreoni,"['Seven months after its first case of the coronavirus, Brazil on Wednesday passed the five million mark. The milestone comes as the spread of the virus has been slowing down for over a month, an achievement many public health experts believe has little to do with the Brazilian government’s handling of the crisis, but rather how thoroughly the virus has ravaged the country. Nearly 150,000 people have died from the virus in Brazil. As the virus eased its grip on the country’s biggest cities, like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, life started to go back to normal, with restaurants and parks reopening. Almost half of Brazilian states have authorized schools to reopen, albeit with many restrictions. Meanwhile, concerns of a second wave of the virus are still heightened. In the city of Manaus, in the state of Amazonas, one of the most severely hit by the virus, the number of cases started to go up again, especially among young people, in recent weeks. But deaths haven’t shot up again, and government statistics show the city’s hospitals are coping well with demand. The path to recovery, however, is still unclear. Unemployment numbers reached a record during the pandemic, with almost 14 million Brazilians looking for jobs, and capital flight more than doubled as foreign investors sought safer havens. But the Brazilian government did send over 60 million citizens emergency cash transfers that many believe helped propel President Jair Bolsonaro’s popularity, despite his questionable handling of the pandemic. To retain his popularity, now at almost 40 percent according to recent polls, an all-time high for him, the president and his allies have struggled to come up with a social program that would write at least part of the popular emergency relief into law. But the efforts have spooked investors, who fear the country won’t honor its debts as it faces the consequence of a GDP contraction of 5.8 percent this year. Even as it praised the Brazilian government for avoiding a deeper economic downturn by helping its poor earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund said the country’s economy faces “exceptionally high” risks. In other developments around the world: The European Union signed a deal with Gilead, the California-based pharmaceutical company, to ensure uninterrupted access to an antiviral drug being used to treat Covid-19. Veklury, also known as remdesivir, has been authorized by more than 50 countries, including the United States and in Europe, for the treatment of Covid-19 patients needing supplemental oxygen. The deal signed between Gilead and the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, would allow all members of the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and several Balkan countries to buy up to 500,000 treatment courses in the next six months.  Poland will make face masks mandatory in public spaces starting Saturday in response to a second day of record-high case numbers, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced on Thursday. “The second wave has reached us, and we need to face it in a decisive way,” Mr. Morawiecki said. The new rule will not apply in forests, parks and beaches. Poland had implemented a lockdown early in the pandemic, but loosened restrictions over the summer, and bars and restaurants remain open. An Italian bishop, Giovanni D’Alise, has died of Covid-19. Bishop D’Alise, 72, died Tuesday in Caserta, a city about 20 miles north of Naples.']",
Britain is said to be weighing the tightening of restrictions in hard-hit parts of the country.,2020-10-08,By Anna Schaverien,"['The British government is considering a tiered system that would tighten restrictions on pubs and restaurants in the areas of England with the highest rates of infection, according to the BBC and other media outlets. A ban on overnight stays away from home could also be introduced for the worst-affected areas, but schools would remain open. Despite local lockdowns in several cities in the north of England, the country’s coronavirus caseload has continued to increase, with Britain reporting an average of 13,000 new cases a day over the past week. Cities in the north of England, where infection rates are the highest, would likely be targeted by these new restrictions. But the mayors of Liverpool and Manchester said on Twitter that they had not been consulted about any plans.']",
"Hidden Beneath the Ocean’s Surface, Nearly 16 Million Tons of Microplastic",2020-10-07,By Tiffany May,"['Plastic waste has long been a visible — and growing — problem in oceans around the world, with refuse littering the shorelines of once-pristine beaches, stretching out across a wide expanse of sea in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and threatening sea life that ingest it. A new report offers a glimpse of the scale of microplastics building up on the ocean floor. In what researchers called the first such global estimate, Australia’s national science agency says that 9.25 million to 15.87 million tons of microplastics — fragments measuring between five millimeters and one micrometer — are embedded on the sea floor. That is far more than on the ocean’s surface, and it’s the equivalent of 18 to 24 shopping bags full of small plastic fragments for every foot of coastline on every continent except for Antarctica. It is an issue that activists have long warned about even as the fight to clean up the ocean has focused largely on the eradication of single-use plastic products like shopping bags. The findings were published on Monday in a new study by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or C.S.I.R.O. “It really points to the ubiquity of the problem. It is really everywhere all the time and increasing,” Britta Denise Hardesty, a principal scientist for C.S.I.R.O. and an author of the study, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Microplastics are not confined to the ocean. They are also found in air particles and can be spread by wind. A variety of microplastics was even detected in the human gut. Scientists believe that 4.4 million to 8.8 million tons of plastic enter the sea every year. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a gyre of refuse between California and Hawaii that is estimated to be more than twice the size of Texas, carries over 87,000 tons of trash. In recent years, hundreds of plastic objects have been found in the bellies of dead whales around the world. While cities have banned plastic bags and straws, the use of disposable plastic packaging has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic as consumers grow more concerned about hygiene and contamination. Over time, some plastics break down into smaller pieces and sink into the ocean. More buoyant types of plastic do not sink by themselves and either wash up on beaches or end up in deepwater. Microbes and mussel colonies growing on floating plastic often cause the entire mass to sink from the added weight. Dr. Hardesty said that microplastics could be ingested by smaller plankton and fish on the seabed. Once eaten by fish, the microplastics can end up in the human food chain.  The aim of the study, Dr. Hardesty said, was to put a scale to the problem. She described it as the first such accounting. Using a robotic submarine, the scientists collected 51 deepwater samples of sand and sediment in the Great Australian Bight in 2017, hundreds of miles from the shore, and determined the global estimate based on the average number and size of the particles. The study found zero plastic particles in some deep-ocean sediment, but up to 13.6 particles per gram in others, a figure up to 25 times larger than what had been found in earlier deep-sea studies of microplastics. The scientists said they made conservative estimates to take into account the full range of samples. They also eliminated fibers or other materials from their count to rule out the potential contamination of the samples. Dr. Hardesty said that it was important to prevent plastic from ending up in the ocean in the first place. She said she was hopeful that awareness about the pollution would lead to more sustainable policies and shifts in behavior. “Most of what ends up in oceans are in people’s hand,” she said. “They can see that their behavior — their actions and purchasing power — is very powerful and that can result in change.”']",New research shows that the amount of fragments embedded in the sea floor is far more than the plastic floating on the ocean’s surface.
Golden Dawn Found Guilty of Running Criminal Organization in Greece,2020-10-07,By Niki Kitsantonis and Iliana Magra,"['ATHENS — In a landmark verdict in Greece’s highest-profile political trial in decades, an Athens court on Wednesday found the neo-fascist party Golden Dawn guilty of running a criminal organization as it rose to prominence during the country’s financial crisis, systematically targeting migrants and left-wing critics. The ruling came more than five years after the trial began in a makeshift courtroom in Greece’s largest high-security prison near Athens, and as at the beginning of the trial, none of the party officials were in the courtroom where the verdict was announced. But thousands of Greek citizens had gathered outside the court on Wednesday, waving banners reading, “They are not innocent,” “Nazis out” and “Life terms to the murderers,” as some 2,000 police officers patrolled the area and helicopters and drones circled above. The three-judge criminal court tied the party to a string of attacks including the fatal stabbing in 2013 of a left-wing rapper, Pavlos Fyssas. The party member who stabbed Mr. Fyssas, Giorgos Roupakias, was found guilty of murder on Wednesday.  Another five Golden Dawn supporters or members were found guilty of attempted murder over assaults on three Egyptian fishermen in 2012, while four were found guilty of causing bodily harm over assaults on members of Greece’s Communist Party trade union in 2013. “Today is an important day for democracy,” the country’s president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, said. “Today’s decision is a confirmation of the fact that democracy and its institutions are always capable of fending off any attempt to undermine them.” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the ruling brought an end to “a traumatic cycle in the country’s public life.” “After the ballot box, the Nazi entity was also condemned in court,” he said, referring to Golden Dawn’s failure to re-enter Greece’s Parliament last year. “Democracy won today.” Formed in the 1980s by a former Greek army commando, the Golden Dawn party was catapulted from obscurity to become Greece’s third largest political party at the peak of the country’s financial crisis in 2012, tapping into public discontent against austerity and a growing influx of immigrants. During its time in Greek Parliament from 2012 to 2019, the party maintained public support by casting itself as patriotic and fighting the system from within, but it retained links with neo-fascist parties in other European countries and the United States. A spate of violent attacks in 2013, culminating in the fatal stabbing of Mr. Fyssas, precipitated the party’s unraveling. A few days after the killing, police arrested the entire party leadership as a judicial investigation began into suspicions that Golden Dawn had conducted criminal activities under its military-style leadership. The trial eventually began in April 2015 with a 3,000-page case file, 69 defendants — one has since died — and 120 witnesses for the prosecution. Although Golden Dawn’s legislators avoided appearing in court whenever possible, the proceedings took their toll on the party’s appeal. Once at the forefront of Greek politics, Golden Dawn failed to win re-election to Greek Parliament last year. But despite the party’s fall, the threat of neo-Nazism in Greece has not receded. Former members of Parliament including Ilias Kasidiaris, Golden Dawn’s one-time spokesman, have formed their own parties espousing similar views. And less extreme right-wing parties have also sprung up in the party’s wake, including the nationalist Greek Solution. Golden Dawn, for its part, has systematically denied any direct link to the attacks and has described the trial and charges brought against the party’s leadership as “politically motivated” and a “conspiracy.” “All supporters await an acquittal tomorrow, a decision that will trigger an even more vociferous nationalist campaign to reclaim our country,” the party said in a statement released on the eve of the trial. The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Monday that a guilty verdict would boost efforts to crack down on hate crimes. “The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,” said Nils Muiznieks, Europe director at Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.” When the news of the guilty verdict was announced, the thousands outside the court erupted in cheers that echoed out from the avenue and the surrounding balconies overlooking the court. The Greek Police said two people were detained after scuffles broke out between protesters and police officers shortly before the verdict was issued. A group of around 600 people broke off from the crowd of about 20,000 people, and lobbed some 150 firebombs and stones at officers, a police statement said, adding that 10 police vehicles were vandalized by protesters trying to gain access to the court building. The police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd, the statement said. Speaking before the decision, Elena Karvouni, 68, who was among those gathered, said that it was important for her to be at the court, despite the pandemic. Some wore masks and gloves and some were attempting to maintain social distance in the crowd. “As a mother and as a citizen of this country that has fought with blood against fascism, it wasn’t possible that I wouldn’t be here,” she said. Elena Kritikou, 50, said that the throngs of young people crowing Alexandras Avenue in Athens and the area outside the court made her feel exhilarated. “I feel like there is hope for a better tomorrow,” she said. While waiting for the verdict, people chanted antifascist slogans — “Pavlos lives, crush the Nazis,” and “No acquittal for the Nazis” — while the Italian resistance song “Bella Ciao” played in the background. “It is my duty to be here,” said Giannis, a 19-year-old computing student who did not want to give his last name. “I didn’t know Pavlos Fyssas personally but someone else could have also been in his place, it could have been me.” “We don’t tolerate groups like Golden Dawn — it needs to be condemned,” he added.']","The court tied the far-right party to a string of attacks, including the fatal stabbing of a left-wing rapper."
"Australia, Tell Us the Places in the World You Love the Most",2020-10-09,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. Some days, I wake up longing for Slovenia. My obsession is somewhat odd, seeing as I never had any particular ambition to visit Slovenia. When I found myself there, as part of a work project, I knew barely anything about the country and came and went within a span of less than 24 hours. But, man, did that 24 hours make an impression. I rented a car at the Ljubljana airport and drove over pointy green mountians into the Soča Valley. Tiny ancient villages clung to steep hillsides, old stone and lush grass and tiny purple and yellow flowers covering everything. I had to keep pulling over to gape in wonder at the outrageous countryside. At my first glimpse of the Soča river, I laughed in delight. Known as “the emerald river,” it is a startling blue/green color, like nothing I’d ever seen before. Slovenia was like the alpine fairyland of my childhood imagination, and I had never even been aware of its existence, outside of knowing the country’s name and approximate location.

Battle Over Mink Fur Almost Brings Down the Polish Government,2020-10-07,By Marc Santora,"['KASZEWSKA WOLA, Poland — When the European Union condemned Poland’s government for demonizing gays and lesbians, the country’s governing coalition defiantly stood together. When state media was accused of spreading hate speech that fueled violence, the governing parties brushed off concerns. And when protests erupted against efforts to control the judicial system, they pressed ahead regardless. Then came the minks. Proposed legislation that would ban the farming of minks, semiaquatic mammals prized for their fur, and put in place a range of protections for other animals, opened deep divisions in the coalition that almost brought down the government. It took the intervention of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the dominant Law and Justice Party, to quell the uprising for now by taking on a formal role that allowed him to act as a buffer between opposing factions. The bill, which gained momentum after a documentary aired on Polish television showing minks living in deplorable conditions on one farm, has widespread public support and the leaders of the country’s foremost opposition party support the legislation. But the conservative governing coalition is divided over the issue, waging increasingly furious internal battles at a time when the nation is consumed with the coronavirus. All that has raised questions about the long-term viability of the government. In the face of those concerns, Mr. Kaczynski, the most powerful politician in Poland and the architect of the government’s agenda, stepped in Tuesday to be sworn in as deputy prime minister after five years of ruling from behind the scenes. Apart from separating feuding coalition partners, one of his main tasks will be trying to grow public support for the Law and Justice Party, whose candidate for president, Andrzej Duda, only managed a narrow election victory in July. It will be a difficult challenge since Mr. Kaczynski has been the driving force behind efforts by his party to marginalize the L.G.B.T. community, a campaign that has turned off many young voters. And his government has spent years at war with the European Union, despite broad support in Poland for membership in the bloc, especially among the generation born after the end of communist rule in 1989. The government also has a dismal record on environmental issues — from logging in the country’s ancient forests to failing to curb a reliance on coal. But in championing animal rights, Mr. Kaczynski sees an opportunity. “This is a pivotal moment for the party,” said Wojciech Przybylski, the editor in chief of Visegrad Insight, a policy journal focused on Central Europe. Mr. Kaczynski, he said, knows he needs to expand his political base to include younger, more moderate voters by sending “a message of concern about nature and animals.” The issue also seems personal for Mr. Kaczynski, who has long been known for his affection for animals. When his beloved cat, Alik, died, it was national news. The 71-year-old, who shuns nearly all requests for interviews outside of supportive media outlets, even went on TikTok to post a video promoting the #StopFurChallenge. Since coming to power in 2015, Mr. Kaczynski has rarely been challenged. But observers say the division within the coalition over the law reflects a much more profound split between factions that want to take control over the country’s conservative movement. While Mr. Kaczynski’s Law and Justice Party has long been the dominant force in the United Right coalition, it depends on the support of two junior conservative partners to stay in power: the Agreement and United Poland parties. United Poland is led by the country’s powerful justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, who has made no secret of his desire to become the leader of the country’s conservative movement. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki sees himself as the heir apparent. Mr. Kaczynski’s emergence as deputy prime minister was partly aimed at keeping the two men apart. Mr. Morawiecki quickly aligned himself with Mr. Kaczynski on the animal issue, posting his own video on TikTok supporting a ban on fur. Mr. Ziobro opposes the legislation and, until Mr. Kaczynski’s intervention, his party was threatening to withdraw from the coalition over it, a move that would have erased the government’s parliamentary majority. Mr. Ziobro’s opposition to the ban on mink farming reflects the industry’s deep roots in Poland. The country is home to the largest mink farms left in Europe and the third largest in the world. The bill, which is still being debated, calls for the fur farms to be closed in a year. The law would also end the use of wild animals in circuses, restrict the tethering of dogs on chains — a common practice in the countryside — and restrict the ritual slaughter of animals for meat. The bill has been loudly condemned by politicians from the far right, which has made greater inroads into politics during the five years of rule by the Law and Justice Party. Mr. Kaczynski has often used more extreme factions to push certain messages, and build his party’s power base. The far right was critical in directing public outrage at migrants, helping the Law and Justice Party rise to power in 2015. More recently, as the party cast “L.G.B.T. ideology” as a threat to the nation, ultraconservatives have been driving the messaging. Now Mr. Kaczynski risks losing some of that support. Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, a conservative cleric who has strong connections to Law and Justice and controls a vast media empire, used his Radio Maryja station to attack the legislation. “They feel pity now over these little furs,” Father Rydzyk said recently, adding that the government should be focused on things like further limiting abortion rights. “Let’s not animalize man and humanize animals.” The bill is also opposed by the meat industry, which says its export business to markets with halal and kosher requirements would be badly hit. Jacek Zarzycki, president of the Polish Association of Beef Cattle Breeders and Producers, said that if the bill were passed, his members could lose 30 percent of their income. “We cannot afford that; we will lose the best export markets for Polish beef, which is the export star of Polish agriculture,” he told TVN24.  But it is the minks that have drawn the most attention. And it has turned Szczepan Wojcik, who along with his four brothers controls the vast majority of the mink farms in the country, into a national figure. “I’m the most attacked person in Poland,” he said in an interview at one of his farms some 60 miles outside of Warsaw. He sees the attacks as part of a broader cultural war in Poland. “The people who started the debate in Poland about animal rights, banning the use of animals by man, for example, for furs, are exactly the same people who promote L.G.B.T., same-sex marriage, abortion, euthanasia and so on,” he said. While he has supported Law and Justice in the past, he said his thinking was now more in line with the more conservative groups led by Mr. Ziobro and Father Rydzyk. Recent polls indicate overwhelming support for the ban, however. Much of that is a result of the documentary co-produced by the animal rights organization Open Cages, showing gruesome footage of minks attacking each other, gnawing off limbs of other caged animals and even feasting on their remains. “Poles don’t want fur farms,” said Bogna Witkowska, one of the group’s leaders. Mr. Wojcik said the footage in the documentary was manipulated, adding that it was in his interest to keep animals well cared for since the condition of their fur determined their value. In an average year, 6.5 million minks are slaughtered in Poland, putting it just behind China and Denmark in terms of fur production. Walking past rows of cages filled with minks scheduled to be slaughtered in a few weeks, he said he saw nothing wrong with his trade. “People should take care of animals, but in the end it’s the animals who should serve people, not the other way round,” he said.

"A top health official in Germany warns, ‘It is possible that the virus spreads uncontrolled.’",2020-10-08,By Christopher F.

Speaking at the same news conference on Thursday, Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said the authorities were still in control of the virus and called on Germans to be more vigilant in following restrictions. “It’s up to all of us whether we make it,” he said, comparing the challenge of beating back the virus to a “test of character for society.”']",
Azerbaijan and Armenia Agree to Cease-Fire in Nagorno-Karabakh,2020-10-09,By Andrew E. Kramer and Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Azerbaijan and Armenia negotiated a limited cease-fire early Saturday after almost two weeks of fierce fighting over a disputed province, with the goal of pausing combat long enough to collect bodies from the battlefield and to exchange prisoners. The Russian-brokered agreement, which takes effect at noon on Saturday, was short on specifics. The issue of the how the cease-fire would play out on the front lines was left to the sides to agree to in “additional” talks. The four-point agreement said the warring parties would halt hostilities on “humanitarian” grounds for the prisoner exchange and to retrieve bodies under criteria established by the Red Cross. It was not clear if the Red Cross would oversee the process. Under the terms of the deal, Azerbaijan and Armenia committed again to negotiate for a lasting peace in the Minsk Process, a long-drawn-out diplomatic effort at a settlement that hasn’t prevented earlier escalations in fighting. Even before the announcement, the prospects for a broader peace deal appeared dim after the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said in a televised speech Friday that he was happy to have talks but was making no concessions. “We are winning and will get our territory back and ensure our territorial integrity,” Mr. Aliyev said. “Let them abandon our territory in peace.” The conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, flared late last month and has threatened to spiral into a wider war drawing in Russia; Turkey, a NATO member; and possibly Iran. “Ours is a tiny country, hardly visible on the map, but it could be the start of gigantic war,” Irina Grigoryan, a teacher of Russian literature who fled Nagorno-Karabakh a week ago, said in a telephone interview on Friday. The Russian Foreign Ministry initiated the talks after President Vladimir V. Putin warned this week that Russia could be forced to uphold its mutual defense pact with Armenia if the fighting spread. People fleeing the fighting on Friday described the violence as more intense than what took place during the yearslong war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the early 1990s that killed some 20,000 people and displaced about a million, mostly Azerbaijanis. Over the past two weeks, many in Nagorno-Karabakh fled to basements and shelters. Rafik Arakelyan, 69, and his wife drove their car into the woods and stayed there for six days, venturing home only occasionally for food. “It’s very brutal now — more so than then,” said Maria Ayrian, a 39-year-old knitting teacher who was injured by shrapnel as a girl during the earlier war. No drones, she noted, were deployed in the earlier conflict. The fighting on the front line this time has been so heavy that soldiers were not able to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades. “It feels like one day of this war is approximately equal to three months of the first Karabakh war,” said Tatul Hakobyan, an Armenian journalist who has covered the region for more than 30 years and spent much of the past two weeks in Nagorno-Karabakh. “I did not expect that there would be such a full-scale war.” Soldiers have been fighting in trenches along the front over small bits of territory, backed up by far more destructive weaponry than what they had available in decades past. Russia sells weapons to both countries, and Israel is a major supplier of drones and other sophisticated weapons to Azerbaijan. Armenia said on Friday that 376 of its soldiers had died in the fighting. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its losses. The United Nations estimated that as of Thursday, 58 civilians had been killed, including children, while apartment buildings, schools and other civilian structures had been destroyed. The Red Cross said that it had made an emergency delivery of body bags to Nagorno-Karabakh and was “looking at upgrading forensic capacities across the region.” Ms. Grigoryan, the Russian literature teacher, had fled with five grandchildren for the safety of Yerevan, the Armenian capital. Afterward, she said, an apartment where some of the children lived was bombed. “Can’t they stop the war, at least for a day or two?” she said. “Any negotiation is better than war.”  The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh has simmered for decades in a remote mountain region of little geostrategic importance, after a war in the early 1990s ended in a cease-fire but no wider settlement. That changed when Turkey, which has been flexing its muscles regionally in recent months, openly backed Azerbaijan, its ethnic Turkic ally, in an escalation that began on Sept. 27. Mr. Putin this week said that Russia would honor its defense agreement with Armenia if the fighting spilled onto Armenian territory, raising the prospect of Russian intervention. The fighting carried on Friday even as the Azerbaijani, Armenian and Russian foreign ministers opened the talks in Moscow. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry said that the two armies exchanged artillery fire across the front line overnight Thursday and into Friday, and that populated areas on its territory were hit. Rocket artillery on Thursday hit the roof of the Holy Savior Cathedral, a cherished 19th-century Armenian cathedral in the hilltop town of Shusha, partially destroying it. The cathedral was also partially destroyed in the Nagorno-Karabakh war in the early 1990s and subsequently restored. Azerbaijani state news media reported shelling in two districts on Friday. The country’s prosecutor general said that since the fighting started last month, 31 civilians had been killed and 178 wounded by artillery fire. The United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights on Friday had called on the militaries to halt the use of cluster munitions, which scatter small bombs over a wide area and are particularly lethal to civilians. The fighting also risked spreading the coronavirus, its statement noted. But Nagorno-Karabakh residents who had fled the fighting and crammed into hotels in the Armenian city of Goris, just outside the enclave, on Friday said they saw the coronavirus as a relatively minor concern. Reflecting the energy that has gripped both Armenia and Azerbaijan, volunteers staffed an aid distribution center providing apples, jugs of sunflower oil, cartons of wet wipes and bags of the Caucasian flatbread known as lavash to soldiers and the displaced. “We don’t want war,” said Sona Arzumanyan, a 20-year-old graphic designer who was overseeing the volunteers. “But if there is war, we will serve until the last drop of blood.” Mr. Arakelyan, who hid from the shelling for nearly a week in the woods in his car, narrowly escaped when the vehicle caught fire because of a mechanical issue. Eventually, Armenian journalists gave him and his wife a ride to Goris. On Friday, he was huddled in front of the flat-screen television in the crowded lobby restaurant of his hotel, where he and other Nagorno-Karabakh residents had received free room and board. He had lost his left leg because of a bullet wound in the final days of the 1990s war. Nearby, Ms. Ayrian, the knitting teacher, and several female relatives were knitting clothing for Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers out of rigid local wool. Their adult sons, brothers and husbands had stayed behind. “We have been fighting for 30 years,” Mr. Arakelyan said. “But there were never this many wounded and dead.” Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow, and Anton Troianovski from Goris, Armenia.']","The warring sides have reached a temporary truce, brokered by Moscow, allowing for an exchange of prisoners and collecting the dead, Russia’s foreign minister said."
Berlin Trial Opens for Man Charged With Murder on Behalf of Russia,2020-10-07,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The trial opened on Wednesday for a Russian man accused of murdering a former Chechen field commander in a Berlin park last year, allegedly at the behest of the Russian state. The killing, which occurred in August 2019 in a park just over a mile away from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office, occurred amid increasingly bold provocations from Russia. German investigators blame Moscow for a 2015 cyberattack on Parliament and for a disinformation campaign on German-language Russian news media targeting Berlin’s policy on refugees the following year. This August, the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny arrived in Berlin for treatment after being poisoned with what German experts found to be a military-grade chemical substance. These events have led to a hardening of Germany’s traditionally open stance toward Moscow. In the indictment over the Berlin murder, federal prosecutors charged that the “state agencies of the central government of the Russian Federation ordered the accused to liquidate” the victim, a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who was said to be an opponent of the Russian state. Germany’s federal prosecutors have identified the accused Russian man, who followed the trial through a Russian interpreter, as Vadim N. Krasikov, 55, although his lawyer read a statement from the defendant naming him as Vadim A. Sokolov, 50. The latter name matches the information in a passport found on him when he was arrested on Aug. 23, but German investigators have said they believe the name is an alias. “I will refer to you as ‘the defendant,’” Judge Olaf Arnoldi said as the trial opened, acknowledging the confusion over the man’s identity. Moscow has denied any link between the killing and “official Russia.” But Germans officials say that the Russian authorities have refused to cooperate in the investigation, despite several formal requests. A guilty verdict for Mr. Sokolov would mean a sentence of life in prison. But it could have even larger implications for German-Russian relations, as Ms. Merkel’s government would be under increased pressure to react, given the brazenness of the killing and the opportunity to send a clear message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. A ruling is not expected until next year. The trial opened one day after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed the findings of experts in Germany that the substance used to poison Mr. Navalny had “similar structural characteristics” to the Novichok family of highly potent nerve agents. The German government said in a statement on Tuesday that the European Union and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons would discuss their next steps in the coming days. Weeks after the murder, Ms. Merkel’s government expelled two Russian diplomats, and Moscow retaliated with a tit-for-tat move. Since then, no further action has been taken, but Ms. Merkel’s tone has grown harsher. In May, she stood before the German Parliament and called Russia out. “There is a strategy from Russia that we must take into account — we cannot simply ignore it: the strategy of hybrid warfare, which includes cyberwarfare and distortion of the facts,” she told lawmakers. “This is not just somehow a random product, but it is definitely a strategy that is being applied.” It is a far cry from the more pro-Russian stance shaped by her junior coalition partners in government, the Social Democrats. “Of course, we retain the right to take action against Russia,” Ms. Merkel told Parliament. The killing on Aug. 23, 2019, shocked Berlin. The victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen separatist commander, had been living in Germany since December 2016, when he applied for asylum after arriving.

E.U. Members to Adopt Travel Guidelines as Coronavirus Spreads,2020-10-09,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — European Union countries are expected to adopt guidelines next week aimed at coordinating their varying coronavirus travel measures, according to E.U. officials and diplomats involved in the talks. But the effort will stop well short of a harmonization of rules, as countries try to keep control over how they tackle a resurgence of the disease. The guidelines are intended to make travel restrictions, such as quarantine and testing rules, smoother and more predictable within the bloc. It would be a first step at restoring one of the union’s main tenets: the free movement of people within its territory. Representatives from the European Union’s 27 members, together with officials from the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, have discussed for weeks how to use shared criteria in judging regional responses to the coronavirus. Central to that would be the adoption of a single map using colors to denote the scale of outbreaks around the bloc, green at the low end of risk, orange in the middle and red at the high end. Other measures include unifying how quarantines and testing are done to smooth travel between E.U. countries and ensuring ample warning when national travel advisories are about to change to ensure travelers don’t get stranded. Travel in the bloc, the world’s most integrated group of countries, has become increasingly difficult and complicated amid the pandemic. Each country has its own assessment of the situation in other states, its own rules on travel measures, and ever-changing testing and quarantine demands. “Citizens have been severely affected by the travel restrictions imposed throughout the European Union,” Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, said in a statement. “I now urge all E.U. ministers to agree quickly on a coordinated and simple approach including: an EU-wide map, common criteria, and clear information on a weekly basis.” Under the guidelines expected to be approved Tuesday by E.U. ministers, members will adopt a regional map drafted by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, rather than produce 27 individual ones. Effectively, that will matter only when it comes to green zones, or regions within E.U. countries that pose low risk to travelers, officials said. National authorities will still to be free to make their own determinations on orange and red zones, based on advice from their own experts, the E.U. officials said. The text, which was reviewed by the Times, lays out criteria on how a region should be color-coded, focusing on thresholds for new cases per 100,000 people, as well as positive test results as a percentage of total tests. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control gathers much of this data from national agencies. And while E.U. countries will agree to give 48 hours warning before changing travel restrictions in response to worsening Covid-19 conditions — for example, imposing additional quarantine or testing requirements — they will not harmonize requirements for travelers. For example, a traveler from Belgium, which is considered a red zone across the bloc because of a very high level of infections, faces different restrictions if visiting Germany than if visiting Greece. That will continue to be the case after the proposal is adopted. The bloc will remain largely closed to nonessential travelers from the United States as well as most of the rest of the world. Officials said that the short list of nations from which travelers are allowed to enter the European Union, which now includes Canada and New Zealand, could be revisited this month. But they added that it was virtually certain that travelers from the United States would not be added at this stage because of how poorly the country is containing the pandemic. But new cases have also been surging across the European Union, and few regions in the bloc will actually be labeled green under the new set of criteria. In France, the number of daily cases rose to over 18,000 this week, triggering severe restrictions on public gatherings in a handful of regions. As cases in Belgium surge, bars and cafes have been shuttered in Brussels. And in Spain, which currently has one of the worst new coronavirus caseloads in the European Union, the government is considering putting the Madrid region under a state of emergency in response to a spike in cases. E.U. institutions have found it difficult to persuade individual governments to take a common approach, leading to a cacophony of measures that are harming the flow of people for work or family purposes, and compounding severe losses in the tourism and transportation sectors. Health and related policies are fully sovereign for countries in the bloc. The union does not have a legal basis on which to force policies onto its members, as it does on matters such as monetary affairs or competition. And in drafting national Covid-19 travel measures, E.U. members have in some cases taken into account factors unrelated to health, such as maintaining relations with their neighbors and staying open to large tourism markets. Hungary, for example, said in September that it would shut itself off to travel from all E.U. countries apart from its political allies, known as the Visegrad countries, namely Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland, without the decision being justified by health criteria. E.U. officials called the move a contravention of the principles of free movement of people and nondiscrimination within the bloc. Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.']",But the bloc’s 27 countries will remain largely autonomous in their approach under recommendations that are expected to be approved next week.
QAnon Is Thriving in Germany. The Extreme Right Is Delighted.,2020-10-11,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Early in the pandemic, as thousands of American troops began NATO maneuvers in Germany, Attila Hildmann did a quick YouTube search to see what it was all about. He quickly came across videos posted by German followers of QAnon. In their telling, this was no NATO exercise. It was a covert operation by President Trump to liberate Germany from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government — something they applauded. “The Q movement said these are troops that will free the German people from Merkel,” said Mr. Hildmann, a vegan celebrity cook who had not heard of QAnon before last spring. “I very much hope that Q is real.” In the United States, QAnon has already evolved from a fringe internet subculture into a mass movement veering into the mainstream. But the pandemic is supercharging conspiracy theories far beyond American shores, and QAnon is metastasizing in Europe as well. Groups have sprung up from the Netherlands to the Balkans. In Britain, QAnon-themed protests under the banner of “Save Our Children” have taken place in more than 20 cities and towns, attracting a more female and less right-wing demographic. But it is in Germany that QAnon seems to have made the deepest inroads. With what is regarded as the largest following — an estimated 200,000 people — in the non-English-speaking world, it has quickly built audiences on YouTube, Facebook and the Telegram messenger app. People wave Q flags during protests against coronavirus measures. And in Germany, like in the United States, far-right activists were the first to latch on, making QAnon an unexpected and volatile new political element when the authorities were already struggling to root out extremist networks. “There is a very big overlap,”  said Josef Holnburger, a data scientist who has been tracking QAnon in Germany. “Far-right influencers and groups were the first ones to aggressively push QAnon.” Officials are baffled that a seemingly wacky conspiracy theory about Mr. Trump taking on a “deep state” of Satanists and pedophiles has resonated in Germany. Polls show that trust in Ms. Merkel’s government is high, while the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has been struggling. “I was astonished that QAnon is gaining such momentum here,” said Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker in Ms. Merkel’s conservative party and member of the intelligence oversight committee. “It seemed like such an American thing. But it’s falling on fertile ground.” The mythology and language QAnon uses — from claims of ritual child murder to revenge fantasies against liberal elites — conjure ancient anti-Semitic tropes and putsch fantasies that have long animated Germany’s far-right fringe. Now those groups are seeking to harness the theory’s viral popularity to reach a wider audience. QAnon is drawing an ideologically incoherent mixture of vaccine opponents, fringe thinkers and ordinary citizens who say the threat of the pandemic is overstated and government restrictions unwarranted. Not everyone who now aligns with QAnon believes everything the group espouses, or endorses violence. Until a few months ago, Mr. Hildmann was popularly known merely for his restaurant and cookbooks and as a guest on television cooking shows. But with 80,000 followers on Telegram, he has since become one of QAnon’s most important amplifiers in Germany. He is a noisy regular at coronavirus protests, which drew more than 40,000 people in Berlin this summer, to bridle against what he considers to be a fake pandemic concocted by the “deep state” to strip away liberties. He calls Ms. Merkel a “Zionist Jew” and vents against the “new world order” and the Rothschild banking family. He no longer recognizes Germany’s postwar democratic order and darkly predicts civil war. During a recent interview at his vegan restaurant in an upmarket neighborhood of Berlin, admirer after admirer — a civil servant, a mail carrier, a geography student — approached to thank him, not for his food, but for raising awareness about QAnon. Experts worry that activists like Mr. Hildmann are providing a new and seemingly more acceptable conduit for far-right ideas. “QAnon doesn’t openly fly the colors of fascism, it sells it as secret code,” said Stephan Kramer, head of domestic intelligence in the eastern state of Thuringia. “This gives it an access point to broader German society, where everyone thinks of themselves as immune to Nazism because of history.” “It’s very dangerous,” Mr. Kramer added. “It’s something that has jumped from the virtual world into the real world. And if the U.S. is anything to go by, it’s going to gain speed.” The QAnon conspiracy theory emerged in the United States in 2017, when a pseudonymous online poster claiming to hold the highest U.S. security clearance — Q — began dropping cryptic messages on the message board 4Chan. Global elites were kidnapping children and keeping them in underground prisons to extract a life-prolonging substance from their blood, Q hinted. A “storm” was coming, followed by a “great awakening.” For historians and far-right extremism experts, QAnon is both a very new and a very old phenomenon. Made in modern America, it has powerful echoes of the European anti-Semitism of centuries past, which was at the root of the worst violence the continent has known. The idea of a bloodsucking, rootless elite that abuses and even eats children is reminiscent of medieval propaganda about Jews drinking the blood of Christian babies, said Miro Dittrich, a far-right extremism expert at the Berlin-based Amadeu Antonio Foundation. “It’s the 21-century version of blood libel,” Mr. Dittrich said. “The idea of a global conspiracy of elites is deeply anti-Semitic. ‘Globalists’ is code for Jews.” The ignition switch for QAnon’s spread in Germany was “Defender-Europe 2020,” a large-scale NATO exercise, said Mr. Holnburger, the political scientist. When it was scaled back this spring because of the coronavirus, QAnon followers contended that Ms. Merkel had used a “fake pandemic” to scupper a secret liberation plan. Then one far-right movement, known as the Reichsbürger, or citizens of the Reich, jumped onto the QAnon traffic online to give greater visibility to its own conspiracy theory. The Reichsbürger, estimated by the government to have about 19,000 followers, believe that Germany’s postwar republic is not a sovereign country but a corporation set up by the allies after World War II. The QAnon conspiracies dovetailed with their own and offered the prospect of an army led by Mr. Trump restoring the German Reich. On March 5, the elements of the two movements fused into a  common Facebook group, followed a week later by a Telegram channel. “That’s when QAnon Germany first started taking off,” Mr. Holnburger said. Two weeks later, in the middle of the lockdown, the German pop star Xavier Naidoo, a former judge on Germany’s equivalent of “American Idol,” joined a QAnon group and posted a tearful YouTube video in which he told his followers about children being liberated from underground prisons. A far-right influencer, Oliver Janich, reposted it to his tens of thousands of Telegram followers. Since then, the biggest German-language QAnon channel on Telegram, Qlobal Change, has quadrupled its followers to 123,000. On YouTube, it has more than 18 million views. Overall, the number of followers of QAnon-related accounts on all platforms has risen to more than 200,000, estimates Mr. Dittrich of the Amadeu-Antonio Foundation. On Tuesday, Facebook said it would remove any group, page or Instagram account that openly identified with QAnon. In the country of the Holocaust, promoting Nazi propaganda or inciting hatred is punishable by up to five years in jail, and two years ago the government passed strict legislation designed to enforce its laws online. But conspiracy theories and lies are not illegal unless they veer into hate speech and extremist content, and officials admit they have found QAnon’s spread hard to police. Some QAnon followers are well-known extremists, like Marko Gross, a former police sniper and the leader of a far-right group that hoarded weapons and ammunition. “Trump is fighting the deep state,” he told The New York Times in June. Merkel is part of the deep state, he said. “The deep state is global.” But many are people who in the early days of the pandemic had nothing in common with the far right, Mr. Dittrich pointed out. “You could see it in real time in the Telegram channels,” he said. “Those who started in April with worries about the lockdown became more and more radicalized.” These days you see it on the streets of Germany, too. Michael Ballweg, a Stuttgart-based software entrepreneur who founded Querdenken-711, the organization that has been at the center of protests against coronavirus restrictions, recently started referencing QAnon.  An eastern youth chapter of the AfD has used “WWG1WGA,” an abbreviation for Q’s motto “Where we go one, we go all,” on its Facebook pages. Even those on the far right who do not buy into the conspiracy theory have found it useful. Compact, a magazine classified as extremist by the domestic intelligence agency, has dedicated its last three issues to QAnon, pedophile scandals and the Reichsbürger movement. In August, it had a giant Q on its cover — and had to be reprinted because of high demand. Jürgen Elsässer, its editor in chief, was at the last big coronavirus protest in Berlin handing out Q stickers and Q flags. He does not believe in a conspiracy of pedophile elites, preferring to look at it as “allegories.” “Q is a completely novel attempt to structure political opposition in the era of social media,” Mr. Elsässer said in an interview.  After the pandemic, “the far right will reconstitute itself differently,” Mr. Elsässer said. “Q could play a role in this. It’s about elites, not foreigners. That casts the web more widely.” Asked about the dangers of QAnon, the federal domestic intelligence service replied with an emailed statement saying that  “such conspiracy theories can develop into a danger when anti-Semitic violence or violence against political officials is legitimized with a threat from the ‘deep state.’” The biggest risk, say experts like Mr. Dittrich and Mr. Holnburger, may come when the promised salvation fails to arrive. “Q always says: ‘Trust the plan. You have to wait. Trump’s people will take care of it,’” Mr. Holnburger said. “If Trump does not invade Germany, then some might say, ‘Let’s take the plan in our own hands.’” Mr. Hildmann already has some doubts. “It’s possible that Q is just a psyop of the C.I.A.,” he said. “In the end, there are no external powers that you can rely on,” Mr. Hildmann said. “Either you deal with it yourself or you don’t bother.” Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']","As the U.S. conspiracy theory goes global, it has found fertile ground in the putsch fantasies and anti-Semitic tropes long popular on Germany’s far-right fringe.

Militants in Mali Free 4 Hostages After Government Releases Prisoners,2020-10-09,By Ruth Maclean and Elian Peltier,"['DAKAR — Four hostages held by armed insurgents in Mali were freed on Thursday, days after the country’s newly-formed government released around 200 prisoners, including some suspected of being jihadists. The four hostages released included Soumaïla Cissé, a prominent Malian politician, Sophie Pétronin, a French aid worker who had been held for almost four years, and two Italians: Pierluigi Maccalli, a priest abducted in neighboring Niger in 2018, and Nicola Chiacchio, who was kidnapped last year during a solo bicycle trip. The government, which took power in September following a military coup, announced the releases Thursday evening. It said they had been secured thanks to the efforts of the country’s intelligence services, the armed forces, Mali’s partners and a special crisis unit led by a former prime minister, but it did not provide details of the conditions under which the hostages were released. The government’s release of prisoners last weekend had led to speculation in Mali that a deal to free the hostages had been struck. The freeing of the hostages was greeted with joy in Mali. Mr. Cissé, a 70-year-old former opposition leader who ran for president three times, had been kidnapped by armed men in March as he was campaigning for legislative elections. The releases were also welcomed in France, where Ms. Pétronin’s case has been closely followed. President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a statement that he was “immensely relieved” to learn that Ms. Pétronin, 75, had been freed after the Malian authorities announced that the hostages were en route to the country’s capital, Bamako. “The president of the Republic especially thanks the Malian authorities for this release,” a statement issued by the French presidency said. “He assures them of France’s entire will to support Mali in the fight it is waging with perseverance against terrorism.” The French authorities said they were unaware of whether a ransom had been paid for the hostages, and gave few other details about the operation. “It is the Malian authorities who have entirely handled this situation and this liberation,” Gabriel Attal, the French government’s spokesman, told the broadcaster France 2. “I have no information regarding compensation that would have been provided for this release.” Over 5,000 French soldiers are deployed in the Sahel region to fight Islamist insurgent groups. Last year, two French soldiers were killed in a raid in Burkina Faso that freed four hostages, two of them French. In Italy, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio welcomed the “good news” of the release. “Father Pier Luigi Maccalli and Nicola Chiacchio are finally free and well,” Mr. Di Maio said in a tweet. The Malian authorities said the four hostages had been held by Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, or the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, a coalition of Al-Qaeda-aligned groups in Mali. Mr. Cissé received a hero’s welcome at home in Badalabougou, a Bamako neighborhood, where he stood out of the sunroof of a car, waving at a crowd of supporters blowing vuvuzelas and waving cellphones. “I spent six months under conditions that, as you know very well, were extremely difficult, in almost total isolation,” Mr. Cissé told Malian television. “But I must admit that I never experienced any violence, physical or verbal.” Mr. Cissé’s release had been a key demand of protests against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta that escalated over the summer, before he was overthrown in the military coup. Ms. Pétronin, who ran a charity for malnourished children in Mali, narrowly escaped a first kidnapping in the eastern city of Gao in 2012 and fled the country, but returned soon after. She was then kidnapped in Gao on Dec. 24, 2016, and had been held ever since. Ms. Pétronin returned to France on Friday and was welcomed by Mr. Macron. “Deep down, I was certain that I would come back,” Ms. Pétronin told the French radio station RFI after she landed in Bamako on Thursday and was greeted with a hug by her son, Sébastien Chadaud-Pétronin. “I never gave up,” she said. Ms. Pétronin said that after spending some time in France, she would go back to Mali at some point. “I’m going to come back to see what’s going on here,” she said, looking frail but in good spirits. Standing next to her, her son sounded more cautious. “We have to be reasonable,” Mr. Chadaud-Pétronin said. “You won’t go wherever you want to.” Ruth Maclean reported from Dakar and Elian Peltier from London. Constant Méheut contributed reporting from Paris and Cheick Amadou Diouara from Bamako, Mali.']","The freed hostages included Sophie Pétronin, 75, a French aid worker held for nearly four years, and Soumaïla Cissé, 70, a former opposition leader."
Indian Police Accuse Popular TV Station of Ratings Fraud,2020-10-09,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Hari Kumar and Shalini Venugopal Bhagat","['NEW DELHI — Ever since it hit the airwaves three years ago, Republic TV has been one of India’s most-watched, most-talked-about and most-contentious television news channels. Its lead anchor, Arnab Goswami, has made a name for himself shouting down opponents, embracing right-wing causes and aggressively backing up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-leaning administration. In turn, Republic TV’s ratings have soared. But this week, police officials in Mumbai accused Republic TV and two smaller channels of rigging the ratings system by paying poor people the equivalent of a few dollars a month to tune into the station and leave their televisions on. In some cases, police officials said, people being bribed to watch the English-language channel did not speak English and were annoyed to tie up their television sets with programming that they couldn’t even understand. Those viewership levels are not just a source of pride: They are also a major factor in a station’s ad revenue, therefore fueling its continuing ability to shape the public discourse. Republic TV’s dominance has emerged at a time when many Indian journalists say that their freedoms have been eroded under Mr. Modi’s government and that he has tried to manipulate the country’s news media, especially the airwaves, like no other prime minister in decades. Mr. Goswami, a co-founder of the channel, has strongly denied the accusations of bribery, saying that he was being targeted because of recent coverage that was critical of the Mumbai police. He seems to thrive on confrontation and has used this moment to rally his millions of viewers. “Come to my house, come to my office, if you have the guts,” he taunted the police on Thursday night. “Come and arrest me!” He called Mumbai’s police chief, Param Bir Singh, “a spineless man” and “a pliable tool.” The news that Republic TV had fallen under investigation struck like an earthquake among the country’s media elite. Mr. Goswami is one of India’s best-known darlings on the political right, and throughout Friday, other news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of the investigation. A free press has played a crucial role in protecting India’s democracy since the country’s independence from Britain in 1947. But under Mr. Modi, liberal media outlets have been repeatedly targeted by senior government officials, who have berated editors, cut off advertising and ordered tax investigations. At the same time, right-leaning media organizations like Republic TV, which some refer to as the Fox News of India, are often given preferential treatment. In Mumbai, the tables are somewhat turned. The state government is controlled not by Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party but by an alliance of parties, including the Indian National Congress, that are rivals to Mr. Modi. So even though Mr. Goswami is a friend to the central government, in Mumbai he plays the role of the opposition, hammering state officials and wearing down interviewees in a barrage of loud invective. He recently unleashed a tirade against the Mumbai police, accusing them of bungling an investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, a popular actor who died in June, apparently by suicide. Media commentators said that it was difficult to determine exactly what was behind the bribery accusations, and that the ratings system had been flawed for years. Sevanti Ninan, a media columnist in New Delhi, said that if Republic TV did tamper with its ratings, it would indicate that their sensational coverage is less of a draw. “It would show that their so-called success is not a reflection of the success of their journalism,” she said. There is also suspicion, especially in the Modi camp, that the police are going after Mr. Goswami because of his political views. “Targeting of the media by #Congress and its allies is against all principles of democracy and is unacceptable,” Mr. Modi’s broadcast minister, Prakash Javadekar, wrote on Twitter. Ms. Ninan said, “Seeing that the investigation has barely begun, the alacrity with which the Mumbai police called a press conference certainly raises questions, especially given the way Republic TV has been attacking the Mumbai police on their channel for the past few months.” To determine television viewership in India, certain households are selected to have a meter attached to their television to monitor which channels they watch. These findings are then aggregated to gauge various channels’ popularity, which can make or break them: The more viewers a channel can draw, the more money it can demand for commercials. The most recent ratings showed Republic TV as the No. 1 English-language news channel. Its Hindi version attracted an even bigger audience — approximately 40 times as many viewers. Police officials said that a former employee of a research company hired by the Broadcast Audience Research Council, India’s ratings agency, admitted to having paid households to keep their sets tuned to Republic TV for a specific period each day. “We have interrogated such customers who were approached and manipulated,” Mr. Singh, Mumbai’s police chief, said in a news conference on Thursday. “They admitted that they were paid money to operate that particular channel.” Police officials said they were investigating “suspicious trends” from two other smaller channels, Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema. One of the police documents also mentioned another channel, India Today, though the police later said they had no solid evidence against it. The charges under investigation include breach of trust, cheating and conspiracy. Police officials said they had arrested four people and were preparing to interrogate executives of Republic TV. Mr. Goswami’s position: Bring it on. “If you have the guts, Param Bir Singh,” he said in his taunt directed at the police chief on Thursday, “face me in an interview.”']",Republic TV has torn down critics and bolstered the Indian government. Now it is under a criminal investigation.
World Food Program Awarded Nobel Peace Prize for Work During Pandemic,2020-10-09,By Megan Specia and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['The World Food Program was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its efforts to combat a surge in global hunger amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has swept around the world with devastating impact.  The Nobel committee said that work by the organization, a United Nations agency, to address hunger had laid the foundations for peace in nations ravaged by war. “In the face of the pandemic, the World Food Program has demonstrated an impressive ability to intensify its efforts,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said as she announced the prize in Oslo. “The combination of violent conflict and the pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the number of people living on the brink of starvation,” she added. In many nations, particularly those at war, the combination of conflict and the pandemic has sharply increased the number of people on the brink of starvation. As the global fallout from the pandemic began this spring, the World Food Program estimated that the number of people experiencing life-threatening levels of food insecurity could more than double this year, to 265 million. The World Food Program — the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security internationally — last year provided assistance to nearly 100 million people in 88 countries.  The Nobel committee’s recognition of a United Nations agency comes as the United States under President Trump has very publicly pulled back support for the global organization.  Since he took office in 2017, the United States has withdrawn from several United Nations bodies and slashed funding for others, although World Food Program contributions have increased. Mr. Trump has contended that the United States is shouldering an outsized financial responsibility for the global body as compared with other countries. In the spring, Mr. Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency that has been coordinating the global response to the pandemic.  The World Food Program, established in 1961 after a proposal by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, has been a major behind-the-scenes player helping people affected by some of the world’s most devastating humanitarian disasters, including famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s, wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Several United Nations and World Food Program leaders mentioned in their responses to the Nobel Peace Prize that the program depended on voluntary funding to be able to carry out its work.  The organization has long faced problems funding some of its largest operations, such as in South Sudan, where seasonal rains and conflict have disrupted food availability for as long as the program has existed. Most recently, it began a campaign to fund its Yemen operations, where a yearslong conflict has led to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “The world is in danger of experiencing a hunger crisis of inconceivable proportions if the World Food Program and other food assistance organizations do not receive the financial support they have requested,” the Nobel committee said.  The Nobel Peace Prize comes with a cash award of 10 million Swedish kroners, about $1.1 million. Yet the agency has met with criticism that its food sourcing methods hamper already weak local food markets. The organization buys most supplies on the global market, and development experts have criticized it for offering contracts to major donors — like the United States — in what has come to be known as “tied aid,” or the practice of tying humanitarian donations to purchasing contracts. In response, it has pledged to eventually 10 percent of its supplies from smaller local farms. Its employees have at times also been accused by investigators, journalists and local groups of malpractice, such as stealing and selling food that is meant to be distributed for free. In a major operation in Uganda last year where the organization tried to feed thousands of refugees, four died and hundreds became sick, leading to internal investigations.  The program’s workers also risk their lives to carry out the program’s mission, however, and several lost their lives — sacrifices that António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, noted after the award was announced.  “The women and men of the W.F.P. brave danger and distance to deliver lifesaving sustenance to those devastated by conflict, to people suffering because of disaster, to children and families uncertain about their next meal,” he said in a statement on Friday.  Mr. Guterres also said there was “a hunger in our world for international cooperation,” noting that the program relies on contributions from U.N. member states and the public. One of the program’s key messages is that, in most cases hunger is the result of human actions rather than nature’s whims. Yemen is a case in point: Food exists, but hyperinflation and conflict make it practically unavailable to those who need it most, including children. In a telephone interview, David Beasley, the program’s executive director, said the prize had turned an important spotlight on the millions who go hungry around the world and on the devastating consequences of conflict. “It’s the first time in my life I’m speechless,” he said, adding that it was both wonderful and bad news to receive, because it highlighted not only the work being done, but also the depth of the need for it.  Mr. Beasley said it was an “indictment of humanity” that anyone could want for food “in a time when there is so much wealth in the world.”  “It’s a call to action,” he said of the prize. “The world is suffering more than in any time period, and we literally will be facing famines of biblical proportions if we don’t act.”  Elisabetta Povoledo and Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting.']",The Nobel committee said the U.N. agency’s work to address hunger had laid the foundations for peace in nations ravaged by war.
A Famed Horror Director Mines Japan’s Real-Life Atrocities,2020-10-10,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — The director Kiyoshi Kurosawa is best known for horror movies depicting the dark undercurrents of life in modern Japan and the vengeful ghosts that haunt it. But the evil spirits lurking in the background of his latest film are a real-life horror from the country’s past — the Imperial Army’s testing of biological and chemical weapons on human subjects in Manchuria before and during World War II. The movie, “Wife of a Spy,” garnered Mr. Kurosawa the award for best director at the Venice Film Festival last month. When the film is released in Japan this month, it is likely to cause a stir in the country, where wartime atrocities remain the subject of intense controversy and are seldom seen on the big screen. Winning a top prize at an international film festival is a major victory for Japan, which has invested heavily in promoting its culture industry through its Cool Japan program. But Mr. Kurosawa’s honor may prove awkward; the nation portrayed in “Wife of a Spy” is one that Japan’s vocal right wing, including members of the government’s upper echelons, would rather be forgotten, and have worked to erase. Japanese missions abroad routinely criticize depictions of the Imperial Army’s wartime brothel system, where women were often forced into sexual slavery. In Tokyo, black vans often prowl the streets spouting propaganda that rewrites the country’s role in the war. And publishers churn out books disputing the most basic facts about atrocities. No matter their ideological lens, Japan’s war movies have largely ignored the victims of Japan’s imperialism. The right fetishizes the country’s martial spirit and quiet endurance, while the left tends to deplore the suffering of soldiers in the field and civilians at home. In a recent interview, Mr. Kurosawa, 65 — no relation to the famed director Akira Kurosawa — said he found it hard to understand why Japan’s war crimes remained almost taboo among the country’s filmmakers 75 years after the conflict’s end. Other countries make “lots of movies that skillfully talk about the war without ignoring the awful events that occurred,” he said, in a rented Tokyo office space where harried assistants wrangled TV crews and photographers. “Wife of a Spy,” he added, is “absolutely not a film that is attempting to brew up controversy or intended to be something scandalous, but you can’t make a movie that tries to make history disappear.” Mr. Kurosawa was drawn to the war era, he said, because it made an ideal palette for exploring the tension between the needs of individuals and the demands of society. That is a frequent theme in his films, in which characters often find themselves at the mercy of social pressures they can neither understand nor control. “In modern times, there is a conflict, a sort of rivalry between society and the individual, but at least on the surface there’s a freedom to do as you like,” he said. But in the war era, the demands to conform “take a shape you can clearly see. You can’t do this. You must do that. You have to wear these kinds of clothes, have this kind of hairstyle.” In “Wife of a Spy,” that conflict takes shape in a twisty period drama that owes more to the thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock than to Mr. Kurosawa’s own horror oeuvre. The movie, which begins in the lead-up to the war, tells the story of a Japanese woman’s efforts to help her merchant husband expose the military’s human experiments after he stumbles on them during a business trip to China. Thousands of victims, primarily Chinese — euphemistically described as “logs” — died in the ghastly research efforts into bioweapons by the Army’s Unit 731. Some were deliberately infected with pathogens like plague and then vivisected without anesthetic to study the results. After the war, the United States helped cover up the research in part because it wanted the data. Mr. Kurosawa’s film leaves most of that horror offscreen. Evidence of the atrocities is limited to a short speech, a pair of medical files and a brief reel of footage showing smiling Japanese doctors presiding over inhuman scenes reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. As in real life, the efforts are never exposed while they are still underway. The couple’s attempts at exposure are opposed at every turn by a ruthless officer in Japan’s secret military police. But their presence is felt in a deeper narrative that threads through the plot’s twists and turns, one that speaks to the costs to the nation’s soul of hiding its horrors. Part of the attraction of setting the movie during the war, Mr. Kurosawa said, was the challenge of making a film where the audience already knows the ending: Japan defeated and in flames. The movie’s conclusion will seem familiar to fans of Mr. Kurosawa’s works, which often finish in apocalypse. For the director, however, that destruction does not necessarily signal the end of the world, so much as the beginning of a new one. Faced with a scene of chaos and destruction more hellish than anything portrayed in Mr. Kurosawa’s horror films, the heroine sees a country cleansed by fire and declares it “a beautiful thing.” The success of “Wife of a Spy” in Venice has earned Mr. Kurosawa, who is well respected in Japan but by no means a household name, a new measure of fame. His start in the movie business offered little hint of what lay ahead. His first film, made in 1983, was soft-core porn called “Kandagawa Pervert Wars.” For years, he pieced together a living with television commercials and magazine writing, making movies on the side. In the 1990s, at the age of 40, he began churning out direct-to-video movies. By the end of the decade, he had built a reputation as a workmanlike director specializing in the kinds of pictures that are not often taken seriously in places like Cannes. Still, his artistry gained acclaim. In the late ’90s, he won international attention with his movie “Cure,” a chillingly bleak detective story about a series of gruesome murders that spread through Tokyo like a virus. The film was praised for its brooding atmospherics and unsettling sound design, now considered trademarks of Mr. Kurosawa’s style. In 2001, he debuted at Cannes with “Pulse,” an uncannily prescient story about a world driven insane by vengeful ghosts that haunt the internet. An American remake followed in 2006. In the years since, Mr. Kurosawa has largely turned away from the horror genre, winning recognition at Cannes for his work on the 2008 family drama “Tokyo Sonata” and on “Journey to the Shore,” a ghostly love story released in 2015. But “Wife of a Spy,” which has yet to secure an American distributor, can be seen as a sort of prequel to Mr. Kurosawa’s horror films, many of which are set in a decaying Tokyo, where the ghosts of past sins exert a spectral, corrupting influence on the present. He first began to seriously consider exploring the war era while working on “Retribution,” a 2006 horror film examining how the spirit of repressed tragedy animates modern violence. Although the movie is set in contemporary Tokyo, Mr. Kurosawa said he could not escape the feeling that the story “at its root was really about the war.” As entertainment, the project “failed on many levels,” he said, but it led to an epiphany. “If I wanted to write about the war, its effects, I couldn’t force it into a modern setting, I had to put the era in its era,” he said. Mr. Kurosawa’s fans see his films as laden with meaning. But at heart he views himself as an entertainer, not an auteur. His true ambition is to make an American-style blockbuster, something with the kind of stratospheric budget that is rarely afforded to Japanese filmmakers. He wishes he could make a movie that just allows the audience to “enjoy themselves, to cry and laugh,” he said. But “things are never that simple.” When you make a drama about “certain realities,” he said, “the social and political aspects that have always existed in the period, its people, its events inevitably appear.” He added, “You can’t make something that hides that.”']","Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s latest movie, which recently won him the award for best director at the Venice Film Festival, is a thriller animated by the ghosts of Japan’s ghastly wartime experiments."
A Convicted Kidnapper Is Chosen to Lead Government of Kyrgyzstan,2020-10-10,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — A man who had been convicted of kidnapping was chosen to be the prime minister of Kyrgyzstan on Saturday after feuding politicians agreed on a new government in an effort to end nearly a week of violent turmoil in the Central Asian country. An agreement to put the government under the man, Sadyr Japarov, who was sprung from jail this past week by anti-government protesters, should help calm street violence. But it stirred alarm in some quarters that criminal elements had prevailed in a power struggle set off by disputed parliamentary election results last Sunday. Russia, struggling with a rash of unrest across the former Soviet Union, including protests in neighboring Belarus and fierce fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has a military base in Kyrgyzstan but has mostly stood aside from the political chaos in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. Moscow reached out to a senior security official offering help, but that official was then promptly fired. On Friday, Kyrgyzstan’s embattled president, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, declared a state of emergency in Bishkek, ordering troops onto the streets and confining residents to their homes. “The threat of losing our country is real,” he warned. Violence continued, however, fueled largely by Mr. Japarov’s supporters, who hurled rocks and other projectiles at the followers of a rival would-be prime minister, Omurbek Babanov, and attacked journalists. Several shots were fired. The unrest began with a wave of public anger over the victory of pro-government parties last Sunday in a parliamentary election tainted by credible allegations of widespread vote-buying. Protesters stormed jails and government buildings, sending the president into hiding. The election results were then quickly annulled, opening the way for a new vote, but the turmoil escalated as rival opposition politicians began fighting for government posts, unleashing mobs of young men to confront each other on the street. Arkady Dubnov, a Central Asia expert in Moscow, said the new prime minister, Mr. Japarov, who just days ago was serving an 11-and-half-year sentence for organizing the 2013 kidnapping of a regional governor, had prevailed “because his supporters turned out to be the strongest.” It was unclear whether he would serve a full term or be forced to step down once new parliamentary elections are held to replace last week’s annulled vote. Mr. Japarov, a former member of Parliament for a nationalist party, has insisted that the kidnapping charges against him were politically motivated, a plausible claim in a country where each successive government often jails members of the previous one. Among those freed from prison this past week by protesters were a former president, Almazbek Atambayev, serving an 11-year-sentence for corruption, and two former prime ministers. Mr. Atambayev, under whose rule Mr. Japarov, the new prime minister, was convicted, was himself back behind bars on Saturday after being detained by security officers in the center of Bishkek. He had said on Friday that he had been the target of a failed assassination attempt after his release from jail. Mr. Dubnov, the Moscow analyst, said criminal convictions in Kyrgyzstan were frequently tainted by politics but added that, in an impoverished country that sits astride lucrative smuggling routes, “it is very difficult to find a politician who is not connected to crime in some way.” Residents reached by telephone said Bishkek was mostly calm on Saturday as armed troops set up checkpoints and lawmakers from the previous Parliament gathered at the grand official residence of President Jeenbekov to choose a prime minister. Mr. Jeenbekov, who vanished from view after protesters stormed his office, re-emerged on Friday to take the lead in trying to calm the crisis, firing the previous government and pledging to resign once a new cabinet was formed. The departure of Mr. Jeenbekov, who was elected in 2017, would mark the third time in 15 years that violent protests have toppled the president in Kyrgyzstan, the only country in Central Asia with a modicum of democracy but one prone to instability because of deep poverty, clan rivalries and divisions between north and south. Adding to perennial political tension has been rivalry between the prime minister, nominally the senior figure in what is supposed to be a parliamentary system, and the president, who commands the armed forces and often dominates decision making. Instead of stepping down as promised, President Jeenbekov on Saturday issued a series of decrees reshuffling the leadership of the security services.']",Lawmakers in Central Asia's only democracy selected a man sprung from jail by protesters just days ago in an effort to end days of violent political unrest
An Afghan Boy’s Rape and Death Prompt a Rare Response: Arrests,2020-10-09,By David Zucchino and Taimoor Shah,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — It started as a dispute between boys: Naseebullah Barakzai, 13, was irked when a neighbor boy stole fruit and ripped limbs from his family’s pomegranate tree, and he shoved the younger boy to the ground, relatives say. Just two days later, Naseebullah was dead, and his village, in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, was in an uproar. His family and other residents accuse an influential police checkpoint commander of taking the other boy’s side and abducting and raping Naseebullah, fatally injuring him. It is the kind of sexual assault that has run rampant within the Afghan security forces. And in other forms, child abuse has become ritualized: One practice, in which powerful men molest young boys and force them to dress and dance in girls’ clothing, is widely known as bacha bazi, or boy play. Poor families have suffered for years as commanders and their men have preyed on them, part of a broader culture of corruption in the security forces that led to efforts to reform the military and police. But officials have been reluctant to acknowledge, much less confront, the endemic issue of sexual abuse of children — including bacha bazi and minors forced into marriage — though those practices have been officially outlawed. In the case of Naseebullah, though, public outrage appears to be forcing a rare reckoning. Naseebullah’s family, backed by a throng of elders from the village of Karezak, marched into the offices of Kandahar’s governor, Hayatullah Hayat, to demand justice and the arrest of the police commander, First Lt. Mullah Roozi Khan, last month. And it worked: The government quickly arrested Lieutenant Khan and six of his officers, who are in jail while an official investigation is underway to determine whether to charge them. Naseebullah’s mother and brother said that Lieutenant Khan and his men abducted, beat and raped the sixth-grader, who was dumped the next day at a hospital. They said hospital officials told them that Naseebullah had suffered severe internal injuries before he died, on Sept. 18, and that the men who dropped him off claimed that he had fallen from a roof. But the doctor who operated on the boy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he had observed extensive internal injuries consistent with forced penetration. The allegations against the commander test the jurisdiction of Afghanistan’s American-backed government, which holds limited sway in provinces outside the capital, Kabul. As Afghan and Taliban negotiators discuss a possible peace deal, the militants are still conducting attacks nationwide, exposing the government’s inability to protect its citizens in violently contested provinces like Kandahar. Under these circumstances, the dead boy’s family and neighbors are demanding government action in a district nominally under government control. “I want President Ghani to give us justice — nothing else,” Naseebullah’s mother, Bibi Amina, 50, said of President Ashraf Ghani. “This crime defamed the name of Islam.” Naseebullah’s brother, Ehsanullah Barakzai, 26, said the governor had assured the family that no one, not even a powerful police commander, was above the law. But he said the guilty often go unpunished if they are rich or influential. “We still don’t know whether this criminal will be punished or set free,” Ehsanullah said of the jailed commander. The lieutenant and his men could not be reached for comment, and in recent days were transferred to a prison in Kabul as the investigation continued. Wali Mohammad Askar, the Criminal Investigation director for Kandahar, said his office would conduct a thorough investigation and publicly announce the results. “We assure all the people of Kandahar, and especially the relatives of the victim, that no one who is guilty will be spared justice,” Mr. Askar said. But in similar cases nationwide, authorities have promised to investigate, only to quietly release suspects after interest fades. “When powerful people are involved, often we don’t hear about the investigation again after the first few days,” said Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Ms. Akbar said families often don’t report child sex crimes because of shame or fear of official retribution. But in Naseebullah’s case, the family asked the human rights group’s office in Kandahar to monitor the case and consult with authorities to ensure transparency, she said. In Logar Province, south of Kabul last November, a local child advocacy group publicized statements from 165 schoolboys who said they had been raped by teachers, principals or police officers. Afghanistan’s national intelligence agency quickly detained the two leaders of the advocacy group and coerced them to publicly recant the allegations. After the American Embassy in Kabul and human rights groups intervened, the two advocates were released; one has since fled Afghanistan. Twenty suspects have been arrested and charged with raping the boys, and trials have begun for four of them, Ms. Akbar said. Jamshid Rasuli, spokesman for Afghanistan’s attorney general, said the office had conducted “a comprehensive and extended investigation” in Logar and would announce the results soon. In July, four Afghan security force members, including a company commander, were jailed after they were accused of raping and beating a 13- and a 14-year old boy inside a battalion headquarters base in Takhar Province in northern Afghanistan. The 13-year-old’s cousin, Qurban Ali Hairat, said he found the boys in a room on the battalion base, both injured so badly that they were unable to walk. He said they told him they had been raped by soldiers. Brig. Gen. Mohammad Ali Yazdani, commander of the 217th Pamir Corps in Takhar, said military prosecutors were investigating the case while the soldiers remained in custody, In 2015, an investigation by The New York Times found widespread sexual assault of boys by Afghan security force members, and that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. The investigation prompted a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the military’s reluctance to confront bacha bazi, a practice centuries old. Afghanistan made bacha bazi and similar offenses violations of the national criminal code in 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up the three years in prison — three to five years if the dancing is “a public event.” But human rights advocates say the codes are rarely enforced. In Kandahar, the spokesman for the governor promised that justice would be done for Naseebullah. “Nobody is above the law, and we are committed to following the rule of law and we will complete the investigation soon,” the spokesman, Baher Ahmadi, said. The dead boy’s mother was not convinced. “The government puts innocent people in prison, but the criminals and culprits remain free,” Ms. Amina said. Mohammad Nazem, a neighbor in the Dand district where Naseebullah lived, said hundreds of people turned out for the boy’s funeral and railed against government officials. He said a failure to punish those responsible would only harden the hatred that many residents harbor toward the government. “We cannot imagine a human being doing such a thing to a teenage boy,” Mr. Nazem said. “We would prefer that he be shot and killed, not murdered in this cruel way.” David Zucchino reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Kabul.']","Villagers confronted officials, and seven police officers are now in jail, in a rare official action to investigate child sexual abuse accusations in Afghanistan."
He’s Sorry for His Bad Reviews. He May Now Avoid Prison.,2020-10-09,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — He’s very, very sorry. But the hotel in Thailand that threatened an American guest with prison for his bad reviews may end up with bigger regrets. Wesley Barnes, the American guest, publicly apologized on Friday for his blunt online reviews of the Sea View Koh Chang resort in Thailand. In exchange, the hotel promised it would drop the complaint that led the authorities in Thailand to file criminal defamation charges against him. More than wounded pride was on the line. In Thailand, criminal defamation charges can result in a prison term of up to two years. Mr. Barnes had already spent two days in jail after his arrest on those charges last month before posting bail. The question now for the Sea View resort — and for Thailand’s tourism industry, which is struggling under the coronavirus travel freeze — is whether it can recover from the considerable damage its reputation has suffered by threatening Mr. Barnes with prison. The resort, on the Koh Chang island on Thailand’s southeastern coast, has been excoriated online for using the country’s tough defamation laws against a guest who didn’t enjoy his stay and decided to write about it. Mr. Barnes struck a decidedly different tone on Friday, in a statement filled with stilted official language reminiscent of a forced confession. “All of the statements that I made are completely untrue,” the statement said. “These reviews and comments were written out of anger and malice. Now, I, Mr. Barnes, have regretted my actions and would like to apologize to Sea View Koh Chang, and its staff.” As required by the settlement with the hotel, Mr. Barnes also sent the statement to news outlets that covered his case, including The New York Times. He apologized “for my repeatedly false and untrue statements/reviews made to maliciously defame Sea View Koh Chang.” Kitti Maleehuan, the Koh Chang police chief, whose office brought the charges, attended a settlement meeting on Thursday, according to the police. The resort on Koh Chang island, an hour’s flight from Bangkok, said by email that it would drop its complaint if Mr. Barnes complied with the terms of the agreement by Oct. 30. “After all conditions are met, the hotel will then withdraw the charges against the offender,” said Col. Kissana Phathanacharoen, deputy spokesman for the Royal Thai Police. Mr. Barnes did not respond to a request for further comment. Mr. Barnes’s arrest and the filing of criminal charges last month over reviews he posted on TripAdvisor and Google alarmed many travelers, who have long felt free to post blunt and critical online reviews in Thailand and elsewhere. The move also called into question the judgment of the Thai authorities for pursuing the criminal case just as Thailand is desperately trying to revive its tourist industry. One of the government’s strategies is to encourage residents, including foreigners like Mr. Barnes who live in Thailand, to travel within the country. Tourism accounts for about a fifth of the country’s economy. Human rights advocates have long criticized Thailand’s defamation law, which can lead to criminal charges for speaking out and is sometimes used by companies to silence critics. The dispute began in June when Mr. Barnes, a hotel guest, objected to paying what he saw as an excessive $15 corkage fee so that he could drink from a bottle of gin he had brought to the hotel restaurant. A manager eventually waived the fee. Mr. Barnes said in a statement after his arrest that he saw the same manager later harshly criticizing an employee and concluded that “there was some master/slave mentality going on.” That inspired him to post a series of negative reviews on TripAdvisor and Google, including one in which he wrote, “Avoid this place as if it was the Coronavirus!” The hotel said it repeatedly asked him to take down the reviews and posted its own detailed rebuttals online. The hotel said it had no choice but to go to the police after Mr. Barnes ignored their requests. An “official statement” included in the settlement agreement said that the Sea View had decided in August to “protect its rights” by filing the criminal complaint. “This decision was not taken lightly by the management team,” it said. The settlement required Mr. Barnes to make a “sincere apology” for his reviews, including for mention of “using slave labor, xenophobic comments against hotel staff, and comparing the hotel to coronavirus on multiple occasions and website platforms.” In his statement, Mr. Barnes expressed gratitude to the hotel for allowing him to avoid prison. “The hotel has forgiven me and agreed to withdraw the complaint,” the statement said. “I would like to sincerely thank the hotel and its staff and take this opportunity to announce this news to the general public.”']","An American who went to jail for disparaging a hotel in Thailand online apologized profusely as part of a deal to avoid prosecution, in an episode that laid bare that country’s harsh defamation laws."
"In Belarus, Women Led the Protests and Shattered Stereotypes",2020-10-11,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MINSK, Belarus — With masked riot police officers massing nearby, threatening to attack protesters like him with batons and fists, Aleksei D. Zulevsky felt safe for the first time in weeks of anti-government unrest in Belarus: He was surrounded by hundreds of women he knew would shield him. “I feel protected here,” said Mr. Zulevsky, as fellow protesters, many holding red and white flags, the banner of the opposition, chanted at a rally last month. “Only cowards beat women!” In a country whose strongman president, Aleksandr. G Lukashenko, has openly scoffed at women as too weak for politics and told them their place was in the kitchen, Belarusian women have become the face and driving force of a movement aimed at toppling a leader known as “Europe’s last dictator.” That effort may be flagging, with Mr. Lukashenko refusing to give up power even though tens of thousands of people continue to come out to the streets of Minsk to protest every weekend. On Saturday many women, holding flowers in their hands, again protested in the city. They avoided forming a single crowd in fear of being arrested by police officers. But whether or not the protest movement succeeds in ousting Mr. Lukashenko, it has already shattered deeply entrenched gender stereotypes built up over generations. “Women were stronger in this situation,” said Tatiana N. Kotes, a film production designer and activist. “We had to assume a more significant role. Men’s dominating role in the society has collapsed.” The collapse began even before an Aug. 9 presidential election that Mr. Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, setting off two months of almost nonstop protests. To his obvious distaste, Mr. Lukashenko faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from a woman candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of a popular blogger who had hoped to run himself but was imprisoned before he could register as a candidate. Mr. Lukashenko mocked his rival as a housewife, a meek mother ill-equipped to debate serious issues of state with a veteran leader like himself. “She just cooked a tasty cutlet, maybe fed the children, and the cutlet smelled nice,” Mr. Lukashenko said in an interview shortly before the election. “And now there’s supposed to be a debate about some issues.” Adding to his rage and, perhaps, consternation, was the fact that the opposition, previously led by men and prone to bitter internal feuding, had united around three women — Ms. Tikhanovskaya, whom they backed as the candidate; Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of a would-be candidate who fled the country to avoid arrest; and Maria Kolesnikova, the campaign manager for Viktor Babariko, a jailed banker who had also hoped to challenge Mr. Lukashenko. With all the main male opposition figures knocked out of the race by arrest or flight abroad, Ms. Tikhanovskaya and her two colleagues ran a strategic and successful campaign, holding large rallies across the country while Mr. Lukashenko confined himself to Soviet-style visits to factories and military bases. “At our first rallies, we were amazed to see how many people turned up,” Ms. Tsepkalo, 44, said in an interview. “It was a symbol of the unity of Belarusians against the dictatorship.” Ms. Kolesnikova, the only one of the women to remain in Belarus after the election, achieved hero status when she tore up her passport to foil the government’s plan to deport her to Ukraine, and was then imprisoned. The emergence of women in the protest movement — while surprising to many and, to Mr. Lukashenko, an affront to the natural order — drew on an important feature of the country’s national psychology left by the traumas of World War II, when a quarter of the population, mostly men, was wiped out. Olga Shparaga, a feminist and lecturer in philosophy at the European College of Liberal Arts in Belarus, said the shortage of males left women to play an outsize role in rebuilding the devastated country once the war ended in 1945. Memories of this, she said, left even the most misogynistic Belarusians aware, deep down, of what women could accomplish. Wartime memories have been kept alive and introduced to younger Belarusians with no recollection of the war or its aftermath by Svetlana Alexievich, the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who has made the role of women one of the main topics of her work. “After the war, we children lived in a world of women,” Ms. Alexievich said in her Nobel lecture in 2015. “What I remember most is that women talked about love, not death.” But it is perhaps Mr. Lukashenko himself who, inadvertently, has done more than anyone to advance the cause of feminism. Casting himself as a classic Slavic “muzhik,” or real man, Mr. Lukashenko has sneered at women with such abandon that he has become a caricature of boorish misogyny and an easy target for attack. Sergei Chaly, a Belarusian political and economic analyst who worked with Mr. Lukashenko at the beginning of his political career in the 1990s, said Ms. Tikhanovskaya made a smart decision to portray herself as “a simple woman that just needs her husband and children, but who was selected by fate to fulfill a political role.” That appealed to voters wary of the dominating and masculine style presented by Mr. Lukashenko throughout his 26 years in power. “He got used to dealing with men by means of bullying and boorishness, but this didn’t work with women,” Mr. Chaly said. After their leading role in the campaign it was only natural that women would step up in the protests that broke out after Mr. Lukashenko claimed an implausible 80 percent of the vote in the Aug. 9 election. In the days that followed, the streets of the capital, Minsk, became a perilous conflict zone. Thousands of protesters, mostly men, were arrested, and hundreds were beaten and tortured. With the country in danger of sliding into violent strife as groups of aggressive young men appeared on the streets calling for revenge, women again took center stage. A small group of women activists organized a protest so conspicuously peaceable that, they calculated, even the most brutish riot police officer would hesitate to use force. Hundreds of women descended hand-in-hand on the central market in Minsk, forming a human chain that left the police clearly baffled about how they should respond. Beating unarmed women publicly risked embarrassing the law enforcement apparatus and opening up officers not only to public condemnation but perhaps even punishment by their superiors. “Our government is always looking for organizers, but this idea was in the air, it was a feeling shared by all women in Belarus,” said Irina G. Sukhiy, an activist who joined the women’s protest. The day after the first women’s march ended peacefully, thousands of women took to the streets in Minsk and other cities across the country. Mr. Lukashenko, who was counting that brute force would be enough to crush the protests, was thrown off balance and sought help from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The immediate answer was to isolate the women leading the protests and drive them out of the country. More recently, masked police officers, many of them visibly embarrassed, have made mass arrests of women demonstrators. But most of those taken into custody were released after fingerprinting and a mug shot. Even the leaders, like Ms. Sukhiy, were sentenced to only several days of administrative arrest. “They didn’t expect that a woman could stand against them,” said Ksenia A. Fyodorova, 47, an entrepreneur and activist, of the security forces. “We realized that you can only counter them in a way that would be diametrically opposed to what they did.” Speaking with reporters in Berlin Wednesday after meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Ms. Tikhanovskaya said the role women have played in the uprising was as determined as it was unexpected. “They are fighting for the future of their children,” she said. “They don’t want their children to be slaves of this system in the future.” In the face of official brutality, she said, the women have responded by showing “peace and love.” As a broad smile broke across her face, she added, “Now, Belarusian women are world-known, and this is wonderful.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']",The women who organized the political campaign and the subsequent protests against President Aleksandr G.

"For Trump, Defying Mideast Truisms Produced Breakthroughs and Backfires",2020-10-11,"By David M. Halbfinger, Ben Hubbard and Farnaz Fassihi","['JERUSALEM — He moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, breaking with those who said it would ignite the Muslim world. He withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and ordered the killing of a top Iranian general, defying those who said those moves would lead to war. He brokered treaties between Israel and two Arab states, disproving those who said such deals could only follow the creation of a Palestinian state. Again and again in the Middle East, where volatility has burnished or battered previous presidential legacies, President Trump has run roughshod over conventional thinking, advancing key policy aims or fulfilling campaign promises in ways that experts warned could set off a conflagration or blow up in his face. Not only did the predicted disasters not materialize, but in many cases his policies produced demonstrable achievements. The Arab treaties with Israel doubled the number of countries in the region that have relations with Israel. The killing of the Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, eliminated the leader of a network of dangerous militias. And the embassy move, rightly or wrongly, was a step previous administrations had shrunk from despite claiming to support it. But the bold moves often had major drawbacks: The Iranians resumed their nuclear project, and experts believe they may have enough nuclear material to build a bomb. The killing of General Suleimani scuttled any chance of negotiating a better nuclear deal with Iran, at least for now. The chances of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict appeared ever more distant. And political gifts to Israel and Saudi Arabia received none of the concessions in return that would have been expected as part of a negotiation. Mr. Trump approached the region more like a businessman than a politician, alternately squeezing adversaries and dangling economic inducements, and snagging opportunities where he found them. Remarkably, this scattershot, transactional approach bore fruit that a more strategic, diplomatic approach had not. But it also failed to persuade the Palestinians to compromise on their national aspirations and the Iranians on their ideology. Lacking an overall strategy for the region, critics say, Mr. Trump blundered in self-defeating ways, allowing Turkey to attack America’s Kurdish partners in Syria and worsening a rift among gulf allies that has impeded the containment of Iran. And his overriding focus on helping Israel and hurting Iran led to a hands-off approach to bloody conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya, which remain shattered and dangerous. In an interview, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser on Middle East policy, said the administration sought to create a “core stability” in the Middle East, in part by promoting Israel’s acceptance by Arab states, which he argued would keep terrorism at bay, reduce the risks to American soldiers and costs to its taxpayers, and put the region “on a pathway to a more stable place.” The president, he said, “took a pragmatic approach, which was to state the goals that we want to go to — set the North Star — and then work very hard to move things toward them.” Chief among Mr. Trump’s ambitious objectives: defeating Islamic extremists, bringing Iran to heel and achieving what he called the “ultimate deal” between the Israelis and Palestinians. During his term, the Islamic State lost its territorial caliphate and attacks by its supporters that once frequently terrified the West have grown rare, although the group remains a potent underground threat, launching frequent deadly attacks in Iraq, Syria and West Africa. The other goals largely eluded him. The Palestinians rejected Mr. Trump’s peace deal, and the prospect of its resuscitation appears remote. Iran has resumed enriching uranium — a direct consequence of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement — which has brought it closer to being able to make a bomb. And its allied militias are rocketing the United States Embassy in Baghdad so often that the Americans have threatened to close it. Mr. Trump prioritized arms sales over human rights, standing by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia after his agents murdered the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi and he waged a disastrous war in Yemen. And Mr. Trump’s plan to sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates shows signs of setting off a new regional arms race. His emphasis on deal-making, critics say, has ignored all but the economic sources of the region’s many problems. “The Middle East is not a bazaar,” said Lina Khatib, an expert on the region at Chatham House, a London research group. “And to try to solve its crises by treating it that way simply does not work.” The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the setting for Mr. Trump’s biggest failure, may also be where he leaves the most enduring mark. Eager to succeed where no other president had, he confronted the conflict quickly, cheering Palestinians who had dreaded being ignored — only to demoralize them by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American Embassy, steps widely seen as irreversible. The predicted uprising did not occur, but the Palestinians boycotted Mr. Trump. And he pushed them further away, slashing funding, expelling their diplomats from Washington and eliminating a consulate in Jerusalem devoted to their interests. When the long-awaited Trump “Vision for Peace” emerged in January, it read as though it had been drafted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, snubbing the main Palestinian demands and encouraging Israeli annexation of occupied West Bank territory. The Palestinians dismissed it in the most vehement terms. In a twist, though, the talk of annexation made possible a diplomatic coup. Annexation stalled amid Israeli political opposition, but it created an opening for a deal: In exchange for Israel’s “suspending” annexation, the U.A.E. would bring its under-the-radar ties with Israel into the open. The small gulf kingdom of Bahrain followed. More broadly, what had driven the U.A.E. into Israel’s arms was the Trump administration’s waning commitment to the region and newfound doubts about its willingness to send its military to the rescue, particularly after Mr. Trump refused to retaliate against Iran after accusing it of attacking Saudi oil facilities last year. “The Emiratis were looking around for who they could rely on,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former United States envoy to peace talks and ambassador to Israel. The region’s strongest military was the obvious answer. For the Palestinians, it was perhaps the unkindest cut: Much of their strategy to pressure Israel relied on Arab solidarity to deny Israel the acceptance it craved. For the Trump administration, a dud product launch became a marketing bonanza. “We were nimble and opportunistic,” said David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel. Moreover, Mr. Kushner argued, the deals with the U.A.E. and Bahrain would eventually force the Palestinians to come around. “They’re only going to be tough for as long as they have the resources,” he said. But few expect the Trump peace plan to be the basis of any future talks. “If you have parameters which are only supported by Israel, and rejected by the Palestinians, the Arabs, the Europeans and so on, they’ll probably not hold for long,” said Michael Herzog, a veteran peace negotiator and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Mr. Trump focused much of his attention on Iran, which he called the Middle East’s greatest generator of instability through its support for a network of militias active across the Arab world. President Obama had sought to entice Iran with the promise of sanctions relief and engagement with the West, an approach that led to an international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump declared that deal a failure for not addressing Iran’s missile program and aggressive behavior, and for permitting it to resume unconstrained uranium enrichment in 2030. So he replaced carrots with sticks, withdrawing from the agreement and launching a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at constricting Iran’s finances. In January, Mr. Trump took aim at Iran’s regional militia network, ordering the killing of its architect, General Suleimani. The approach alienated Western allies but won Mr. Trump plaudits from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., rivals of Iran who resented Mr. Obama’s negotiations with their nemesis. “Showing Iran the big stick, that was needed,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist. “This guy was Public Enemy No. 1 for many countries.” The pressure campaign — including sanctions on Iran’s oil sales and financial transactions — has choked its economy. Its currency plunged nearly 50 percent against the dollar in the last month. Iranian officials have spoken frankly about the distress but remain dismissive toward Mr. Trump. “He hasn’t got a deal, he hasn’t changed the regime, he hasn’t made Iran withdraw from the region and he has undermined moderates in Iran,” said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert and former State Department adviser. Mr. Trump and his allies say the policy has reduced the Iranian threat by degrading its ability to finance militias in Iraq and Syria, the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. “That’s money denied, it’s resources unavailable, it’s terror attacks avoided,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview. Iran has also dialed down provocative activity in the Persian Gulf in recent months, which administration officials cast as a direct result of American pressure. Iranian politicians, however, say it reflects a fear that conflict would only help Mr. Trump win a second term.   Mr. Kushner said Mr. Trump’s policies gave the United States a strong negotiating position. “The table’s set. Iran right now is stone-cold broke,” he said. “The goal here hasn’t been to make a deal. The goal here has been to try to set the table to make a good deal.” But such talks seem remote. Iranian politicians said the Suleimani killing would bar the country’s leaders from negotiating with Mr. Trump. “Even if he gets re-elected, it will be impossible,” said Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a reformist politician. For now, Iran’s militia network remains active, and its nuclear program is up and running, and rapidly approaching the ability to build a bomb. Regardless who wins the November election, Mr. Trump has brought about changes in the Middle East that the next administration must take into account. The momentum toward normalization agreements could continue, with Saudi Arabia, whose stance toward Israel has warmed under Crown Prince Mohammed, looming as the largest potential prize. A future United States administration could use that enticement to press Israel for concessions toward the Palestinians. But there is much concern in Israel about how the Palestinians would react to their abandonment by more of the Arab world. With Iran’s government in dire financial straits, some of its regional allies have questioned how long it can hang on. The next administration could use that distress as leverage, even if in the pursuit of drastically different objectives. Mr. Trump’s transactionalism may also have limits: Sudan’s new leaders have so far refused to normalize relations with Israel despite substantial financial incentives because doing so could leave them “morally compromised” among their people, said Ofer Zalzberg, Middle East director at the Herbert C. Kelman Institute for Interactive Conflict Transformation. Still, the id on display in Mr. Trump’s policies has earned measured praise in unlikely quarters. Even some critics said Mr. Trump’s lack of interest in traditional talking points about democracy and human rights had brought a new frankness to age-old discussions about the United States’ dealings with autocrats. “It takes away the illusions some people have convinced themselves of, that we used to be a force for good,” said Amy Hawthorne, deputy director for research at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “The harm is significant,” she hastened to add. “We don’t get that soft power back right away.” And Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group and a former senior Obama administration official for the Middle East, said Mr. Trump’s record held at least one lesson for his successors: The prospect of blowback from critics and allies need not be paralyzing. “They may not like what we’re doing,” he said, but Mr. Trump had shown that “if it’s in our interest to do it, we just need to forge ahead.” David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.']","Disregarding norms and accepted wisdom, President Trump went his own way in the Middle East and, in some cases, got what he wanted."
"For Boris Johnson, and Maybe Trump, Covid as Metaphor Is Hard to Shake",2020-10-10,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — President Trump got a well-wishing phone call this past week from one of the few foreign leaders who knows what he’s been going through: Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the survivor of a serious brush with the coronavirus this spring. Mr. Trump seized on the call as another opportunity to boast of a swift recovery from Covid-19. But he should take little comfort from Mr. Johnson’s experience — and not just because the prime minister ended up in an intensive-care unit after he, like the president, tried to work through the illness. Six months after Mr. Johnson was released from the hospital, he has yet to shake off questions about the effects of the disease on his energy, focus and spirit. His health is a source of whispered speculation in the hallways of Parliament, questions from reporters and ominous musings by columnists, for whom Mr. Johnson’s illness has become a symptom of his broader political decline. “It’s a metaphor for his government, and that’s affecting him personally,” said Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff to Tony Blair when he was prime minister. “He looks like the wrong man for the job at this time.” Parallels between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Trump are often overblown, and there is little in the prime minister’s convalescence that compares to the daily spectacle of a president pronouncing himself back to normal and scheduling campaign rallies a week after being airlifted to the hospital with trouble breathing. Still, the two men share a penchant for brash statements, flouting the rules and a campaign-style approach to government. Both also initially played down the threat of the virus — Mr. Johnson, most notoriously, when he bragged about shaking the hands of coronavirus patients while visiting them in the hospital. Despite his efforts, Mr. Johnson has never recaptured the public buoyancy that propelled him to a landslide election victory last December. On Tuesday, speaking to his Conservative Party’s annual conference, he tried again to put to rest questions about lingering effects of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. “I have read a lot of nonsense recently about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo,” the prime minister said in a tone of theatrical umbrage. “And of course, this is self-evident drivel, the kind of seditious propaganda that you would expect from people who don’t want this government to succeed.” Far from being a political Austin Powers, sapped of his vitality by an invisible enemy, Mr. Johnson said he had lost 26 pounds since his recovery. Having long struggled with his weight, he has declared himself as “fit as a butcher’s dog” and challenged the people of Britain to join him in getting into shape. “I could refute these critics of my athletic abilities in any way they want: arm-wrestle, leg-wrestle, Cumberland wrestle, sprint-off, you name it,” Mr. Johnson said, sounding a bit like Mr. Trump, who despite being 74 and moderately obese attributed his recovery to the fact that he is a “perfect physical specimen.” Both leaders sought to make political points after being discharged from the hospital: Mr. Trump about the miracle-cure qualities of the drugs he was treated with, which he promised to distribute free to all Americans; and Mr. Johnson about the miracle workers who treated him — the doctors and nurses of the National Health Service, perhaps Britain’s most revered institution. But Mr. Johnson, unlike Mr. Trump, emerged from his illness with a new appreciation for the virus’s deadliness and his own vulnerability. He spoke movingly about how the nurses in the I.C.U. took turns giving him oxygen, something that Mr. Trump, who also received supplemental oxygen, has not mentioned. Mr. Johnson also became a reluctant proponent of protective measures, a stance that has put him at odds not only with Mr. Trump, but also with members of his own party who worry about the damage that lockdowns do to the economy. The prime minister’s speech to the Conservative conference was a concession to the times. Whereas he would typically deliver the speech in a giant hall with the party faithful arrayed before him, Mr. Johnson instead faced a camera in an empty room. “There is no one to clap or heckle,” he lamented. He did his best to turn the page, sketching out his vision of a post-Covid future for Britain: ambitious investments in wind turbines and windmills, under the slogan “Build Back Better,” which happens to also be the slogan of the jobs and recovery plan of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic candidate for president. The Trump campaign accused Mr. Biden of plagiarizing Mr. Johnson. But “Build Back Better” has been used recently by the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, suggesting a lack of imagination more than a theft of intellectual property. In any event, the British news media largely ignored “Build Back Better” and kept the focus on Mr. Johnson’s misplaced mojo. The state of his health is hard to judge, given that his office provided sketchy, uninformative updates while he was sick and has not offered a medical briefing since then. He looked energetic on Tuesday but has seemed occasionally lethargic during debates in Parliament. “His party conference speech was palpably a chance to shake off the sense that he’s half the man he used to be, that he’s lost his élan and brio, that he’s now a poor shuddering wreck,” said Andrew Gimson, one of Mr. Johnson’s biographers. “But he hasn’t been able to shake it off,” Mr. Gimson said. “There are a lot of columnists who are committed to the idea that he’s an utter scoundrel, and they write these things partly to convince themselves.” Still, it is not just Mr. Johnson’s polarizing personality that has caused his problems. His government’s botched response to the pandemic — from its tardy lockdown and trouble-prone test-and-trace system to its serial reversals on lockdown measures — has cemented the perception that it is ill-equipped to deal with the challenge. Mr. Johnson’s approval rating, which peaked at 66 percent when he left the I.C.U., has sagged to 35 percent, according to the research group YouGov. Early polls suggest that Mr. Trump may not even get that transitory a sympathy bump from his illness, and unlike Mr. Johnson, he is due to face voters in less than a month. When Mr. Johnson and several of his top advisers got sick in late March, it was eerily similar to the contagion now sweeping through the White House. Like the president’s aides in the West Wing, Mr. Johnson and his staff huddled in the cramped offices of 10 Downing Street, not observing adequate social distancing. What it revealed, people who know him said, was Mr. Johnson’s blithe disregard for health issues — another trait he once shared with Mr. Trump. Before his illness, he boasted of his appetite for cheese and argued against regulating fast-food advertising or taxing companies that use unhealthy ingredients. “He wasn’t really suited for this kind of problem,” Mr. Gimson said, “because he’s never taken health problems seriously.”']",The British prime minister’s personal battle with the disease has come to symbolize his government’s fumbling efforts to halt the pathogen.
"Fighting Eases, Briefly, After Cease-Fire Between Armenia and Azerbaijan",2020-10-10,By Anton Troianovski,"['GORIS, Armenia — Fierce fighting over a breakaway Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan partly subsided on Saturday after a cease-fire took effect. But there was little expectation of a durable peace two weeks into the most violent conflict that the volatile region has seen in decades. The cease-fire agreement, reached by Armenia and Azerbaijan in Moscow early Saturday after 10 hours of overnight talks, raised hopes of at least a brief respite in the artillery bombardment, drone strikes and trench warfare that have killed hundreds since Azerbaijan launched an offensive on Sept. 27. Each side accused the other of mounting new attacks after the cease-fire took effect at noon on Saturday. But eyewitnesses reported no shelling in the enclave’s capital, Stepanakert, for much of the afternoon and evening, and the Armenian Defense Ministry said most of the front line was “relatively calm.” Shortly before midnight Saturday, though, people in Stepanakert said they heard a series of explosions and the wail of air raid sirens, suggesting the cease-fire was teetering just 12 hours after it came into force. Around the same time, Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry said the Azerbaijani town of Terter, near the border of the enclave, had come under attack. Earlier in the day, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it stood ready to use the lull to retrieve the remains of the dead at the front line, where the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh borders Azerbaijani-controlled territory. Emergency services workers fanned out looking for unexploded ordnance, a journalist based in the city, Gegham Baghdasaryan, said in a telephone interview. Nagorno-Karabakh, with a population of about 150,000, is a landlocked territory in the Caucasus, the mountain range where Europe meets Asia, between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The territory, smaller than Connecticut, has little geostrategic significance on its own, but is the subject of an escalating test of strength among regional powers. Russia, Iran and an increasingly assertive Turkey have all been jockeying for influence in the region. “I hope that the world’s power centers will find enough means of influence on Azerbaijan to have it abide by the cease-fire,” Mr. Baghdasaryan said. The enclave is part of Azerbaijan under international law, but has been controlled by a breakaway government closely aligned with Armenia since a yearslong war over the territory in the early 1990s. About 20,000 people were killed, and about a million, mostly Azerbaijanis, were displaced in that war. Azerbaijan says it is now fighting to reclaim land that rightfully belongs to the country, while Armenia says ceding the land to Azerbaijan could bring about the destruction of the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh. Neither side appears in a mood to compromise, with rhetoric from all parties having grown harsher in recent months. The current war has already killed more than 400 Armenian soldiers and, according to the United Nations, more than 50 civilians; Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military casualties. “This war did not surprise anyone here,” said Zaur Shiriyev, an analyst with the International Crisis Group based in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. “No one actually questions why it’s happening now.” Mr. Shiriyev said he did not expect the cease-fire to hold for long, in part because the agreement announced in Moscow early Saturday morning contained no specifics on geography or timing. “It can be declared inoperative at any time,” he said. Turkey, a member of NATO, is Azerbaijan’s major ally in the region. It is now challenging Russia’s longtime geopolitical primacy in the southern Caucasus, which was part of the Soviet Union. Russia has a mutual-defense treaty with Armenia and maintains a military base there, but has also nurtured close ties with Azerbaijan. The region’s southern neighbor, Iran, is also a major player, and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday to discuss the conflict, the Kremlin said. Whether or not the cease-fire, which was brokered by Russia, holds will test Mr. Putin’s ability to influence events in his country’s post-Soviet neighborhood. Azerbaijan insists Armenia must withdraw its troops from Nagorno-Karabakh if it wants peace. The foreign minister of Azerbaijan, Jeyhun Bayramov, warned Saturday that his country was prepared to continue fighting, while Turkey said it would stand by “brotherly Azerbaijan” on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. “Azerbaijan has shown Armenia and the whole world that it has the ability and the self confidence to reclaim its territories under occupation for nearly 30 years,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Saturday. By agreeing to the cease-fire, the ministry said, “Azerbaijan gave Armenia a last opportunity to withdraw from the territories it has occupied.”']",The Armenian Defense Ministry said most of the front line was “relatively calm.” But renewed shelling was reported at night.
"With Elections Ahead, Some African Presidents Try Engineering Results",2020-10-11,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — The president of the West African nation of Guinea is running for a third term on Oct. 18, even though Guinea requires its presidents to step down after two. But because of a constitutional change he initiated, his first two terms don’t count. The president in neighboring Ivory Coast has made his first two terms disappear with a constitutional amendment, too. So he is also running for a third-but-actually-first term, on Oct. 31. And after 34 years in power, Uganda’s 76-year-old president plans to run for re-election in February. The age limit for presidents in Uganda was 75, but then he changed the constitution, and sought to prove his fitness to stay in office with a demonstration of his red-carpet workout routine in the State House — to the howls of many Ugandans. While much of the world may be focused on the contest for the top job in the United States, presidential elections are also set to take place in at least 10 of Africa’s 54 countries over the next five months. All of the incumbents but one want to stay in office. While most African presidents since 1990 have stepped down after their terms were up, many are now bending the rules to ensure they stay in power. Some have manipulated supreme courts and electoral commissions; others have changed constitutions, prosecuted opposition candidates or prevented them from running by imposing onerous qualifying criteria. But countries like the United States that once claimed to stand against those undermining democracy are now turning inward and so, some political thinkers say, incumbents are increasingly getting away with it. “Too many of our countries have not stood by the protocols and the resolutions that we have made in our regional institutions. Regarding democracy. Regarding term limits. Regarding the transfer of power in a regular and peaceful way,” said Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia. “And those shifts are coming also because of the changes in the geopolitical landscape.” European colonizers frequently damaged or destroyed Africa’s own systems and traditions of holding power to account, as historians have chronicled. Post-colonial African governments have instead relied on imported, sometimes ill-fitting political systems. And at around 60 years old, these systems are still younger than many current presidents. In March, Ivory Coast’s President Alassane Ouattara, 78, was basking in praise for saying he would step down when he had completed his two terms — despite arguing that he didn’t have to, because a constitutional change meant his term clock was reset to zero. But four months later his chosen successor suddenly died, and the president judged that no other candidate would do. Like his predecessors, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Ivory Coast’s first president, under whom Mr. Ouattara served as prime minister, and Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to leave office in 2011 set off the country’s second bloody civil war within a decade, Mr. Ouattara decided to hang on — calling it a “real sacrifice.” Protests spread across the country. Then two of the front-runners were barred from standing in the election — Mr. Gbagbo, who last year was acquitted of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, and Guillaume Soro, a former prime minister and rebel leader living in exile, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail in absentia in April. Four candidates remain, though 40 were disqualified. “Not allowing the others to be candidates will surely bring another war,” said Mélodie Gnékonté, a secretary who said her uncle, an army doctor, had been killed during the last war. Ivory Coast’s economic growth is second only to Ethiopia’s in Africa, but Ms. Gnékonté said President Ouattara was “spoiling” everything he had achieved by “finding reasons to stay in power.” The coups of the 1970s and 1980s are now mostly a thing of the past. Since 2015, there have been at least 30 peaceful transitions of power in sub-Saharan African countries, including in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria, where governing parties lost elections. Rigging outcomes on Election Day, by stuffing ballot boxes or changing vote tallies, has become more difficult in recent years, said Mathias Hounkpe, a specialist in political governance at the Open Society Initiative West Africa. Politicians are changing their tactics as a result, he said. “Little by little, those in power are realizing that it’s becoming harder to cheat,” Mr. Hounkpe said in an online debate. “They use the means they have to keep the political space in check.” Across French-speaking West Africa, civic space is shrinking, so that citizens trying to hold their governments to account face repressive laws, arrest and sometimes death, according to a report to be published by the global nonprofit Civicus. Case in point: recent deadly clashes in Guinea, over the new constitution pushed by the country’s first democratically elected president, Alpha Condé. His success at maneuvering to stay in power is partly the fault of Western negligence, said Cellou Dalein Diallo, the Guinean opposition leader. “The Europeans are less attentive, and the Americans, with the arrival of Trump, are less demanding when it comes to democracy and human rights,” Mr. Diallo said on a recent campaign trip to Dakar, Senegal, where a large Guinean diaspora lives.   Secretary of State Michael Pompeo issued a two-paragraph statement last week about “upcoming elections in Africa,” warning that “repression and intimidation have no place in democracies.” But many Africans commented on social media that such a skimpy, blanket statement about the continent, rather than specific countries, was evidence that there is little interest from the administration of President Trump, who denigrated African countries with a memorable epithet in 2018. When Mr. Diallo got back to Guinea, President Condé accused him of going there to recruit mercenaries and attack his own country, which Mr. Diallo strongly denies. But President Condé closed the border. As a result, many Guineans living abroad may be unable to return to cast their votes. And some of those at home, who can vote, say politicians are trying to sow division. “Power shouldn’t be something they cling to, knowing that there are people who could do better,” said Fanta Traoré, a student at the French University of Guinea. In Uganda, political rallies are banned because of the coronavirus, making it harder for opposition candidates. To reach voters, candidates have to rely on the news media, over which President Yoweri Museveni and the governing party exert great influence. Tanzania’s political space is shrinking rapidly too. The opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who spent three years in exile after an assassination attempt, has returned to the country to run for president, but says the police are disrupting his campaign. He says he fears for his life. Until recently, Gambia was riding on the joyful high that followed the dislodging of its longtime autocratic president in 2016. But the new president reneged on his promise to serve for only three years. Last month, his supporters in the National Assembly rejected a new, transformative constitution because, civil rights activists say, it would limit the new president to a decade in power. The other countries set to have elections in the next five months are Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Ghana and Seychelles. The only country where the incumbent is not running is Niger. Like constitutions, coups — while now rare — are evolving too. When soldiers abducted Mali’s democratically elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, on Aug. 18, and forced him to resign on state television, they denied that this constituted a coup. They presented it as the will of the people and peppered their speeches with pro-democracy language that seemed designed to be palatable to Mali’s Western partners, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. On a video conference two days later, 14 West African presidents discussed the coup. Putschism was a grave disease, Niger’s president said. Others appeared worried their countries might catch it. If Mali’s coup leaders got away with this, would it inspire Ivory Coast’s or Guinea’s citizens to rise against their own tenacious presidents? But it was the presidents’ newest colleague who gave voice to what many West Africans citizens have expressed. All coups d’état should be condemned, said Umaro Sissoco Embaló, the president of Guinea-Bissau. Third terms, he said, also count as coups.

"From Hiding, Kyrgyzstan’s Leader Declares State of Emergency",2020-10-09,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Four days after vanishing during a wave of attacks on government buildings by opposition protesters, the president of Kyrgyzstan declared a state of emergency in the capital of his Central Asian country on Friday, ordering the military into the city to halt unrest, confining residents to their homes and banning public gatherings. The beleaguered president, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, announced the measures in a decree issued from an undisclosed location and posted on his official website. But it was unclear whether Mr. Jeenbekov, who went into hiding after violent protests over a disputed parliamentary election on Sunday, would be able to enforce the state of emergency in the absence of a functioning government. Bowing to pressure from the street, Mr. Jeenbekov earlier on Friday formally dismissed the prime minister, the head of the armed forces and the country’s security chief. The dismissed officials had already given up their posts and decrees announcing their departure merely acknowledged a fait accompli dictated by the president’s foes. In a separate statement early on Friday, the president indicated that he, too, could leave office, saying that he was ready to resign once a new cabinet was appointed and “we are back on the path of lawfulness.” His subsequent declaration of a state of emergency, however, suggested he might try to hang on to power, but many welcomed the move as necessary to prevent the turmoil from escalating into a wider conflict. He named a deputy interior minister as “commandant” of the capital, responsible for enforcing the emergency measures. Mr. Jeenbekov, seeking to reassert his battered authority, reappeared later Friday to attend a meeting in Bishkek with the military leadership and is scheduled to meet with members of Parliament on Saturday to try and hammer out an agreement on a new prime minister. The prospects of an orderly transfer of power have dimmed in recent days, largely because the opposition is deeply divided. Lawmakers, who have responsibility for naming a prime minister, have held rival meetings in a hotel and cinema but have been unable to agree on a new lawful government that could fill the power vacuum. On Friday, supporters of two rival would-be new prime ministers — both of whom were freed from prison earlier in the week — clashed violently in Bishkek. The country’s former president, Almazbek Atambayev, who was broken out of jail by protesters and joined the opposition, said he had been the victim of an assassination attempt. The turmoil in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic and the only country in Central Asia with a modicum of democracy, follows two months of unrest in Belarus, another former Soviet land, and comes as a military conflict is underway between two other former republics, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The simultaneous crises have blindsided the Kremlin and left President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia scrambling to reassert some order in a zone of influence that Moscow calls its “near abroad” and views as vital to the country’s stability. Russia has military bases in Kyrgyzstan and also in Armenia, but has so far refrained from flexing its muscle on the ground in favor of one side or another in what are deeply entrenched local quarrels. The head of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B., spoke by telephone earlier this week with the acting head of the Kyrgyz security service and offered help to curb the chaos in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. But that Kyrgyz official, Omurbek Suvanaliyev, lost his job on Thursday. In a separate attempt to rein in the turmoil in former Soviet lands, Russia’s foreign ministry is hosting a meeting in Moscow on Friday between the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan over a possible truce in their fighting over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Bishkek fell under mob rule this week after protesters rampaged through buildings housing the Parliament and the presidential administration and stormed detention centers, freeing Mr. Atambayev, two former prime ministers and other detainees. The violence followed allegations by the opposition of vote buying and other irregularities in parliamentary elections on Sunday that handed victory to pro-government parties. Protesters seized government buildings and Mr. Jeenbekov went into hiding, while insisting he was still running the country. Mr. Jeenbekov is the second president of a former Soviet republic now struggling to survive after a disputed election. But unlike the authoritarian president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Mr. Jeenbekov presides over a country that, at least until Friday’s state of emergency, which imposed restrictions on media, has had a vibrant free press and many opposition parties. Instead of bringing stability, however, Kyrgyzstan’s relatively democratic system has opened the way to regular bouts of political unrest in a country bedeviled by clan rivalries and deep divisions between north and south. Two of Mr. Jeenbekov’s predecessors were toppled in violent revolutions and fled abroad to escape arrest. His immediate predecessor, Mr. Atambayev, who is from the north, served out his term but was thrown in jail after leaving office, a fate that Mr. Jeenbekov, a southerner, now wants to avoid. But securing a deal that guarantees his future freedom will be difficult as Mr. Atambayev, freed from jail earlier this week by his supporters, has been busy rallying opposition to his successor with demands that Mr. Jeenbekov be prosecuted. Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.']","Earlier on Friday, after protesters besieged government buildings, President Sooronbai Jeenbekov said he was willing to leave office.

"‘Eventually, slowly, it comes back’: The U.S. Northeast sees signs of a second wave.",2020-10-09,By Sarah Mervosh and Julie Bosman,"['The Northeastern United States, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and then held up as a model of infection control by the summer, is now seeing the first inklings of what might become a second wave of the virus. The rise in case numbers has prompted state and local officials to reverse course, tightening restrictions on businesses, schools and outdoor spaces. In Boston, plans to bring children back to school have been halted as cases climb precariously. New virus clusters are emerging in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In New York City, the number of new cases each day now averages more than 500 for the first time since June, and the city is putting strict rules in place in some neighborhoods. In New Jersey, where hospitalizations are on the rise and the rate of infection has almost doubled, towns have closed public parks and picnic areas to discourage people from gathering. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island extended restaurant capacity rules for another month. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, said that early in the nation’s outbreak, New York and much of the Northeast had successfully tamped down transmission of the virus with physical distancing and masking, as much of Europe had done. “The point is, once you let up on the brake, then eventually, slowly, it comes back,” Dr. Osterholm said. By many measures, the Northeast is still doing quite well, particularly compared with virus hot spots elsewhere in the country, including the Midwest and Great Plains. Still, the number of people in the hospital — a clear measure of those most seriously affected by an outbreak — is starting to trend slightly upward again in the Northeast. There may be a number of reasons for the upward trend in cases. The air turned suddenly chilly in past few weeks, sending people who had been lounging in sunny parks indoors. Students returned to schools and college campuses. But it may also be that Northeasterners, who were among the first to take the virus seriously, are simply growing weary. “We’re all kind of exhausted with it,” said Danielle Ompad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at New York University. “We have to acknowledge that this is not easy.”']",
Kamala Harris’s ‘Canadian Dream’,2020-10-09,By Dan Bilefsky,"['Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky, a Canada correspondent for The New York Times based in Montreal, where Senator Kamala Harris spent her oft-overlooked teenage years. During Wednesday’s U.S. vice-presidential debate, Ms. Harris, a former California attorney general, prosecuted her case against the Trump presidency. But for the past month, I’ve been trying to understand a different Kamala: the disco-dancing adolescent shaped by her formative years at a multicultural high school in Montreal in the late 1970s. [Read: In Canada, Kamala Harris, a Disco-Dancing Teenager, Yearned for Home]. The assignment had particular resonance for me because my childhood intersected with Ms. Harris’s. While I didn’t know Ms. Harris, I grew up in Montreal near Westmount, a few blocks from where she lived with her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, and her sister, Maya. I was in high school around the same era as Ms. Harris. And my father, a kidney specialist, worked at the Jewish General Hospital, where her mother did pioneering breast cancer research. We also share another connection: While young Kamala was channeling Diana Ross in an all-girl troupe in which her nom de disco was “Angel,” I was pretending to be John Travolta, clumsily twirling my older sister to the soundtrack of “Saturday Night Fever.” Two themes stood out as I was reporting the story. One is the infinite influence of mothers in shaping who we become. The other was how the Canadian model of multiculturalism — in which we are part of a mosaic of different cultures rather than a melting pot — embraced a young American girl homesick for California. Ms. Harris’s mother, born in India, had divorced her Jamaican-born husband, a Stanford economist, by the time the family arrived in Montreal when Ms. Harris was 12 years old. In Montreal, Dr. Gopalan Harris had her own laboratory and worked 10-hour days and on weekends. I discovered a 1985 article in the Montreal Gazette on leading female scientists in Canada in which she was profiled. “Researchers live under terrible pressure. It’s very difficult not to take their work home at night,” she told the paper. “Children don’t understand work pressures,” she added. She credited young Kamala and her sister for forcing her to “turn off at least for a few hours when I got home.” Dr. Richard Margolese, a professor of surgical oncology at McGill University in Montreal, who worked with Dr. Gopalan Harris, told me that she asked to be called Shyamala. Her independent streak left an impression. “Here she was in this strange country, a single mother with two young daughters, doing important breast cancer research in a field where there were not a lot of women at the time,” he recalled. Wanda Kagan, Ms. Harris’s best friend from high school, went to live with her family for a time to escape an abusive stepfather. She told me that Dr. Gopalan Harris made sure she received counseling, and treated her like family, including making certain that she and the Harris sisters studied every day after school. “Her mom sometimes wore ’70s bell-bottom jeans. She was sassy but also strict,” Ms. Kagan told me. “She was a proud Indian woman.” Ms. Kagan said Ms. Harris was largely sheltered from Quebec’s political upheaval when she was at Westmount High from 1978-1981. But she said she believed her friend’s progressive politics were influenced by having come of age in a humanistic country with universal health care and less racial strife than the United States. Her childhood friends recalled a confident young woman who showed seeds of activism, found cultural affirmation in her Black identity and complained about French class. Mara Rudzitis, an art teacher at Westmount High for 22 years, recalled Kamala sometimes spent her lunch hour making art in the arts and crafts studio, where students would come to paint and make ceramic masks. “We didn’t get the cream of the crop at Westmount High — many of those kids would go to private schools — we got more of the sour cream,” she told me. “Kids are very impressionable at that age and Kamala was exposed to people from all walks of life and nationalities.” Ms. Kagan told me that while Ms. Harris was a diligent student, her limited exposure to French before coming to Canada disadvantaged her at a high school where the students in the French immersion section received more attention and resources. Ms. Harris arrived in Montreal knowing a handful of French words learned from ballet classes and was placed in the English section, Ms. Kagan said. Now, however, Ms. Harris is one of Westmount High’s most celebrated alumni (Leonard Cohen also studied there). During a recent politics class there, students debated Ms. Harris’s record as California attorney general, including whether she had done enough to mitigate racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system. Members of the class were also giddy that she had walked the same halls. “The students, especially the Black girls, are motivated by seeing a Black woman from Westmount High running for one of the highest political offices in the world,” Robert Green, who teaches the class, told me. This week, I reported on a bizarre case whose lurid details have grabbed headlines in Canada and China: a Chinese immigrant who killed his family member and chopped him into 108 pieces. Some observers say his sentence of 10 years and six months in prison is too short. A Toronto producer wants to bring “Blindness” to theater-starved Toronto.

"Offering few details, the White House doctor says Trump is no longer contagious.",2020-10-11,"By Maggie Haberman, Katherine J. Wu and Apoorva Mandavilli","['President Trump’s doctor said in a memo released Saturday night that he was “no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” as the president prepared to resume campaign activities this week. The memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said he was releasing information with Mr. Trump’s permission. But the amount of information he provided was limited, in keeping with restrictive presentations to the public that Dr. Conley has made throughout Mr. Trump’s battle with symptoms of the coronavirus since officials made his diagnosis public early on Oct. 2. Dr. Conley last released an update on the president’s condition on Thursday. Experts have repeatedly called into question the true severity of Mr. Trump’s illness. According to guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with severe Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, may need to isolate for up to 20 days. And the president’s health could still deteriorate in the next few days. “I don’t think he’s out of the woods for certain,” said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician based in South Carolina. Men of Mr. Trump’s age, 74, and weight are at higher risk for severe cases of Covid-19. His recent course of steroids, which suppress certain parts of the immune system, could also make him vulnerable to other infections, Dr. Kuppalli added. “I would still be careful with someone like him.” The start date of Mr. Trump’s symptoms has also remained unclear. By Dr. Conley’s assessment, Mr. Trump would have needed to show signs of his illness on Wednesday, Sept. 30, for Saturday to qualify as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Most people stop being infectious by the 10th day after they start feeling ill, according to the C.D.C. “This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the president meeting C.D.C. criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s Covid P.C.R. sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” Dr. Conley wrote. “Now at day 10 from symptoms onset, fever-free for well over 24 hours and all symptoms improved, the assortment of advanced diagnostic tests obtained reveal there is no longer evidence of actively replicating virus. In addition, sequential testing throughout his illness has demonstrated decreasing viral loads that correlate with increasing cycle threshold times, as well as decreasing and now undetectable subgenomic mRNA.” Several experts expressed skepticism at the wording describing Mr. Trump’s diagnostic tests, which did not explicitly categorize the president as “negative” for the coronavirus. P.C.R., a laboratory technique that detects the virus’s genetic material, can give researchers a rough sense of how much virus remains within a person’s body, or the viral load. Dr. Conley’s note suggested Mr. Trump’s viral load was dropping, but appeared to still be detectable. The subgenomic mRNA mentioned by Dr. Conley is a part of the virus that can be detected by laboratory techniques, and that suggests the presence of actively replicating virus, said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. But “there are zero cleared tests that look at subgenomic mRNA” from the coronavirus, she added, which means the procedure is “experimental at this point.” Another, more traditional, approach to determine whether Mr. Trump still harbored actively replicating virus in his body might be to take a sample from the president’s airway and see if the coronavirus could be grown from the sample in a lab. But this technique was not mentioned in Dr. Conley’s memo. There is also no test that can definitively show if a person at the end of a coronavirus infection is still contagious and poses a risk to others, said Melissa Miller, a clinical microbiologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Dr. Conley said he would continue to monitor the president in the coming days. Mr. Trump is to speak at a campaign event on Monday. Mr. Trump’s voice has grown stronger since he was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday. But other than on his trips to and from the hospital, he had not been seen in public before Saturday, when he appeared on a balcony for nearly 20 minutes before a crowd of a few hundred people gathered on the South Lawn of the White House.']",
What if Local and Diverse Is Better Than Networked and Global?,2020-10-09,By Damien Cave,"['MULLUMBIMBY, Australia — Helena Norberg-Hodge strolled into the farmers’ market that she helped start long before it was fashionable. She had come to shop but also to check on friends — especially the farmers living out her ideas about prizing localism and rejecting globalization, for the health of the environment and the happiness of humanity. A few steps into the market near the New South Wales coast, she found Andrew Cameron, 38, a cattle rancher with a thick beard and a cooler full of grass-fed meat. He said Covid-19 had made Ms. Norberg-Hodge’s message even more vital. “We’ve just been shown how fragile and not resilient it all is,” Mr. Cameron said, referring to global supply chains that spread the coronavirus worldwide, then struggled to deliver medical supplies. “Our resilience now” — “yeah, yeah,” Ms. Norberg-Hodge said, goading him on — “comes from local producers.” “There has been such a huge shift in awareness,” she said, her blue eyes filled with energy. “It has been good,” he said. The back and forth perfectly captured how Ms. Norberg-Hodge — an activist-scholar who started promoting localism decades ago — has become a lodestar, now more than ever, for people all over the world who are demanding an alternative to the global system of trade. At 74, she still interrupts with the urgency of an eager student, determined to win over every skeptic or amplify her message alongside the converted. And it’s quite a crowd she has gathered. Her vocal supporters include the Dalai Lama, the British comedian Russell Brand, the San Francisco chef Alice Waters, and Iain McGilchrist, the Oxford literary scholar and psychiatrist. “Whether or not our civilization survives, Helena’s work is of prime importance,” said Dr. McGilchrist, whose groundbreaking 2009 book, “The Master and His Emissary,” argued that each half of the brain generates a fundamentally different way of experiencing the world. “Encouraging local communities is a vital antidote to universal globalism.” “And if civilization should break down,” he added, “it will be our only hope for survival. We need to be acting on her ideas now.” Those ideas can be found in books and in documentaries, along with conferences and regular lectures tied to her nonprofit organization, Local Futures, which has offices in Australia, Britain and the United States. It boils down to two concepts that sound simple but have profound implications: First, shorter distances are healthier than longer distances for commerce and human interaction; second, diversification — one farmer growing a dozen crops, for example — is healthier than monoculture, which is what globalization tends to create, whether it’s bananas or mobile phones. “My big thing is helping to make this grow all over the world,” she said, pointing to shoppers and farmers chatting over produce. “It just makes sense.” But the status quo is stubborn. She said she was heartbroken by the news on Friday that the World Food Program won the Nobel Peace Prize because, like many critics, she believes the organization undermines local economies by favoring big business and destructive supply chains. “It’s so sad,” she said. “Despite the best of intentions, the W.F.P. is still promoting an outdated form of agriculture that’s based on monocultures for export, rather than diversification for local and national consumption. The end result is actually a loss of livelihoods and an increase in divisiveness.” *** A linguist by training who studied with Noam Chomsky in the 1970s, Ms. Norberg-Hodge says she landed in Byron Bay 20 years ago, at least part-time, because her husband, John Page, an English lawyer, seemed to benefit from the favorable climate. The home they share is modest, surrounded by trees, strewn with Asian rugs and overrun by books with titles like “Silencing Dissent” and “The Capitalism Papers.” In many ways, she fits right in around Byron Bay, where she helped start all four farmers’ markets in the area. Though now known as a celebrity hangout, the coastal town has been a haven for surfers, back-to-the-landers and backpackers since the 1960s. Not that Ms. Norberg-Hodge, wild gray hair notwithstanding, sees herself as a hippy. At the market, she winced after encountering a baby boomer American in a long flowing dress who started going on about how Ms. Norberg-Hodge should pitch her latest documentary to this very interesting film festival called Sundance. She was much more comfortable talking to Lance Powell, 67, an organic farmer who reported that after he stopped selling to supermarkets and shifted to organic local sales, his business soared and his stress level collapsed. “What it is,” she said, “is rebuilding human interdependence.” It’s an interesting critique coming from such a peripatetic citizen of the world. Ms. Norberg-Hodge was born in New York City, but her parents were Swedish, and after growing up in Stockholm she studied and traveled her way into speaking six languages before she turned 30. In 1975, on the strength of those skills, her plans for life were thrown into disarray when a German film crew invited her to Ladakh, a mostly-Buddhist mountain enclave in northwest India, which was just starting to open up to tourism and the international economy. She became one of the first visitors to learn Ladakhi, which helped her see how the unquestioned pursuit of economic growth corroded local competency and cohesion. The path to “development” for Ladakhis meant ending centuries of self-reliance, where they found everything they needed around them, except salt, which they traded for. It also meant accepting policies that favored choices they would not have made on their own. India subsidized fossil fuels, for example. But Ladakh featured relentless sunshine. Ms. Norberg-Hodge tried to fight back — early on, she started a pilot program for solar power. She also tried to maintain self-esteem among local young people by helping them see that the Hollywood images they devoured did not capture the full picture of consumerist reality. Along with shiny products, she emphasized that life in the West also included depression, divorce and social strife. Her first book, “Ancient Futures,” and a film of the same title, has been translated into 40 languages. Together, they amount to a cri de coeur about Ladakh, warning the world to stop assuming that progress is one-size-fits-all. “She got the opportunity to see a different world, and she was smart enough to understand that she wasn’t looking at a relic, she was looking at a vision of a working future,” said Bill McKibben, an author and founder of the environmental activism group 350.org. “And she has kept that vision close over many decades, helping all of us see that the metrics we’re used to — G.D.P., say — are not the only possibilities.” Over tea one afternoon, Ms. Norberg-Hodge argued that G.D.P., or gross domestic product, the accepted benchmark of national economic output, should be redefined. “You must know this, but G.D.P. is a measure of the breakdown of society and ecosystems,” she said. “If the water is so polluted that we are providing bottled water, it benefits G.D.P. If you and I plant a garden and say, eat most or half of our vegetables from there, G.D.P. goes down. If you and I stay healthy, G.D.P. goes down. If you need chemotherapy every year, G.D.P. goes up.” She shook her head in quiet scorn, as if saying it out loud was enough to reignite her outrage. *** What she would like to see instead, she said, is what she calls an “economics of happiness,” where the cost of environmental damage is included for products shipped over long distances; where intangible benefits like community are more deeply valued in policy. Food — despite the Nobel Peace Prize going to the World Food Program — is where she has won over the most converts. Alice Waters, who brought local, healthy cuisine alive at her Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, called her “tireless and single-minded.” “I have completely internalized her vision of how we can come back to our senses,” Ms. Waters said. Ms. Norberg-Hodge said the coronavirus pandemic may even help over the long term — as a disruptive force that could lead people to more “medium-sized” lifestyles in smaller communities, even within cities. Perhaps, she said, there are reasons for optimism being planted in otherwise dark times. “I think this moment has meant that a lot of people have developed an appetite for having a little more time, being a bit closer to home, learning the names of their neighbors, becoming interested in where their food is coming from and even developing an appetite for actually growing food.” For a moment, she stopped lecturing. “It’s so heartwarming for me to see,” she said.']","Helena Norberg-Hodge has been arguing for localism since the 1970s, but the pandemic is making the Australian activist-scholar’s ideas more relevant than ever."
Fauci says his words were ‘taken out of context’ by the president’s campaign.,2020-10-11,By Sheila Kaplan,"['Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, took issue Sunday with a decision by the Trump campaign to feature him in an advertisement without his consent and said it had misrepresented his comments. “I was totally surprised,” Dr. Fauci said. “The use of my name and my words by the G.O.P. campaign was done without my permission, and the actual words themselves were taken out of context, based on something that I said months ago regarding the entire effort of the task force.” CNN first reported Dr. Fauci’s displeasure with the campaign ad. The spot seeks to use Mr. Trump’s illness with Covid-19 and apparent recovery to improve the negative image many Americans have of his handling of the coronavirus. “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” the ad shows Dr. Fauci saying — though in fact he was talking about the broader government effort. Dr. Fauci, who said he had never publicly endorsed a political candidate in decades of public work, has long had an uneasy relationship with President Trump. Just a little over a week ago, he clashed with his boss over his position on mask-wearing. In his debate with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump claimed that Dr. Fauci had initially said “masks are not good — then he changed his mind.” When Mr. Biden said wearing masks could save tens of thousands of lives, Mr. Trump contended that “Dr. Fauci said the opposite.” In fact, in the early days of the pandemic, Dr. Fauci and other health experts discouraged the general public from rushing out to buy masks because they were worried about shortages for health workers. Their position changed when it became clear that asymptomatic transmission was spreading the virus. Dr. Fauci may favor measured language, but his criticisms of the White House — and, implicitly, the man in the Oval Office — over the handling of the pandemic have not gone unnoticed, including by hard-core Trump supporters who claim he is part of a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine the president. On Friday, Dr. Fauci called the White House ceremony announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court a “superspreader event.” “It was in a situation where people were crowded together and not wearing masks,” he said. “The data speak for themselves.” Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee begins on Monday. The proceedings will play out partially by video to allow senators who may be sick or worried about infection to participate remotely. No members of the public will be allowed in the hearing room, which will be sparsely populated with senators and spectators.']",
"Virus Hits Foreign Farmhands, Challenging Canadians’ Self-Image",2020-10-11,By Catherine Porter,"['SIMCOE, Ontario — Three weeks after they began cutting asparagus in the thawing fields, Luis Gabriel Flores Flores noticed that one of his co-workers was missing. He said he found the man shivering with a fever, in bed — where he would remain for a week. “I was trying to tell the foremen, ‘He is very ill, he needs a doctor,’” said Mr. Flores, one of thousands of migrant farm workers flown into Ontario in April to secure Canada’s food supply. “They said, ‘Sure, soon, later.’ They never did.” The sprawling vegetable farm where he worked became the site of one of the country’s largest coronavirus outbreaks. Almost 200 workers, all from Mexico, tested positive, seven were hospitalized and one died: Juan Lopez Chaparro, the one Mr. Flores said he had tried in vain to help. The farm owner insisted that Mr. Chaparro had been treated promptly and called Mr. Flores a “bad apple” being used by activists to score political points. If that is the case, it has worked: The outbreak and others like it have spurred national protests about the systemic vulnerability of migrant farm laborers, a population unknown to many Canadians until they began to fall ill at a rate 11 times that of health workers. Canadians pride themselves on a liberal immigration system welcoming to an array of ethnicities and nationalities, contrasting their attitude with what many see as xenophobia in their neighbor to the south. The reality does not always match the rhetoric, but Canada encourages different groups to maintain their cultures, and an embrace of multiculturalism is enshrined in Canada’s charter and self-image. When other world leaders shunned refugees from Syria’s civil war, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed them in person, handing them winter coats. But in importing large numbers of seasonal farm laborers from abroad and offering them no path to residence or citizenship, Canada looks disturbingly un-Canadian to many of its people. Canada admits temporary workers who stay for most of a year but requires them to return home when their contracts end (the United States does, as well, but they are outnumbered by farm workers who are undocumented and often do stay year-round). As in the United States, farm workers live for months on their employers’ property, often in large bunkhouses where disease can spread easily. Those who enter Canada with work permits often return year after year with no prospect of ever legally putting down roots. Canada, at least, guarantees them health care, but on isolated farms, gaining access to that care can be difficult. “In no other immigration category do you have people who come only from certain countries, are trapped in certain occupations, living only on their work sites and must absolutely leave the country at the end,” said Jenna Hennebry, director of the International Migration Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. “It’s not consistent with our ideals of multiculturalism.” Professor Hennebry was among a group of academics who warned the Canadian government about the heightened risks migrant farm workers faced from Covid-19 before the first planeload of Mexicans arrived in April. The coronavirus outbreaks prompted the Mexican government to pause sending workers to Canada for a week in June. In response, Mr. Trudeau said: “We should always take advantage of moments of crisis to reflect. Can we change the system to do better?” Since then, his government has announced 59 million Canadian dollars — about $45 million — for improved farm housing, sanitation and inspections. But it has not offered the cure that advocates for migrant workers demand: a path to citizenship. “We have a group of people defined as good enough to work in Canada, but not good enough to stay,” said Vic Satzewich, a sociology professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “As a country we have to ask ourselves why that’s the case.” The seasonal agricultural worker program began in 1966, when 264 Jamaican farm hands arrived in Southern Ontario as a temporary solution to chronic farm labor shortages. It was designed “to prevent Black settlement,” Mr. Satzewich wrote in his book “Racism and the Incorporation of Foreign Labor.” Unlike earlier agricultural worker programs for Europeans, the Jamaican workers were not permitted to apply for Canadian citizenship or bring their families because of fear that there would be “race relations problems” and that they would not assimilate or be “competitive,” he wrote. The program has expanded to include more than 56,000 workers from a dozen countries, making up one in five farm workers across Canada. The coronavirus has infected more than 1,600 of them in Ontario alone this year and killed three. In theory, migrant farm workers are protected by all the laws that shield Canadian farm workers. But their contracts state that any worker fired for cause requires “immediate removal” from the country, which keeps people from complaining about abuses, advocates say. The federal government introduced an enforcement system in 2015, with a complaint line for migrant workers, but Canada’s auditor general deemed it inadequate: Only 13 of 173 planned inspections were completed in the 2016 fiscal year. This year, no farms have been found noncompliant. “The employers have too much power over their workers,” said Mr. Flores, 36, at a protest by migrant workers and their supporters in downtown Toronto in August. Around him, masked men and women held up pictures of Mr. Chaparro, his deceased co-worker. “It could have happened to any of us,” said Mr. Flores, a father of two from the outskirts of Mexico City, who has worked on farms across Canada in four of the past six years. This year, the program placed him at Scotlynn Sweetpac Growers, a family-run agribusiness with a large trucking fleet and 12,000 acres in Ontario, Florida and Georgia. He tested positive for the virus, but experienced only mild symptoms. The day after he learned of Mr. Chaparro’s death, he left the farm two hours southwest of Toronto. He has been supported since then by the advocacy group Migrant Workers Alliance For Change, which helped him file a complaint with the provincial labor board, seeking 40,000 Canadian dollars from Scotlynn for lost wages and suffering. He contends that he was fired for asserting publicly that the company had a role in Mr. Chaparro’s death. The farm’s owner, Scott Biddle, said his family had hired farm workers from Mexico for more than 30 years and never fired a single one. He said Mr. Flores was one of three workers who asked to be returned to Mexico after the outbreak began. Mr. Biddle said his farm had strictly followed the district’s coronavirus regulations, putting almost all the workers up in hotel rooms for two rounds of quarantine. He called Mr. Chaparro’s death an unfortunate reflection of the disease’s vagaries, not of systemic failures. “Every regulation was followed that needed to be,” he said, standing in a parking lot behind his office. “At the end of the day, these gentlemen are living in close contact, they work in close contact, they are frontline workers providing food.” He invited a New York Times reporter to speak to three of his employees, one of whom had worked for him for 32 years. Two confirmed that Mr. Chaparro had lain sick in bed for a week. They said that four other workers in the bunkhouse had also had fevers and that one coughed so much, they thought he had pneumonia. “All of us were 100 percent convinced it was just the change in climate,” said Daniel Hernandez Vargas, a roommate of Mr. Chaparro’s who was working at the farm this spring for the first time. Workers in another bunkhouse, who were unsure where to turn when one of them became seriously ill, reached out to the assistant to an anthropology professor, whom they had met during a previous growing season. With the help of the two academics nearly 2,000 miles away, at Okanagan College in British Columbia, an ambulance was called. “It had gotten to the point, one of their co-workers was so ill, he was slipping in and out of consciousness,” said the professor, Amy Cohen, who is an advocate for migrant workers. Mr. Biddle said he believed a foreman had called the ambulance, but wasn’t sure of the details. “If anyone showed any symptoms of being ill, they were always taken to the hospital,” he said.']",Outbreaks at farms have made Canadians question how well their system is really protecting vulnerable migrant workers.
Hong Kong Arrests Nine Over Protesters’ Escape by Speedboat,2020-10-10,By Tiffany May and Mike Ives,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police said on Saturday that they had arrested nine people accused of helping a group of protesters, who were later intercepted by the mainland Chinese authorities, flee the city in August by speedboat. The arrests seemed intended to send a message to anyone who might consider helping other antigovernment protesters escape Hong Kong, where anxiety about Beijing’s tightening grip has intensified since the Communist Party imposed a sweeping national security law on the Chinese territory in June. The nine people arrested on Saturday are accused of funding the protesters’ planned escape to Taiwan and offering them shelter and a ride to a remote pier in Hong Kong, a police spokesman, Ho Chun-tung, said. At least one of the nine is accused of supplying a boat, Mr. Ho said. The 12 protesters who tried to escape were barred from leaving Hong Kong, the police said, and have been under investigation over their participation in the large-scale demonstrations that gripped the territory last year. Some face serious charges, and they are expected to face trial in the mainland for illegally crossing the border with Hong Kong. “We suspect that these nine individuals helped the 12 fugitives avoid hearings in the courts, or they have prevented them from being arrested by the police,” Mr. Ho said. Most of the four men and five women arrested on Saturday were friends of the captured protesters, he said. Among the group were assistants to former lawmakers, an office worker, a chef and a music teacher. The police did not release their names but said their ages ranged from 27 to 72. They each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Last year’s demonstrations evolved into the most serious challenge to the Communist Party’s rule in decades. The protests targeted a proposed extradition law, since abandoned, that would have exposed the city’s residents to trial on the mainland, where courts are controlled by the party. As many as 200 Hong Kong protesters are believed to have fled to Taiwan over the past year. Going there by sea has become increasingly risky, and smugglers who once plied the route are now unwilling to participate. As of late September, the 12 captured protesters, aged 18 to 33, were being held in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, at a detention center near the border with Hong Kong. The charge that they face of illegally crossing the boundary with Hong Kong carries a maximum penalty of up to one year in prison, or seven years if they are found to have organized such an effort. Pro-democracy lawmakers and activists in Hong Kong have pushed for the mainland government to return the detainees to the territory. But Beijing has called demands for their release “absurd,” and an official at China’s foreign ministry has described the protesters as separatists. The activists’ have been barred from seeing human rights lawyers and were told that the attorneys at their trial would be appointed by the mainland authorities, according to their relatives. The Hong Kong news media have reported that the territory’s police force deployed aircraft during the early morning hours of the Aug. 23 escape attempt, suggesting that the local police played a role in ensnaring the protesters. Mr. Ho denied that the local police had coordinated with the mainland authorities. “Their arrests within the mainland have nothing to do with Hong Kong police,” he said.']","The arrests appeared intended to deter others from helping antigovernment protesters flee the Chinese territory, where Beijing’s grip is tightening."
Spain uses emergency powers to lock down Madrid.,2020-10-09,By Raphael Minder,"['Spain’s government on Friday decreed a state of emergency for the Madrid region, overruling Madrid’s own regional politicians, who had applied a limited lockdown on specific neighborhoods to try to stop a second wave of Covid-19. The government decided to use its emergency powers to lock down Madrid after suffering a major legal defeat on Thursday, when Madrid’s top regional court declared illegal its earlier effort to isolate Madrid from the rest of Spain. The intense feuding between the government and the regional administration of Madrid is highlighting the failure of Spain’s politicians to coordinate their response to the coronavirus, amid party polarization and fragmentation. At a cabinet meeting on Friday, the government decided that the state of emergency should come into force immediately, in a bid to stop about 4.8 millions of residents of the Madrid region from leaving for a long weekend, as Monday is a holiday in Spain. Police officers were expected to set up new checkpoints by 3 p.m. Friday. Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the regional health minister of Madrid, said that his administration would “ask every day for the state of emergency to be lifted because the numbers back us,” in insisting that locking down specific neighborhoods was sufficient to rein in the latest wave of Covid-19 in Madrid. The residents of Madrid, he added, “will not understand” the intervention of the central government, given the recent improvement in Madrid’s Covid-19 data. According to the regional government, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospitals of Madrid has fallen to about 2,800 from 3,300 on Sept. 21, when selective lockdowns were introduced. However, Madrid’s lockdown strategy also triggered social tensions, because the restrictions affected mostly poorer areas of Madrid.']",
North Korea Unveils What Appears to Be New ICBM During Military Parade,2020-10-10,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea displayed what appeared to be its largest-ever intercontinental ballistic missile during a nighttime military parade in Pyongyang on Saturday, but it was not immediately clear if the missile would work or was for show. The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has vowed to strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent as talks with President Trump over the country’s arsenal have stalled. The rollout of the weapon comes as Mr. Kim has struggled to keep his promises to strengthen his nation’s staggering economy. The new ICBM appeared to be much larger than North Korea’s biggest, previously disclosed long-range missile, the Hwasong-15. The size of the new missile indicated that it might fly farther and carry a more powerful nuclear warhead, South Korean and other analysts said, although it has never been flight-tested. North Korea has been improving its missile and nuclear technologies despite Mr. Trump’s on-again, off-again diplomacy with Mr. Kim, and the display Saturday was likely an attempt to show that more advances are being made. But it was not immediately clear if the new missiles were real, or were mocked-up versions. “We will continue to strengthen the war deterrent, the righteous self-defense means,” against threats from “hostile forces,” Mr. Kim said during a speech at the parade, without citing the United States by name. When North Korea test-launched the Hwasong-15 in late 2017, it claimed the missile could reach any part of the continental United States carrying a nuclear warhead. Although North Korea has conducted three ICBM tests, it remains unclear whether the country has the technology to protect a nuclear warhead during atmospheric re-entry and deliver the weapon to its target. South Korean officials did not immediately comment on the missile displayed Saturday. But they have long said, based on undisclosed intelligence, that North Korea was developing a more powerful ICBM. In Washington, officials would not comment on whether the new missile was, in fact, more powerful than the North’s previous weapons. But one American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the Trump administration continues to pursue diplomacy with Mr. Kim, said the show of force indicated that the North was “continuing to prioritize its prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile program” and called it “disappointing.” Mr. Kim dedicated much of his speech to thanking his people, as well as his military, for enduring “huge challenges and difficulties,” including living under sanctions even as the country temporarily closed its border to its only major trading partner — China — to try to keep the coronavirus from slipping into North Korea. He also apologized to his people for failing to live up \u200bto \u200btheir expectations. “I am really sorry for that,” he said, \u200bappearing to fight back tears. “My efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life.” Mr. Kim’s emotional apology was “a shrewd way of placing blame on circumstances beyond his control, and deflecting attention from the enormous resources poured into nuclear weapons\u200b,” Jean H. Lee, a North Korea expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, said in an email. Mr. Kim’s speech was notable for its lack of anti-American and anti-South Korean diatribes common in North Korean statements. Instead, he offered his “consolation to all those around the world” combating Covid-19. Mr. Kim ha\u200bd already sent a telegram wishing Mr. Trump a quick recovery. North Korea had prepared for months for the parade on Saturday, the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party. The parade — which unlike earlier celebrations was held at night — was meant to lift morale after a difficult year that included devastating floods. Laden with spectacle, it featured fireworks and military planes firing flares in the night sky as columns of goose-stepping soldiers swore to “defend Kim Jong-un with our lives.” But the real highlight was an impressive array of artillery pieces, tanks, rockets and missiles. Analysts noted what they suggested were Mr. Kim’s careful political calculations in deciding how to celebrate the party anniversary, which comes just weeks before the U.S. presidential election. By displaying an apparently more powerful ICBM, Mr. Kim seemed to demonstrate the North’s growing military threat to whoever wins the election. But he also seemed to be hedging his bets, given what both he and Mr. Trump have called their special “personal relationship.” Mr. Kim declared a halt to all nuclear and ICBM tests ahead of his first summit meeting with Mr. Trump, in Singapore in 2018. Mr. Trump has called the moratorium one of his biggest foreign policy achievements. By showing off — but not launching — a new ICBM, analysts said Mr. Kim appeared to want to avoid provoking Mr. Trump ahead of the election. “The Kim regime is focused on domestic challenges and is waiting out the U.S. presidential election before starting another cycle of provocations and diplomacy,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “Parading a ‘new strategic weapon’ offers domestic political benefits without the risks of an internationally provocative missile test.” Mr. Kim became the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting U.S. president when he held his first summit with Mr. Trump in Singapore and agreed to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But his second meeting with Mr. Trump, in 2019, collapsed without an agreement on dismantling the North’s arsenal or easing crippling sanctions. In his 2020 New Year’s message, a defiant Mr. Kim said his country no longer felt bound by its self-declared nuclear and ICBM test moratorium and vowed to show the world a “new strategic weapon.” Until Saturday, no such weapon was displayed, as North Korea seemed preoccupied with fighting Covid-19 and extensive flood damage. During his speech, Mr. Kim reiterated his claim that the country had no cases of Covid-19, and a large, maskless crowd gathered for the parade. Outside experts are skeptical about the claim. Harry J. Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest, said that the new ICBM seems to be a derivative of the Hwasong-15. But he said that its size indicates that it could carry a deadlier nuclear payload, potentially even multiple warheads. “Despite North Korea being hammered this year by three typhoons, constant food insecurity issues, international sanctions and now threats from Covid-19,” Mr. Kazianis wrote in an email, “the Kim regime has shown the world once again its long-range missile program will continue to advance with each passing day.” Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington.']","The weapon appeared to be bigger than the North’s previous long-range missile, indicating that it might be able to fly farther with a more powerful nuclear warhead. But it is untested."
"As Virus Surges in Europe, Resistance to New Restrictions Also Grows",2020-10-09,By Marc Santora and Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — France has placed cities on “maximum alert” and ordered many to close all bars, gyms and sports centers on Saturday. Italy and Poland have made masks compulsory in public. The Czech Republic has declared a state of emergency, and German officials fear new outbreaks could soon grow beyond the control of their vaunted testing and tracing. Across Europe and beyond, Covid-19 has come roaring back, and, as happened last spring, officials are invoking restrictions to try and suppress it. But this time is different. Still reeling from the economic, emotional and physical toll of nationwide lockdowns that brought the Continent to a virtual standstill, government officials are finding that the public might not be so compliant the second time around. In some places new restrictions are accepted, albeit grudgingly, because the alternative — new nationwide lockdowns — would only be worse. But there is widening skepticism that the public would even go along with such a drastic step. Instead, as exhaustion and frustration with pandemic restrictions sets in, governments are trying to thread a narrowing course between keeping the virus in check and what their publics and economies will tolerate. That is especially so in democracies, where governments are ultimately answerable to the voters. “It is going to be a lot more difficult this time,” said Cornelia Betsch, Heisenberg-Professor of Health Communication at Erfurt University, in Germany, citing “pandemic fatigue.” As the crisis deepens, the once-solid consensus in many countries to join in sacrifices to combat the virus is showing signs of fracturing. New rules are challenged in courts. National and local leaders are sparring. In Spain, the government on Friday decreed a state of emergency in the Madrid area. The step was taken over the heads of the highest regional court and objecting local politicians, and within hours the nation’s main opposition leader called on the prime minister to appear in Parliament to justify it. The intense feuding in Spain reflects a broader political resistance confronting national leaders worldwide. Business groups are issuing dire warnings that whole industries could collapse if restrictions go too far. Sporadic protests, usually though not always, limited to a political fringe, have broken out. Public skepticism is fueled in many countries by the failure of governments to fulfill grand promises on measures like contact tracing, testing and other measures. In perhaps the most telling indication that people are either confused or done listening to guidance, cases continue to explode, including in places where new measures have already been promulgated. Portugal ordered new restrictions last month, but on Thursday recorded more than 1,000 daily infections for the first time since April. In the northern England, where new rules have come and gone and come again, the most tangible result has been sowing confusion, not slowing contagion. Officials are now warning that hospitals could face a greater flood of patients than at the height of the pandemic in April. The World Health Organization on Thursday announced a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases. Europe, as a region, is now reporting more cases than India, Brazil or the United States.  The pitfall of imposing stricter new measures has already been witnessed in Israel, the only country to order a second nationwide lockdown. It has led to chaos and rampant protests. “People view the decisions as political, and not health-based,” said Ishay Hadas, a protest organizer in Israel, arguing that masked outdoor gatherings carried minimal risk. “The main problem is the lack of public trust.” While issues around mask wearing and other prudent measures remain far less politicized in Europe, especially compared to America, the prospect of a winter under tight restrictions or even lockdowns is stirring new frustration and dividing political parties. With Britain expected to announce even more sweeping measures on Monday, many focused on curbs to drinking and carousing, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer has challenged the government to produce any scientific evidence showing that the early pub closings help slow transmission. Even people responsible for advising the British government cannot keep up and are at a loss to explain some of the measures. “People are very confused,” said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University of College London. Mr. West is a subcommittee member of SAGE, a scientific body advising the government on policy. “I couldn’t put my hand on my heart and say I know what the rules are,” he said. In part of the eurozone region that the W.H.O. team has studied in detail, about half the population is experiencing pandemic fatigue, Ms. Betsch said. These people were searching for less information about the virus, less concerned about the risks and less willing to follow recommended behaviors.  Slowing the spread of the virus, which thrives on human contact, still depends on individuals changing their behavior. “The only other option is to lock us up again,” said Francesca Del Gaudio, 24, as she and a friend, wearing masks like nearly everyone around them, walked through Rome’s Piazza Trilussa on Thursday, the first day of Italy’s expanded measures. “And we do not want that.” But if people choose not to listen to guidance, it remains to be seen if steep punishments will chasten them. Violators in Italy now face a 1,000-euro fine. Surveys in countries across Europe reviewed by the health officials show that a clear majority of people are willing to comply with regulations if they are well explained and easy to follow. People may also be more willing to submit to new restrictions if they see hospitals fill and death tolls rise, Ms. Betsch said. But Europe’s regulatory landscape is shifting so quickly that governments risk undermining basic guidance in their contortions to avoid further lockdowns Some steps have seemed simply nonsensical. In Spain, restaurants in Madrid were ordered to stop serving after 10 p.m., and to close by 11 p.m. — when many people are just considering sitting down to eat. “Everybody knows that we dine in Spain much later than in other countries, so not being able to stay open until midnight is pure economic nonsense,” said Florentino Pérez del Barsa, a Madrid restaurateur, who no longer professionally uses his legal name, Florentino Pérez Rato, to avoid confusion with the head of the Real Madrid soccer club. While public attention often focuses on those who shout the loudest — like the thousands who protested recently outside the Reichstag in Berlin and in London’s Trafalgar Square, calling the pandemic a hoax and a government-driven plot — they represent only about 10 percent of the public, according to a study from Germany. About 20 percent of people are against regulations, presumably for personal, emotional and financial reasons. But Ms. Betsch, who has been working with the W.H.O. research group, said the larger concern is roughly half the population — the “fence-sitters.” They are open to regulations but need to be listened to and educated, she said, and new government policies that are fragmented only compound the frustration. The choices facing national governments are onerous. The French government, watching anxiously as hospital beds fill up, extended its maximum-alert ‘‘red zone’’ to many major metropolitan areas including Lyon, Grenoble, Lille and Saint-Etienne in addition to Paris, Marseille and Aix-en-Provence. Residents of Toulouse protested on Friday, fearing their city would be included. Xavier Lencou, an engineering student queuing for a coronavirus test near Les Halles, in central Paris, said that more people around him were respecting measures like mask-wearing, unlike in the spring. But he worried stricter measures would push people past their limit. “If we have a new lockdown it might be worse, because people wouldn’t respect it.” he said. Jérôme Fourquet, a political analyst at France’s IFOP polling institute, said that managing the economy and epidemic was like “squaring the circle,” even more so now that “our maneuvering room is not at all what it was last March.” He said France’s government now has less to spend to prop up businesses and people are less accepting of any new restrictions. For Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, too, fears that a second lockdown would doom the fragile economic recovery have led to increasing pushback from citizens and companies. Ms. Merkel said this week that she does not “want a situation like the one in spring to repeat itself” — meaning another lockdown — and warned on Friday that the next 10 days would be critical. But the country’s mass-circulation Bild newspaper reflected the feelings of many Germans in its lead editorial on Friday, warning that a lockdown would lead to “mass unemployment, bankruptcies and never-ending strains on families and children.” “It is not a case of what Merkel wants, however — she MUST, together with the states and towns and cities, prevent a second lockdown!” the Bild editors warned. “In a free country the majority cannot be made to pay for the behavior of a few idiots.” In Germany, like in other countries, the focus is on changing the behavior of young people. “Isn’t it worth it to be a bit patient now?” Ms. Merkel beseeched them. “Everything will return — partying, going out, fun without corona rules. But right now, something else matters most, being mindful of one another and sticking together.” But public patience, in Germany and elsewhere, is precisely what is waning. It is important to follow rules like mask-wearing and hand washing, said June Nossin, 32, a Belgian-born therapist sitting at the terrace of a Parisian cafe. But there was a limit to what people could take. “If everything is banned,’’ she said, ‘‘people are going to go crazy.” Reporting was contributed by Raphael Minder from Spain, Christopher Schuetze and Melissa Eddy from Berlin, Adam Nossiter, Aurelien Breeden and Antonella Francini from France, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, and Elizabeth Povoledo and Emma Bubola from Italy.']",Public health officials say “pandemic fatigue” presents a real challenge to countries trying to enforce new measures meant to slow the virus while avoiding national lockdowns.
"Feared Shabab Exploit Somali Banking and Invest in Real Estate, U.N. Says",2020-10-11,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — The Shabab, the Somalia-based militant group that is Al Qaeda’s most powerful ally in Africa, is not only collecting millions of dollars in tariffs and payoffs but moving the money through local banks and even investing it in real estate and businesses, according to a new United Nations Security Council report. The report describes how the Shabab, known for suicide attacks and a severe interpretation of Islam that bans music and other pleasures, have diversified their funding streams. Although financial dealings with the Shabab are prohibited under Security Council sanctions, the report said the group had found ways to expand from strictly cash transactions into utilizing bank accounts and electronic mobile services to save, transfer and invest money. A Security Council panel of experts that monitors Somalia produced the report, which has not yet been made public. The New York Times obtained an advance copy. The Shabab’s deadly attacks have wreaked havoc in Somalia and across East Africa. The group sustains an estimated 4,000 fighters, and expands its power, by collecting money from around south and central Somalia, including in the capital, Mogadishu, the report said. The group charges vehicles transporting goods, demands that businesses pay a monthly fee and forcibly collects zakat, the annual alms that observant Muslims are expected to pay. The Shabab also have penetrated Mogadishu’s port, blackmailing importers to pay a levy on goods, the report said. In all the cases the report documented, business owners paid up, citing threats and violence if they refused. The report found evidence that Shabab operatives had stored and transferred the money through accounts operated by Salaam Somali Bank, a leading bank in Somalia. In response, the bank said that it had never “opened an account for a sanctioned individual or entity” and that it had taken unspecified actions against suspicious accounts, but it did not rule out the possibility that the Shabab had found surreptitious ways to use the bank. The country’s finance minister also acknowledged the Shabab’s ability to exploit the banking system and called the group’s financiers “very cunning.” The report comes just a few months before crucial elections in Somalia, a strategically located country in the Horn of Africa that has endured cycles of dysfunction and mayhem for decades. It also is contending with the coronavirus pandemic, swarms of locusts that are destroying crops and floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The Shabab pose a growing threat to Somalia and the region, even though the group has lost territory in the past five years, suffered high-level defections and been degraded by sustained American airstrikes. The report is especially damning for the Somali government, which is backed by the United States and the United Nations. They have insisted that Somalia take steps to modernize its banking so that groups like the Shabab that are under sanction cannot exploit the system’s weaknesses. “Al-Shabab’s use of formal banking systems enables the immediate transfer and distribution of large amounts, including in areas it no longer directly controls, eliminating the risk of physically transporting cash across hostile territory,” the report said. The Security Council’s experts on Somalia, a six-member panel based in Nairobi, are responsible for monitoring compliance with sanctions imposed on Somalia. The panel undertook the same work on Eritrea, another Horn of Africa country, until 2018, when sanctions there were lifted after Eritrea mended relations with neighboring Ethiopia. In past years, the panel’s reports have examined topics such as how food aid in Somalia was redirected by corrupt contractors and how the Shabab’s bomb-making operations became sophisticated. But the focus this year has largely been on the Shabab’s sources and movement of funds.  During the reporting period, from last December to this August, the report’s authors found evidence that the Shabab had generated about $13 million in revenue. This included an estimated $2.4 million from checkpoints in the Lower Juba region in southern Somalia and $5.8 million from charging businesses in the southern port city of Kismayo. The report includes redacted copies of receipts for these transactions. Two bank accounts associated with the Shabab — paid into by retailers, shipping agencies and car dealerships — generated more than $3 million. The report linked the transfers to the Salaam Somali Bank. In two separate accounts reviewed by the panel of experts — one receiving port duties, the other alms collection — the panel found large cash deposits and frequent transfers that exceeded the $10,000 limit that would have required the bank to report them. In one of the accounts, $1.7 million was transferred entirely in 87 transactions, with one person receiving $310,000. Over a 48-hour period in May, more than $322,000 was transferred from these two accounts to a third bank account, the report said, showing “an institutional link between the accounts and an organized approach to the distribution of funds.” The panel of experts recorded a total of 128 transactions that would have warranted disclosure to Somalia’s Financial Reporting Center, which investigates suspicious financial activities. A review of the accounts “revealed no obvious legitimate outgoings or expenditures,” the report said. In a statement, a Salaam spokesman said the bank had taken “appropriate actions against numerous accounts” believed linked to “suspicious activity.” The bank also said the United Nations had reached out to it about the panel’s investigation but that since the bank had not “received the details of these accounts” it was “unable to determine whether the appropriate action has been taken against these accounts.” After decades of war, Somalia has achieved a modicum of peace, as it looks to build functioning public institutions. This includes oversight of financial outlets like banks and the passage of laws against money laundering and terrorism financing. But enforcement by the weak Somali government remains inadequate, hindered by many obstacles, including the lack of widespread proof of legal identity. The U.N. report noted how identity documents used to open the Shabab’s bank accounts had been acquired just days before. A recent study also showed how the country’s informal hawala system of money transfer underpinned the sale and trade of illicit arms. In an interview, Somalia’s finance minister, Abdirahman Beileh, acknowledged the Shabab’s pervasive use of domestic financial systems. “We are meeting with the banks and informing them of the danger they are in,” he said in an interview from Mogadishu. Calling the Shabab a “mafia,” he said that whenever the authorities closed one loophole, the group figured out another way to move money. “These are people who are very smart and very cunning,” he said. The report also described the Shabab’s well-organized financial system, with regular audits to prevent losses. Besides spending on intelligence and military expenditures, the group has invested tens of thousands of dollars in property and business enterprises in Mogadishu’s bustling Bakara Market, which sells a wide range of goods and is the country’s biggest open-air bazaar. The findings prove how the Shabab are embedded deep into Somali society, said Rashid Abdi, an analyst and researcher who specializes in the Horn of Africa. “It’s no longer an insurgency but an economic power,” Mr. Abdi said in a telephone interview. “It’s a shadow state that’s out-taxing the government even in areas it doesn’t control.” The Shabab, he said, are becoming a “much more entrenched, resilient and deep-rooted organization that doesn’t have to rely on might or military force to stay relevant.”']","Despite sanctions, Shabab militants have found ways to extort, move and invest money using Somalia’s banking system, a United Nations panel says."

‘Call Me a Dreamer’: A Shattered Beirut Neighborhood Rebuilds,2020-10-11,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — After the August port explosion that disfigured much of Beirut, many compared the city to a phoenix that would rise again. “We are staying,” read some signs in the famous nightlife district of Mar Mikhael, one of the worst-hit neighborhoods. Down the main thoroughfare in Gemmayzeh, another badly damaged area whose graceful old buildings housed storied families and Beirut newcomers alike, it was the same: Residents vowed to return, and banners on buildings promised to rebuild. Two months later, some businesses have begun to reopen, and teams of volunteer engineers and architects are working to save heritage buildings. But even the bullish say they do not believe a full recovery is possible, pointing to the lack of government leadership and resources, combined with an imploding economy that has put even basic repairs beyond the wallets of many residents. If Beirut is a phoenix, it has already endured too much, they say: civil war; war with Israel; incompetent and corrupt governments; huge protests, the coronavirus and now this. Though they were traditionally Christian neighborhoods, Mar Mikhael, Gemmayzeh and the surrounding areas attracted young Lebanese of different religious backgrounds, as well as foreigners and tourists, to its bars, cafes and art galleries.Gay, lesbian and transgender people felt safe. Entrepreneurs and designers moved in. Dusty hardware stores sat a few doors down from trendy coffee shops. The explosion has threatened that unique social fabric, locals say. And not all are ready to return. It would feel like erasing what happened, a few said — like walking blithely over a grave. At the edge of Gemmayzeh, between a church and an antique chandelier shop, a narrow street darts up the hill at odd angles. Locals call it Thieves’ Lane, from long ago, when it was a quick getaway route from the authorities. Over the last year, antigovernment protesters dodging tear gas have often sprinted the same way and ducked into Demo, a bar with pleasantly worn wooden benches and experimental music thrumming from the D.J. booth. Its owner, Tarek Mourad, 38, opened Demo with a partner a decade ago, and it became a Beirut classic. The bar’s glass front was smashed in the explosion, and Mr. Mourad turned to GoFundMe to replace it. “When you spend years planting something,” he said, “and suddenly there’s something that cuts the plant down, you hope the roots are there.” But he was not sure whether everything that made Demo what it had been would return — the small shops and bakeries nearby that gave the street life, neighbors who stopped in for coffee or a beer. “Everyone that works at Demo, or lives around it, needs to get back and get their lives back,” he said. “But it’s not just Demo, it’s a whole neighborhood. For years, I walked through Gemmayzeh daily. Now it’s not there anymore. What form it’ll take, I don’t know.” Fadlo Dagher’s family began building their pale-blue villa on the main street of Gemmayzeh in 1820. To him, the houses in the neighborhood — and throughout Beirut — represent the tolerant, diverse, sophisticated country Lebanon was meant to be. “This is the image of openness,” he said, “the image of a cosmopolitan culture.” The houses — generally wide dwellings a few stories high, with red tiled roofs and tall, street-facing triple-arched windows opening onto a central hall — began appearing in Beirut by the mid-1800s, after the city grew into a hub for trade between Damascus, Syria, and the Mediterranean. The style blended architectural ideas from Iran, Venice and Istanbul. While the new houses’ walls were of Lebanese sandstone, their marble floors and columns were imported from Italy, roof tiles from Marseille, France, and cedar timbers from Turkey. Despite war, neglect and a 20th-century fashion for high-rises, many of the old houses stood untouched in Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael until the explosion, which seriously damaged about 360 structures built between 1860 and 1930. To abandon them, Mr. Dagher said, would be to jettison one of the few shared legacies of a perpetually fractured country. “I’d like to imagine that what is happening here, this diversity, this mixed city, that it still exists, that maybe it can reflourish,” he said. “Is it mission impossible? I don’t know. But, OK, call me a dreamer. This is what I want it to be.” Habib Abdel Massih, his wife and son were in the small corner convenience store he owns in Gemmayzeh when the neighborhood blew apart, injuring all three. He has spent his whole life in the neighborhood, watching it change from quiet residential area to cultural destination. “Suddenly, everything changed,” he said. “Most of the people I used to know have left.” He worried that rebuilding would prove too expensive, that neither original residents nor newcomers would come back. A few weeks after the blast, Mr. Abdel Massih, 55, was preparing to reopen his store. A cast sheathed his foot. He was selling water and coffee, he said. Not much else. Sursock is the name of the neighborhood up the hill from Gemmayzeh. It is also the name of the area’s main street, the museum on that street, the palace a few doors down and the family that lives in that palace. All are now damaged. Lady Yvonne Sursock Cochrane grew up in the palace, which was built by her forebears in the mid-1800s. She spent decades protecting it — first from Lebanon’s 15-year civil war (by staying put), and then from overdevelopment (by buying up neighboring properties). She was injured in the Aug. 4 explosion as she sat on her terrace, debris falling in a neat border around her chair. She died on Aug. 31, aged 98. Her last look at the house showed this: roof partly caved in; frescoed ceilings more holes than plaster; marble statues shattered; Ottoman-era furniture splintered; antique tapestries torn; intricately latticed windows blown in. Her son and daughter-in-law, Roderick and Mary Cochrane, are rebuilding. They do not yet know the price, only that it will be astronomical. “You restore things because it’s part of the history,” said Ms. Cochrane, an American. She was hospitalized after the explosion but recovered. “We take care of it for future generations.” Mr. Cochrane added: “Mar Mikhael and Gemmayzeh should remain a place for Lebanese, for small designers, small shops, small business owners. Without these, there’d be no Beirut. We’d be a city like Dubai.” Just off the main drag of Mar Mikhael — where the sound of laughter, clinking glasses and pounding car stereos once floated up from the pubs to the balconies nearly every night — sit Butcher’s BBQ and, nearby, a cocktail bar, Tenno. The main street is dark and quiet now; many homes remain uninhabitable. But Tenno is open. Bashir Wardini and his partners raised about $15,000 through GoFundMe, and in mid-September muted their doubts and reopened to host a friend’s birthday drinks. They had not been sure customers were ready to return. They were not sure they were ready, either. “Many of us, and our customers, said, ‘No, you have to reopen, you have to move on, because the street needs to feel some kind of life again,’” Mr. Wardini said. Tenno looks itself again, but the rest of the neighborhood feels wrong. Mr. Wardini said still he avoids going there, unless he has to. “It takes a few drinks too many to forget the surroundings,” he said.']",
Azerbaijan and Armenia Agree to Cease-Fire in Nagorno-Karabakh,2020-10-09,By Andrew E. Kramer and Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Azerbaijan and Armenia negotiated a limited cease-fire early Saturday after almost two weeks of fierce fighting over a disputed province, with the goal of pausing combat long enough to collect bodies from the battlefield and to exchange prisoners. The Russian-brokered agreement, which takes effect at noon on Saturday, was short on specifics. The issue of the how the cease-fire would play out on the front lines was left to the sides to agree to in “additional” talks. The four-point agreement said the warring parties would halt hostilities on “humanitarian” grounds for the prisoner exchange and to retrieve bodies under criteria established by the Red Cross. It was not clear if the Red Cross would oversee the process. Under the terms of the deal, Azerbaijan and Armenia committed again to negotiate for a lasting peace in the Minsk Process, a long-drawn-out diplomatic effort at a settlement that hasn’t prevented earlier escalations in fighting. Even before the announcement, the prospects for a broader peace deal appeared dim after the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said in a televised speech Friday that he was happy to have talks but was making no concessions. “We are winning and will get our territory back and ensure our territorial integrity,” Mr. Aliyev said. “Let them abandon our territory in peace.” The conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, flared late last month and has threatened to spiral into a wider war drawing in Russia; Turkey, a NATO member; and possibly Iran. “Ours is a tiny country, hardly visible on the map, but it could be the start of gigantic war,” Irina Grigoryan, a teacher of Russian literature who fled Nagorno-Karabakh a week ago, said in a telephone interview on Friday. The Russian Foreign Ministry initiated the talks after President Vladimir V. Putin warned this week that Russia could be forced to uphold its mutual defense pact with Armenia if the fighting spread. People fleeing the fighting on Friday described the violence as more intense than what took place during the yearslong war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the early 1990s that killed some 20,000 people and displaced about a million, mostly Azerbaijanis. Over the past two weeks, many in Nagorno-Karabakh fled to basements and shelters. Rafik Arakelyan, 69, and his wife drove their car into the woods and stayed there for six days, venturing home only occasionally for food. “It’s very brutal now — more so than then,” said Maria Ayrian, a 39-year-old knitting teacher who was injured by shrapnel as a girl during the earlier war. No drones, she noted, were deployed in the earlier conflict. The fighting on the front line this time has been so heavy that soldiers were not able to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades. “It feels like one day of this war is approximately equal to three months of the first Karabakh war,” said Tatul Hakobyan, an Armenian journalist who has covered the region for more than 30 years and spent much of the past two weeks in Nagorno-Karabakh. “I did not expect that there would be such a full-scale war.” Soldiers have been fighting in trenches along the front over small bits of territory, backed up by far more destructive weaponry than what they had available in decades past. Russia sells weapons to both countries, and Israel is a major supplier of drones and other sophisticated weapons to Azerbaijan. Armenia said on Friday that 376 of its soldiers had died in the fighting. Azerbaijan has not disclosed its losses. The United Nations estimated that as of Thursday, 58 civilians had been killed, including children, while apartment buildings, schools and other civilian structures had been destroyed. The Red Cross said that it had made an emergency delivery of body bags to Nagorno-Karabakh and was “looking at upgrading forensic capacities across the region.” Ms. Grigoryan, the Russian literature teacher, had fled with five grandchildren for the safety of Yerevan, the Armenian capital. Afterward, she said, an apartment where some of the children lived was bombed. “Can’t they stop the war, at least for a day or two?” she said. “Any negotiation is better than war.”  The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh has simmered for decades in a remote mountain region of little geostrategic importance, after a war in the early 1990s ended in a cease-fire but no wider settlement. That changed when Turkey, which has been flexing its muscles regionally in recent months, openly backed Azerbaijan, its ethnic Turkic ally, in an escalation that began on Sept. 27. Mr. Putin this week said that Russia would honor its defense agreement with Armenia if the fighting spilled onto Armenian territory, raising the prospect of Russian intervention. The fighting carried on Friday even as the Azerbaijani, Armenian and Russian foreign ministers opened the talks in Moscow. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry said that the two armies exchanged artillery fire across the front line overnight Thursday and into Friday, and that populated areas on its territory were hit. Rocket artillery on Thursday hit the roof of the Holy Savior Cathedral, a cherished 19th-century Armenian cathedral in the hilltop town of Shusha, partially destroying it. The cathedral was also partially destroyed in the Nagorno-Karabakh war in the early 1990s and subsequently restored. Azerbaijani state news media reported shelling in two districts on Friday. The country’s prosecutor general said that since the fighting started last month, 31 civilians had been killed and 178 wounded by artillery fire. The United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights on Friday had called on the militaries to halt the use of cluster munitions, which scatter small bombs over a wide area and are particularly lethal to civilians. The fighting also risked spreading the coronavirus, its statement noted. But Nagorno-Karabakh residents who had fled the fighting and crammed into hotels in the Armenian city of Goris, just outside the enclave, on Friday said they saw the coronavirus as a relatively minor concern. Reflecting the energy that has gripped both Armenia and Azerbaijan, volunteers staffed an aid distribution center providing apples, jugs of sunflower oil, cartons of wet wipes and bags of the Caucasian flatbread known as lavash to soldiers and the displaced. “We don’t want war,” said Sona Arzumanyan, a 20-year-old graphic designer who was overseeing the volunteers. “But if there is war, we will serve until the last drop of blood.” Mr. Arakelyan, who hid from the shelling for nearly a week in the woods in his car, narrowly escaped when the vehicle caught fire because of a mechanical issue. Eventually, Armenian journalists gave him and his wife a ride to Goris. On Friday, he was huddled in front of the flat-screen television in the crowded lobby restaurant of his hotel, where he and other Nagorno-Karabakh residents had received free room and board. He had lost his left leg because of a bullet wound in the final days of the 1990s war. Nearby, Ms. Ayrian, the knitting teacher, and several female relatives were knitting clothing for Nagorno-Karabakh soldiers out of rigid local wool. Their adult sons, brothers and husbands had stayed behind. “We have been fighting for 30 years,” Mr. Arakelyan said. “But there were never this many wounded and dead.” Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow, and Anton Troianovski from Goris, Armenia.']","The warring sides have reached a temporary truce, brokered by Moscow, allowing for an exchange of prisoners and collecting the dead, Russia’s foreign minister said."
E.U. Members to Adopt Travel Guidelines as Coronavirus Spreads,2020-10-09,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — European Union countries are expected to adopt guidelines next week aimed at coordinating their varying coronavirus travel measures, according to E.U. officials and diplomats involved in the talks. But the effort will stop well short of a harmonization of rules, as countries try to keep control over how they tackle a resurgence of the disease. The guidelines are intended to make travel restrictions, such as quarantine and testing rules, smoother and more predictable within the bloc. It would be a first step at restoring one of the union’s main tenets: the free movement of people within its territory. Representatives from the European Union’s 27 members, together with officials from the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, have discussed for weeks how to use shared criteria in judging regional responses to the coronavirus. Central to that would be the adoption of a single map using colors to denote the scale of outbreaks around the bloc, green at the low end of risk, orange in the middle and red at the high end. Other measures include unifying how quarantines and testing are done to smooth travel between E.U. countries and ensuring ample warning when national travel advisories are about to change to ensure travelers don’t get stranded. Travel in the bloc, the world’s most integrated group of countries, has become increasingly difficult and complicated amid the pandemic. Each country has its own assessment of the situation in other states, its own rules on travel measures, and ever-changing testing and quarantine demands. “Citizens have been severely affected by the travel restrictions imposed throughout the European Union,” Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, said in a statement. “I now urge all E.U. ministers to agree quickly on a coordinated and simple approach including: an EU-wide map, common criteria, and clear information on a weekly basis.” Under the guidelines expected to be approved Tuesday by E.U. ministers, members will adopt a regional map drafted by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, rather than produce 27 individual ones. Effectively, that will matter only when it comes to green zones, or regions within E.U. countries that pose low risk to travelers, officials said. National authorities will still to be free to make their own determinations on orange and red zones, based on advice from their own experts, the E.U. officials said. The text, which was reviewed by the Times, lays out criteria on how a region should be color-coded, focusing on thresholds for new cases per 100,000 people, as well as positive test results as a percentage of total tests. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control gathers much of this data from national agencies. And while E.U. countries will agree to give 48 hours warning before changing travel restrictions in response to worsening Covid-19 conditions — for example, imposing additional quarantine or testing requirements — they will not harmonize requirements for travelers. For example, a traveler from Belgium, which is considered a red zone across the bloc because of a very high level of infections, faces different restrictions if visiting Germany than if visiting Greece. That will continue to be the case after the proposal is adopted. The bloc will remain largely closed to nonessential travelers from the United States as well as most of the rest of the world. Officials said that the short list of nations from which travelers are allowed to enter the European Union, which now includes Canada and New Zealand, could be revisited this month. But they added that it was virtually certain that travelers from the United States would not be added at this stage because of how poorly the country is containing the pandemic. But new cases have also been surging across the European Union, and few regions in the bloc will actually be labeled green under the new set of criteria. In France, the number of daily cases rose to over 18,000 this week, triggering severe restrictions on public gatherings in a handful of regions. As cases in Belgium surge, bars and cafes have been shuttered in Brussels. And in Spain, which currently has one of the worst new coronavirus caseloads in the European Union, the government is considering putting the Madrid region under a state of emergency in response to a spike in cases. E.U. institutions have found it difficult to persuade individual governments to take a common approach, leading to a cacophony of measures that are harming the flow of people for work or family purposes, and compounding severe losses in the tourism and transportation sectors. Health and related policies are fully sovereign for countries in the bloc. The union does not have a legal basis on which to force policies onto its members, as it does on matters such as monetary affairs or competition. And in drafting national Covid-19 travel measures, E.U. members have in some cases taken into account factors unrelated to health, such as maintaining relations with their neighbors and staying open to large tourism markets. Hungary, for example, said in September that it would shut itself off to travel from all E.U. countries apart from its political allies, known as the Visegrad countries, namely Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland, without the decision being justified by health criteria. E.U. officials called the move a contravention of the principles of free movement of people and nondiscrimination within the bloc. Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.']",But the bloc’s 27 countries will remain largely autonomous in their approach under recommendations that are expected to be approved next week.
"As Trump flouts safety protocols, news outlets balk at close coverage.",2020-10-13,By Michael M. Grynbaum,"['Major news organizations have become increasingly wary of sending journalists to travel with President Trump to White House events and campaign rallies, as the president and his aides continue to shun safety protocols after an outbreak of the virus within their ranks. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post are among the major outlets that have declined to assign reporters to travel with Mr. Trump as he returns to the trail this week, saying they do not have assurance that basic precautions will be taken to protect reporters’ health. Foremost among the flouters is Mr. Trump himself, who, despite recently contracting the virus and spending three nights in the hospital, has shown little willingness to change his habits: On Saturday, he said the virus would soon “disappear,” and on the way to a rally in Florida on Monday, he boarded Air Force One — where reporters were seated in the cabin — without wearing a mask. At least three White House correspondents have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past two weeks, including a Times reporter who had traveled on Air Force One, Michael D. Shear. Safety concerns may also complicate Mr. Trump’s tentative NBC town hall on Thursday. NBC executives have asked the White House for proof that their employees will not face undue risks at the event, according to two people familiar with discussions. Among the concerns raised by reporters: Many flight attendants and Secret Service agents on Air Force One have not worn masks; White House aides who tested positive for the coronavirus, or were potentially exposed, are returning to work before the end of a two-week quarantine; and the campaign has instituted few restrictions at the raucous rallies that Mr. Trump is now pledging to hold. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany — who briefed reporters last weekend without wearing a mask, shortly before she tested positive for the virus — said on Monday that the Trump campaign would distribute masks but would not require attendees to wear them.']",
QAnon Is Thriving in Germany. The Extreme Right Is Delighted.,2020-10-11,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Early in the pandemic, as thousands of American troops began NATO maneuvers in Germany, Attila Hildmann did a quick YouTube search to see what it was all about. He quickly came across videos posted by German followers of QAnon. In their telling, this was no NATO exercise. It was a covert operation by President Trump to liberate Germany from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government — something they applauded. “The Q movement said these are troops that will free the German people from Merkel,” said Mr. Hildmann, a vegan celebrity cook who had not heard of QAnon before last spring. “I very much hope that Q is real.” In the United States, QAnon has already evolved from a fringe internet subculture into a mass movement veering into the mainstream. But the pandemic is supercharging conspiracy theories far beyond American shores, and QAnon is metastasizing in Europe as well. Groups have sprung up from the Netherlands to the Balkans. In Britain, QAnon-themed protests under the banner of “Save Our Children” have taken place in more than 20 cities and towns, attracting a more female and less right-wing demographic. But it is in Germany that QAnon seems to have made the deepest inroads. With what is regarded as the largest following — an estimated 200,000 people — in the non-English-speaking world, it has quickly built audiences on YouTube, Facebook and the Telegram messenger app. People wave Q flags during protests against coronavirus measures. And in Germany, like in the United States, far-right activists were the first to latch on, making QAnon an unexpected and volatile new political element when the authorities were already struggling to root out extremist networks. “There is a very big overlap,”  said Josef Holnburger, a data scientist who has been tracking QAnon in Germany. “Far-right influencers and groups were the first ones to aggressively push QAnon.” Officials are baffled that a seemingly wacky conspiracy theory about Mr. Trump taking on a “deep state” of Satanists and pedophiles has resonated in Germany. Polls show that trust in Ms. Merkel’s government is high, while the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has been struggling. “I was astonished that QAnon is gaining such momentum here,” said Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker in Ms. Merkel’s conservative party and member of the intelligence oversight committee. “It seemed like such an American thing. But it’s falling on fertile ground.” The mythology and language QAnon uses — from claims of ritual child murder to revenge fantasies against liberal elites — conjure ancient anti-Semitic tropes and putsch fantasies that have long animated Germany’s far-right fringe. Now those groups are seeking to harness the theory’s viral popularity to reach a wider audience. QAnon is drawing an ideologically incoherent mixture of vaccine opponents, fringe thinkers and ordinary citizens who say the threat of the pandemic is overstated and government restrictions unwarranted. Not everyone who now aligns with QAnon believes everything the group espouses, or endorses violence. Until a few months ago, Mr. Hildmann was popularly known merely for his restaurant and cookbooks and as a guest on television cooking shows. But with 80,000 followers on Telegram, he has since become one of QAnon’s most important amplifiers in Germany. He is a noisy regular at coronavirus protests, which drew more than 40,000 people in Berlin this summer, to bridle against what he considers to be a fake pandemic concocted by the “deep state” to strip away liberties. He calls Ms. Merkel a “Zionist Jew” and vents against the “new world order” and the Rothschild banking family. He no longer recognizes Germany’s postwar democratic order and darkly predicts civil war. During a recent interview at his vegan restaurant in an upmarket neighborhood of Berlin, admirer after admirer — a civil servant, a mail carrier, a geography student — approached to thank him, not for his food, but for raising awareness about QAnon. Experts worry that activists like Mr. Hildmann are providing a new and seemingly more acceptable conduit for far-right ideas. “QAnon doesn’t openly fly the colors of fascism, it sells it as secret code,” said Stephan Kramer, head of domestic intelligence in the eastern state of Thuringia. “This gives it an access point to broader German society, where everyone thinks of themselves as immune to Nazism because of history.” “It’s very dangerous,” Mr. Kramer added. “It’s something that has jumped from the virtual world into the real world. And if the U.S. is anything to go by, it’s going to gain speed.” The QAnon conspiracy theory emerged in the United States in 2017, when a pseudonymous online poster claiming to hold the highest U.S. security clearance — Q — began dropping cryptic messages on the message board 4Chan. Global elites were kidnapping children and keeping them in underground prisons to extract a life-prolonging substance from their blood, Q hinted. A “storm” was coming, followed by a “great awakening.” For historians and far-right extremism experts, QAnon is both a very new and a very old phenomenon. Made in modern America, it has powerful echoes of the European anti-Semitism of centuries past, which was at the root of the worst violence the continent has known. The idea of a bloodsucking, rootless elite that abuses and even eats children is reminiscent of medieval propaganda about Jews drinking the blood of Christian babies, said Miro Dittrich, a far-right extremism expert at the Berlin-based Amadeu Antonio Foundation. “It’s the 21-century version of blood libel,” Mr. Dittrich said. “The idea of a global conspiracy of elites is deeply anti-Semitic. ‘Globalists’ is code for Jews.” The ignition switch for QAnon’s spread in Germany was “Defender-Europe 2020,” a large-scale NATO exercise, said Mr. Holnburger, the political scientist. When it was scaled back this spring because of the coronavirus, QAnon followers contended that Ms. Merkel had used a “fake pandemic” to scupper a secret liberation plan. Then one far-right movement, known as the Reichsbürger, or citizens of the Reich, jumped onto the QAnon traffic online to give greater visibility to its own conspiracy theory. The Reichsbürger, estimated by the government to have about 19,000 followers, believe that Germany’s postwar republic is not a sovereign country but a corporation set up by the allies after World War II. The QAnon conspiracies dovetailed with their own and offered the prospect of an army led by Mr. Trump restoring the German Reich. On March 5, the elements of the two movements fused into a  common Facebook group, followed a week later by a Telegram channel. “That’s when QAnon Germany first started taking off,” Mr. Holnburger said. Two weeks later, in the middle of the lockdown, the German pop star Xavier Naidoo, a former judge on Germany’s equivalent of “American Idol,” joined a QAnon group and posted a tearful YouTube video in which he told his followers about children being liberated from underground prisons. A far-right influencer, Oliver Janich, reposted it to his tens of thousands of Telegram followers. Since then, the biggest German-language QAnon channel on Telegram, Qlobal Change, has quadrupled its followers to 123,000. On YouTube, it has more than 18 million views. Overall, the number of followers of QAnon-related accounts on all platforms has risen to more than 200,000, estimates Mr. Dittrich of the Amadeu-Antonio Foundation. On Tuesday, Facebook said it would remove any group, page or Instagram account that openly identified with QAnon. In the country of the Holocaust, promoting Nazi propaganda or inciting hatred is punishable by up to five years in jail, and two years ago the government passed strict legislation designed to enforce its laws online. But conspiracy theories and lies are not illegal unless they veer into hate speech and extremist content, and officials admit they have found QAnon’s spread hard to police. Some QAnon followers are well-known extremists, like Marko Gross, a former police sniper and the leader of a far-right group that hoarded weapons and ammunition. “Trump is fighting the deep state,” he told The New York Times in June. Merkel is part of the deep state, he said. “The deep state is global.” But many are people who in the early days of the pandemic had nothing in common with the far right, Mr. Dittrich pointed out. “You could see it in real time in the Telegram channels,” he said. “Those who started in April with worries about the lockdown became more and more radicalized.” These days you see it on the streets of Germany, too. Michael Ballweg, a Stuttgart-based software entrepreneur who founded Querdenken-711, the organization that has been at the center of protests against coronavirus restrictions, recently started referencing QAnon.  An eastern youth chapter of the AfD has used “WWG1WGA,” an abbreviation for Q’s motto “Where we go one, we go all,” on its Facebook pages. Even those on the far right who do not buy into the conspiracy theory have found it useful. Compact, a magazine classified as extremist by the domestic intelligence agency, has dedicated its last three issues to QAnon, pedophile scandals and the Reichsbürger movement. In August, it had a giant Q on its cover — and had to be reprinted because of high demand. Jürgen Elsässer, its editor in chief, was at the last big coronavirus protest in Berlin handing out Q stickers and Q flags. He does not believe in a conspiracy of pedophile elites, preferring to look at it as “allegories.” “Q is a completely novel attempt to structure political opposition in the era of social media,” Mr. Elsässer said in an interview.  After the pandemic, “the far right will reconstitute itself differently,” Mr. Elsässer said. “Q could play a role in this. It’s about elites, not foreigners. That casts the web more widely.” Asked about the dangers of QAnon, the federal domestic intelligence service replied with an emailed statement saying that  “such conspiracy theories can develop into a danger when anti-Semitic violence or violence against political officials is legitimized with a threat from the ‘deep state.’” The biggest risk, say experts like Mr. Dittrich and Mr. Holnburger, may come when the promised salvation fails to arrive. “Q always says: ‘Trust the plan. You have to wait. Trump’s people will take care of it,’” Mr. Holnburger said. “If Trump does not invade Germany, then some might say, ‘Let’s take the plan in our own hands.’” Mr. Hildmann already has some doubts. “It’s possible that Q is just a psyop of the C.I.A.,” he said. “In the end, there are no external powers that you can rely on,” Mr. Hildmann said. “Either you deal with it yourself or you don’t bother.” Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']","As the U.S. conspiracy theory goes global, it has found fertile ground in the putsch fantasies and anti-Semitic tropes long popular on Germany’s far-right fringe.

"After a 7-Month Wait, This Tourist Got Machu Picchu All to Himself",2020-10-13,By Tiffany May and Hisako Ueno,"['Jesse Katayama had planned to end a journey around the world 8,000 feet above sea level at Machu Picchu, the sprawling 15th-century Inca citadel high in the Andes Mountains. Then the coronavirus happened, stranding Mr. Katayama, a 26-year-old Japanese citizen, in Peru and shutting down tourism sites as a lockdown was imposed across the country. On Sunday, after a wait of seven months, Mr. Katayama finally got to visit the UNESCO world heritage site. And aside from a few guides, he got it all to himself. “After the lockdown, the first man to visit Machu Picchu is meeeeeee,” he wrote in a post on Instagram that included photos of him with a park representative. Alejandro Neyra, Peru’s culture minister, said in a virtual news conference on Monday that Mr. Katayama had been granted special access to the site in recognition of his patience. “He had come to Peru with the dream of being able to enter,” Mr. Neyra said. “The Japanese citizen has entered together with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country.” Before the pandemic, Machu Picchu welcomed thousands of visitors a day. Tourists typically have to apply months in advance for permits to enter an Inca trail that leads to the ancient fortress. Mr. Katayama’s original pass was scheduled for March 16, and he arrived two days before, at Aguas Calientes, a town at the foot of the mountain. But two days turned into weeks and then months. He rented a small apartment in the town and passed the time taking daily yoga classes, teaching local children how to box, and studying for various fitness and sports nutrition certification exams. He wrote on a crowdfunding website in 2019 that he dreamed of opening a boxing gym in Japan and wanted to travel the world to learn the best approaches from each country. Before reaching Peru, he taught boxing in Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya. Mr. Katayama told a Japanese news outlet that he had considered joining the emergency evacuation flights organized by Japan’s government in the spring, but found them too expensive. He ultimately decided to stay, postponing his departure in the hopes that Machu Picchu would soon reopen. His patience paid off in the end, and he became a bit of a local celebrity last week when La República, a major Peruvian broadsheet, covered his vigil and called him “the last tourist in Machu Picchu.” “I stayed with the sole purpose of getting to know this wonder and I didn’t want to leave without doing so,” he told the newspaper in a separate interview. News of his persistence had resulted in hundreds of well-wishers offering to petition the authorities on his behalf, he said on Instagram.  Mr. Neyra, the culture minister, said that the authorities had received a visitor application for Mr. Katayama and decided to grant him special access before his return to Japan. The pandemic has devastated Peru’s tourism industry, the country’s third largest generator of income. The industry employs more than 1.3 million workers, or nearly 8 percent of the country’s work force, the Lima Chamber of Commerce said in 2018. When travel stopped, most of those jobs were lost. Peru has also reported an increasing number of coronavirus cases, and more than 33,000 deaths. Mr. Neyras said that seven archaeological sites in Cusco, a city in the Andes, would reopen to small groups at 30 percent capacity on Thursday. A reopening date for Machu Picchu has yet to be announced.']","Jesse Katayama, a Japanese tourist, didn’t let Peru’s pandemic lockdown keep him from completing the journey of a lifetime."
Petition Targeting Murdoch Swamps Australian Parliament’s Website,2020-10-13,By Isabella Kwai,"['Most Australians would probably not choose to spend their weekends browsing Parliament’s website. But a petition calling for a public inquiry into Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in Australia, posted by a former prime minister, generated so much interest over the weekend that it overwhelmed the website’s cyberdefenses and shut down access to the document. The petition — posted on Friday by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd — asks the government to establish a Royal Commission, the country’s highest form of inquiry, into the dominance of Australian media by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corp and its impact on the country’s political landscape. “Murdoch has become a cancer — an arrogant cancer on our democracy,” Mr. Rudd said in a Twitter video on Friday. An inquiry, he added, would “maximize media diversity ownership for the future lifeblood of our democratic system.” The move was a very public attempt to challenge Mr. Murdoch, 89, and his global media empire, which contributed to the rise of right-wing politics and helped reshape democratic governments around the world. In the United States, Mr. Murdoch’s Fox News Channel and New York Post have been leading supporters of President Trump and critics of President Obama and other Democrats. His British newspapers are conservative stalwarts and one of them, the tabloid The Sun, was a leading booster of the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. But nowhere is his influence greater than in Australia, where News Corp controls about two-thirds of daily newspaper circulation, and Mr. Murdoch also controls prominent news channels like Sky News Australia. Ousted prime ministers like Mr. Rudd, of the center-left Australian Labor Party, have said News Corp and its outsized presence were partly to blame for their falls. And, critics say, News Corp outlets have undermined efforts to fight climate change, pushed governments into hard-line policies on issues like migration, and employed language and images widely seen as racist. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Murdoch has said that he is a climate-change skeptic, and his outlets have repeatedly denied charges of racism. A center-right former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has also been very vocal about his clashes with Mr. Murdoch, who he says helped drive him from power, in favor of a politician farther to the right. By Monday night, over 200,000 people had signed Mr. Rudd’s petition — even as technical issues over the weekend prevented some users from accessing the site. Such was the volume of traffic that it triggered defenses designed to stop bots from manipulating the site, the Australian House of Representatives said, adding that the website saw a 500 percent spike in traffic over the weekend. The site has since increased its capacity, it said, and the petition will close on Nov. 4. Even if support for the petition rises, the government, a coalition of conservative parties, is unlikely to approve a Royal Commission, and would not want to antagonize Mr. Murdoch, media and political analysts say. Even Anthony Albanese, the head of the opposition Labor party, has distanced himself from the petition filed by Mr. Rudd, who has long called for an investigation into News Corp’s influence in Australia. Mr. Rudd served as Australia’s prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and for a few months in 2013, and is currently the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. But the petition has tapped into a “a deep reservoir of discontent and frustration,” said Timothy Dwyer, an associate professor of media and communications at the University of Sydney, particularly among younger, center-left voters who oppose the climate change skepticism that has been a feature of Mr. Murdoch’s media outlets. David McKnight, an associate professor of media at the University of New South Wales, said Mr. Murdoch’s role in Australia highlighted the need for more public interest journalism. “Mr. Murdoch has a long history of interfering or trying to swing the result in elections,” he said. The blurring of opinion and news, and the shift in media consumption to online and social media, have given more even weight to News Corp, he added. Critics have pointed to a New York Times interview, published on Saturday, with one of Mr. Murdoch’s adult children, James Murdoch, who was once seen as a potential successor to run his father’s business. James Murdoch said that he had resigned from the News Corp board because of growing discomfort over the agenda of Fox News and other outlets. “A contest of ideas shouldn’t be used to legitimize disinformation,” he said. Even without immediate action from the government, analysts say anger against the elder Mr. Murdoch will continue to simmer. The question is whether a movement to build more media diversity — and in turn, address Mr. Murdoch’s dominance — will gain more momentum in the future, said Mr. McKnight. “People have long memories,” he said.']","More than 200,000 people signed a petition drawn up by a former prime minister calling for an examination of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in Australia."
"For Nagorno-Karabakh’s Dueling Sides, Living Together Is ‘Impossible’",2020-10-13,By Anton Troianovski,"['SHGHARJIK, Armenia — The concrete memorial to 30 Azerbaijani soldiers — pockmarked, stained and cracked — pokes out of the craggy mountainside next to the crumbling remnants of two junked cars. They died fighting for the Soviet Union in World War II, but the time has come, the current head of the village says, for the soldiers’ monument to go. “We also have our heroes now,” said the village head, Shahen Babayants, who is Armenian. Armenians and Azerbaijanis lived side by side in the Soviet days, until conflict over the disputed mountain territory called Nagorno-Karabakh exploded in the late 1980s into riots, expulsions and a yearslong war. The violence left personal wounds festering for decades, as stubborn as the tan and gray stone ruins of Azerbaijani villages still scattered in the Armenian countryside. In the last two weeks, those unhealed scars have erupted into a modern-day conflagration of trench warfare, drone strikes and artillery bombardments. More than 500 Armenian soldiers have died, along with scores of civilians and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis. A cease-fire brokered in Moscow over the weekend has failed to hold, and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has threatened a further escalation of his offensive. The new war over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Azerbaijan insists it is ready to fight to recapture the swath of land Armenia conquered in the 1990s, is emerging as this century’s deadliest conflict in the southern Caucasus region that separates Europe from Asia, between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The conflict has the potential to spiral into an even bigger crisis with unforeseeable consequences. It is already drawing in Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey, which is a member of NATO; Russia, which has a mutual-defense treaty with Armenia; and even Iran, which borders the region to the south. For the region’s populace, the war is a continuation of on-off strife over both territory and history, with roots going back more than a century. The days when the Soviet Union kept a lid on such conflicts, and Azerbaijanis and Armenians mostly lived together in peace, feel like an irrevocably lost world. “Each wants to say that he is the master of this land,” said Mr. Babayants, himself a refugee who left Azerbaijan in 1989. “To live together is, put simply, impossible.” He settled in Armenia, just over the border, in a village that had recently been home to Azerbaijanis. A few years after he arrived, the village took fire from Azerbaijani forces. The Azerbaijani graveyard, of all places, was hit. Beyond that border, a gray-green expanse of mountains, is territory that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but has been effectively controlled by Armenia ever since the 1990s war. It includes both the Armenian-majority enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and land that surrounds it and links it to Armenia. Some 500,000 Azerbaijanis were expelled, often violently, from that territory, and more than 200,000 were forced out of Armenia proper. For decades, international mediators have been looking for a way to hand territory back to Azerbaijan while preserving the safety of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. To Mr. Babayants, the lesson of history is that returning those territories is out of the question. For Azerbaijan, the loss of them has been a national tragedy. Azerbaijanis who lost their homes in Armenia and Armenian-controlled territory make up some 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s population. Their desire to leave cramped housing and to return to village life has been a potent political force in Azerbaijan, and it helps explain the domestic support for the escalation of the conflict by Mr. Aliyev, the Azerbaijani president. “They kept pressuring the authorities to return their homes to them,” said Avaz Hasanov, an Azerbaijani peace advocate who held frequent talks with Armenians during civil-society efforts to mediate in the conflict. “It was impossible to set that fact aside.” In Azerbaijan, many blame Armenian intransigence under Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who took power after a revolution in 2018, for pushing Mr. Aliyev to seek to resolve the conflict militarily. While Azerbaijan lost the war that ended in 1994, its rising energy wealth in recent years has allowed Mr. Aliyev to build up his military with armed drones and other sophisticated weaponry from Israel, Russia and Turkey that, analysts say, exceeds Armenia’s capabilities. Mr. Hasanov said that Azerbaijan had been bearing the situation for 26 years. “Now both we and them have ended up in this hole, and coming out of it will be very hard,” he added. Mr. Aliyev himself has roots in Armenia. The ethnic geography of the southern Caucasus is so complicated that part of Azerbaijan, the region called Nakhchivan, is cut off from the rest of the country by a slice of Armenia. The family of Mr. Aliyev’s father and predecessor as president, Heydar Aliyev, moved to Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani village, now called Tanahat, on the Armenian side of the border. These days, Tanahat is an expanse of stone ruins, with plum trees, bearing sweet yellow and red fruit, growing out of them. One of its few residents, Arsen Ogamyan, 67, was a teacher at the local driving school in 1990. Most of the village’s 38 Azerbaijani families loaded their belongings onto the driving school’s trucks — they even took their firewood, he says — and he and other Armenians drove them to the Azerbaijani border. Russian soldiers were on hand to ensure security. Mr. Ogamyan said the departure was peaceful. Historians and human rights groups say the larger exodus was precipitated by beatings and the threat of more violence. Down the road from Tanahat, in the village of Arevis, the mountains marking the border with Azerbaijan loom just a few miles away. The villagers were so nervous on Monday about the potential for an Azerbaijani attack that they refused to allow any photographs to be taken. The Armenians who moved to Arevis after the Azerbaijanis left kept the old Azerbaijani cemetery intact; but when Armenian villagers died in recent years, they were buried on the opposite hillside. The guard of the village school, Tigran Saakyan, recalled the inflection point as his once-friendly attitudes to his Azerbaijani neighbors shifted: the day in 1988 that his cousin arrived, fleeing the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, where anti-Armenian riots had taken at least 32 lives. That history of violence now underpins Armenians’ insistence that any territorial concessions to Azerbaijan in and around Nagorno-Karabakh could bring about the destruction of the Armenian population there. Reaching farther back into history, many Armenians note Azerbaijani ethnic violence directed against Armenians during and after World War I, and cite Turkey’s outspoken support for the Azerbaijani cause. “Turkey committed a genocide of the Armenians in 1915,” Mr. Saakyan said. “Now they want to finish the job.” There was violence by Armenians against Azerbaijanis, as well, including the killing of hundreds of Azerbaijani civilians in 1992, near the town of Khojaly. In both Azerbaijan and Armenia, views of the other as the enemy have hardened as a generation has come of age with no memory of living with each other on friendly terms. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has been posting drone footage to Twitter, set to dramatic music, showing what appear to be the last moments of Armenian soldiers’ lives as they try to flee incoming missiles. The Armenian Defense Ministry, which has less sophisticated drone technology, has released graphic video of dead Azerbaijani soldiers. “I can’t imagine two peoples in the world that hate each other as much as Armenians and Azerbaijanis,” said Serob Smbatyan, 30, a cardiologist in the southern Armenian city of Kapan who previously served in the military in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thomas de Waal, a British expert on the region who wrote a book on Nagorno-Karabakh, “Black Garden,” said he feared a further escalation by Azerbaijan now that more than two weeks of war had weakened Armenia’s defenses and frayed its fragile supply lines. In a worst-case scenario, he said, Azerbaijan could seek to capture all of Nagorno-Karabakh — not just the sparsely populated surrounding territories that were previously home to Azerbaijanis and are now controlled by Armenia. “It certainly does look like that peaceful coexistence in Soviet times was a bit of an illusion,” Mr. de Waal said. “They were living together — but also in parallel worlds, as far as their understanding of history went, and what belonged to whom.”']","Armenians and Azerbaijanis coexisted in Soviet days. But conflict over the disputed territory exploded in the late 1980s, leaving festering wounds that have erupted anew."
"In Belarus, Women Led the Protests and Shattered Stereotypes",2020-10-11,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MINSK, Belarus — With masked riot police officers massing nearby, threatening to attack protesters like him with batons and fists, Aleksei D. Zulevsky felt safe for the first time in weeks of anti-government unrest in Belarus: He was surrounded by hundreds of women he knew would shield him. “I feel protected here,” said Mr. Zulevsky, as fellow protesters, many holding red and white flags, the banner of the opposition, chanted at a rally last month. “Only cowards beat women!” In a country whose strongman president, Aleksandr. G Lukashenko, has openly scoffed at women as too weak for politics and told them their place was in the kitchen, Belarusian women have become the face and driving force of a movement aimed at toppling a leader known as “Europe’s last dictator.” That effort may be flagging, with Mr. Lukashenko refusing to give up power even though tens of thousands of people continue to come out to the streets of Minsk to protest every weekend. On Saturday many women, holding flowers in their hands, again protested in the city. They avoided forming a single crowd in fear of being arrested by police officers. But whether or not the protest movement succeeds in ousting Mr. Lukashenko, it has already shattered deeply entrenched gender stereotypes built up over generations. “Women were stronger in this situation,” said Tatiana N. Kotes, a film production designer and activist. “We had to assume a more significant role. Men’s dominating role in the society has collapsed.” The collapse began even before an Aug. 9 presidential election that Mr. Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, setting off two months of almost nonstop protests. To his obvious distaste, Mr. Lukashenko faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from a woman candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of a popular blogger who had hoped to run himself but was imprisoned before he could register as a candidate. Mr. Lukashenko mocked his rival as a housewife, a meek mother ill-equipped to debate serious issues of state with a veteran leader like himself. “She just cooked a tasty cutlet, maybe fed the children, and the cutlet smelled nice,” Mr. Lukashenko said in an interview shortly before the election. “And now there’s supposed to be a debate about some issues.” Adding to his rage and, perhaps, consternation, was the fact that the opposition, previously led by men and prone to bitter internal feuding, had united around three women — Ms. Tikhanovskaya, whom they backed as the candidate; Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of a would-be candidate who fled the country to avoid arrest; and Maria Kolesnikova, the campaign manager for Viktor Babariko, a jailed banker who had also hoped to challenge Mr. Lukashenko. With all the main male opposition figures knocked out of the race by arrest or flight abroad, Ms. Tikhanovskaya and her two colleagues ran a strategic and successful campaign, holding large rallies across the country while Mr. Lukashenko confined himself to Soviet-style visits to factories and military bases. “At our first rallies, we were amazed to see how many people turned up,” Ms. Tsepkalo, 44, said in an interview. “It was a symbol of the unity of Belarusians against the dictatorship.” Ms. Kolesnikova, the only one of the women to remain in Belarus after the election, achieved hero status when she tore up her passport to foil the government’s plan to deport her to Ukraine, and was then imprisoned. The emergence of women in the protest movement — while surprising to many and, to Mr. Lukashenko, an affront to the natural order — drew on an important feature of the country’s national psychology left by the traumas of World War II, when a quarter of the population, mostly men, was wiped out. Olga Shparaga, a feminist and lecturer in philosophy at the European College of Liberal Arts in Belarus, said the shortage of males left women to play an outsize role in rebuilding the devastated country once the war ended in 1945. Memories of this, she said, left even the most misogynistic Belarusians aware, deep down, of what women could accomplish. Wartime memories have been kept alive and introduced to younger Belarusians with no recollection of the war or its aftermath by Svetlana Alexievich, the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who has made the role of women one of the main topics of her work. “After the war, we children lived in a world of women,” Ms. Alexievich said in her Nobel lecture in 2015. “What I remember most is that women talked about love, not death.” But it is perhaps Mr. Lukashenko himself who, inadvertently, has done more than anyone to advance the cause of feminism. Casting himself as a classic Slavic “muzhik,” or real man, Mr. Lukashenko has sneered at women with such abandon that he has become a caricature of boorish misogyny and an easy target for attack. Sergei Chaly, a Belarusian political and economic analyst who worked with Mr. Lukashenko at the beginning of his political career in the 1990s, said Ms. Tikhanovskaya made a smart decision to portray herself as “a simple woman that just needs her husband and children, but who was selected by fate to fulfill a political role.” That appealed to voters wary of the dominating and masculine style presented by Mr. Lukashenko throughout his 26 years in power. “He got used to dealing with men by means of bullying and boorishness, but this didn’t work with women,” Mr. Chaly said. After their leading role in the campaign it was only natural that women would step up in the protests that broke out after Mr. Lukashenko claimed an implausible 80 percent of the vote in the Aug. 9 election. In the days that followed, the streets of the capital, Minsk, became a perilous conflict zone. Thousands of protesters, mostly men, were arrested, and hundreds were beaten and tortured. With the country in danger of sliding into violent strife as groups of aggressive young men appeared on the streets calling for revenge, women again took center stage. A small group of women activists organized a protest so conspicuously peaceable that, they calculated, even the most brutish riot police officer would hesitate to use force. Hundreds of women descended hand-in-hand on the central market in Minsk, forming a human chain that left the police clearly baffled about how they should respond. Beating unarmed women publicly risked embarrassing the law enforcement apparatus and opening up officers not only to public condemnation but perhaps even punishment by their superiors. “Our government is always looking for organizers, but this idea was in the air, it was a feeling shared by all women in Belarus,” said Irina G. Sukhiy, an activist who joined the women’s protest. The day after the first women’s march ended peacefully, thousands of women took to the streets in Minsk and other cities across the country. Mr. Lukashenko, who was counting that brute force would be enough to crush the protests, was thrown off balance and sought help from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The immediate answer was to isolate the women leading the protests and drive them out of the country. More recently, masked police officers, many of them visibly embarrassed, have made mass arrests of women demonstrators. But most of those taken into custody were released after fingerprinting and a mug shot. Even the leaders, like Ms. Sukhiy, were sentenced to only several days of administrative arrest. “They didn’t expect that a woman could stand against them,” said Ksenia A. Fyodorova, 47, an entrepreneur and activist, of the security forces. “We realized that you can only counter them in a way that would be diametrically opposed to what they did.” Speaking with reporters in Berlin Wednesday after meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Ms. Tikhanovskaya said the role women have played in the uprising was as determined as it was unexpected. “They are fighting for the future of their children,” she said. “They don’t want their children to be slaves of this system in the future.” In the face of official brutality, she said, the women have responded by showing “peace and love.” As a broad smile broke across her face, she added, “Now, Belarusian women are world-known, and this is wonderful.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']",The women who organized the political campaign and the subsequent protests against President Aleksandr G.

"For Trump, Defying Mideast Truisms Produced Breakthroughs and Backfires",2020-10-11,"By David M. Halbfinger, Ben Hubbard and Farnaz Fassihi","['JERUSALEM — He moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, breaking with those who said it would ignite the Muslim world. He withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and ordered the killing of a top Iranian general, defying those who said those moves would lead to war. He brokered treaties between Israel and two Arab states, disproving those who said such deals could only follow the creation of a Palestinian state. Again and again in the Middle East, where volatility has burnished or battered previous presidential legacies, President Trump has run roughshod over conventional thinking, advancing key policy aims or fulfilling campaign promises in ways that experts warned could set off a conflagration or blow up in his face. Not only did the predicted disasters not materialize, but in many cases his policies produced demonstrable achievements. The Arab treaties with Israel doubled the number of countries in the region that have relations with Israel. The killing of the Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, eliminated the leader of a network of dangerous militias. And the embassy move, rightly or wrongly, was a step previous administrations had shrunk from despite claiming to support it. But the bold moves often had major drawbacks: The Iranians resumed their nuclear project, and experts believe they may have enough nuclear material to build a bomb. The killing of General Suleimani scuttled any chance of negotiating a better nuclear deal with Iran, at least for now. The chances of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict appeared ever more distant. And political gifts to Israel and Saudi Arabia received none of the concessions in return that would have been expected as part of a negotiation. Mr. Trump approached the region more like a businessman than a politician, alternately squeezing adversaries and dangling economic inducements, and snagging opportunities where he found them. Remarkably, this scattershot, transactional approach bore fruit that a more strategic, diplomatic approach had not. But it also failed to persuade the Palestinians to compromise on their national aspirations and the Iranians on their ideology. Lacking an overall strategy for the region, critics say, Mr. Trump blundered in self-defeating ways, allowing Turkey to attack America’s Kurdish partners in Syria and worsening a rift among gulf allies that has impeded the containment of Iran. And his overriding focus on helping Israel and hurting Iran led to a hands-off approach to bloody conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya, which remain shattered and dangerous. In an interview, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser on Middle East policy, said the administration sought to create a “core stability” in the Middle East, in part by promoting Israel’s acceptance by Arab states, which he argued would keep terrorism at bay, reduce the risks to American soldiers and costs to its taxpayers, and put the region “on a pathway to a more stable place.” The president, he said, “took a pragmatic approach, which was to state the goals that we want to go to — set the North Star — and then work very hard to move things toward them.” Chief among Mr. Trump’s ambitious objectives: defeating Islamic extremists, bringing Iran to heel and achieving what he called the “ultimate deal” between the Israelis and Palestinians. During his term, the Islamic State lost its territorial caliphate and attacks by its supporters that once frequently terrified the West have grown rare, although the group remains a potent underground threat, launching frequent deadly attacks in Iraq, Syria and West Africa. The other goals largely eluded him. The Palestinians rejected Mr. Trump’s peace deal, and the prospect of its resuscitation appears remote. Iran has resumed enriching uranium — a direct consequence of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement — which has brought it closer to being able to make a bomb. And its allied militias are rocketing the United States Embassy in Baghdad so often that the Americans have threatened to close it. Mr. Trump prioritized arms sales over human rights, standing by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia after his agents murdered the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi and he waged a disastrous war in Yemen. And Mr. Trump’s plan to sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates shows signs of setting off a new regional arms race. His emphasis on deal-making, critics say, has ignored all but the economic sources of the region’s many problems. “The Middle East is not a bazaar,” said Lina Khatib, an expert on the region at Chatham House, a London research group. “And to try to solve its crises by treating it that way simply does not work.” The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the setting for Mr. Trump’s biggest failure, may also be where he leaves the most enduring mark. Eager to succeed where no other president had, he confronted the conflict quickly, cheering Palestinians who had dreaded being ignored — only to demoralize them by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American Embassy, steps widely seen as irreversible. The predicted uprising did not occur, but the Palestinians boycotted Mr. Trump. And he pushed them further away, slashing funding, expelling their diplomats from Washington and eliminating a consulate in Jerusalem devoted to their interests. When the long-awaited Trump “Vision for Peace” emerged in January, it read as though it had been drafted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, snubbing the main Palestinian demands and encouraging Israeli annexation of occupied West Bank territory. The Palestinians dismissed it in the most vehement terms. In a twist, though, the talk of annexation made possible a diplomatic coup. Annexation stalled amid Israeli political opposition, but it created an opening for a deal: In exchange for Israel’s “suspending” annexation, the U.A.E. would bring its under-the-radar ties with Israel into the open. The small gulf kingdom of Bahrain followed. More broadly, what had driven the U.A.E. into Israel’s arms was the Trump administration’s waning commitment to the region and newfound doubts about its willingness to send its military to the rescue, particularly after Mr. Trump refused to retaliate against Iran after accusing it of attacking Saudi oil facilities last year. “The Emiratis were looking around for who they could rely on,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former United States envoy to peace talks and ambassador to Israel. The region’s strongest military was the obvious answer. For the Palestinians, it was perhaps the unkindest cut: Much of their strategy to pressure Israel relied on Arab solidarity to deny Israel the acceptance it craved. For the Trump administration, a dud product launch became a marketing bonanza. “We were nimble and opportunistic,” said David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel. Moreover, Mr. Kushner argued, the deals with the U.A.E. and Bahrain would eventually force the Palestinians to come around. “They’re only going to be tough for as long as they have the resources,” he said. But few expect the Trump peace plan to be the basis of any future talks. “If you have parameters which are only supported by Israel, and rejected by the Palestinians, the Arabs, the Europeans and so on, they’ll probably not hold for long,” said Michael Herzog, a veteran peace negotiator and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Mr. Trump focused much of his attention on Iran, which he called the Middle East’s greatest generator of instability through its support for a network of militias active across the Arab world. President Obama had sought to entice Iran with the promise of sanctions relief and engagement with the West, an approach that led to an international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump declared that deal a failure for not addressing Iran’s missile program and aggressive behavior, and for permitting it to resume unconstrained uranium enrichment in 2030. So he replaced carrots with sticks, withdrawing from the agreement and launching a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at constricting Iran’s finances. In January, Mr. Trump took aim at Iran’s regional militia network, ordering the killing of its architect, General Suleimani. The approach alienated Western allies but won Mr. Trump plaudits from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., rivals of Iran who resented Mr. Obama’s negotiations with their nemesis. “Showing Iran the big stick, that was needed,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist. “This guy was Public Enemy No. 1 for many countries.” The pressure campaign — including sanctions on Iran’s oil sales and financial transactions — has choked its economy. Its currency plunged nearly 50 percent against the dollar in the last month. Iranian officials have spoken frankly about the distress but remain dismissive toward Mr. Trump. “He hasn’t got a deal, he hasn’t changed the regime, he hasn’t made Iran withdraw from the region and he has undermined moderates in Iran,” said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert and former State Department adviser. Mr. Trump and his allies say the policy has reduced the Iranian threat by degrading its ability to finance militias in Iraq and Syria, the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. “That’s money denied, it’s resources unavailable, it’s terror attacks avoided,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview. Iran has also dialed down provocative activity in the Persian Gulf in recent months, which administration officials cast as a direct result of American pressure. Iranian politicians, however, say it reflects a fear that conflict would only help Mr. Trump win a second term.   Mr. Kushner said Mr. Trump’s policies gave the United States a strong negotiating position. “The table’s set. Iran right now is stone-cold broke,” he said. “The goal here hasn’t been to make a deal. The goal here has been to try to set the table to make a good deal.” But such talks seem remote. Iranian politicians said the Suleimani killing would bar the country’s leaders from negotiating with Mr. Trump. “Even if he gets re-elected, it will be impossible,” said Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a reformist politician. For now, Iran’s militia network remains active, and its nuclear program is up and running, and rapidly approaching the ability to build a bomb. Regardless who wins the November election, Mr. Trump has brought about changes in the Middle East that the next administration must take into account. The momentum toward normalization agreements could continue, with Saudi Arabia, whose stance toward Israel has warmed under Crown Prince Mohammed, looming as the largest potential prize. A future United States administration could use that enticement to press Israel for concessions toward the Palestinians. But there is much concern in Israel about how the Palestinians would react to their abandonment by more of the Arab world. With Iran’s government in dire financial straits, some of its regional allies have questioned how long it can hang on. The next administration could use that distress as leverage, even if in the pursuit of drastically different objectives. Mr. Trump’s transactionalism may also have limits: Sudan’s new leaders have so far refused to normalize relations with Israel despite substantial financial incentives because doing so could leave them “morally compromised” among their people, said Ofer Zalzberg, Middle East director at the Herbert C. Kelman Institute for Interactive Conflict Transformation. Still, the id on display in Mr. Trump’s policies has earned measured praise in unlikely quarters. Even some critics said Mr. Trump’s lack of interest in traditional talking points about democracy and human rights had brought a new frankness to age-old discussions about the United States’ dealings with autocrats. “It takes away the illusions some people have convinced themselves of, that we used to be a force for good,” said Amy Hawthorne, deputy director for research at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “The harm is significant,” she hastened to add. “We don’t get that soft power back right away.” And Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group and a former senior Obama administration official for the Middle East, said Mr. Trump’s record held at least one lesson for his successors: The prospect of blowback from critics and allies need not be paralyzing. “They may not like what we’re doing,” he said, but Mr. Trump had shown that “if it’s in our interest to do it, we just need to forge ahead.” David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.']","Disregarding norms and accepted wisdom, President Trump went his own way in the Middle East and, in some cases, got what he wanted."
Turkish Defector Says He Was Ordered to Kill Politician in Austria,2020-10-13,By Katrin Bennhold and Carlotta Gall,"['One afternoon last month, a man claiming to be a Turkish intelligence operative walked into a police station in Vienna. His confession was explosive: The man said he had been ordered to shoot a Kurdish-Austrian politician, which he did not want to do, and asked for police protection. He also said that he had been forced to give false testimony used to convict an employee at the American Consulate in Istanbul. If true, the claims by the man, who identified himself as Feyyaz Ozturk, provide new insight into how far President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is prepared to go to pursue his foes. Mr. Ozturk’s confession, detailed in a police report which was obtained by The New York Times, could blow a hole in the conviction of Metin Topuz, who worked for the U.S. State Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration in Istanbul. In June, Mr. Topuz was sentenced by a Turkish court to more than eight years in prison on charges of aiding an armed terrorist group. The Topuz case is one of several against American citizens and U.S. government employees that American officials have said are groundless and that they see as an attempt by Mr. Erdogan to exert leverage in his increasingly antagonistic relations with the United States. Mr. Erdogan’s growing authoritarianism over the past decade has been accompanied by an aggressive campaign against perceived enemies at home and abroad, which began as he fell out with the European Union and intensified after a failed coup in 2016 that the president has blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. In Turkey, the crackdown has resulted in the imprisonment of tens of thousands of Mr. Erdogan’s political enemies, often on evidence that critics say is flimsy or fabricated. Abroad, it has involved the forced renditions of 100 or more Gulen supporters and has even stretched, according to French investigators, to the assassination of three Kurdish militants in Paris in 2013, although Turkish intelligence denies any involvement in those killings. Others living abroad have had notices served through Interpol for their arrest and complain of harassment and surveillance by Turkish agents. The Austrian government has long been concerned about the influence of Turkey’s secret service in Austria and this latest case has raised the alarm. “We are taking this very seriously,” Karl Nehammer, the Austrian interior minister, told The New York Times on Tuesday. He said he would not comment on the details of the case because the investigation was continuing. The prosecutor’s office declined to comment, saying in an emailed statement that the case was so sensitive that it was “classified.” A senior government official who is familiar with the case and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue while the investigation remained open, said that if the plot to attack a Kurdish-Austrian politician were confirmed, it would signal a new level of Turkish meddling in Austria. Just last month, a special police commission concluded that Turkey’s secret service had recruited agitators to help provoke violent clashes during a Kurdish street protest in the Vienna district of Favoriten in June and collect information on demonstrators. At the time, Mr. Nehammer said, “Turkish espionage and Turkish meddling in democratic rights has no place in Austria.” There are about 270,000 people with Turkish roots in Austria, the Interior Ministry said, and about a third of them are Kurds. Susanne Raab, the Austrian minister for integration, was even more blunt. “Austria has become a target of Turkish espionage,” she said. “Erdogan’s long arm reaches all the way to Vienna-Favoriten.” When Mr. Ozturk turned himself in on Sept. 15, he told the police that he was retired from a long career at the Turkish intelligence agency, known as the M.I.T., but had recently been tasked to carry out an attack on Aygul Berivan Aslan, a former Green Party lawmaker of Kurdish descent and a vocal Erdogan critic. He has since been detained by Austrian prosecutors, who are now investigating him on suspicion of working for a foreign military intelligence service. Asked for comment, a senior official in the Communications Directorate of the Turkish presidency said in an emailed statement that the claims were nonsense. “Mr. Ozturk was never affiliated with, nor did he ever act on behalf of, the Turkish intelligence,” the statement said. But the Turkish attempts to undermine Mr. Ozturk’s credibility in turn seem to raise questions about his reliability as a witness in the prosecution against Mr. Topuz. Over a four-hour interview with the Austrian police, the account by Mr. Ozturk, 53, was vague at times, especially when it came to his alleged job as a hit man. But it became very concrete when an officer asked him about Mr. Topuz’s case. According to the police transcript, Mr. Ozturk said that he had worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration until 2004 and that he had last met Mr. Topuz in 2005. Mr. Topuz, too, had worked for the D.E.A. as a translator, he added, something American officials have confirmed. A press officer for the D.E.A. in the United States said in an email that the agency had no record of Mr. Ozturk’s employment there but was checking with the office in Turkey. Mr. Ozturk said that in early September 2017, he had been asked to sign a witness statement against Mr. Topuz or risk going to prison himself. “They slotted me in as a witness and put an empty piece of paper in front of me, which I signed,” Mr. Ozturk said. “Otherwise I would go to prison with Metin Topuz.” “In Turkey, they always do it that way,” he added.  The police officers then turned back to Mr. Ozturk’s account of the alleged plot to attack a politician in Austria. Mr. Ozturk said he had been given orders to shoot Ms. Aslan and was first contacted for the job by a Turkish prosecutor in Istanbul in 2018. Originally, he was supposed to carry out the attack in March, but the lockdown got in the way of his travel to Vienna, he told the police. Mr. Ozturk, who has an Italian passport, said he got stuck in Rimini, Italy, where he ended up breaking a leg in an accident. In the end, he told his handlers that he could not go ahead with the attack. Then in August, he said, he was contacted on WhatsApp by a man who told him to travel to Belgrade, Serbia, and meet a contact in a Turkish coffee shop. “It doesn’t matter if she dies or is only injured,” his contact told him there, Mr. Ozturk recounted to the Austrian police. The main point was “that the politician gets the message,” he reported that the contact had said, telling him to travel to Vienna and await further instructions. Asked in the police interview why he had turned himself in, Mr. Ozturk said it was perhaps to save himself. “The Austrian police could catch me afterward,” he continued. “I don’t like this kind of thing. I am no contract killer.” “If this had happened, they would have distanced themselves from me and said I am a criminal,” he said of the Turkish authorities. He also said that the Turkish authorities had frozen his and his family’s bank accounts.  In a later police interview, Mr. Ozturk also named other targets he had been given in addition to Ms. Aslan, the Austrian-Kurdish politician. Peter Pilz, the publisher of the online magazine ZackZack, which was the first to publish Mr. Ozturk’s account, said that the police had told him he was one of those targets and had offered him protection. Mr. Pilz, also a former Green Party lawmaker, served on the intelligence oversight committee and is a longstanding and vocal critic of Mr. Erdogan and his treatment of the Kurdish population. He knows Ms. Aslan well. She has been threatened many times over the years, he said. “He got the order to shoot a politician in Austria, the question is: Who gave the order?” Mr. Pilz said. “In the case against Mr. Topuz, things are legally absolutely clear,” he added. “The key witness in the case has retracted his statement. The case needs to be reopened.” The U.S. embassy in Ankara, the Turkish capital, and Mr. Topuz’s lawyers declined to comment on Mr. Ozturk’s claims or the effect that they may have on the case, which has gone to appeal. But Mr. Ozturk’s statement in the indictment was central to Mr. Topuz’s conviction, alleging that Mr. Topuz had worked closely with members of the Gulen organization in the Turkish police and prosecutor’s office. Yet Mr. Ozturk never appeared in court in person and was never cross-examined. The judge prolonged the trial several times to wait for Mr. Ozturk to return from abroad. In June, the judge ruled that the trial would proceed without his appearance. But contrary to normal legal procedure, he did not order Mr. Ozturk’s testimony to be ignored.']","The testimony by the man, who claimed to be an intelligence agent, offers insight into President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s pursuit of foes and undermines the conviction of a U.S. Consulate employee in Istanbul."
"At a campaign rally, Trump offers to give ‘a big fat kiss’ to attendees.",2020-10-13,By Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni,"['President Trump, eager to prove he is healthy and energetic despite his recent hospitalization for Covid-19, returned to the campaign trail on Monday night in Florida, telling supporters he was fully recovered and therefore immune to the coronavirus — a claim for which there is no conclusive scientific backing. Onstage at a hangar at the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Mr. Trump said he felt “so powerful” and offered to wade into the crowd. “I’ll kiss everyone in that audience,” he said. “I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women. Just give you a big fat kiss.” The president spoke for about an hour. Many supporters in the crowd did not wear masks, including some of those chosen to stand behind the president’s lectern and within the camera shot. Mr. Trump claimed that vaccines against the virus “are going to be distributed very shortly,” although the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved one. The president also implied without evidence that the agency was deliberately holding back on vaccine approvals to hurt his chances of re-election. (Read a fact check of Mr. Trump’s claims on Monday here.) “Frankly, it’s a big political deal going on where they don’t want it to be before the election,” the president said. Mr. Trump, whose response to a pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans remains the biggest threat to his re-election, also claimed without evidence that his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., would delay the vaccine and “prolong the pandemic.” Mr. Trump’s arrival in Florida took place only hours after the White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said the president had tested negative “on consecutive days” using a rapid coronavirus test not intended for that purpose. Experts cautioned that the test’s accuracy has not yet been investigated enough to be sure that the president is virus-free or, as his doctor claimed, “not infectious to others.” With three weeks left in the race, Mr. Trump is running behind Mr. Biden. His polling numbers with seniors, a crucial constituency that has been disproportionately harmed by the coronavirus, have been flagging. Hours before Monday’s rally, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, warned that holding large rallies was “asking for trouble” with cases of the virus surging in many states. Dr. Fauci, in an interview with CNN, said that Americans needed to be more cautious in the fall and winter months, and warned that rising rates of infections in a number of states suggested Americans should be “doubling down” on precautions rather than casting them aside.']",
"With Elections Ahead, Some African Presidents Try Engineering Results",2020-10-11,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — The president of the West African nation of Guinea is running for a third term on Oct. 18, even though Guinea requires its presidents to step down after two. But because of a constitutional change he initiated, his first two terms don’t count. The president in neighboring Ivory Coast has made his first two terms disappear with a constitutional amendment, too. So he is also running for a third-but-actually-first term, on Oct. 31. And after 34 years in power, Uganda’s 76-year-old president plans to run for re-election in February. The age limit for presidents in Uganda was 75, but then he changed the constitution, and sought to prove his fitness to stay in office with a demonstration of his red-carpet workout routine in the State House — to the howls of many Ugandans. While much of the world may be focused on the contest for the top job in the United States, presidential elections are also set to take place in at least 10 of Africa’s 54 countries over the next five months. All of the incumbents but one want to stay in office. While most African presidents since 1990 have stepped down after their terms were up, many are now bending the rules to ensure they stay in power. Some have manipulated supreme courts and electoral commissions; others have changed constitutions, prosecuted opposition candidates or prevented them from running by imposing onerous qualifying criteria. But countries like the United States that once claimed to stand against those undermining democracy are now turning inward and so, some political thinkers say, incumbents are increasingly getting away with it. “Too many of our countries have not stood by the protocols and the resolutions that we have made in our regional institutions. Regarding democracy. Regarding term limits. Regarding the transfer of power in a regular and peaceful way,” said Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia. “And those shifts are coming also because of the changes in the geopolitical landscape.” European colonizers frequently damaged or destroyed Africa’s own systems and traditions of holding power to account, as historians have chronicled. Post-colonial African governments have instead relied on imported, sometimes ill-fitting political systems. And at around 60 years old, these systems are still younger than many current presidents. In March, Ivory Coast’s President Alassane Ouattara, 78, was basking in praise for saying he would step down when he had completed his two terms — despite arguing that he didn’t have to, because a constitutional change meant his term clock was reset to zero. But four months later his chosen successor suddenly died, and the president judged that no other candidate would do. Like his predecessors, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Ivory Coast’s first president, under whom Mr. Ouattara served as prime minister, and Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to leave office in 2011 set off the country’s second bloody civil war within a decade, Mr. Ouattara decided to hang on — calling it a “real sacrifice.” Protests spread across the country. Then two of the front-runners were barred from standing in the election — Mr. Gbagbo, who last year was acquitted of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, and Guillaume Soro, a former prime minister and rebel leader living in exile, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail in absentia in April. Four candidates remain, though 40 were disqualified. “Not allowing the others to be candidates will surely bring another war,” said Mélodie Gnékonté, a secretary who said her uncle, an army doctor, had been killed during the last war. Ivory Coast’s economic growth is second only to Ethiopia’s in Africa, but Ms. Gnékonté said President Ouattara was “spoiling” everything he had achieved by “finding reasons to stay in power.” The coups of the 1970s and 1980s are now mostly a thing of the past. Since 2015, there have been at least 30 peaceful transitions of power in sub-Saharan African countries, including in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria, where governing parties lost elections. Rigging outcomes on Election Day, by stuffing ballot boxes or changing vote tallies, has become more difficult in recent years, said Mathias Hounkpe, a specialist in political governance at the Open Society Initiative West Africa. Politicians are changing their tactics as a result, he said. “Little by little, those in power are realizing that it’s becoming harder to cheat,” Mr. Hounkpe said in an online debate. “They use the means they have to keep the political space in check.” Across French-speaking West Africa, civic space is shrinking, so that citizens trying to hold their governments to account face repressive laws, arrest and sometimes death, according to a report to be published by the global nonprofit Civicus. Case in point: recent deadly clashes in Guinea, over the new constitution pushed by the country’s first democratically elected president, Alpha Condé. His success at maneuvering to stay in power is partly the fault of Western negligence, said Cellou Dalein Diallo, the Guinean opposition leader. “The Europeans are less attentive, and the Americans, with the arrival of Trump, are less demanding when it comes to democracy and human rights,” Mr. Diallo said on a recent campaign trip to Dakar, Senegal, where a large Guinean diaspora lives.   Secretary of State Michael Pompeo issued a two-paragraph statement last week about “upcoming elections in Africa,” warning that “repression and intimidation have no place in democracies.” But many Africans commented on social media that such a skimpy, blanket statement about the continent, rather than specific countries, was evidence that there is little interest from the administration of President Trump, who denigrated African countries with a memorable epithet in 2018. When Mr. Diallo got back to Guinea, President Condé accused him of going there to recruit mercenaries and attack his own country, which Mr. Diallo strongly denies. But President Condé closed the border. As a result, many Guineans living abroad may be unable to return to cast their votes. And some of those at home, who can vote, say politicians are trying to sow division. “Power shouldn’t be something they cling to, knowing that there are people who could do better,” said Fanta Traoré, a student at the French University of Guinea. In Uganda, political rallies are banned because of the coronavirus, making it harder for opposition candidates. To reach voters, candidates have to rely on the news media, over which President Yoweri Museveni and the governing party exert great influence. Tanzania’s political space is shrinking rapidly too. The opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who spent three years in exile after an assassination attempt, has returned to the country to run for president, but says the police are disrupting his campaign. He says he fears for his life. Until recently, Gambia was riding on the joyful high that followed the dislodging of its longtime autocratic president in 2016. But the new president reneged on his promise to serve for only three years. Last month, his supporters in the National Assembly rejected a new, transformative constitution because, civil rights activists say, it would limit the new president to a decade in power. The other countries set to have elections in the next five months are Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Ghana and Seychelles. The only country where the incumbent is not running is Niger. Like constitutions, coups — while now rare — are evolving too. When soldiers abducted Mali’s democratically elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, on Aug. 18, and forced him to resign on state television, they denied that this constituted a coup. They presented it as the will of the people and peppered their speeches with pro-democracy language that seemed designed to be palatable to Mali’s Western partners, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. On a video conference two days later, 14 West African presidents discussed the coup. Putschism was a grave disease, Niger’s president said. Others appeared worried their countries might catch it. If Mali’s coup leaders got away with this, would it inspire Ivory Coast’s or Guinea’s citizens to rise against their own tenacious presidents? But it was the presidents’ newest colleague who gave voice to what many West Africans citizens have expressed. All coups d’état should be condemned, said Umaro Sissoco Embaló, the president of Guinea-Bissau. Third terms, he said, also count as coups. Abdi Latif Dahir contributed reporting from Nairobi, Kenya; Eromo Egbejule from Abidjan, Ivory Coast; and Saikou Jammeh from Banjul, Gambia.']",Presidential elections are scheduled soon in at least 10 African countries.

"Israel Accepts Ethiopians of Jewish Descent, but Fewer Than Promised",2020-10-12,By Adam Rasgon,"['JERUSALEM — The Israeli government on Monday approved an airlift of 2,000 Ethiopians of Jewish descent to Israel in the coming months, prompting angry reactions from Ethiopian Israeli activists who insist that about 8,000 should be resettled. Israel permits Jews around the world to settle there under its Law of Return, but does not grant that right to people known as Falash Mura, descendants of Ethiopian Jews who converted to Christianity about a century ago, many under duress, though they identify as Jewish or of Jewish lineage. “We need all of our brothers and sisters to be brought here,” said Kassahun Shiferaw, an Ethiopian Israeli activist. “Only allowing part of them to come is not sufficient.” Jews in Ethiopia, known as Beta Israel, were largely cut off from the mainstreams of Judaism for millenniums and their faith evolved in somewhat different form, but Israeli authorities have generally recognized them as Jewish. Since the 1970s, tens of thousands have been admitted from Ethiopia, where they had faced persecution. But what was once celebrated as a heartwarming story of rescue and solidarity has taken on a less rosy hue, raising questions about racial acceptance in Israel. Israelis of Ethiopian descent, who number about 150,000, say they often face discrimination and excessive use of force by the police. Many of them have had trouble integrating into Israeli society, and their rates of poverty and unemployment are high. The position of the Falash Mura — a term some of them consider demeaning — is more tenuous than that of the larger Beta Israel population. Though many of the descendants of converts to Christianity are observant Jews, the Israeli government does not consider them to be fully Jewish. They require special permission to migrate to Israel, and upon arriving in the country must undergo a conversion process, even if they already practice Judaism. In November 2015, Israel approved a plan to bring the remaining Falash Mura, about 10,000 people, to its territory by the end of 2020. But a few months after the decision, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it would not follow through on the plan due to budget constraints. Since then, Israel has allowed around 2,000 of the Ethiopians to immigrate. The plan approved on Monday would admit about one-quarter of the roughly 8,000 who remain, living in mostly run-down communities in the Ethiopian cities of Addis Ababa, the capital, and Gondar. Some have been trying to relocate to Israel for 20 years. “There have been too many broken promises,” said Mr. Shiferaw. “The time has come for executing decisions.” In a letter to Mr. Netanyahu, current and retired Israeli military officers from the Ethiopian community blasted the government decision. “It is unfathomable that the immigration from around the world continues, while quotas and limits are only placed on immigration of Ethiopian Jews,” said the officers, all of whom have siblings or parents waiting in Ethiopia to come to Israel. Pnina Tamano-Shata, the minister of immigration and absorption who spearheaded the plan to bring the 2,000 Ethiopians, called the government decision “very exciting,” but she acknowledged that she was sympathetic to the criticisms against it. “They are right,” said Ms. Tamano-Shata, the first Ethiopian Israeli to serve as a government minister, referring to the Ethiopian Israeli activists. “I think we need to bring everyone here as soon as possible, but unfortunately we only received a budget for 2,000 people this time.” The minister said she planned to present to the government a plan to relocate another 7,000 Ethiopians to Israel in 2021 and 2022, and the rest in 2023. Ms. Tamano-Shata said the government had allocated $109,320,000 to bring the 2,000 Ethiopians to Israel and assist them with their absorption into Israeli society. She also said all of them would receive coronavirus tests before entering Israel and would be required to quarantine for two weeks at special facilities or family members’ homes. Mr. Netanyahu said he had spoken last week with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who he said had promised to help with Israel’s effort to bring the Ethiopians to its territory. Sefy Bililin, an Israeli Ethiopian who is waiting for her two sisters, 22 and 29, to come from Addis Ababa to Israel, said she was praying they would be included in the 2,000. “It’s impossible to know if they will make it this time, but I really hope they do,” said Ms. Bililin, 25, who last saw her sisters a year ago on a trip to Ethiopia. “I don’t want to even think about the possibility that they’ll be left behind again.” In Addis Ababa, Amare Ezra said both of his parents had already moved to Israel but he was still stuck in Ethiopia. “I’ve been here for 18 years,” waiting to go, said Mr. Ezra, 40. “I’m wishing it will finally happen.” Simon Marks contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.']","Israel has been slow to admit Ethiopians whose ancestors converted to Christianity, not seeing them as fully Jewish even if they practice Judaism."

Italy tightens rules for the second time in a week to slow infections.,2020-10-13,By Emma Bubola,"['The Italian government continued to tighten restrictions in an effort to stem a resurgence in virus cases, announcing on Tuesday a ban on informal amateur contact sports, parties and school trips. The decree, signed by Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte, represents a second crackdown in less than a week as the second wave of the coronavirus, which seemed to have hit Italy less violently than other European countries, is now gaining strength, with 4,619 new cases registered on Monday. The new decree introduces a general ban on parties and recommends private gatherings be limited to no more than six people inside homes. It also sets a limit of 30 guests for banquets organized after religious or civil ceremonies. To avoid crowds, Mr. Conte also ordered restaurants, bars and ice-cream sellers to stop serving non-seated customers after 9 p.m. While contact sports, such as soccer or basketball, are now banned in informal contexts, trainings and matches organized by clubs are still permitted. Italy is still in a better position compared with countries such as Spain or France, and while the number of daily infections is similar to those reached in Italy during the spring, the number of deaths and of patients in intensive care units remains lower. But in Italy, the first and one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, the level of alert and the fear of a new lockdown remain high. “I would exclude a new lockdown,” Mr. Conte told reporters on Monday, “We specifically worked to prevent a new generalized lockdown.”']",
Leading Slovak Extremist Sentenced to 4 Years in Jail Over Use of Neo-Nazi Symbol,2020-10-13,By Miroslava German Sirotnikova,"['BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — A Slovakian court has sentenced the country’s leading neo-fascist politician to more than four years in prison after he used a well-known neo-Nazi symbol. The politician, Marian Kotleba, the head of the extremist People’s Party Our Slovakia, was convicted of founding, supporting and promoting a movement and ideology aimed at suppressing civil rights and democratic freedoms. His sentencing on Monday was the culmination of a high-profile trial that lasted several months. “It is a testimony of change,” Grigorij Meseznikov, a political scientist at the Public Affairs Institute in Bratislava, said on Tuesday. “What it means for the country is that the legal tools against those who undermine the democracy are finally working.” The conviction of Mr. Kotleba was a blow to the country’s far-right movement, which gained popularity at the height of the migration crisis in 2015. Mr. Kotleba’s party, which opposes Slovakia’s membership in the European Union and NATO, entered the Parliament in 2016. The party drew energy from broad public disgust with a political system rife with corruption. But in February 2018, the murders of a young investigative reporter and his fiancée set off the largest protests since the 1989 Velvet Revolution, leading to the collapse of the longtime governing party and paving the way for a new, conservative government coalition. The current government has presided over a more effective enforcement of laws to battle extremism and corruption. Mr. Kotleba’s party kept its support, winning roughly 8 percent of the vote in the February election and remaining part of the opposition in Parliament. Mr. Kotleba used to appear in uniforms reminiscent of those worn during the wartime Slovak State, which was run by the Nazi puppet regime led by a former Roman Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso. But as Mr. Kotleba’s party moved into the mainstream, he shifted his attacks from Jews to immigrants and the country’s Roma minority. The case against Mr. Kotleba centered on the distribution of three checks for 1,488 euros to families in need at a public event in 2017. The prosecutor Tomas Honz argued in court that the amount of each check — 1,488 — was a clear reference to neo-Nazi ideology. According to the prosecutors and expert witnesses, the number 14 was a reference to “14 Words,” a popular white supremacist slogan. They said the number 88 was an allusion to the Nazi salute “Heil Hitler,” in which each word begins with the eighth letter in the English alphabet. The special court for organized crime in the town of Pezinok sentenced Mr. Kotleba to four years and four months in prison. He has said he will appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court, and he will remain in Parliament until the appeal process is complete. But if his conviction is upheld, he can never run for election again and he would be the first sitting member of parliament to go to jail since Slovakia became independent in 1993. “The words themselves don’t mean anything,” Judge Ruzena Sabova said in her verdict, adding that the numbers had meaning only in the context that they are signs of extremism. In an eight-hour speech on Monday, Mr. Kotleba argued that the numbers were coincidental and the trial unfair. In an attempt to drag out the proceedings, he pulled a number of stunts. They included reading out long lists of items or contracts priced with similar sums and commenting on all of the witness testimony. “The event was not neo-Nazi,” Mr. Kotleba said during the trial. “The event had a beautiful, Christian and national character, and I handed charity checks to three families.” Losing patience with the theatrics in the courtroom, Judge Sabova fined him €500, or about $590, for disrespecting the court. Mr. Honz, the prosecutor, told reporters that the court’s ruling was a victory in Slovakia’s fight against extremism. “It is a message for all the democrats in Slovakia that the courts and prosecution will stand up for people who are victims of extremism, violence, racial hatred, fascism or neo-Nazism,” he said. Rights organizations and many politicians in Slovakia also welcomed the verdict. “No democracy is immune to the threat of extremism,” a group of local anti-extremism organizations said in a joint statement released on Monday. “We are glad that extremism in Slovakia is finally being punished and addressed with the appropriate attention.” Andrea Buckova, the Slovak government representative for Roma communities, which are often targeted by Mr. Kotleba’s party, said the verdict was the “only possible fair decision.” “It is also a satisfaction for everyone who Marian Kotleba is trying to turn into second-class citizens with his hateful rhetoric and actions,” she said on Facebook. “Fascism has no place in our society.”']","Marian Kotleba, the head of a neo-fascist political party, was convicted of spreading an ideology aimed at suppressing democratic rights and freedoms."
"In Former Taliban Stronghold, Defiant Women Hit the Gym",2020-10-12,By David Zucchino and Fatima Faizi,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Homa Yusafzai felt terrible. Her weight was up, she had diabetes and high blood pressure, and at just 27 she felt lethargic and depressed. Then she heard that Kandahar’s first health club for women had just opened — the miracle she had been waiting for, she thought. Her husband at first refused to let her join. Kandahar is a deeply conservative city, a former headquarters of the Taliban where men still dictate the most prosaic details of women’s lives. But ultimately, he relented, and Ms. Yusafzai now works out six days a week, straining through hand-weight repetitions and pounding a treadmill. In six months, she said, she had shed almost 50 pounds, lowered her blood pressure and brought her diabetes under control. “I feel so healthy and I have more energy — I’m so happy,” she said as she rested between workouts. The health club was opened late last year by Maryam Durani, 36, an indomitable women’s rights advocate who has survived two suicide bombings, an assassination attempt and countless death threats — not to mention harsh public condemnation for opening the club. The gym has survived, tucked away in a windowless basement inside a locked compound, shielded from prying eyes. It is the latest addition to the Khadija Kubra Women’s Association, run by Ms. Durani with her father’s help since 2004. It includes a radio station, English and literacy classes for women, an Islamic school and a seamstress center that sells clothing made by women. It is rare for Afghan women to exercise, though several women’s health clubs and even two women’s swimming pools have opened in Kabul, the capital. But in conservative strongholds like Kandahar, many men disapprove of women trying to take control of their own bodies. “Kandahar is a very difficult environment for women,” Ms. Durani said. “We have to be careful and discreet.” She added: “The club is as much for women’s mental health as their physical health. Almost every woman who comes here is depressed.” Roughly 40 percent of club members exercise secretly, hiding workouts from their families, Ms. Durani said. Membership had dropped from 60 in the spring to 30 now, because of a three-month coronavirus closure and because some women feared their families would discover their secret workouts. “My father and brothers said they would kill me if I went to a health club,” said one gym member, who asked to be identified only by her nickname, Tamana. Tamana, 33, was dressed in white robes traditionally worn for studying the Quran at a madrasa — the excuse she gives her family for leaving home to exercise at the club two hours a day, six days a week. She changes into workout clothes at the gym, hitting the treadmill, stationary bike and hand weights. “I’m not doing anything wrong or shameful,” Tamana said. “In fact, it’s something that’s made me a happier and healthier person.” But the gym is constantly in jeopardy. Soon after it opened, it was deluged with profane social media posts from outraged residents. They called it a house of prostitution where whores exercised to make themselves more appealing to men. Mocked and vilified, Ms. Durani was told to close the club and send the women home to their husbands. “I was shocked that they called my daughter a prostitute — that they said no man with dignity would allow such a thing,” said Ms. Durani’s father, Haji Mohammad Essa, 82, a wiry, white-bearded former teacher who owns the compound that includes the gym. Club members say they have been harassed and propositioned by men outside the club. A few have been struck by stones thrown by men on motorbikes who threatened to kill them if they continued to visit the club, Ms. Durani said. Some members always cover their hair with head scarves while exercising — out of modesty or tradition, Ms. Durani said. (A male reporter was permitted to interview women inside the gym, but not during workouts and only while they were fully covered. A female photographer for The New York Times was allowed to photograph gym clients with their consent, but only if they were wearing fully concealing clothing instead of their usual workout clothes.) “If people see us exercising without being covered, it will create a bad image for us,” Ms. Yusafzai said. The club employs a trainer who leads exercises and teaches nutrition and dieting. Ms. Yusafzai said she abandoned meat, rice and bread in favor of vegetables and fruit. She no longer ate sugar or chocolate, and had meat and rice just once a week, she said. Mumtaz Faizi, 32, said her husband had encouraged her to join the gym. After two months on the treadmill and stationary bike, plus situps and hand weight workouts, she had lost 11 pounds and was determined to lose 30 more, she said. Ms. Faizi said she felt relaxed and free inside the sanctuary of the gym. Even so, she said she did not feel completely free of stress and worry. “In this society, men create all the problems,” she said. “It’s our culture, not just the Taliban. They’ve been gone a long time, but men still control everything.” Several neighborhood men said they approved of the club as long as the women were shielded from public view. They said Kandahar had no safe spaces for women to exercise. “Women need more exercise than men because they stay home and get fat, which causes diseases,” said Abdul Wali Wafa, 30. Sardar Mohammad, 40, said most older men vehemently disapprove of the club, but younger men have few objections. “If the environment is safe and protects women, it’s OK,” he said. Mr. Essa, who runs the radio station, said he views the gym as one small step in returning Afghanistan to what he considers its glory years — the 1960s and early 1970s, when he remembers a progressive government and freedoms for women. “We’re an extremist country now,” he said. “I would sacrifice my life if Afghanistan could go back to that time.” For now, he said, it gives him great pleasure to see women exercising and improving their health, and for just 250 Afghanis ($3.50) a month. He also enjoys teasing his daughter, who said she had lost weight after regular gym workouts. “You used to tell me I was too fat,” Ms. Durani told him. “Now you tell me I should eat more or I’ll get sick.” For Ms. Yusafzai, the club provides a welcome refuge. “I relax when I’m here and forget about everything outside, at least for a while,” she said.

Bangladesh to Allow Death Penalty for Rape Convictions,2020-10-12,By Megan Specia,"['The government of Bangladesh has approved measures to allow for the death penalty for rape, after several high-profile sexual assault cases set off widespread protests in recent weeks. Khandker Anwarul Islam, the Bangladeshi cabinet secretary, told reporters in a news conference on Monday that ministers had approved an amendment to the country’s existing law that would elevate the maximum punishment for rape to death, from life in prison. A presidential declaration on Tuesday is expected to put the provision into law by amending the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, officials said. Parliament is not in session because of the coronavirus pandemic. Anisul Huq, the Bangladeshi minister for law, said on Monday that the government hoped that the new measure would act as a deterrent and lead to a significant drop in rape cases. But rights groups have said that simply enacting harsher punishments for offenders is insufficient. A series of harrowing attacks on women and young girls have focused attention on the problem of sexual violence. In recent days, protests were held in Dhaka, the capital, and elsewhere, after a video of a woman being attacked by a group of men in the country’s southwest spread rapidly on Facebook. Sultan Mohammed Zakaria, a South Asia researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement released soon after the video was made public that the “truly disturbing footage demonstrates the shocking violence that Bangladeshi women are routinely being subjected to.” But he also noted that it was part of a larger system of impunity for attackers. “In the vast majority of these cases, the justice system fails to hold the perpetrators responsible,” he said in the statement. “There can be no excuses here — the Bangladeshi authorities must immediately launch a thorough and impartial investigation and bring those responsible for this vicious attack to justice through fair trials without recourse to the death penalty.” After the most recent case, local and international rights groups were critical of the lack of accountability for attacks and minimal support for survivors, and urged the government to make meaningful changes. This year, and also in response to large scale demonstrations, the country’s highest court ordered the government to set up a commission to investigate a steep rise in the number of rape cases being reported nationally. Ain o Salish Kenya, a rights monitoring group in Bangladesh, has documented 975 instances of violent rape, based on media reports, but experts say that the number is most likely higher, as many go unreported. Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the introduction of the death penalty would do little to address the core issues and what she called an “epidemic” of rape cases. “Apart from the fact that the capital punishment is inherently cruel and should be abolished, Bangladesh has to confront a much more basic problem — that it has a broken criminal justice system where survivors are unable to even approach the police with confidence, forget expect a successful prosecution,” she said. She noted that conviction rates in cases of violence against women were “abysmally low,” and that there was no access to legal aid, medical care, safe shelter, witness protection, or psychological and social counseling for survivors of violent sexual assaults. “The government should instead do the hard work to bring protection mechanisms and remove institutional barriers to justice,” she said. Public reaction to the sentencing guidelines has been largely positive. Tahmid Binte Mahima, 21, a graduate student, said the measure was a “very welcome move,” as the possibility of a death sentence could act as a deterrent. “Such harsh punishment will create fear among offenders,” she said. “But the more important thing is the strong implementation of law and the quick settling of cases. This needs to be ensured.”']",Ministers approved an amendment that would permit capital punishment for the crime after a series of assaults led to widespread calls to tackle what many say is a systemic problem.
"Offering few details, the White House doctor says Trump is no longer contagious.",2020-10-11,"By Maggie Haberman, Katherine J. Wu and Apoorva Mandavilli","['President Trump’s doctor said in a memo released Saturday night that he was “no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” as the president prepared to resume campaign activities this week. The memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said he was releasing information with Mr. Trump’s permission. But the amount of information he provided was limited, in keeping with restrictive presentations to the public that Dr. Conley has made throughout Mr. Trump’s battle with symptoms of the coronavirus since officials made his diagnosis public early on Oct. 2. Dr. Conley last released an update on the president’s condition on Thursday. Experts have repeatedly called into question the true severity of Mr. Trump’s illness. According to guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with severe Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, may need to isolate for up to 20 days. And the president’s health could still deteriorate in the next few days. “I don’t think he’s out of the woods for certain,” said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician based in South Carolina. Men of Mr. Trump’s age, 74, and weight are at higher risk for severe cases of Covid-19. His recent course of steroids, which suppress certain parts of the immune system, could also make him vulnerable to other infections, Dr. Kuppalli added. “I would still be careful with someone like him.” The start date of Mr. Trump’s symptoms has also remained unclear. By Dr. Conley’s assessment, Mr. Trump would have needed to show signs of his illness on Wednesday, Sept. 30, for Saturday to qualify as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Most people stop being infectious by the 10th day after they start feeling ill, according to the C.D.C. “This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the president meeting C.D.C. criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s Covid P.C.R. sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” Dr. Conley wrote. “Now at day 10 from symptoms onset, fever-free for well over 24 hours and all symptoms improved, the assortment of advanced diagnostic tests obtained reveal there is no longer evidence of actively replicating virus. In addition, sequential testing throughout his illness has demonstrated decreasing viral loads that correlate with increasing cycle threshold times, as well as decreasing and now undetectable subgenomic mRNA.” Several experts expressed skepticism at the wording describing Mr. Trump’s diagnostic tests, which did not explicitly categorize the president as “negative” for the coronavirus. P.C.R., a laboratory technique that detects the virus’s genetic material, can give researchers a rough sense of how much virus remains within a person’s body, or the viral load. Dr. Conley’s note suggested Mr. Trump’s viral load was dropping, but appeared to still be detectable. The subgenomic mRNA mentioned by Dr. Conley is a part of the virus that can be detected by laboratory techniques, and that suggests the presence of actively replicating virus, said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. But “there are zero cleared tests that look at subgenomic mRNA” from the coronavirus, she added, which means the procedure is “experimental at this point.” Another, more traditional, approach to determine whether Mr. Trump still harbored actively replicating virus in his body might be to take a sample from the president’s airway and see if the coronavirus could be grown from the sample in a lab. But this technique was not mentioned in Dr. Conley’s memo. There is also no test that can definitively show if a person at the end of a coronavirus infection is still contagious and poses a risk to others, said Melissa Miller, a clinical microbiologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Dr. Conley said he would continue to monitor the president in the coming days. Mr. Trump is to speak at a campaign event on Monday. Mr. Trump’s voice has grown stronger since he was released from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday. But other than on his trips to and from the hospital, he had not been seen in public before Saturday, when he appeared on a balcony for nearly 20 minutes before a crowd of a few hundred people gathered on the South Lawn of the White House.']",
Nigerians Demand End to Police Squad Known for Brutalizing the Young,2020-10-12,,"['By Shola Lawal and Adenike Olanrewaju LAGOS, Nigeria — With protests breaking out across Nigeria and in expatriate Nigerian communities around the world, the country’s president vowed to a skeptical public on Monday that he would crack down on rogue police officers accused of brutalizing citizens. President Muhammadu Buhari’s promise came a day after his government announced that it would dismantle a widely feared police unit known as SARS, for Special Anti-Robbery Squad. “The disbanding of SARS is only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reforms,” Mr. Buhari said in a televised statement, speaking out for the first time since protests started last week. “We will also ensure that all those responsible for misconduct are brought to justice.”  To many, Mr. Buhari’s response was too little, too late, and they predicted it would do little to placate the angry young Nigerians who have been blocking major routes in cities across the country to protest the police unit. One protester in Lagos, Olasunkanmi Amoo, 26, said President Buhari’s statement was a hollow promise — and she noted that the demonstrations had not come to a halt. “We’re all still outside,” she said. “People are just very wary because you can talk all you want, but if you don’t do anything we’re still going to be here. We’re coming back tomorrow. We don’t trust him, and we don’t believe him.” The Special Anti-Robbery Squad was created in 1992 and charged with tackling the problem of violent crime in Lagos. It operated as a faceless, 15-member team that traveled in two unmarked buses, its officers often wearing neither uniforms nor name tags. The anonymity was considered vital for taking on the gangs that openly terrorized Lagos at the time. But as the police unit grew, establishing itself throughout the country, its faceless nature opened the door to abuse, making it difficult to identify and report rogue officers and emboldening them to act with impunity, critics say. The SARS unit has been accused of targeting young people who appear well-dressed, shaking them down for money, and torturing and abusing and even killing those who resist. Amnesty International says it documented more than 82 cases of abuse and extrajudicial killings by SARS officers from January 2017 to this May. Many of the victims were between 18 and 35, the human rights group said. Nearly half of Nigeria’s population of 182 million population is below age 30, one of the world’s largest concentrations of young people. The government has claimed before that it planned to shut down the unit, but its officers are still on the streets. “The government disbanded SARS in 2017, in 2018 and in 2019,” said Omobolanle Adams, 25, a Nigerian graduate student at Boston University. “We’re not buying it this time.” Protesters say they won’t be satisfied until the president issues an executive order and until clear action is taken not just to disband SARS but to address broader problems with the police. Their demands include psychological evaluations for reassigned SARS officers, and compensation for victims of police violence. They are also pushing for better pay for police officers to reduce the financial exploitation of citizens. Protesters are also demanding the release of those arrested at the recent demonstrations, and a requirement that the police use only rubber bullets during civil unrest. The protests broke out in major Nigerian cities, including Lagos and the capital, Abuja, and the outrage quickly spread online. The #EndSARS hashtag on Twitter soon garnered global attention, resonating particularly in the United States, birthplace of the Black Lives Matter movement. The Nigerian protests have been embraced by top American stars like Chance the Rapper and Cardi B. Demonstrations in shows of solidarity have been held across the Nigerian diaspora in cities like Atlanta, Berlin and London. In New York on Sunday, young protesters gathered in front of the Nigerian Consulate General in Midtown to share their own stories of police brutality while in Nigeria and to demand action from the Nigerian government. “The youth in Nigeria are tired,” said Ms. Adams, 25, the Boston University graduate student, who helped organize the event with other activists she met on Twitter. She pointed to the harsh crackdowns on the protesters in Nigeria. “People are being tear-gassed,” she said. “People are being shot dead. We’re here today to amplify Nigerians’ voices. The time is now.” The protests that began over the last week were set off by reports that a young man in Delta State, in southern Nigeria, had been killed during a stop-and-search operation on Oct. 3. The police have said that SARS officers were not involved. As the protests over the killing grew, demonstrators faced increasingly violent crackdowns from security forces. One person, Jimoh Isiaq, was killed in the demonstrations in Oyo State on Saturday, and an unidentified bystander was killed in Lagos on Monday, as the police fired bullets into crowds of protesters, witnesses said. Protesters and journalists have also been shot at and beaten in Abuja. And dozens more have been arrested and remain in custody. The demonstrations have been the biggest in Nigeria in recent years, rivaling protests in 2012 over fuel-price increases during President Goodluck Jonathan’s tenure. Worn down by weak governments and corrupt leadership for decades, and divided along religious, ethnic and class lines, Nigerians do not often join in mass protests. But since last week, protesters of varying economic status and religion have taken to the streets to voice their demands. Top Nigerian celebrities like the pop stars Wizkid, Davido and Tiwa Savage have attended rallies in big cities. And the protests have bridged generational divides as older people briefly joined the demonstrations this weekend. Shola Lawal reported from Lagos and Adenike Olanrewaju from New York.']","The government said it would bow to the demands of Nigerians protesting police abuses, but skeptical protesters vowed to keep the pressure on."
Iceland’s tourism industry is preparing for a comeback.,2020-10-13,By Paige McClanahan,"['Tourism is undergoing a downturn all over the world, but several factors make Iceland particularly vulnerable to the industry’s crash: geographic isolation, a small domestic population, strict border measures and an economy that — after an extraordinary, decade-long tourism boom — had come to depend heavily on foreign tourists. A recent surge in coronavirus cases has added to Iceland’s challenges. But while visitor numbers are low, Iceland is positioning itself for a major tourism rebound after the pandemic. The government is investing more than $12 million in tourism infrastructure, while improving roads and harbors across the country. To keep the tourism industry afloat in the short term, the government is also investing more than $9 million in a program that distributes free travel vouchers to Icelandic citizens and residents. A marketing campaign targeting domestic tourists was rolled out in the late spring; an international version will be unveiled as soon as travel restrictions are lifted. The voucher campaign helped to jump-start demand for hotels, restaurants and attractions. So far, Icelanders have used more than $1.2 million worth of their free travel vouchers, which are valid through the end of the year. The summer was “pretty good, considering everything,” said Bjarnheidur Hallsdottir, the chairwoman of the board of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association and the chief executive of two tourism companies. “And then suddenly out of nowhere, the government decided to change the rules at the borders. Since then, everyone is crying.” Under the new rules, which took effect in August, arriving passengers may choose either to submit to two screening tests for the virus, separated by five days’ self-quarantine, or to skip border screening and self-quarantine for 14 days after arrival.']",
Fauci says his words were ‘taken out of context’ by the president’s campaign.,2020-10-11,By Sheila Kaplan,"['Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, took issue Sunday with a decision by the Trump campaign to feature him in an advertisement without his consent and said it had misrepresented his comments. “I was totally surprised,” Dr. Fauci said. “The use of my name and my words by the G.O.P. campaign was done without my permission, and the actual words themselves were taken out of context, based on something that I said months ago regarding the entire effort of the task force.” CNN first reported Dr. Fauci’s displeasure with the campaign ad. The spot seeks to use Mr. Trump’s illness with Covid-19 and apparent recovery to improve the negative image many Americans have of his handling of the coronavirus. “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” the ad shows Dr. Fauci saying — though in fact he was talking about the broader government effort. Dr. Fauci, who said he had never publicly endorsed a political candidate in decades of public work, has long had an uneasy relationship with President Trump. Just a little over a week ago, he clashed with his boss over his position on mask-wearing. In his debate with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump claimed that Dr. Fauci had initially said “masks are not good — then he changed his mind.” When Mr. Biden said wearing masks could save tens of thousands of lives, Mr. Trump contended that “Dr. Fauci said the opposite.” In fact, in the early days of the pandemic, Dr. Fauci and other health experts discouraged the general public from rushing out to buy masks because they were worried about shortages for health workers. Their position changed when it became clear that asymptomatic transmission was spreading the virus. Dr. Fauci may favor measured language, but his criticisms of the White House — and, implicitly, the man in the Oval Office — over the handling of the pandemic have not gone unnoticed, including by hard-core Trump supporters who claim he is part of a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine the president. On Friday, Dr. Fauci called the White House ceremony announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court a “superspreader event.” “It was in a situation where people were crowded together and not wearing masks,” he said. “The data speak for themselves.” Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee begins on Monday. The proceedings will play out partially by video to allow senators who may be sick or worried about infection to participate remotely. No members of the public will be allowed in the hearing room, which will be sparsely populated with senators and spectators.']",
‘Chaos and confusion’ could follow vaccine approvals.,2020-10-13,By Carl Zimmer,"['The United States may be within months of a profound turning point in the country’s fight against the coronavirus: the first working vaccine. Demonstrating that a new vaccine is safe and effective in less than a year would shatter the record for speed, the result of seven-day workweeks for scientists and billions of dollars of investment by the government. The path has not been without bumps. Johnson & Johnson announced Monday night that it was halting its Phase 3 trial after a volunteer got sick. And AstraZeneca also paused its trial, last month, after two participants became ill. Still, it’s tempting to look at the first vaccine as President Trump does: an on-off switch that will bring back life as we know it. “As soon as it’s given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus,” he said at a September news conference. Instead, vaccine experts say, we should prepare for a perplexing, frustrating year. The first vaccines may provide only moderate protection, low enough to make it prudent to keep wearing a mask. By next spring or summer, there may be several of these so-so vaccines. Because of this array of options, makers of a superior vaccine in early stages of development may struggle to finish clinical testing. And some vaccines may be abruptly withdrawn from the market because they turn out not to be safe. “It has not yet dawned on hardly anybody the amount of complexity and chaos and confusion that will happen in a few short months,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, the director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic.']",

ယခုအခါ အမေရိကန်၊ ဆွီဒင်၊ နယူးဇီလန်နိုင်ငံသားများဖြစ်နေပြီ။ အခြားအလံတော်များကိုကတိသစ္စာခံနေကြပြီ။ သို့သော် စိတ်ဒဏ်ရာများက ပြန်ကျက်ဖို့ ပိုခက်ခဲသည်။ အထူးသဖြင့် ဒုက္ခသည်ဘဝက အစေအပါးအလုပ်များလုပ်ကိုင် ရုန်းကန်နေရပြီး ယဉ်ကျေးမှုဓလေ့များနှင့်စိမ်းနေသေးချိန်မှာ ပိုခက်သည်။ စိတ်ဒဏ်ရာဒဏ်ချက်များက ကုစားမရ ဖြစ်နေဆဲ။ ကိုရိုနာဗိုင်းရပ်စ်က သူတို့၏အလုပ်ခွင်များမှာ မင်းမူနေသည်။ နယ်မြေဝေးကွာပြီးရာသီပိုအေးရာသို့လွတ်မြောက်ရောက်ရှိလာချိန်မှာ သူတို့လက်ရှိဘဝကို အတိတ်က ဖိစီးထားဆဲဖြစ်သည်ကို God’s Army ၏စစ်သည်ဟောင်းများတွင်တွေ့ရသည်။ မြန်မာပြည်ကို လုံးဝ ခြေမချဖူးသည့်နောက်လူငယ်မျိုးဆက်အတွက်ပင်လျင် သူတို့ဘဝက မရှိတော့ပြီဖြစ်သည့်ရွာတရွာ၊ ရှုံးနှိမ့်ခဲပြီဖြစ်သည့် တပ်ဖွဲ့တခုနှင့် ဆက်နွယ်နေသည်။ လူသာ၊ ဂျွန်နီ့မိခင်၊ ညီမများနှင့်အခြားဆွေမျိုးများက နယူးဇီလန်နိုင်ငံ သြကလန်မြို့မှာပြန်လည်အခြေချသည်။ အခန်း ၅ခန်းပါအိမ်တအိမ်မှာ လူ၁၂ဦး ပြွတ်သိပ်နေသည်။ သည်နိုင်ငံရောက်လာပြီးဆယ်စုနှစ်တခုကျော်အကြာမှာ အမြွှာညီကို၏မိခင်ဒေါ်ပီခန်းသည် အဝေးပြေးလမ်းမကြီးများနှင့်အသားမကျနိုင်သေး၊ မြေသားလမ်းပေါ်က မိတ်ဆွေတယောက်၏အိမ်သို့အေးအေးလူလူလမ်းလျှောက်သွားဖို့မဖြစ်နိုင်သေး။ ဆွေမျိုးတစ်ဒါဇင်နှင့်အတူနေသည့်တိုင် အားလုံးက သီးခြားအထီးကျန်နေသည်။ “ကျမ အိမ်ပြန်ချင်တယ်” သူ ပြောသည်။ ထို့နောက် သူ ပြန်စဉ်းစားသည်။ “ကျမ အိမ်မပြန်ချင်ဘူး” သူ သက်ပြင်းချသည်။ ထိုဆန္ဒနှစ်ခုစလုံး မမှား။ နှစ်ခုစလုံးလည်း မမှန်။ ကရင်ရွာအတွင်းပိုင်း ဘုရားသခင်တောင်အနီးရွာထဲကလူတိုင်းက ၁၉၈၈ခုနှစ်မှာမွေးသည့် ဂျွန်နီနှင့်လူသာထူးတို့က ထူးခြားသူများဖြစ်သည်ကို သိကြသည်။ လူသာက စမ်ချောင်းတခုဆီရေးချိုးဆင်းသွားပြီး တမန်တော်ဖြစ်ကောင်းဖြစ်နိုင်သည့်လူအိုတယောက်အသွင် ပြောင်းသွားသည်ဆိုသော ဇာတ်လမ်းတပုဒ်ရှိခဲ့သည်။ ဂျွန်နီရေပေါ်မှာလမ်းလျှောက်သည်ဆိုသောအချိန်ရှိခဲ့သည်။ သူဆံပင်ရှည်များက သူတို့တွေးထင်ထားသည့်ယေရှုဆံနွယ်များကဲ့သို့ လေမှာလွင့်နေသည်။ အမြွှာနှစ်ယောက် ဆယ်နှစ်သားအရွယ်ရောက်လာချိန်မှာ ကိုယ်ပျောက်တပ်ဖွဲ့များစုစည်းခဲ့သည်၊ သူတို့က မြန်မာစစ်သားများရှိရာကို ဝါးပင်တရှဲရှဲသံပင်မကြားရပဲသတင်းပေးနိုင်သည်ဟု ရွာသားများကပြောသည်။ ကယ်တင်ရှင်တဦးကို ရွာသားများက တောင့်တခဲ့သည်။ သူတို့အတွက် နှစ်ဦးရလိုက်သည်။ “ကျမ ကိုယ်ဝန်ရှိတော့ ကျမသားတွေဟာ ပြန်လည်ရှင်သန်လိုတဲ့ နာမည်ကြီးစစ်သားတွေလို့ အိပ်မက်မက်တယ်”ဟု ဒေါ်ပီခန်းက ပြောသည်။ “ဂျွန်နီနဲ့လူသာ မွေးပြီးတော့ ဘဝကပိုအဆင်ပြေလာတယ်။ တောမှာ တောကောင်များများ အမဲလိုက်လို့ရလာတယ်။ သူတို့ကကာကွယ်ထားတော့ ကျမတို့ လုံခြုံဘေးကင်းနေတယ်” ထူးညီအကိုအမွှာနှစ်ယောက်သည် တောင်ယာလုပ်ကိုင်ပြီး အမဲလိုက်ရာမှာသုံးသည့် အိမ်လုပ်ကျည်ဆံများပြုလုပ်သည့် မိသားစုမှာ မွေးဖွားလာသည်။ မြန်မာစစ်တပ်ထိုးစစ်ဆင်မှုများကြောင့် သူငယ်တန်းကျောင်းသားအရွယ်မှာပင် ထိုင်း မြန်မာနယ်စပ်တကြောက တောတောင်ထဲ သူတို့ရောက်သွားရသည်။ အမွှာနှစ်ယောက်ကို သူတို့ဖခင်ကဲ့သို့ပင် အကြီးဆုံး ကရင်တိုင်းရင်းသားတပ်မတော်ဖြစ်သည့် ကရင်အမျိုးသားလွတ်မြောက်ရေးတပ်မတော်ထဲသို့ဝင်ရောက်မည်ဟု မျှော်လင့်ထားခဲ့သည်။ ဗမာနိုင်ငံအဖြစ်တချိန်ကသိကြသည့်နိုင်ငံကို ၁၉၄၈ ဗြိတိန်ဆီကလွတ်လပ်ရေးရပြီးကတည်းက ကရင်တိုင်းရင်းသားတော်လှန်ရေးတပ်ဖွဲ့ကတိုက်ခိုက်နေသည်။ လွတ်လပ်ရေးရပြီးစနိုင်ငံသစ်က ဗမာတိုင်းရင်းသားအများစုနှင့် လူနည်းစုတိုင်းရင်းသားများ စုစည်းထားသည့် ပြည်ထောင်စုဖြစ်သည်။ သို့သော် လူဦးရေ ၅သန်းဝန်းကျင်ရှိသည့်ကရင်က အစိုးရ၏လူမျိုးကြီးဝါဒစတင်လာသည်ကို ကသိကအောက်ဖြစ် စိတ်မရှည်နိုင်ဖြစ်ရသည်။ အခြားတိုင်းရင်းသားလက်နက်ကိုင်များကဲ့သို့ပင် တချို့က လက်နက်ကိုင်လာကြသည်။ နိုင်ငံခြားသားမုန်းသည့် ဗိုလ်ချုပ်တဦးက ၁၉၆၂ခုနှစ် အရပ်သားအစိုးရကိုအာဏာဖြုတ်ချချိန်မှာ ပြည်ထောင်စုမပြိုကွဲအောင် စစ်အုပ်ချုပ်ရေးလိုအပ်သည်ဟု အကြောင်းပြသည်။ ၁၉၉၀ပြည့်နှစ်များနှောင်းပိုင်းမှာ ကရင်က ခံစစ်အခြေအနေမှာရှိသည်။ မြန်မာပြည်ထဲက ပြည်နယ်လေးကိုတချိန်က ထိန်းချုပ်ထားသည့်ကရင်တိုင်းရင်းသားလက်နက်ကိုင်များက သူတို့ပိုက်နက်အများစုကိုဆုံးရှုံးလိုက်ရသည်။ ဂျွန်နီနှင့်လူသာတို့ကဲ့သို့ ခရစ်ယာန်များသာမက ဗုဒ္ဓဘာသာဝင်နှင့်နတ်ကိုးကွယ်သူများအပါအဝင် သိန်းနှင့်ချီသောကရင်တို ထိုင်းနိုင်ငံ ဒုက္ခသည်စခန်းများဆီ ထွက်ပြေးခဲ့ကြရသည်။ ထို့နောက် ရွှေ့ပြောင်းအခြေချနေထိုင်သူများအဖြစ်နေထိုင်ပြီး ပင်လယ်စာလုပ်ငန်းနှင့် ဆောက်လုပ်ရေး လုပ်ငန်းများမှာ ပင်ပင်ပန်းပန်းလုပ်ကိုင်နေသည်။ အများစုက ငှက်ဖျားအဖြစ်များသည့်တောနယ်များကိုပြန်လာကြသည်။ မြန်မာစစ်သားများက ထိုးစစ်ဆင်မှုများ လုပ်လာသည့်အခါ သူတို့တဲအိမ်များကိုစွန့်ပစ်ရသည်နှင့်သာ ကြုံရပြန်သည်။ မြန်မာစစ်တပ်က ထိုသို့ဝင်ရောက်နှောင့်ယှက်တိုက်ခိုက်မှုများတွင် လိင်အကြမ်းဖက်မှု၊ ရွာမီးရှို့မှုများ အင်တိုက်အားတိုက် လုပ်ဆောင်သောကြောင့် လူမျိုးတုံးသုတ်သင်ရှင်းလင်းမှုသဘောပင်ဖြစ်သည်ဟု ကုလသမဂ္ဂကဆိုသည်။ လူသာနှင့်ဂျွန်နီတို့လမ်းလျှောက်သင်ခါစအရွယ်မှာ တိုင်းပြည်၏စစ်အာဏာရှင်အစိုးရကို ဥစ္စာဓနများယူဆောင်ပေးလာမည့် ရေနံနှင့်သဘာဝဓာတ်ငွေ့ပိုက်လိုင်းသွယ်လမ်းကြောင်းဖောက်ရန် သစ်တောများကို မြန်မာစစ်သားများက စတင် ရှင်းလင်းသည်။ ထိုမြေပေါ်နေထိုင်သည့်ကရင်များမှာ ဘာမျှမရဟုဆိုရမည်။ သစ်တောထူထပ်သည့် တောင်ကုန်းများပေါ် မြန်မာစစ်တပ်ခြေလျင်တပ်သားများ ရုတ်တရက်တဟုန်ထိုးဝင်လာသည့်အခါ ကရင်အမျိုးသားလွတ်မြောက်ရေးတပ်မှ စစ်သားရာပေါင်းများစွာ ဆုံးရှုံးရသည်။ ဂျွန်နီနှင့်လုသာတို့က တိုက်ခိုက်ရန် ဆက်လက်ရှိနေသည်။ သူတို့က သေနတ်ပစ်ကောင်းသည်။ သူတို့ကိုယ်ခန္ဓာသေးသေးလေးပေါ် လက်နက်များ မနိုင်တနိုင် တရွတ်ဆွဲပြီး ငြိမ်အောင်ကိုင်ထားနိုင်သည်။ မြေမြှုပ်မိုင်းများကို သူတို့ နင်းမိသည် မရှိ။ ကျည်ဆန်များက မုတ်သုန်မိုးလိုရွာနေသည့်တိုင် ထိရှပွန်းပဲ့ရာတခုမရှိဘဲ သူတို့ပြန်ပေါ်လာသည်ဟု ရွာသားများကပြောသည်။ “ရုပ်ရှင်ထဲက စူပါပါဝါရထားတဲ့တယောက်လိုပေါ့” ဂျွန်နီကပြောသည်။ “သိတယ်မလား။ ကိုယ့်ကိုပစ်နေတယ်။ ဒါပေမယ့် ကျည်ဆန်တွေ လာမထိဘူး” God’s Army ပေါ်ထွန်းလာခဲ့သည်။ စစ်ထဲမှာမိဘမဲ့ဖြစ်သွားသူများက God’s Army တပ်သားများအဖြစ်တိုးလာသည်။ သူတို့မှာ အခြားသွားစရာမရှိ။ Swiss Family Robinson ရုပ်ရှင်နှင့် Lord of the Flies ဝတ္ထုကိုပေါင်းစပ်ထားသလိုပင်။ စစ်သားကြီးများက ဝိုင်းဖွဲ့ဆုတောင်းကြသည်။ ထို့နောက် တိုက်ပွဲအတွင်းမှာ အမွှာနှစ်ယောက်ကို လာဘ်အဆောင်များလို သူတို့ ပုခုံးမှာ ထမ်းမထားသည်။ တောင်ကိုရီးယားခရစ်ယာန်အသိုင်းအဝိုင်းကလည်း သူတို့ဆီထောက်ပံ့လှူဒါန်းကြသည်။ God’s Army ၏ စည်းမျဉ်းများက တင်းကြပ်သည့်ကရင်ခရစ်ယာန်အယူဝါဒနှင့်အညီဖြစ်သည်။ ဥမစား၊ ဝက်သားမစား၊ လိမ်ညာမပြော၊ ဆဲဆိုခြင်းမလုပ်ရ။ သမ္မာကျမ်းအပိုဒ်များကို တိုက်ပွဲညွှန်ကြားချက်များအဖြစ်သုံးသည်။ အမွှာညီအကိုက ကလေးများဖြစ်သည့်အတွက် သူတို့ဆဲဆိုခြင်းနှင့်ဆေးလိပ်အဆက်မပြတ်သောက်ခြင်းကိုတော့ အရေးတယူရှိပုံမရ။ ဂျွန်နီက စိတ်ဆတ်သည်။ လူသာက နောက်တတ်ပြောင်တတ်သည်။ နှစ်ယောက်စလုံးအတွက် စစ်ဝတ်စုံများက ကြီးလွန်းနေသည်။ God’s Armyက အသက်ကြီးပိုင်း အတွေ့အကြုံရှိတပ်ဖွဲ့ဝင်များက ဘန်ကောက်ရှိမြန်မာသံရုံးကိုဝင်စီးသည့် ကျောင်းသားတပ်မတော်နှင့်အဆက်အသွယ်ရှိနေသည့်တိုင် သူတို့နောက်လိုက်များက သူတို့အပေါ်သစ္စာရှိနေမြဲဖြစ်သည်။ “ကျုပ်တို့က အရက်မသောက်ဘူး။ ကျုပ်တို့ကိုဘေးကင်းအောင်လုပ်ပေးဖို့ ဘုရားသခင်ကခွင့်ပြုချက်ကို ကျုပ်တို့ နေ့စဉ် ဆုတောင်းတယ်” ဘုရားသခင်တပ်တော် (God’s Army) ၏ ဗိုလ်မှူးဟောင်းတယောက်ဖြစ်တဲ့ဦးအာနာဝါး ကပြောသည်။ “ကျနော်တို့က ကျည်ပြီးတယ်” သို့သော် သူတို့ကျည်မပြီးပါ။ ၁၉၈၈ခုနှစ်ကဖြစ်ပွားသည့် God’s Armyနှင့် မြန်မာစစ်တပ်တပ်ရင်းတခုကြားဖြစ်ပွားသည့် တိုက်ပွဲတခုမှာ ဦးအာနာဝါးကျည်ထိမှန်သည်။ ထိုတိုက်ပွဲမှာ God’s Armyက ၃ယောက်ကျဆုံးသည်။ ဦးအာနာဝါး၏ခြေကို ဒူးအထက်မှ ဖြတ်လိုက်ရသည်။ ၂၀၀၀ခုနှစ်မှာ ကျောင်းသားလက်နက်ကိုင်အဖွဲ့၏အဖွဲ့ဝင်များနှင့် God’s Armyတို့ မြန်မာ-ထိုင်းနယ်စပ်ရှိ ရချာဘူရီမြို့ကဆေးရုံတရုံကို ဝင်စီးသည်။ လူနာရာပေါင်းများစွာကို ဓားစာခံထားသည်။ သူတို့၏ဒဏ်ရာရစစ်သားများအတွက် ဆေးပစ္စည်းအထောက်အပံံ့ရရှိရေး သူတို့ ကြံရာမရဖြစ်နေသည်။ ထိုင်းစစ်တပ်က ပြတ်ပြတ်သားသား တုံ့ပြန်သည်။ ဓားစားခံများကိုဖမ်းဆီးသူအားလုံးအသတ်ခံရသည်။ ထိုသို့ ဝင်ရောက်စီးနင်းမှုမှာ ဂျွန်နီနှင့်လူသာတို့မပါ။ သို့သော် God’s Army ၏အကောင်းဆုံးစစ်သားတချို့ ဆုံးရှုံးလိုက်ရသည်။ ၁နှစ်အတွင်းမှာ အမွှာနှစ်ဦးက ထိုင်းစစ်တပ်ဆီမှာလက်နက်ချပြီးနောက် ထိုင်းနိုင်ငံရှိ စစ်ဘေးဒုက္ခသည်စခန်းတွင် ခိုလှုံခဲ့ကြသည်။ ဒီလိုနဲ့ God’s Army လည်းဆုံးခန်းတိုင်သွားသည်။ လူငယ်လေးများမှာ အသက် ၁၃နှစ်ပင် မပြည့်သေး။ လူသာ ကြီးကောင်ဝင်စအချိန် အစောပိုင်းမှာ သူ အများဆုံး မှတ်မိနေသည်က အအေးဒဏ်။ ၂၀၀၉ မှာ သူက ထိုင်းနိုင်ငံဒုက္ခသည်စခန်းကနေ ဆွီဒင်နိုင်ငံကိုသွားသည်။ ထိုနိုင်ငံအကြောင်း သူများများစားစား မသိ။ ဆွီဒင်ကလူတွေ အရပ်ရှည်တယ်၊ ဆံပင်အရောင်တွေဖြူဖျော့နေတယ်လို့သာ သူကြားဖူးထားသည်။ သူကတော့ သူ့အမွှာညီအစ်ကိုကဲ့သို့ပင် ၅ပေ မပြည့်တပြည့်။ ကာလရှည်ကြာအဟာရမပြည့်ဝမှုကြောင့် ဖြစ်ကောင်းဖြစ်နိုင်သည်။ ဆွီဒင်မှာ ပင်လယ်စာကောင်းသည်ဟု တယောက်ကသူ့ကိုပြောထားသည်။ သို့သော် အကောင်ကြီးမားပြီး အသားများသည့်ငါးကြီးက သူဖမ်းခဲ့ဖူးသည့်ချောင်းထဲက အရိုးများများကြားကအချိုဆုံးအသားရှိသည့် ငါးလေးများနှင့်မတူ။ လူသာတယောက် ယော်တဲ့နဲမြို့လေးမှာ ၁၀နှစ်ကြာခဲ့သည်။ ထိုမြို့ကလေးမှာ အခြားကရင်မိသားစု ၃ခု၊ တရုတ်စားသောက်ဆိုင်တဆိုင်ရှိသည်။ ထိုနေရာကို သူ့အိမ်ဖြစ်လာနိုင်မည်အထင်ဖြင့် သူကြိုးစားခဲ့သည်။ ဆွီဒင်ဘုရင်များနှင့်ဆိုရှယ်လစ်ဝါဒကို သူသိခဲ့သည်။ အခြားကရင်ဒုက္ခသည်တယောက်နှင့် သူ အိမ်ထောင်ပြုပြီး သူတို့မှာ ကလေးတယောက်ထွန်းကားခဲ့သည်။ သက်ကြီးရွယ်အိုစောင့်ရှောက်ရေးဂေဟာတခုမှာ သူအလုပ်လုပ်ခဲ့သည်။ သူ အိမ်ထောင်ကွဲသွားသည်။ စိတ်ဖိစီးကမောက်ကမဖြစ်ခြင်းက စွန့်ခွာပြောင်းရွှေ့လာသူများမှာ ခံစားရသည်။ အနောက်နိုင်ငံများတွင် ကရင်လူမျိုးအများစုမှာ အမေရိကန်ပြည်ထောင်စုမှာ နေထိုင်ကြသည်။ ကရင်လူမျိုးဒုက္ခသည် ထောင်ပေါင်းများစွာဟာ အမေရိကန်မှာ စုရုံး နေထိုင်သည်။ အမေရိကန်ပြည်ထောင်စုမှာနေထိုင်သည့်ဘဝက ရုပ်ဝတ္ထုပိုင်းအရဆိုလျှင် ထိုင်းနိုင်ငံရှိဒုက္ခသည်စခန်းနှင့် သူတို့အမိမြေမှာ ဝမ်းစာရရုံလယ်သမားအဖြစ် နေထိုင်ရသည်ထက်ပိုကောင်းသည်။ သို့သော် အမေရိကန်နိုင်ငံသား ဗမာသုံးပုံတပုံကျော်က ဆင်းရဲမွဲတေမှုညွှန်ကိန်းအဆင့်အောက်မှာ နေထိုင်ကြသည်။ Pew သုတေသနစင်တာ၏ထုတ်ပြန်ချက်အရ ထိုအထဲမှ ယခုရာစုနှစ်အတွင်းရောက်လာသူအများစုမှာ ကရင်ဒုက္ခသည်များဖြစ်သည်။ God’s Army အတွက် တိုက်ပွဲဝင်ခဲ့ဖူးသည့်နှစ်ခြင်းသင်းအုပ်ဆရာ စောမချာ တယောက် ၂၀၀၉ခုနှစ်မှာ သူ့ဇနီး၊ ကလေးငါးယောက်၊ မြေး၁၃ယောက်နှင့်မြောက်ကယ်ရိုလိုင်းနားရှိနယူးဘန်းမြို့ကို ပြောင်းလာသည်။ ဤမြို့သည် ကရင်လူမျိုး ၁၀၀၀ နီးပါးအခြေချနေထိုင်သည့် မြစ်ကမ်းနားမြို့တမြို့ ဖြစ်သည်။ ကရင်များကြောင့် နယူးဘန်းမြို့၏ နှစ်ခြင်းခရစ်ယာန်ဘုန်းတော်ကြီးတို့၏အလုပ်များ ပြန်လည်ရှင်သန်လာသည်။ အစိုးရကျောင်းများအတွက် အားသစ်အင်သစ်ဖြစ်လာသည်။ သို့သော် ကရင်မိသားစုများက အပြင်မှာ ငါးခြောက်လှမ်းသည့်အခါ အိမ်နီးခြင်းများက စူးစိုက်ကြည့်ကြသည်။ အေတီအမ်စက်တွေ၊ ကားအာမခံ၊ အရိုးပျောက်ကြက်ရင်ပုံသားစသဖြင့် သူတို့အတွက် သိစရာသင်စရာအများကြီးရှိနေသည်။ အမေရိကန်ပြည်ထောင်စုရှိ ကရင်ဒုက္ခသည်များကြားမှာ စိတ်ဒဏ်ရာအနာတရဖြစ်နှုန်းက သာမန်ထက်များနေသည်ကို လေ့လာမှုတခုမှာ တွေ့ရသည်။ စစ်၏စိတ်ဒုက္ခကြောင့်သာမဟုတ်။ အိမ်ယာဌာနေသစ်တည်ဆောက်အခြေချမှု၏ ခက်ခဲကြမ်းတမ်းမှုတွေကြောင့်ဖြစ်သည်။ ၂၀၁၅ခုနှစ်က နယူးဘန်းကိုရောက်လာသည်မှာ နှစ်နှစ်မပြည့်သေးသည့် ကရင်ဆယ်ကျော်သက်လူငယ်တဦးက အိမိနီးခြင်း အခြားကရင်ဒုက္ခသည်မိသားစုဆီသွားပြီး ကလေးသုံးယောက်ကိုဓားဖြင့်ခုတ်သတ်လိုက်သည်။ သူက ယခုတော့ စိတ်ကျန်းမာရေးကုသဌာနမှာ

နယူးဘန်းမြို့တဝိုက်စက်ရုံများက အလုပ်သမားများကို ကိုရိုနာဗိုင်းရပ်စ်စတင်ကူးစက်လာသည့်အခါ ကရင်လူမျိုး ၇၀ခန့် ဖျားနာကြသည်။ တယောက် သေဆုံးသွားသည်။ “မမြင်ရတဲ့ ကိုရိုနာဗိုင်းရပ်စ်က

The French prime minister warns that local lockdowns may be imposed as cases surge.,2020-10-12,By Aurelien Breeden,"['France is weighing the possibility of local lockdowns as the country battles a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic, Prime Minister Jean Castex said Monday. Mr. Castex told Franceinfo that France faces an unprecedented surge in cases that is putting increasing pressure on hospitals, saying that many citizens were not taking health warnings seriously. Nearly 27,000 new infections were reported by health authorities on Saturday — a record — and the rate of positive results from testing passed 11 percent. The number of deaths is increasing at a higher rate than over the summer, though much more slowly than in the spring, and hospitalizations, including in intensive care units, are rising. “Nothing can be excluded when one sees the situation in our hospitals,” Mr. Castex said when asked if authorities might put certain cities or regions under lockdown. But Mr. Castex denied suggestions that France’s testing and tracing strategy had failed, castigating the French instead for failing to heed health warnings. Mr. Castex said the country had ended a period of confinement “efficiently,” referring to May, when France’s nationwide lockdown ended. “And then the holidays arrived and we — the French, collectively — believed that it was over, that it was behind us.” He added that the people of France believed that the threat had disappeared, “a bit too quickly, despite our warning about the fact that we had to live with the virus.” About 500 checks were carried out in the Paris area over the weekend and police found nearly 100 bars and restaurants flouting new health restrictions, Mr. Castex said. In Paris, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has surpassed 800 for people aged 20 to 30 years old — sixteen times the government-set alert level. “We aren’t doing this to bother them, we are doing this to protect them,” Mr. Castex said of the restrictions. But he ruled out limits on private gatherings with friends and family, calling it legally impossible under French law and contrary to the country’s values. Mr. Castex also announced that a new version of France’s official contact tracing app, StopCovid, would be released on Oct. 22. The current version has helped to identify only a handful of cases. In other global developments: In South Korea, masks will be mandatory in public starting on Tuesday even as social distancing measures are eased. After a 30-day grace period, people over age 14 who fail to wear masks could be fined as much as 100,000 won, or $87. Social-distancing measures will be reduced to their lowest level as of Monday as a second outbreak of infections appears to wane. Nightclubs, bars and karaoke parlors will be allowed to reopen and spectators will be able to go back to sports stadiums. South Korea reported 97 new cases on Monday, slightly higher than the increase most days last week. New Zealand on Monday announced its first deal for a potential coronavirus vaccine, agreeing to buy 1.5 million doses from the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and the German biotechnology company BioNTech if their product succeeds. Officials did not say how much it cost to buy the vaccine, which could be available early next year. With each person expected to require two doses, there would be enough to inoculate 750,000 of New Zealand’s five million people. Megan Woods, the research minister, said that the government was in negotiations with other drug makers and that there would be more announcements next month. Iran on Monday announced its highest single-day death toll from the virus for the second day in a row, with 272 new victims, The Associated Press reported. The country surpassed 500,000 cases on Sunday, and two of its vice presidents, Mohammad Bagher Nobakht and Ali Akbar Salehi — who is also Iran’s nuclear chief — are the latest senior officials to test positive for the virus, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported. The president of French Polynesia tested positive for the virus two days after meeting in Paris with the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, according to the French newspaper Le Monde.

"Virus Hits Foreign Farmhands, Challenging Canadians’ Self-Image",2020-10-11,By Catherine Porter,"['SIMCOE, Ontario — Three weeks after they began cutting asparagus in the thawing fields, Luis Gabriel Flores Flores noticed that one of his co-workers was missing. He said he found the man shivering with a fever, in bed — where he would remain for a week. “I was trying to tell the foremen, ‘He is very ill, he needs a doctor,’” said Mr. Flores, one of thousands of migrant farm workers flown into Ontario in April to secure Canada’s food supply. “They said, ‘Sure, soon, later.’ They never did.” The sprawling vegetable farm where he worked became the site of one of the country’s largest coronavirus outbreaks. Almost 200 workers, all from Mexico, tested positive, seven were hospitalized and one died: Juan Lopez Chaparro, the one Mr. Flores said he had tried in vain to help. The farm owner insisted that Mr. Chaparro had been treated promptly and called Mr. Flores a “bad apple” being used by activists to score political points. If that is the case, it has worked: The outbreak and others like it have spurred national protests about the systemic vulnerability of migrant farm laborers, a population unknown to many Canadians until they began to fall ill at a rate 11 times that of health workers. Canadians pride themselves on a liberal immigration system welcoming to an array of ethnicities and nationalities, contrasting their attitude with what many see as xenophobia in their neighbor to the south. The reality does not always match the rhetoric, but Canada encourages different groups to maintain their cultures, and an embrace of multiculturalism is enshrined in Canada’s charter and self-image. When other world leaders shunned refugees from Syria’s civil war, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed them in person, handing them winter coats. But in importing large numbers of seasonal farm laborers from abroad and offering them no path to residence or citizenship, Canada looks disturbingly un-Canadian to many of its people. Canada admits temporary workers who stay for most of a year but requires them to return home when their contracts end (the United States does, as well, but they are outnumbered by farm workers who are undocumented and often do stay year-round). As in the United States, farm workers live for months on their employers’ property, often in large bunkhouses where disease can spread easily. Those who enter Canada with work permits often return year after year with no prospect of ever legally putting down roots. Canada, at least, guarantees them health care, but on isolated farms, gaining access to that care can be difficult. “In no other immigration category do you have people who come only from certain countries, are trapped in certain occupations, living only on their work sites and must absolutely leave the country at the end,” said Jenna Hennebry, director of the International Migration Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario. “It’s not consistent with our ideals of multiculturalism.” Professor Hennebry was among a group of academics who warned the Canadian government about the heightened risks migrant farm workers faced from Covid-19 before the first planeload of Mexicans arrived in April. The coronavirus outbreaks prompted the Mexican government to pause sending workers to Canada for a week in June. In response, Mr. Trudeau said: “We should always take advantage of moments of crisis to reflect. Can we change the system to do better?” Since then, his government has announced 59 million Canadian dollars — about $45 million — for improved farm housing, sanitation and inspections. But it has not offered the cure that advocates for migrant workers demand: a path to citizenship. “We have a group of people defined as good enough to work in Canada, but not good enough to stay,” said Vic Satzewich, a sociology professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “As a country we have to ask ourselves why that’s the case.” The seasonal agricultural worker program began in 1966, when 264 Jamaican farm hands arrived in Southern Ontario as a temporary solution to chronic farm labor shortages. It was designed “to prevent Black settlement,” Mr. Satzewich wrote in his book “Racism and the Incorporation of Foreign Labor.” Unlike earlier agricultural worker programs for Europeans, the Jamaican workers were not permitted to apply for Canadian citizenship or bring their families because of fear that there would be “race relations problems” and that they would not assimilate or be “competitive,” he wrote. The program has expanded to include more than 56,000 workers from a dozen countries, making up one in five farm workers across Canada. The coronavirus has infected more than 1,600 of them in Ontario alone this year and killed three. In theory, migrant farm workers are protected by all the laws that shield Canadian farm workers. But their contracts state that any worker fired for cause requires “immediate removal” from the country, which keeps people from complaining about abuses, advocates say. The federal government introduced an enforcement system in 2015, with a complaint line for migrant workers, but Canada’s auditor general deemed it inadequate: Only 13 of 173 planned inspections were completed in the 2016 fiscal year. This year, no farms have been found noncompliant. “The employers have too much power over their workers,” said Mr. Flores, 36, at a protest by migrant workers and their supporters in downtown Toronto in August. Around him, masked men and women held up pictures of Mr. Chaparro, his deceased co-worker. “It could have happened to any of us,” said Mr. Flores, a father of two from the outskirts of Mexico City, who has worked on farms across Canada in four of the past six years. This year, the program placed him at Scotlynn Sweetpac Growers, a family-run agribusiness with a large trucking fleet and 12,000 acres in Ontario, Florida and Georgia. He tested positive for the virus, but experienced only mild symptoms. The day after he learned of Mr. Chaparro’s death, he left the farm two hours southwest of Toronto. He has been supported since then by the advocacy group Migrant Workers Alliance For Change, which helped him file a complaint with the provincial labor board, seeking 40,000 Canadian dollars from Scotlynn for lost wages and suffering. He contends that he was fired for asserting publicly that the company had a role in Mr. Chaparro’s death. The farm’s owner, Scott Biddle, said his family had hired farm workers from Mexico for more than 30 years and never fired a single one. He said Mr. Flores was one of three workers who asked to be returned to Mexico after the outbreak began. Mr. Biddle said his farm had strictly followed the district’s coronavirus regulations, putting almost all the workers up in hotel rooms for two rounds of quarantine. He called Mr. Chaparro’s death an unfortunate reflection of the disease’s vagaries, not of systemic failures. “Every regulation was followed that needed to be,” he said, standing in a parking lot behind his office. “At the end of the day, these gentlemen are living in close contact, they work in close contact, they are frontline workers providing food.” He invited a New York Times reporter to speak to three of his employees, one of whom had worked for him for 32 years. Two confirmed that Mr. Chaparro had lain sick in bed for a week. They said that four other workers in the bunkhouse had also had fevers and that one coughed so much, they thought he had pneumonia. “All of us were 100 percent convinced it was just the change in climate,” said Daniel Hernandez Vargas, a roommate of Mr. Chaparro’s who was working at the farm this spring for the first time. Workers in another bunkhouse, who were unsure where to turn when one of them became seriously ill, reached out to the assistant to an anthropology professor, whom they had met during a previous growing season. With the help of the two academics nearly 2,000 miles away, at Okanagan College in British Columbia, an ambulance was called. “It had gotten to the point, one of their co-workers was so ill, he was slipping in and out of consciousness,” said the professor, Amy Cohen, who is an advocate for migrant workers. Mr. Biddle said he believed a foreman had called the ambulance, but wasn’t sure of the details. “If anyone showed any symptoms of being ill, they were always taken to the hospital,” he said.']",Outbreaks at farms have made Canadians question how well their system is really protecting vulnerable migrant workers.
"‘We Were Bulletproof’: As Child Soldiers Grow Up, Legacy of War Lingers",2020-10-12,By Hannah Beech,"['Twin leaders of Myanmar’s God’s Army were once thought to have magical powers. Now adults, they are contending with the trauma of exile, alcohol and loss. อ่านบทความนี้ในภาษาไทย | ဤဆောင်းပါးကို မြန်မာဘာသာဖြင့် ဖတ်ပါ။ 阅读简体中文版 | 閱讀繁體中文版 NAT THAN KWIN, Myanmar — Johnny Htoo lay on a concrete floor. His eyes stared at nothing in particular. Back when he was a boy, when he and his twin, Luther, commanded God’s Army, Johnny was renowned for seeing what others could not see. His soldiers, men hardened from one of the world’s most enduring civil wars, believed that Johnny and Luther Htoo could magically shield them from bullets — child talismans for an oppressed people, the ethnic Karen of Myanmar. Johnny’s cousin hushed the others in the shack on Thailand’s border with Myanmar. They waited for his words. Johnny, now 32, closed his eyes and eased into sleep. “Drunk,” whispered Hser Ler El, one of Johnny’s friends and followers. “Always drunk.” Hundreds of miles away, in the forests of eastern Myanmar, the light from a cheap cellphone shone on Luther Htoo’s bare chest, where a tattoo of the flag of the Karen people covered his heart. Below it was a pucker of scarred skin. Luther pointed to his eye socket, his knee, his thigh. There were at least 10 bullet wounds on his body, he said. He lapsed into silence. His eyes were glazed. “Drunk,” his girlfriend’s mother, Naw Htay Myint, said, more an observation than an indictment. “He’s always drunk.” Just before the turn of the century, Luther and Johnny Htoo, then not even 10 years old, took command of a Karen militia hundreds strong that aimed to protect the ethnic group from incursions by the Myanmar Army. The boys were barely taller than their rifles. But their followers, descendants of Baptists converted by American missionaries, worshiped the twins. Each, they said, could use prayer to conjure up a battalion of invisible soldiers sent by God. The Htoo boys — one with flowing hair and the poignant contemplation of a Raphael, the other with a fierce determination that belied his young years — generated worldwide attention when their crusade ended in a storm of bullets. At least 100 of God’s Army’s fighters, some children, were killed in years of battle. Many more lost limbs, livelihoods and their grip on reality. Two decades later, the Htoo twins’ mystique endures. The boys, now men, are the last connection to a lost home for their followers, who have dispersed across the world, from refugee camps in Thailand to exile communities in places like New Zealand and North Carolina. The displaced soldiers are from one of the many ethnic groups that make up a global diaspora of refugees that is now the largest in history. At least 100 million people around the world have had to flee their homes over the past decade. In Myanmar alone, more than one million ethnic minorities, mostly Rohingya Muslims, have been uprooted by conflict since 2016. As Myanmar’s borderlands remain at war, United Nations investigators have accused the nation’s army of acting with genocidal intent against its own people. After years in exile, Johnny and Luther’s fighters — and even Johnny and Luther themselves — have watched their physical scars heal. Some of their children are now Americans, Swedes and New Zealanders, pledging allegiance to other flags. But emotional wounds are harder to close, especially when refugee life means a constant struggle with menial jobs and still unfamiliar cultures. Post-traumatic stress remains undiagnosed. The coronavirus stalks their workplaces. As they escape to farther and colder climates, the former ranks of God’s Army have found that their present is still weighted by the past. Even for the younger generation, those who have never set foot in Myanmar, their lives are tied to a village long gone or an army since beaten. Luther and Johnny’s mother, sisters and other relatives were resettled in Auckland, New Zealand, 12 people now crammed into a five-room house. More than a decade after arriving in the country, the twins’ mother, Pe Khen, cannot get used to the highways or the inability to just stroll to a friend’s house on a dirt path. Everyone is isolated, Ms. Pe Khen said, even if a dozen relatives live together. “I want to go home,” she said. Then she reconsidered. “I don’t want to go home.” She sighed. Neither was wrong. But neither was right. Everyone in the village near God’s Mountain, deep in Karen country, knew that Johnny and Luther Htoo, born in 1988, were special. There was the tale of the time when Luther went to bathe in a stream and shape-shifted into an old man who might have been an apostle. There was the moment when Johnny supposedly walked on water, his long hair flowing like they imagined Jesus’ did. By the time the twins were a decade old, the villagers said, the boys had assembled armies of invisible men who could ambush Myanmar soldiers with barely a rustle of bamboo to give away their positions. The villagers had longed for a messiah, and they received two. “When I was pregnant, I dreamed that my sons were famous soldiers who wanted to be reborn,” Ms. Pe Khen said. “After Johnny and Luther were born, life got better. We could hunt more animals in the forest, and we were safe because they protected us.” The Htoo twins came from a family that farmed the land and fashioned homemade bullets for hunting. Myanmar Army offensives forced them into the forests along the porous border between Myanmar and Thailand when they were in kindergarten, and the boys were expected to join the Karen National Liberation Army, the largest Karen militia, as their father had. Karen rebels have been fighting the state almost since the moment that the country also known as Burma gained independence from Britain in 1948. The new nation was a patchwork federation of the majority Bamar and dozens of minority groups. But the Karen, some five million people, chafed against the fledgling government’s chauvinism. Some took up arms, as did other ethnic insurgents. When a xenophobic general overthrew the civilian government in 1962, he justified military rule as necessary to keep the union from collapse. In the late 1990s, the Karen, pronounced “kuh-REN,” were on the defensive. Karen insurgents, who had once controlled a ministate within Myanmar, lost most of their territory. Hundreds of thousands of Karen — not just Christian like Johnny and Luther but Buddhist and animist, too — fled to refugee camps in Thailand or toiled in the migrant seafood and construction industries. Many of the rest retreated into the malarial bush, only to abandon their shacks when Myanmar soldiers launched offensives. The United States has said such incursions by the Myanmar military, rife with sexual violence and village burnings, constitute ethnic cleansing. When Luther and Johnny were toddling around, Myanmar soldiers had begun clearing the forest to make way for a natural gas pipeline that would bring riches to the country’s military dictatorship. The Karen who lived on the land received almost nothing. As Myanmar infantrymen surged over the densely forested hills, the Karen National Liberation Army lost hundreds of soldiers. Johnny and Luther stayed to fight. They were crack shots, able to lug and steady their weapons against their small frames. They never stepped on land mines. And, villagers said, they emerged without a scratch, even as bullets flew like monsoon rain. “It’s like a super power in a movie,” Johnny said. “You know that you are being shot at but the bullets don’t hit.” God’s Army was born. The militia’s ranks were augmented by war orphans, who had nowhere else to go, a Swiss Family Robinson crossed with Lord of the Flies. Adult soldiers prayed in a circle and then lifted the twins on their shoulders during battle, like child amulets. South Korean Christians sent donations. The rules of God’s Army hewed to a strict Karen interpretation of Christianity. No eggs, no pork, no alcohol, no lying and no swearing. Verses from the Bible were used as battle directives. It didn’t seem to matter that the twins cursed and chain-smoked cheroots, that they were just boys. Johnny could be petulant. Luther was impish. Both were too small for their army fatigues. Their followers kept the faith, even as God’s Army’s adult commanders partnered with a radical student group that laid siege to the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok. “We did not drink alcohol, and we prayed every day to ask permission from God to make us safe,” said Eh Na Wah, a former God’s Army major. “We were bulletproof.” But they weren’t. Mr. Eh Na Wah was shot in a firefight in 1998, when God’s Army tried to fend off a brigade of Myanmar soldiers. Three God’s Army men were killed in that battle. Mr. Eh Na Wah’s leg was amputated above the knee. In 2000, members of the extremist student group and God’s Army stormed a hospital in Ratchaburi, a Thai town not far from the border with Myanmar, and took hundreds of patients as hostages. They were desperate for medical supplies for their wounded soldiers. The Thai Army responded decisively. All the hostage takers were killed. Luther and Johnny were not part of the raid, but God’s Army lost some of its best fighters. Within a year, the twins had surrendered to the Thai Army and ended up in a refugee camp in Thailand. God’s Army was finished. The boys were not even 13 years old. Of his early adulthood, Luther mostly remembers the cold. In 2009, he left the refugee camp in Thailand for Sweden. He didn’t know much about the country. The people were tall, he heard, and pale-headed. He, like his brother, barely reached five feet, perhaps the result of chronic malnutrition. Someone told him the seafood was good in Sweden. But the fish, giant and meaty, was not like the small river fish he used to catch, the sweetest flesh between tight bones. Luther lasted a decade in Gotene, a small town with three other Karen families and one Chinese restaurant. He tried. He thought it could be home. He learned about Swedish kings and socialism. He married another Karen refugee, and they had a child. He worked in a community center, taking care of older people. He divorced. The stress of dislocation has played out across the diaspora. The biggest Karen population in the West is in the United States, where tens of thousands of refugees have congregated. Life in the United States is materially better than in the Thai refugee camps or in their homeland, where most Karen were subsistence farmers. Yet more than one-third of Burmese Americans, of whom the majority of arrivals this century are Karen refugees, live below the poverty line, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2009, Saw Ma Cher, a Baptist pastor who once fought for God’s Army, moved with his wife, five children and 13 grandchildren to New Bern, N.C., a river town where nearly 1,000 Karen were resettled. The Karen revitalized New Bern’s Baptist ministries. They brought new energy to public schools. But neighbors stared when Karen families tried to dry fish outside. There was much to learn: ATMs, car insurance, boneless chicken breasts. One study found that the rate of ulcers among Karen refugees in the United States was significantly higher than normal, not just from the stress of war, but also from the hardship of making a new home. In 2015, a Karen teenager who had arrived in New Bern less than two years earlier walked next door to where another refugee family from Myanmar lived and killed three children with a machete. He is now in a mental institution. Most Karen refugees in the United States end up in low-wage jobs, like meat packing. It doesn’t take any English to lop off 2,000 turkey tails in an hour. When the coronavirus began infecting workers in factories around New Bern, about 70 Karen fell ill. One has died. “The coronavirus is worse than fighting in the forest because you cannot see the virus,” Mr. Saw Ma Cher, 72, said. Sel Lay Moo, whose relatives attend the 400-person Karen Baptist Church of New Bern, which Mr. Saw Ma Cher helped found, worries every time her father returns from work at a poultry processing plant. She arrived in New Bern a decade ago, at age 9. At school, she didn’t know how to ask for the bathroom in English, so she had to hold it in for hours. It took her mother 24 times to pass her driver’s test. Her older sister found work at a nail salon, and her older brother is in the Marine Corps. But Ms. Sel Lay Moo was young enough that English later came easily. She excelled at school. Ms. Sel Lay Moo hears the stories every day of the grinding conflict back in Myanmar: her uncle’s death at the hands of the army, a pair of twins who led their people to glory until it all shattered. “Yes, Ma’am,” she said. “As a kid at a time like that when everything is scary and everyone is fearing the Burmese Army, it’s not surprising to have kids who are so young to lead other people into fighting.” Her life has taken a different path. This year, Ms. Sel Lay Moo won a scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. She is the first member of her family to go to college. One day, in his home in Gotene, Sweden, a woolen hat on his head, Luther went on Facebook and plugged in a common Karen woman’s moniker: Naw. He scrolled through the Naws, looking for one that pleased him. For Naw Lay Kapaw Wah, living in a Karen village where Myanmar soldiers had sent inhabitants fleeing into the forest, the Facebook friend request seemed like a prank. Surely someone was impersonating Luther Htoo, one of the boy twins who had commanded God’s Army. It was the real Luther. He was lonely. After a couple years of online dating, she asked him to come home to Myanmar. He did two years ago, Swedish passport in hand. The couple now lives mostly on the edge of a forest, sleeping in a hammock or in a shack above the chickens. “I love Asia,” he said. “Sweden is very cold.” When the monsoons don’t fray the cell signal, and when there’s enough money to top up their phones, they talk with Luther’s family in New Zealand. (His father died in 2017.) The twins’ mother, Ms. Pe Khen, video-chats with Johnny, too. She is worried, like everyone else, about his drinking. “He misses his family,” she said. “He gets very emotional. I need to take care of him.” She reached her hand toward the phone screen, as if she were caressing his hair. Unlike Luther, Johnny has no passport to visit New Zealand. Besides, his mother said, he is still needed by the Karen. “I worry that the Burmese Army will shoot him,” she said. “But they need to fight for our people, for our freedom.” Johnny and Luther’s younger sister, Naw Paw Law Tah, is 17. After she finishes high school, she wants to study fashion or design, maybe. Her indecision is that of any teenager unbound by war. She once wrote an essay for school on the Karen. She wrote about how the Karen call their homeland Kawthoolei, how the Myanmar Army raped and killed, how children were turned into human land-mine detectors. She tried to describe the cool hills, thick with groves of bamboo, even though she has never seen them because she was born in a refugee camp in Thailand. She wrote about her twin big brothers, their piety and their powers. “I think it’s cool that they could be invisible,” she said. Her paper earned an “excellent” in assessments. It was her proudest moment in school. But the homeland of her essay does not exist. Today, the Karen armed groups have fractured into kaleidoscopic shards of initials: the K.N.L.A., the D.K.B.A., the B.G.F., among others. Some fight the Myanmar Army. Some fight each other. Across the country, Myanmar’s ethnic minorities continue to suffer. Damage is inflicted by both sides: a national army conditioned to target minorities and various ethnic militias that see armed struggle as a cultural obligation. Some cease-fires exist in paper form only. A peace process has gone nowhere. A national election scheduled for November has laid bare ethnic divisions that have festered since the founding of the country more than seven decades ago. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is now the nation’s civilian leader. She was once respected by Myanmar’s ethnic groups for the legacy of her father, the independence hero Gen. Aung San, who formed a nation by pledging equality for all of Burma’s peoples. Now, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s refusal to adequately condemn the military’s abuses means that she, too, has lost the trust of Myanmar’s ethnic minorities and of an international community that once conferred upon her a collection of human rights awards. Johnny and Luther dream of a new God’s Army. On Johnny’s arm is a tattoo, its Karen script rough like that of a child who grew up in the rainforest, measuring his height against an M16 rifle. “From my mother I was born in blood, and I will die in blood, too.” Luther talks of a cache of weapons he and his followers can access. He thinks he can become invisible again, if the incantations are right. Yet he has to plead for money from his mother to keep his cellphone active. His girlfriend concedes that they once prayed together on a full moon night, and Luther remained visible. “For peace, we want to fight again,” Luther said. “We want to do this, not only for Karen people, but all people in Burma.” Padoh Saw Hser Bwe, a joint general secretary of the Karen National Union, the largest Karen political force, remembers the magical powers that Johnny and Luther used to wield, their status “just one step lower than God.” That’s all gone, he said. “They have lost their magic power, and they are now in a foolish state,” he said. “Maybe those guys were something before. But not now.” Others still believe. “Luther and Johnny will fight for us again,” said Mr. Eh Na Wah, the God’s Army recruit who now lives in Auckland with his nine children. “As long as they believe in God, as long as they stay away from alcohol, they can lead us.” But the Htoo twins are often drunk. Both are unemployed. Johnny’s cousin soothes him and holds his hands, which shake with tremors. He sleeps when others are awake, curled up like a quotation mark missing its companion. “I miss the jungle,” said Johnny, who now lives in the village in Thailand, after spending years in the refugee camp. “I miss where I grew up.” The family of Luther’s girlfriend has told the village store not to sell him more liquor. He sometimes vomits blood after his binges. He is back home in Myanmar but still feels as lost as any exile. “I’m still living,” Luther said, an accomplishment in itself. “Alcohol can stop my sorrow.” One evening, in a jungle clearing in front of their shack, Luther and his girlfriend’s family gathered around a cellphone to watch a video of a gospel choir. The night insects hurtled at the screen, attracted by the light. Luther moved his lips with the lyrics on the screen. “God’s boundless mercy,” he sang. “We will live another day. We will fight the good fight another day.” Saw Nang contributed reporting from Nat Than Kwin, and Muktita Suhartono from Suan Phueng, Thailand.']",
"While Boris Johnson Sinks, Rishi Sunak Is on the Rise",2020-10-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Breakfast starts at 8 a.m. and guests help themselves to croissants and juice before the sleek figure of Rishi Sunak, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, works his way around the crowded, oak-paneled dining room of his official London home, No. 11 Downing Street. For Mr. Sunak, meetings with groups of Conservative Party lawmakers help him reach out and forge a network of support in Parliament. For the lawmakers, it’s a chance to meet someone many expect to one day move next door — to No. 10, the prime minister’s home. Virtually unknown 10 months ago, Mr. Sunak’s vertiginous rise has surprised almost everyone in British politics — in all likelihood even the man who promoted him, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose approval ratings have plummeted during the pandemic. “Rishi Sunak has the strengths that the prime minister so conspicuously lacks, not only basic competence, but a grasp of detail,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, “and no one has mounted such an obvious, in-your-face social media campaign as Rishi Sunak.” It seems to be working. A recent poll of party members by the ConservativeHome website placed Mr. Sunak, 40, easily top of cabinet satisfaction ratings, while Mr. Johnson was almost bottom of the list. Contrast that with a survey Professor Bale conducted last December in which Conservative Party members were asked who should take over were Mr. Johnson to step aside. “Just five out of 1,191 named Rishi Sunak,” he said, “and I’m not sure that all of them spelt his name correctly.” When he was catapulted into his job in February, after two years as a minister — including six months in the No. 2 job at the Treasury — Mr. Sunak was firmly in the shadow of Mr. Johnson, who had just won a landslide election victory. But while Mr. Johnson has floundered during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Sunak has been a beacon of calm and competence, intervening swiftly to spend billions of pounds supporting jobs as the economy went into lockdown free fall. With new restrictions coming into force in parts of the country, Mr. Sunak has announced new state support for affected areas and on Monday he gave a fluent defense of his latest measures at a media conference alongside Mr. Johnson. Perhaps wisely, given the speculation about his ambitions, Mr. Sunak tried to burst his own bubble when the Conservative Party held its recent party conference virtually. In a surprisingly short speech, he lavished praise on Mr. Johnson and warned that uncomfortable economic choices lay ahead. The subliminal message seemed to be: You might like me a little less when all this cash has to be paid back. But right now, they like him a lot, and his appeal among nonpartisan Britons has been burnished through slick social media posts on Instagram and Twitter designed around “Brand Rishi.” Allies insist that Mr. Sunak is simply using digital media techniques to communicate more effectively rather than to promote his ambitions. His posts stand out from the drab detritus of political advertising, though. Often they feature a stylish photograph of the chancellor endorsing a policy with his distinctive signature, rather like a sporting celebrity might promote an expensive fitness accessory. This was probably not what Mr. Johnson expected when he promoted Mr. Sunak to take over from Sajid Javid, the previous chancellor who resigned after refusing to accept curbs on his right to hire his own advisers. Mr. Sunak agreed, leading some to speculate that he would be more compliant. In Britain, the relationship between prime minister and chancellor — although a central pivot of government — is often one of rivalry and tension. So the idea in February was to ensure that there was one center of power on economic policy: No. 10 Downing Street. But few prime ministers can afford to fire two chancellors, so Mr. Johnson was taking a risk in appointing someone as adept and diligent as Mr. Sunak. Not only is Mr. Sunak a smooth communicator but, with his Indian heritage, he is a walking success story of modern multiracial Britain. His grandparents, originally from Punjab, arrived in England from British colonial East Africa in the 1960s. As a teenager, he says he suffered racist abuse. “It stung, I still remember, it’s seared in my memory,” he told the BBC, recounting how he had been abused in a restaurant. But while Mr. Javid, his predecessor, was the son of a bus driver from Pakistan, Mr. Sunak’s father was a doctor and his mother ran a pharmacy. Together, they earned enough to send him to an elite private school, Winchester College. Without that expensive education, Mr. Sunak might well still have reached Oxford University (He graduated with top grades.) But his schooling seems to have helped instill the confidence and social polish that has allowed him to move effortlessly through the ranks of the Conservative Party. Before his political career began in earnest, Mr. Sunak also earned an M.B.A. at Stanford University. There, he met his future wife, Akshata Murthy, daughter of Narayana Murthy, the billionaire co-founder of the IT giant Infosys and one of India’s richest men. Mr. Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and two hedge funds before being elected to Parliament in 2015. In the 2016 referendum on European Union membership, he voted to leave. That decision sped his promotion through the ranks, though some hard-line Brexit supporters say that they suspect it was a tactical move and that they believe he is pressing Mr. Johnson to strike a trade deal with the European Union. One of Mr. Sunak’s few political vulnerabilities is his wealth. There was barbed commentary when he was photographed with a $235 “smart mug” that keeps coffee or tea at a precise drinking temperature for up to three hours and when he described working out on an exercise bike that retails at around 10 times that amount. But Mr. Sunak is generally good at avoiding gaffes and is well plugged into the media world. He was the best man at the wedding of a school friend, James Forsyth, and Allegra Stratton. Mr. Forsyth is the political editor of The Spectator, a conservative weekly, and Ms. Stratton is a former journalist and broadcaster. She is currently employed by Mr. Sunak as an adviser but is expected to become the spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, in which capacity she will conduct televised news conferences. Mr. Sunak’s allies see this as an illustration of the close ties between the Downing Street neighbors. But, while relations appear good at the moment, tensions have surfaced. Last month Mr. Sunak moved to protect the economy by fighting off many lockdown restrictions suggested by scientists advising the government. Those differences are likely to grow. Some day, Britain will have to start to repay its huge pile of debt. Mr. Johnson neither wants to return to austerity nor to raise taxes, but some decision cannot be delayed indefinitely. Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group and a fellow at the London School of Economics, said, “The chancellor has been in the privileged position of playing Father Christmas throughout the pandemic, one of the few politicians bearing gifts rather than taking them away.” “Tax rises are on the horizon,” she added, “and he will soon have to take tough decisions about which industries to prop up and which parts of the electorate to shield from the worst of the pandemic’s economic hit.” Should unemployment rise to levels not seen since the 1980s, Mr. Sunak would surely take at least some of the blame. But, Ms. Gaston noted, he has already shown himself to be an outstanding communicator and a consultative and pragmatic leader. “If his branding can remain strong during the next six months of economic doom and gloom, there can be no limits on the scope of his political ambitions,” she said. So far, Mr. Sunak has successfully distanced himself from the questions over competence that have gathered around Mr. Johnson and much of his cabinet. He has also avoided the culture wars regularly stirred by some of Mr. Johnson’s pugilistic, pro-Brexit advisers, who seem never happier than when attacking the pillars of the establishment. That leaves him neatly positioned as an exponent of a more competent and inclusive type of politics, an enticing package should a vacancy arise next door on Downing Street. “In his position, you can’t afford to look too eager,” Professor Bale of Queen Mary University of London said. “But, on the other hand, you can’t afford to miss your moment when it comes.”']","A virtual unknown 10 months ago, the wealthy and polished British finance chief gained stature during the pandemic, while remaining in his boss’s good graces."
Jewelry Ad Featuring Interfaith Couple Sparks Outrage in India,2020-10-13,By Geneva Abdul,"['An Indian jewelry brand withdrew an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple after Hindu nationalists accused the company of “love jihad,” a pejorative used to describe marriage between Muslim men and Hindu women in India. The forty-three second ad, released last week, featured a pregnant woman in a sari, making her way through a luminous home to a garden prepared for her baby shower. The advertisement, since removed from Facebook and YouTube, was described by the jeweler, Tanishq, as a “beautiful confluence of two different religions, traditions and cultures,” reported the BBC. It was meant to promote a new jewelry collection called “Ekatvam,” a Sanskrit word that translates as “oneness.” “Beautiful things happen when people come together,” reads a description on the company’s website, including the slogan: “The beauty of oneness. One as humanity. One as a nation.” But on social media, the ad quickly created fault lines, and #BoycottTanishq soon topped Twitter trends. “Why are you showing a Hindu ‘daughter-in-law’ to a Muslim family and glorifying it,” Khemchand Sharma, a member of the country’s governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, asked on Twitter. Mr. Sharma accused the company of love jihad, and of favoring one faith over another. “Why don’t you show a Muslim daughter-in-law in your ads with a Hindu family?” “Love jihad” is a term coined by right-wing Hindu nationalists who have accused India’s Muslim minority of persuading Hindu women into marriage to convert them to Islam. The term was previously used by Yogi Adityanath, also a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who was later reprimanded for hate speech. Shashi Tharoor, one of the country’s most influential opposition politicians, pushed back against the ad’s critics. “If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” Mr. Tharoor wrote on Twitter. Others said it was “foolish” of the company to “bow down” to online trolls, and described the removal of the ad as a “very sad state of affairs.” Chetan Bhagat, an Indian author, tweeted for Tanishq to “Keep the ad. Stay Strong. Stay Indian.” In a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, the company said that the ad was meant to “celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life,” and that the severe reactions to it were “contrary to its very objective.” The ad was removed to protect the “well being of our employees, partners and store staff,” according to the company’s statement. Interfaith relationships are very rare in India, and when they do exist, they create additional social pressures, said Amit Thorat, an assistant professor at the Center for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University. A survey that Mr. Thorat helped conduct found that only 5 percent of marriages in India are intercaste. A 2016 survey found that a majority of people opposed marriages across both caste and religion. “Society is not ready, the social protection which is required from the state is just not there,” said Mr. Thorat. “And the environment which we have right now, a kind of a Hindu religious fundamentalist kind of government, it’s going to be that much more difficult.” Critics argue that policies enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have fanned religious hatred. Muslims make up around 14 percent of the population in India while Hindus account for roughly 74 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people. The centuries-old practice of arranged marriages is still common and interreligious couples often face threats and violence. India’s Muslim minority has been increasingly demonized in the pandemic. The health ministry has blamed Muslims for spreading the virus across the country, which now has more than seven million cases. Following a crackdown in Kashmir and a new, contested citizenship law, Muslims have also faced a wave of violence in recent months. In 2018, India’s Supreme Court upheld the right of citizens to choose their spouse and convert to another religion. The ruling was considered a blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party, leading right-wing Hindu nationalists to embrace the term “love jihad.”']",The jeweler withdrew its forty-three second advertisement after Hindu nationalists accused the company of promoting “love jihad” on social media.
July is the new January: More companies delay a return to the office.,2020-10-13,By Gillian Friedman and Kellen Browning,"['When the coronavirus pandemic closed offices around the United States in March, many companies told their employees that it would be a short hiatus. Workers, they said, would be back in cubicles within a matter of weeks. Weeks turned into September. Then September turned into January. And now, with the virus still surging in some parts of the country, a growing number of employers are delaying return-to-office dates once again, to the summer of 2021. Google was one of the first to announce that July 2021 was its return date. Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon followed. In the past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor and The New York Times said they, too, had postponed the return of in-person work to next summer and acknowledged the inevitable: The pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon. Many more companies are expected to delay their return-to-office dates to keep workers safe. And workers said they were in no rush to go back, with 73 percent of U.S. employees fearing that being in their workplace could pose a risk to their personal health and safety, according to a study by Wakefield Research commissioned by Envoy, a workplace technology company. More companies are also saying that they will institute permanent work-from-home policies. In May, Facebook was one of the first to announce that it would allow many employees to work remotely even after the pandemic. Twitter, Coinbase, Shopify and Microsoft have also said they would do so. The postponement of return dates is a “psychological blow for those who expected this to be a transition phase,” said Tsedal Neeley, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. “The reality is hitting that, ‘There won’t be a vaccine as I expected very quickly. This is going to be my life, and I’d better learn how to do this.’”']",
Covid-19 vaccines are a chance at salvation for drug makers.,2020-10-13,"By Jesse Drucker, David Gelles and Katie Thomas","['For a long time, drug makers have been the most hated industry in America, blamed for gouging prices on lifesaving drugs and enriching themselves through the opioid crisis, among other sins. Now, with pharmaceutical companies racing to find vaccines to end the coronavirus pandemic, the industry is hoping to redeem itself in the public’s mind. The primary goal, of course, is to rescue the world from the grips of a vicious virus. But a big fringe benefit is to get public credit — and to use an improved image to fend off government efforts to more heavily regulate the industry. Consider Johnson & Johnson. In recent years, its reputation has been battered by accusations that products like its artificial hips and talcum powder have harmed customers. In 2019, an Oklahoma judge ordered the company to pay $572 million for contributing to the opioid epidemic. This spring, Johnson & Johnson jumped into the hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine; its candidate is in the final stage of clinical trials, though that trial has been paused, the company said on Monday night, after a participant got sick. Regardless of whether the vaccine ever comes to market, the company is looking to create a surge of positive publicity from its work. Its chief executive, Alex Gorsky, went on the “Today” show this spring and called Johnson & Johnson’s lab workers heroes.  For an industry demonized by consumers and politicians, the hunt for a vaccine “offers a path to redemption,” said J. Stephen Morrison, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. Last fall, a Gallup poll found that drug makers had the worst reputation of any American industry.  The pandemic — and the high hopes for a fast, safe, effective vaccine — appears to be changing that perception. This spring, other opinion polls showed that Americans’ views of the industry were improving. When Gallup released the results of this year’s annual survey, conducted in the first half of August, the results confirmed that the pharmaceutical industry’s reputation had gotten a bit better. Now, it is second-to-last, having inched past the U.S. government.']",
White House embraces a declaration from scientists that opposes lockdowns and relies on ‘herd immunity.’,2020-10-13,By Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"['The White House has embraced a declaration by a group of scientists arguing that authorities should allow the coronavirus to spread among young healthy people while protecting the elderly and the vulnerable — an approach that would rely on arriving at “herd immunity” through infections rather than a vaccine. Many experts say “herd immunity” — the point at which a disease stops spreading because nearly everyone in a population has contracted it — is still very far-off. Leading experts have concluded, using different scientific methods, that about 85 to 90 percent of the American population is still susceptible to the coronavirus. On a call convened Monday by the White House, two senior administration officials, both speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to give their names, cited an October 4 petition titled The Great Barrington Declaration, which argues against lockdowns and calls for a reopening of businesses and schools. “Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,” the declaration states, adding, “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.” The declaration has more than 9,000 signatories from all over the world, its website says, though most of the names are not public. The document grew out of a meeting hosted by the American Institute for Economic Research, a libertarian-leaning research organization. Its lead authors include Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, an economist at Stanford University, the academic home of Dr. Scott Atlas, President Trump’s science adviser. Dr. Atlas has also espoused herd immunity. The declaration’s signatories include Sunetra Gupta and Gabriela Gomes, two scientists who have proposed that societies may achieve herd immunity when 10 to 20 percent of their populations have been infected with the virus, a position most epidemiologists disagree with. Last month, at the request of The New York Times, three epidemiological teams calculated the percentage of the country that is infected. What they found runs strongly counter to the theory being promoted in influential circles that the United States has either already achieved herd immunity or is close to doing so, and that the pandemic is all but over. That conclusion would imply that businesses, schools and restaurants could safely reopen, and that masks and other distancing measures could be abandoned. “The idea that herd immunity will happen at 10 or 20 percent is just nonsense,” said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produced the epidemic model frequently cited during White House news briefings as the epidemic hit hard in the spring. The move comes amid a coronavirus outbreak at the White House that has now grown to more than 20 people, as evidence mounts that the administration did little to prevent or contain the virus’s spread. On Tuesday night, officials with the Department of Labor said that the wife of the secretary, Eugene Scalia, tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the day. Trish Scalia, who was said to be experiencing “mild symptoms,” and her husband were at a Rose Garden event honoring Judge Amy Coney Barrett that is being eyed as the source of several infections in people connected to the White House. The secretary tested negative, officials said, but he will work from home “for the time being.”']",
"Feared Shabab Exploit Somali Banking and Invest in Real Estate, U.N. Says",2020-10-11,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — The Shabab, the Somalia-based militant group that is Al Qaeda’s most powerful ally in Africa, is not only collecting millions of dollars in tariffs and payoffs but moving the money through local banks and even investing it in real estate and businesses, according to a new United Nations Security Council report. The report describes how the Shabab, known for suicide attacks and a severe interpretation of Islam that bans music and other pleasures, have diversified their funding streams. Although financial dealings with the Shabab are prohibited under Security Council sanctions, the report said the group had found ways to expand from strictly cash transactions into utilizing bank accounts and electronic mobile services to save, transfer and invest money. A Security Council panel of experts that monitors Somalia produced the report, which has not yet been made public. The New York Times obtained an advance copy. The Shabab’s deadly attacks have wreaked havoc in Somalia and across East Africa. The group sustains an estimated 4,000 fighters, and expands its power, by collecting money from around south and central Somalia, including in the capital, Mogadishu, the report said. The group charges vehicles transporting goods, demands that businesses pay a monthly fee and forcibly collects zakat, the annual alms that observant Muslims are expected to pay. The Shabab also have penetrated Mogadishu’s port, blackmailing importers to pay a levy on goods, the report said. In all the cases the report documented, business owners paid up, citing threats and violence if they refused. The report found evidence that Shabab operatives had stored and transferred the money through accounts operated by Salaam Somali Bank, a leading bank in Somalia. In response, the bank said that it had never “opened an account for a sanctioned individual or entity” and that it had taken unspecified actions against suspicious accounts, but it did not rule out the possibility that the Shabab had found surreptitious ways to use the bank. The country’s finance minister also acknowledged the Shabab’s ability to exploit the banking system and called the group’s financiers “very cunning.” The report comes just a few months before crucial elections in Somalia, a strategically located country in the Horn of Africa that has endured cycles of dysfunction and mayhem for decades. It also is contending with the coronavirus pandemic, swarms of locusts that are destroying crops and floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The Shabab pose a growing threat to Somalia and the region, even though the group has lost territory in the past five years, suffered high-level defections and been degraded by sustained American airstrikes. The report is especially damning for the Somali government, which is backed by the United States and the United Nations. They have insisted that Somalia take steps to modernize its banking so that groups like the Shabab that are under sanction cannot exploit the system’s weaknesses. “Al-Shabab’s use of formal banking systems enables the immediate transfer and distribution of large amounts, including in areas it no longer directly controls, eliminating the risk of physically transporting cash across hostile territory,” the report said. The Security Council’s experts on Somalia, a six-member panel based in Nairobi, are responsible for monitoring compliance with sanctions imposed on Somalia. The panel undertook the same work on Eritrea, another Horn of Africa country, until 2018, when sanctions there were lifted after Eritrea mended relations with neighboring Ethiopia. In past years, the panel’s reports have examined topics such as how food aid in Somalia was redirected by corrupt contractors and how the Shabab’s bomb-making operations became sophisticated. But the focus this year has largely been on the Shabab’s sources and movement of funds.  During the reporting period, from last December to this August, the report’s authors found evidence that the Shabab had generated about $13 million in revenue. This included an estimated $2.4 million from checkpoints in the Lower Juba region in southern Somalia and $5.8 million from charging businesses in the southern port city of Kismayo. The report includes redacted copies of receipts for these transactions. Two bank accounts associated with the Shabab — paid into by retailers, shipping agencies and car dealerships — generated more than $3 million. The report linked the transfers to the Salaam Somali Bank. In two separate accounts reviewed by the panel of experts — one receiving port duties, the other alms collection — the panel found large cash deposits and frequent transfers that exceeded the $10,000 limit that would have required the bank to report them. In one of the accounts, $1.7 million was transferred entirely in 87 transactions, with one person receiving $310,000. Over a 48-hour period in May, more than $322,000 was transferred from these two accounts to a third bank account, the report said, showing “an institutional link between the accounts and an organized approach to the distribution of funds.” The panel of experts recorded a total of 128 transactions that would have warranted disclosure to Somalia’s Financial Reporting Center, which investigates suspicious financial activities. A review of the accounts “revealed no obvious legitimate outgoings or expenditures,” the report said. In a statement, a Salaam spokesman said the bank had taken “appropriate actions against numerous accounts” believed linked to “suspicious activity.” The bank also said the United Nations had reached out to it about the panel’s investigation but that since the bank had not “received the details of these accounts” it was “unable to determine whether the appropriate action has been taken against these accounts.” After decades of war, Somalia has achieved a modicum of peace, as it looks to build functioning public institutions. This includes oversight of financial outlets like banks and the passage of laws against money laundering and terrorism financing. But enforcement by the weak Somali government remains inadequate, hindered by many obstacles, including the lack of widespread proof of legal identity. The U.N. report noted how identity documents used to open the Shabab’s bank accounts had been acquired just days before. A recent study also showed how the country’s informal hawala system of money transfer underpinned the sale and trade of illicit arms. In an interview, Somalia’s finance minister, Abdirahman Beileh, acknowledged the Shabab’s pervasive use of domestic financial systems. “We are meeting with the banks and informing them of the danger they are in,” he said in an interview from Mogadishu. Calling the Shabab a “mafia,” he said that whenever the authorities closed one loophole, the group figured out another way to move money. “These are people who are very smart and very cunning,” he said. The report also described the Shabab’s well-organized financial system, with regular audits to prevent losses. Besides spending on intelligence and military expenditures, the group has invested tens of thousands of dollars in property and business enterprises in Mogadishu’s bustling Bakara Market, which sells a wide range of goods and is the country’s biggest open-air bazaar. The findings prove how the Shabab are embedded deep into Somali society, said Rashid Abdi, an analyst and researcher who specializes in the Horn of Africa. “It’s no longer an insurgency but an economic power,” Mr. Abdi said in a telephone interview. “It’s a shadow state that’s out-taxing the government even in areas it doesn’t control.” The Shabab, he said, are becoming a “much more entrenched, resilient and deep-rooted organization that doesn’t have to rely on might or military force to stay relevant.”']","Despite sanctions, Shabab militants have found ways to extort, move and invest money using Somalia’s banking system, a United Nations panel says."
Johnson & Johnson pauses its coronavirus vaccine trial because of a volunteer’s ‘unexplained illness.’,2020-10-13,"By Virginia Hughes, Katie Thomas, Carl Zimmer and Katherine J. Wu","['Johnson & Johnson has paused the large late-stage clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine because of an “unexplained illness” in one of the volunteers, the company said on Monday. The company did not say whether the sick participant had received the experimental vaccine or a placebo. The pause was first reported by the health news website Stat. On Tuesday morning, shares of Johnson & Johnson fell about 2 percent on the S&P 500. Johnson & Johnson, which just began the so-called Phase 3 trial of its vaccine last month, was behind several of its competitors in the vaccine race, but its vaccine had some advantages over others. It does not need to be frozen, and it could need just one dose instead of two. It would also be the largest trial, with a goal of enrolling 60,000 volunteers. “Adverse events — illnesses, accidents, etc. — even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” the company said in a statement. “We’re also learning more about this participant’s illness, and it’s important to have all the facts before we share additional information.” Trial pauses are often lifted quickly after the illness is investigated and deemed not to be a serious safety risk. “It’s actually a good thing that these companies are pausing these trials when these things come up,” said Dr. Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco, a trial site for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. “We just need to let the sponsor and the safety board do their review and let us know their findings.” “It doesn’t mean that the adverse event is related to the vaccine, but it needs to be investigated thoroughly,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, who oversaw public health preparedness for the National Security Council under President Trump and was acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration under former President Barack Obama. Depending on the findings, she said, additional data may be collected, trial rules may be modified, or other steps may be taken to ensure safety. Johnson & Johnson’s is not the first trial to be paused because of safety concerns. Two participants in AstraZeneca’s trial became seriously ill after getting its vaccine. That trial was halted twice — most recently last month — and has still not resumed in the United States, though locations abroad swiftly broke the pause. Both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca developed their vaccines using adenovirus vectors, modified viruses engineered to carry coronavirus genes into human cells. AstraZeneca’s vaccine used an adenovirus that causes common colds in chimpanzees. Johnson & Johnson’s used another adenovirus, called Ad26, which has also been used in its approved vaccine for Ebola. Experts say safety issues must be investigated and are one reason late-stage trials cannot be rushed —\xa0even for a president who has repeatedly claimed that a vaccine will be ready before the U.S. election on Nov. 3. “This kind of event epitomizes why vaccine development can’t be influenced by artificial timelines such as an election,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine.']",
"E.U. Agrees to Penalize Lukashenko, but Gives Him Time to Back Down",2020-10-12,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — European Union foreign ministers agreed on Monday to impose sanctions on President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, widely seen as having stolen the recent election — but they also appeared to offer him a way out of the penalties. The proposed sanctions must first go through legal vetting and may not be implemented if Mr. Lukashenko engages in serious talks with the opposition about new elections and eases a crackdown against protesters. Some 40 Belarusian officials have already faced an asset freeze and a travel ban. After a violent confrontation in Belarus on Sunday in which the police used water cannons and arrested more than 700 protesters, the E.U. foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to expand the list to include the authoritarian president and others. “In line with the E.U.’s gradual approach, the E.U. stands ready to take further restrictive measures, including against entities and high-ranking officials, including A. Lukashenko,’’ they said in a statement. Once the legal work is done, the ministers will have to approve the implementation of any new sanctions, which they are trying to use as a means to pressure Mr. Lukashenko. He has been under E.U. sanctions in the past, but they were lifted in 2016 when he eased up on the opposition and released some critics from prison. Mr. Lukashenko is already under sanctions from the United States and Britain, as well as from the Baltic nations. In response, Belarus has expelled several ambassadors of E.U. member states. On Monday, the country’s Interior Ministry threatened to use lethal weapons against the demonstrators.  Gennady Kazakevich, the first deputy interior minister, said in a statement that protests recently had turned “extremely radical” and that security forces would now have the option of using more than the rubber bullets, stun grenades, violent arrests and mass detentions that had been deployed previously to stop the demonstrations. “Police officers and interior troops won’t leave the streets and will use special equipment and military weapons if necessary,” Mr. Kazakevich said. The E.U. ministers also agreed on Monday to scale back the financial support the bloc gives to the Belarus government and to redirect some of the funds to civil society groups. The bloc has already declared that it does not recognize Mr. Lukashenko as the legitimate president of Belarus after elections on Aug. 9 that it deemed fraudulent. “The EU calls on the Belarusian authorities to seek a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis through an inclusive national dialogue with broader society,” the ministers said, supporting a plan by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help set up such talks. The ministers said that a substantial package of aid would be available to support a democratic transition. Mr. Lukashenko appeared to show some willingness to negotiate when, on Saturday, he visited to a jail in central Minsk, the capital, to hold a meeting with detained opposition leaders. The meeting lasted more than four hours, during which Mr. Lukashenko discussed possible changes to the country’s Constitution, according to a brief video of his speech. The E.U. ministers also agreed to impose sanctions on Russian officials and organizations blamed for the poisoning of Aleksei A. Navalny, a prominent opposition leader, with a nerve agent. But the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, provided no details about who in Russia might face sanctions or when the measures might come into force, saying that technical work on preparing the action was proceeding. Monika Pronczuk contributed research from Brussels, and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.

Pelosi defends demand for broad stimulus package as Senate prepares scaled-down bill,2020-10-13,By Emily Cochrane,"['Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California defended her unwillingness to accept anything less than a broad coronavirus stimulus package in negotiations with the administration, on the same day that President Trump called on Twitter for negotiators to “go big or go home!!!” Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are heading toward a vote to advance a scaled-down package that Democrats are unlikely to support. In a heated CNN interview, Ms. Pelosi chastised Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchor, and his colleagues as “apologists for the Republican position” after Mr. Blitzer noted that some Democrats, including Andrew Yang and Representative Ro Khanna of California, have urged her in recent days to cut a deal with the administration. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, last put forward a $1.8 trillion framework in negotiations. “Honest to God, I can’t get over it,” Ms. Pelosi said, who muscled a $2.2 trillion proposal through the House earlier this month. “Andrew Yang, he’s lovely. Ro Khanna, he’s lovely. They are not negotiating this situation. They have no idea of the particulars. They have no idea of what the language is here.” The interview on Tuesday further underscored Ms. Pelosi’s unwillingness to accept a scaled-down bill, even as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced the Senate would vote to advance such a package when the full chamber returns later this month. Senate Democrats have also accused their Republican counterparts of prioritizing a Supreme Court confirmation over negotiating a stimulus bill. The scaled-down package, Mr. McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky, is likely around $500 billion and containing funds for hospitals, schools, enhanced unemployment benefits and the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular federal loan program for small businesses that has expired without congressional action. It is unlikely that such a package would secure the necessary Democratic support needed to clear the chamber, a reality further highlighted by the combative CNN interview with Ms. Pelosi. When Mr. Blitzer pressed her again to not let perfect be the enemy of the good, given the mounting toll of the pandemic, she said the administration’s offer was “not even close to the good.” In a private caucus call before the interview, she and her top lieutenants on Tuesday continued to rail against the administration’s latest offer was inadequate. “We really need to have an agreement, but we cannot have an agreement by just folding,” she said. “I don’t think our leverage has ever been greater than it is now.” Ms. Pelosi pushed back on the suggestion that she should accept anything less than the latest $2.2 trillion Democratic proposal, after coming down from the original $3.4 trillion proposal the House approved in May. “I appreciate, shall we say, a couple people saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it,’” Ms. Pelosi said. “Take it? Take it? Even the president is saying, ‘Go big or go home.’” But the $1.8 trillion offer also faced additional resistance among the majority of Senate Republicans, who lashed out at top administration officials on Saturday for putting forward a counteroffer that they felt to be too expensive and veering toward catering too much to Democratic priorities.']",
‘Call Me a Dreamer’: A Shattered Beirut Neighborhood Rebuilds,2020-10-11,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — After the August port explosion that disfigured much of Beirut, many compared the city to a phoenix that would rise again. “We are staying,” read some signs in the famous nightlife district of Mar Mikhael, one of the worst-hit neighborhoods. Down the main thoroughfare in Gemmayzeh, another badly damaged area whose graceful old buildings housed storied families and Beirut newcomers alike, it was the same: Residents vowed to return, and banners on buildings promised to rebuild. Two months later, some businesses have begun to reopen, and teams of volunteer engineers and architects are working to save heritage buildings. But even the bullish say they do not believe a full recovery is possible, pointing to the lack of government leadership and resources, combined with an imploding economy that has put even basic repairs beyond the wallets of many residents. If Beirut is a phoenix, it has already endured too much, they say: civil war; war with Israel; incompetent and corrupt governments; huge protests, the coronavirus and now this. Though they were traditionally Christian neighborhoods, Mar Mikhael, Gemmayzeh and the surrounding areas attracted young Lebanese of different religious backgrounds, as well as foreigners and tourists, to its bars, cafes and art galleries.Gay, lesbian and transgender people felt safe. Entrepreneurs and designers moved in. Dusty hardware stores sat a few doors down from trendy coffee shops. The explosion has threatened that unique social fabric, locals say. And not all are ready to return. It would feel like erasing what happened, a few said — like walking blithely over a grave. At the edge of Gemmayzeh, between a church and an antique chandelier shop, a narrow street darts up the hill at odd angles. Locals call it Thieves’ Lane, from long ago, when it was a quick getaway route from the authorities. Over the last year, antigovernment protesters dodging tear gas have often sprinted the same way and ducked into Demo, a bar with pleasantly worn wooden benches and experimental music thrumming from the D.J. booth. Its owner, Tarek Mourad, 38, opened Demo with a partner a decade ago, and it became a Beirut classic. The bar’s glass front was smashed in the explosion, and Mr. Mourad turned to GoFundMe to replace it. “When you spend years planting something,” he said, “and suddenly there’s something that cuts the plant down, you hope the roots are there.” But he was not sure whether everything that made Demo what it had been would return — the small shops and bakeries nearby that gave the street life, neighbors who stopped in for coffee or a beer. “Everyone that works at Demo, or lives around it, needs to get back and get their lives back,” he said. “But it’s not just Demo, it’s a whole neighborhood. For years, I walked through Gemmayzeh daily. Now it’s not there anymore. What form it’ll take, I don’t know.” Fadlo Dagher’s family began building their pale-blue villa on the main street of Gemmayzeh in 1820. To him, the houses in the neighborhood — and throughout Beirut — represent the tolerant, diverse, sophisticated country Lebanon was meant to be. “This is the image of openness,” he said, “the image of a cosmopolitan culture.” The houses — generally wide dwellings a few stories high, with red tiled roofs and tall, street-facing triple-arched windows opening onto a central hall — began appearing in Beirut by the mid-1800s, after the city grew into a hub for trade between Damascus, Syria, and the Mediterranean. The style blended architectural ideas from Iran, Venice and Istanbul. While the new houses’ walls were of Lebanese sandstone, their marble floors and columns were imported from Italy, roof tiles from Marseille, France, and cedar timbers from Turkey. Despite war, neglect and a 20th-century fashion for high-rises, many of the old houses stood untouched in Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael until the explosion, which seriously damaged about 360 structures built between 1860 and 1930. To abandon them, Mr. Dagher said, would be to jettison one of the few shared legacies of a perpetually fractured country. “I’d like to imagine that what is happening here, this diversity, this mixed city, that it still exists, that maybe it can reflourish,” he said. “Is it mission impossible? I don’t know. But, OK, call me a dreamer. This is what I want it to be.” Habib Abdel Massih, his wife and son were in the small corner convenience store he owns in Gemmayzeh when the neighborhood blew apart, injuring all three. He has spent his whole life in the neighborhood, watching it change from quiet residential area to cultural destination. “Suddenly, everything changed,” he said. “Most of the people I used to know have left.” He worried that rebuilding would prove too expensive, that neither original residents nor newcomers would come back. A few weeks after the blast, Mr. Abdel Massih, 55, was preparing to reopen his store. A cast sheathed his foot. He was selling water and coffee, he said. Not much else. Sursock is the name of the neighborhood up the hill from Gemmayzeh. It is also the name of the area’s main street, the museum on that street, the palace a few doors down and the family that lives in that palace. All are now damaged. Lady Yvonne Sursock Cochrane grew up in the palace, which was built by her forebears in the mid-1800s. She spent decades protecting it — first from Lebanon’s 15-year civil war (by staying put), and then from overdevelopment (by buying up neighboring properties). She was injured in the Aug. 4 explosion as she sat on her terrace, debris falling in a neat border around her chair. She died on Aug. 31, aged 98. Her last look at the house showed this: roof partly caved in; frescoed ceilings more holes than plaster; marble statues shattered; Ottoman-era furniture splintered; antique tapestries torn; intricately latticed windows blown in. Her son and daughter-in-law, Roderick and Mary Cochrane, are rebuilding. They do not yet know the price, only that it will be astronomical. “You restore things because it’s part of the history,” said Ms. Cochrane, an American. She was hospitalized after the explosion but recovered. “We take care of it for future generations.” Mr. Cochrane added: “Mar Mikhael and Gemmayzeh should remain a place for Lebanese, for small designers, small shops, small business owners. Without these, there’d be no Beirut. We’d be a city like Dubai.” Just off the main drag of Mar Mikhael — where the sound of laughter, clinking glasses and pounding car stereos once floated up from the pubs to the balconies nearly every night — sit Butcher’s BBQ and, nearby, a cocktail bar, Tenno. The main street is dark and quiet now; many homes remain uninhabitable. But Tenno is open. Bashir Wardini and his partners raised about $15,000 through GoFundMe, and in mid-September muted their doubts and reopened to host a friend’s birthday drinks. They had not been sure customers were ready to return. They were not sure they were ready, either. “Many of us, and our customers, said, ‘No, you have to reopen, you have to move on, because the street needs to feel some kind of life again,’” Mr. Wardini said. Tenno looks itself again, but the rest of the neighborhood feels wrong. Mr. Wardini said still he avoids going there, unless he has to. “It takes a few drinks too many to forget the surroundings,” he said.']",
Britain’s New Measures to Control Virus Inflame North-South Tensions,2020-10-12,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday ordered pubs, bars and gyms in the high-risk city of Liverpool to be closed, a move that inflamed tensions with local officials and laid bare how the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is hitting Britain’s north harder than London or the rest of the south. Mr. Johnson’s measures dramatized the country’s increasingly urgent battle to avert a repeat of last spring’s deadly outbreak. But the rigors of this latest campaign are being felt unevenly: 2.4 million people in Liverpool and its suburbs face tough new restrictions while for now, life in London goes on more or less normally. The prime minister introduced a much-heralded three-tier system of restrictions which he promised would simplify what had become a confusing patchwork of targeted lockdowns in cities around the country. Rather than calm the waters, the plan has infuriated officials in the north of England, who complain that they were cut out of the government’s deliberations. And the new lockdowns — aimed at the areas where the virus is most rampant — will throttle their economies, they say, betraying an election-year promise by Mr. Johnson and his Conservatives to raise prosperity in the north closer to the level of London and other richer areas in the south. “We don’t want to go back to another national lockdown,” Mr. Johnson said in Parliament. But with new infections quadrupling over the last three weeks and hospitalizations rising to crisis levels, he said the government had no choice but to tighten its measures. “We can’t let the virus rip,” Mr. Johnson said. Under the government’s new system, cities or regions will be subject to three escalating tiers of restrictions, depending on the severity of their outbreaks. In the first, or medium alert level, they would merely face the most recent restrictions Mr. Johnson announced for the entire country: a ban on social gatherings of more than six people and a 10 p.m. curfew on bars and restaurants. The second, or high alert level, triggers a ban on mixing by people from different households, while under the third, or very high alert level — the one just imposed on Liverpool — pubs, gyms and some other nonessential businesses must close. Schools, shops and offices can remain open, fulfilling Mr. Johnson’s vow last summer that if he faced a choice between schools or pubs, he would close pubs. Fears that the virus could overwhelm the health service in the north prompted a decision to prepare three field hospitals there to admit patients. A network of so-called “Nightingale hospitals,” constructed earlier this year, had been mothballed but now those in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate have been placed on standby. Britain’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said that northern parts of the country were badly affected partly because infection rates were higher there than in other areas when the earlier lockdown measures were lifted. Disease levels in the north, and certainly in the northwest, “never dropped as far” in the summer as they did in the south, said Professor Van-Tam, while adding that “pretty much all areas of the U.K. are seeing growth in the infection rate.” Health experts criticized the latest measures, saying they would neither stamp out the virus nor shield the economy from damage. Devi Sridhar, the chair of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh, said the government failed to use the time during its earlier lockdown to put in place an effective test-and-trace program. Unless it remedied that failure now, there was little point to closing pubs or gyms. “It’s a slow strangulation of both the economy and human health,” she said. Other experts said the government should abandon the whole concept of lockdowns, since they predict a second wave of cases will be less lethal and more manageable because of better medical treatments and a more resistant population. Sunetra Gupta, an infectious disease expert at Oxford University, said the slower rate of transmission in London suggested that a significant percentage of the population there had already developed immunity to the virus. The government, she said, should aim for the same natural immunity in the north, shielding the elderly and vulnerable but not closing down parts of the economy. “It just kicks the problem down the road,” Professor Gupta said. “It causes a lot of small businesses to fold, a lot of people on temporary contracts to lose their jobs.” Mr. Johnson has already faced fissures with Scotland, where authorities have diverged regularly from the government’s health measures. Now, though, he is facing criticism from local and regional officials in the north of England, who want more power in shaping the rules that affect their communities. Several of the worst-hit areas are represented by city or regional mayors, who are demanding more aid from the government to help struggling businesses. On Monday, Mr. Johnson promised some extra cash to the regions through a modified extension of the government’s massive wage-subsidy program. “If you see parts of your economy closed, potentially until March, whereas London and the south are not locked down similarly, you will think that the consequences could be a long term worsening of economic performance of the north versus the south,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “Mayors in these cities may have few formal powers,” Professor Travers said, “but they have a media profile and enough political legitimacy to make a government in a weak position look even weaker.” The government has tried to build support by bringing some local officials into its deliberations. It also left some major urban areas, like Manchester, out of the highest alert level. But even being in the second tier poses problems because it forbids people from different households from meeting for a drink in a pub, which the owners say will cripple their business, even if they stay open. “This is something the latest local epidemiology does not support, and I am disappointed that the government is pressing ahead with this despite the united view of local leaders,” said Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, who the government had hoped would be an ally. These tensions could have far-reaching political implications for Mr. Johnson. Voters in many of the affected areas traditionally supported the opposition Labour Party, but last year switched to the Conservatives, propelling Mr. Johnson to victory. Now some of those newly elected Conservative lawmakers are becoming restive. Several have joined a new caucus, the Northern Research Group, which is modeled on an influential pro-Brexit alliance of Conservative lawmakers known as the European Research Group. The goal, said its founder, Jake Berry, to the BBC, is “to make sure that the government delivers on its promise to level up the north.”']","Boris Johnson campaigned on a promise to “level up” struggling northern areas, but his three-tier plan threatens to keep them in economically debilitating lockdowns."
Taliban Test Afghan and U.S. Resolve in Talks by Attacking a City,2020-10-12,By Mujib Mashal and Taimoor Shah,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban have opened an offensive on the southern Afghan city of Lashkar Gah, overrunning some of its surrounding security checkpoints and largely cutting it off, even as their negotiators remained at the table for talks with the Afghan government that appear stalled. While the insurgent attempt to cap the fighting season with high-profile attacks before winter sets in was not unusual for recent years of the two-decade war, the run for a provincial capital amid peace talks suggested that the Taliban still see military bullying as their most effective negotiating tactic. The attack also appeared to test the limits of how far the United States military — which is drawing down to about 4,500 troops and significantly cutting back air support to Afghan forces since it signed a deal with the Taliban in February — would go to defend its Afghan allies. The United States has been critical of the Taliban’s intensified attacks across Afghanistan, but has stopped short of calling the group’s actions a breach of their agreement — even as the American troop withdrawal has continued. In recent weeks, confusing signals from Washington that President Trump wanted the remaining American troops home before next spring, as laid out in the withdrawal timeline agreed with the Taliban, threatened to further undermine the shaky Afghan government. In what appeared an attempt to send a clear message to the Taliban and reassure the Afghan forces of continued American support, the U.S. military said it had carried out “several targeted strikes” in defense of the Afghan forces under fire from the Taliban in Helmand Province, of which Lashkar Gah is the capital. “The Taliban need to immediately stop their offensive actions in Helmand Province and reduce their violence around the country,” Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of the U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “It is not consistent with the U.S.-Taliban agreement and undermines the ongoing Afghan Peace Talks.” The Taliban’s social media accounts were drumming up the offensive as an effort to take Lashkar Gah, with some accounts posting “minute by minute” updates of what was described as the group’s march on the city. But late Monday, their official spokesman seemed to walk a tight-line that appeared to suggest they were holding back. The spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the insurgents were only recapturing areas that were once under their control but that were retaken by Afghan forces several months ago. The violence in Helmand was part of a wider uptick in deadly attacks across Afghanistan targeting districts and increasingly choking the highways. In the past 24 hours, the Taliban carried out attacks in 20 of the country’s 34 provinces, according to Rohullah Ahmadzai, the spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry. The insurgents made a strong push for Lashkar Gah from several directions since Friday, following a couple of weeks of tightening the noose, officials said. Ataullah Afghan, the head of the provincial council, said that the Taliban had overrun security checkpoints in the suburbs of Babaji and Chahanjir and closed one of the main roads leading into the city, blowing up parts of it. They also carried out attacks in Nawa, a district neighboring Lashkar Gah. The advances were slowed by airstrikes and fresh government forces that arrived Sunday night, he said. “They have blocked most of the entrances and exits to the city,” said Bashir Ahmad Shakir, a former member of the provincial council in Helmand. “The officials were in deep slumber. The military officials only realized it when the Taliban were almost stepping in to the gates of Lashkar Gah.” Mr. Afghan, the head of the provincial council, attributed the defense failures to a problem that has plagued Afghan forces in the south for years: the presence of a large number of “ghost soldiers” in their ranks.  “In Babaji and Chahanjir on paper there are 150 police, the salary of 150 police is paid, but only 50 police are present in the whole area, with each outpost getting no more than five or six police,” he said. “We shared this problem with higher officials, with the interior minister, with the present of the country, but no action was taken. Now we see the result of those imaginary police.” Lashkar Gah has been one of the most badly affected cities of the long war, with the civilian population bearing the brunt. Families have been repeatedly forced to relocate. The most recent fighting has displaced at least 1,500 families, officials said. “Last night, a stray bullet hit a pregnant woman and killed the baby,” Mariana Cortesi, the coordinator for the Doctors Without Borders hospital in the city, said in a Twitter post. “Miraculously the mother survived and is now receiving maternal and surgical care after a life-saving operation.” The peace talks between the Taliban and a delegation representing the Afghan republic opened last month to much hype in Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the Taliban keep a political office. But progress has been slow, and a month later both sides are stuck on finalizing rules and regulations that will govern their meetings. The Taliban are demanding that the rules for the negotiations clearly lay out that the insurgents are sitting down with the Afghan government only as part of their agreement with the United States. The insurgents’ stubborn refusal of anything short of that is sending a clear message, Afghan and Western officials say: that the Taliban do not see the Afghan government as equals in negotiations, but rather as a subset of the U.S. military occupation that is ending. It was unclear how the deadlock could be broken. But Western and Afghan officials said that much depended on how the United States used its leverage to push the sides to a compromise.

Boris Johnson ignored scientists’ advice for a brief national lockdown.,2020-10-13,By Mark Landler,"['Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has brushed aside advice from an influential group of scientists to lock down the economy for a brief period to try to halt a surge in coronavirus cases. The recommendation, contained in newly published minutes from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or Sage, has intensified the debate in Britain over whether Mr. Johnson’s government is doing enough to avert a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Mr. Johnson ordered pubs and gyms in the city of Liverpool to close, part of a new three-tiered system of restrictions targeting places hardest hit by the virus. But he has resisted pressure to impose a so-called “circuit breaker” lockdown — a brief national shutdown designed to stop the exponential increase in infections — saying it would come at too high an economic and social cost. In the minutes of its Sept. 21 meeting, posted online late Monday night, Sage recommended a brief lockdown as one of several measures to stop what it warned could be a “very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences.” The scientists also advised closing restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, urging people to work from home, and converting universities to remote learning. And they expressed doubts about the effectiveness of one of the measures Mr. Johnson has imposed: closing pubs and restaurants at 10 p.m. The politics of lockdowns are fraught for Mr. Johnson. He has long pledged to be guided by scientific advice. But he faces fierce opposition from members of his own Conservative Party and from local and regional officials in the north of England, who contend that the measures are crippling their economies.']",
Regeneron’s C.E.O. says its promising Covid-19 treatment must be rationed.,2020-10-12,By Sheila Kaplan,"['President Trump said over the weekend that the experimental medication he was given to fight his Covid-19 infection was “standard, pretty routine.” It seems likely it will be anything but should it ever reach the market. There is not nearly enough of the drug that Mr. Trump called a “cure” and promised to distribute free to Americans who might need it, the chief executive of Regeneron, the drug’s maker, said on Sunday. Currently, there are enough doses to treat 50,000 patients, the company has said. On Saturday alone, there were more than 51,000 new infections reported in the United States, according to a New York Times database. “We have to figure out ways to ration this,” Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, the co-founder and chief executive of Regeneron, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” Dr. Schleifer said the company was still in discussions with the administration about who may be first to receive the cocktail of monoclonal antibodies given the president, and when. The treatment has not been approved by the F.D.A., but the White House is pushing the agency to grant an emergency use authorization. When the president spoke about his treatments on the Fox News program “Sunday Morning Future,” he said, “The medications that I took were standard, pretty routine.” In fact, he received a cutting-edge combination treatment: remdesivir, an antiviral medication; dexamethasone, a steroid only recently shown to reduce death rates in severe cases; and the Regeneron drug. Mr. Trump also said during the Fox News interview that he was immune and now “totally free of spreading” the virus. When he repeated the claim on Twitter, the platform added a label saying that the tweet violated Twitter’s rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.']",
"Virginia’s governor was also a possible target of an anti-government plot, the F.B.I. says.",2020-10-13,By Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and Neil MacFarquhar,"['Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia was discussed as a possible target by members of an anti-government group charged last week with plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the F.B.I. said on Tuesday. During a hearing in Grand Rapids, Mich., Special Agent Richard J. Trask II of the F.B.I. said that Mr. Northam and other officials were targeted because of their aggressive lockdown orders to restrict the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, 13 men accused of involvement in the alleged plot were charged with a variety of state and federal crimes including terrorism, conspiracy and weapons possession.  During Tuesday’s hearing, the authorities revealed that the suspects also spoke about “taking” the Virginia governor “based” on coronavirus lockdown orders that restricted businesses. The F.B.I. alerted members of Mr. Northam’s security team throughout their investigation, Alena Yarmosky, Mr. Northam’s press secretary, said in a statement. The governor was not informed, “per security protocols,” Ms. Yarmosky said, but added that “at no time was the governor or his family in imminent danger.” Mr. Northam,  a Democrat, issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 30, instructing residents to leave their homes only for work, medical appointments, family care, shopping for essentials and “outdoor activity with strict social distancing requirements.” In April, President Trump had openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in Virginia, Michigan and other states with stay-at-home orders, a day after his administration had announced guidelines for governors to set their own timetables for reopening. “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment,” the president wrote on Twitter at the time. “It is under siege!”']",
This Urban Safari Comes With a Warning: Watch Out for Snakes,2020-10-15,By Mike Ives,"['HONG KONG — The snake didn’t see the catcher coming, at least not in time to avoid being caught. “This is the fourth-most-toxic land snake in the world, and the most toxic snake in Asia by far,” the catcher, William Sargent, told a group of hikers on a recent night in Hong Kong. He delivered the news calmly, in the way one explains that dinner is ready. Which of us, he asked, wanted to touch it first? Mr. Sargent, 44, runs Hong Kong Snakes Safari, an outfit that takes residents on night hikes through the territory’s wooded hinterlands. Some are more apprehensive than others as they learn firsthand about what he says is a chronically misunderstood reptile. The hikes highlight the scale of biodiversity in Hong Kong, a financial hub of 7.5 million people that is better known for its high-rises than its sprawling protected areas. It’s also a way for city slickers with snake phobias to confront their fears in the wild. Hong Kong is nearly the size of Los Angeles, but about 40 percent of its land area consists of parks that were created in the 1970s when the Chinese territory was still a British colony. Human-animal conflicts are inevitable because so much of the protected land lies within walking distance of dense urban areas. Wild boars, in particular, often cause a stir when they wander into busy streets or subway stations. Last month, a family of boars made the local papers by sauntering through Hong Kong’s central business district and taking a swim in the fountain outside the Bank of China’s 72-story office tower. Snakes generally keep a lower profile in Hong Kong, but because eight native species are capable of inflicting fatal bites, the health risks can be serious if they end up in close quarters with humans. The Hong Kong Police Force said in a statement that whenever a snake endangers the public, it is “safely boxed and bagged” by approved catchers, then sent to live at Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, a local nonprofit that also shelters rescued bats, birds, crocodiles, monkeys, pangolins and turtles. Most of the snakes are later released into the wild. Mr. Sargent, who kept snakes as pets while growing up on one of Hong Kong’s outer islands, has been a police-approved expert since 2015. He said his snake-catching assignments had taken him to prisons, schools, supermarkets, an airport hangar and a construction site for a coronavirus ward, from which he extracted a 10-foot python. Last month, he was summoned to a fishing village at 3 a.m. to remove a Chinese cobra — from beneath the bed of a 90-year-old woman. He said a group of the village’s elderly residents formed a kind of receiving line around him as he walked by, “yelling their five cents’ worth about this foreign snake catcher.” “Even the police were laughing,” said Mr. Sargent, who is British-Swiss and works in event planning by day. Separately, he runs the hiking business and an educational Facebook group about local snakes that has more than 10,000 members. It was set up partly to help correct viral misinformation, like the suggestion that snakebites are common in the city. The World Health Organization estimates that about 81,000 to 138,000 people around the globe die each year from snakebites, mostly in developing countries, and that about three times as many suffer permanent disabilities. Most of the world’s estimated 1.8 million to 2.7 million annual “envenomings,” or snake poisonings, occur in Asia, many in countries with weak health systems and sparse medical resources. The countries that lack the capacity to manufacture antivenom are the most at risk. But in Hong Kong, which has a first-rate medical system, no one has been killed by a venomous snake since at least 2005, according to a spokesman for the city’s Hospital Authority. In 2018, the last year for which data is available, the authorities recorded just 73 snakebites, making the chances of being bitten about one in 100,000. “It’s not mystical,” said Mr. Sargent during the night hike. “It’s very clear-cut what the risk is. But there’s such a huge gap of misconception.” I was one of several hikers who met Mr. Sargent at a village near Hong Kong’s border with mainland China on a sweltering weekday evening. Before we entered an adjacent country park, he explained that the best way to avoid a snakebite was simply to watch our feet and walk with a high-quality headlamp. Check. And check. As we set out on a concrete path, our carefully monitored footsteps were bathed in a reassuringly bright LED halo. But the ambient light seemed to fade with every step, and sections of the path were starting to look worryingly overgrown — at least to my snake-fearing eyes. “Look everywhere you can look,” said James Kwok, a wildlife enthusiast who had tagged along for the safari and offered snake-spotting advice. The group forded a thigh-high stream and traversed slippery rocks in the dark. A few hikers lost their footing and tumbled into the water. Mr. Sargent spotted our first quarry — a mountain water snake — and plucked it off a stream-side rock with his bare hands. As he showed us the snake, it nibbled at his hand, drawing a trickle of blood. He shrugged: It was nonvenomous, and therefore harmless. But it didn’t look happy in Mr. Sargent’s confident grip. “No,” he said. “I mean, I’m a predator, right?” That seemed like more than enough drama for the night. But a few minutes later, a longer, thicker, black-and-white-striped snake slithered into the light of the group’s headlamps. “Quick, quick, quick!” Mr. Sargent yelled in a stage whisper, as the group scrambled into formation behind him, headlamp beams bouncing across the subtropical foliage like spotlights at a rock concert. In a fluid motion, he sprinted ahead, slipped his hand into a puncture-resistant glove and scooped up the snake. As it writhed around in the humid air, he said it was a many-banded krait, a nocturnal species whose highly toxic venom targets the nervous system. We all tittered with anxiety. But Mr. Sargent, who still looked serenely calm, reassuringly said that in three decades of handling wild kraits, he had yet to see one strike. The animal’s primary instinct was to flee, not bite. So we gathered around to touch the krait’s belly — which was surprisingly smooth and delicate, like a baby’s cheeks — and to marvel at how beautiful its scales looked up close. “It’s not what you expect,” said Ruth Stather, a fellow hiker, who works in marketing. The krait was not exactly pleased, but it seemed willing to tolerate the curious humans for a few minutes. As we stood there touching it in the silent darkness, I felt my snake phobia easing. “They’re not interested in fighting,” Mr. Sargent said. I worried that he was tempting fate. But, sure enough, when he released the snake into the undergrowth, it slithered away.']","On nighttime hikes in Hong Kong’s surprisingly lush forests, a snake catcher teaches city slickers about the reptiles — and their bites."
"As Trump flouts safety protocols, news outlets balk at close coverage.",2020-10-13,By Michael M. Grynbaum,"['Major news organizations have become increasingly wary of sending journalists to travel with President Trump to White House events and campaign rallies, as the president and his aides continue to shun safety protocols after an outbreak of the virus within their ranks. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post are among the major outlets that have declined to assign reporters to travel with Mr. Trump as he returns to the trail this week, saying they do not have assurance that basic precautions will be taken to protect reporters’ health. Foremost among the flouters is Mr. Trump himself, who, despite recently contracting the virus and spending three nights in the hospital, has shown little willingness to change his habits: On Saturday, he said the virus would soon “disappear,” and on the way to a rally in Florida on Monday, he boarded Air Force One — where reporters were seated in the cabin — without wearing a mask. At least three White House correspondents have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past two weeks, including a Times reporter who had traveled on Air Force One, Michael D. Shear. Safety concerns may also complicate Mr. Trump’s tentative NBC town hall on Thursday. NBC executives have asked the White House for proof that their employees will not face undue risks at the event, according to two people familiar with discussions. Among the concerns raised by reporters: Many flight attendants and Secret Service agents on Air Force One have not worn masks; White House aides who tested positive for the coronavirus, or were potentially exposed, are returning to work before the end of a two-week quarantine; and the campaign has instituted few restrictions at the raucous rallies that Mr. Trump is now pledging to hold. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany — who briefed reporters last weekend without wearing a mask, shortly before she tested positive for the virus — said on Monday that the Trump campaign would distribute masks but would not require attendees to wear them.']",
"Israel and Lebanon Begin Talks on Sea Border, With U.S. as Mediator",2020-10-14,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon and Israel kicked off their first negotiations in 30 years on nonsecurity issues, aiming to end a long-running dispute over their maritime border in the gas-rich Mediterranean Sea. The brief first session on Wednesday was hosted by the United Nations and mediated by the United States, whose diplomats worked for years to get the negotiations going before the two sides announced on Oct. 1 that they had agreed on a framework for talks. At issue is more than 330 square miles in the Mediterranean that Israel and Lebanon both claim is in their exclusive economic zone. Pressure to resolve the dispute has mounted as Israel and Cyprus have begun exploiting offshore gas in the eastern Mediterranean. Lebanon has sought to do the same, hoping the new industry can assuage its profound economic woes. It was not immediately clear whether any progress was made during the first session in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura, near the Israeli border. The meeting lasted about an hour and the teams are expected to gather again on Oct. 28. The Lebanon-Israel talks follow normalization agreements between Israel and two Gulf States — Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. They were the third and fourth Arab states to recognize Israel, after Egypt and Jordan. But officials on both sides of the talks said that they sought to address only the maritime border and that normalization was not on the table. The Israeli team was headed by the director general of its energy ministry, Udi Adiri, and the Lebanese delegation was headed by Brig. Gen. Bassam Yassin, the army’s deputy chief of staff for operations. The talks were held in a United Nations base where representatives from Lebanon and Israel have regular talks about security issues along their disputed border. Under the framework agreement, the delegations were not supposed to address each other directly, but instead to communicate through intermediaries from the United States. General Yassin said in a statement released by the Lebanese Army before the talks began that they were “technical, indirect negotiations.” He called the talks “the first step on a 1,000-mile journey,” but added that he hoped the issue would be resolved “within a reasonable time frame.” The idea of negotiating with Israel has not been without controversy in Lebanon, because the two countries are still technically at war and many Lebanese feel deep animosity toward their neighbors to the south. After President Michel Aoun named the four members of the Lebanese delegation this week, Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that the president’s doing so without consulting him violated the Constitution. Mr. Aoun’s office responded that such statements weakened the Lebanese negotiating position. And early Wednesday, Hezbollah and Amal, two powerful Shiite political parties in Lebanon who are staunchly anti-Israel, released a statement saying that the inclusion of civilian officials in the Lebanese negotiating team was “a surrender to the Israeli logic that wants any form of normalization.” They called for the committee’s members to be changed. That opposition did not derail the start of the talks, but could undermine broad acceptance of any accord the negotiators might reach. Israel has three objectives for the talks, said Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin of the Institute for National Security Studies, an independent research organization in Tel Aviv: to deny Hezbollah, Lebanon’s most powerful military force, an excuse for war with Israel; to diminish the possibility that Hezbollah will target its gas drilling platforms; and to show the Lebanese that they can benefit from cooperation with Israel. Among Hezbollah’s grievances against Israel are disputes over land and maritime borders. For Lebanon, a maritime border agreement would facilitate the search for oil and gas in its territorial waters and their potential exploitation, which could earn the country much needed income. Lebanon’s currency has lost 80 percent of its value against the dollar over the last year, and its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is one of the world’s highest. Lebanon’s leaders have said that developing an oil and gas industry could help the country pay its debts. David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting from Jerusalem.']",Teams from the neighboring Middle Eastern countries are negotiating over their disputed frontier in the gas-rich Mediterranean Sea.
"After a 7-Month Wait, This Tourist Got Machu Picchu All to Himself",2020-10-13,By Tiffany May and Hisako Ueno,"['Jesse Katayama had planned to end a journey around the world 8,000 feet above sea level at Machu Picchu, the sprawling 15th-century Inca citadel high in the Andes Mountains. Then the coronavirus happened, stranding Mr. Katayama, a 26-year-old Japanese citizen, in Peru and shutting down tourism sites as a lockdown was imposed across the country. On Sunday, after a wait of seven months, Mr. Katayama finally got to visit the UNESCO world heritage site. And aside from a few guides, he got it all to himself. “After the lockdown, the first man to visit Machu Picchu is meeeeeee,” he wrote in a post on Instagram that included photos of him with a park representative. Alejandro Neyra, Peru’s culture minister, said in a virtual news conference on Monday that Mr. Katayama had been granted special access to the site in recognition of his patience. “He had come to Peru with the dream of being able to enter,” Mr. Neyra said. “The Japanese citizen has entered together with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country.” Before the pandemic, Machu Picchu welcomed thousands of visitors a day. Tourists typically have to apply months in advance for permits to enter an Inca trail that leads to the ancient fortress. Mr. Katayama’s original pass was scheduled for March 16, and he arrived two days before, at Aguas Calientes, a town at the foot of the mountain. But two days turned into weeks and then months. He rented a small apartment in the town and passed the time taking daily yoga classes, teaching local children how to box, and studying for various fitness and sports nutrition certification exams. He wrote on a crowdfunding website in 2019 that he dreamed of opening a boxing gym in Japan and wanted to travel the world to learn the best approaches from each country. Before reaching Peru, he taught boxing in Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya. Mr. Katayama told a Japanese news outlet that he had considered joining the emergency evacuation flights organized by Japan’s government in the spring, but found them too expensive. He ultimately decided to stay, postponing his departure in the hopes that Machu Picchu would soon reopen. His patience paid off in the end, and he became a bit of a local celebrity last week when La República, a major Peruvian broadsheet, covered his vigil and called him “the last tourist in Machu Picchu.” “I stayed with the sole purpose of getting to know this wonder and I didn’t want to leave without doing so,” he told the newspaper in a separate interview. News of his persistence had resulted in hundreds of well-wishers offering to petition the authorities on his behalf, he said on Instagram.  Mr. Neyra, the culture minister, said that the authorities had received a visitor application for Mr. Katayama and decided to grant him special access before his return to Japan. The pandemic has devastated Peru’s tourism industry, the country’s third largest generator of income. The industry employs more than 1.3 million workers, or nearly 8 percent of the country’s work force, the Lima Chamber of Commerce said in 2018. When travel stopped, most of those jobs were lost. Peru has also reported an increasing number of coronavirus cases, and more than 33,000 deaths. Mr. Neyras said that seven archaeological sites in Cusco, a city in the Andes, would reopen to small groups at 30 percent capacity on Thursday. A reopening date for Machu Picchu has yet to be announced.']","Jesse Katayama, a Japanese tourist, didn’t let Peru’s pandemic lockdown keep him from completing the journey of a lifetime."
"As the virus spread, private briefings from the Trump administration fueled a stock sell-off.",2020-10-15,By Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti,"['On the afternoon of Feb. 24, President Trump declared on Twitter that the coronavirus was “very much under control” in the United States, but hours earlier, senior members of the president’s economic team, privately addressing board members of the conservative Hoover Institution, were less confident. Tomas J. Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy. To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time. The next day, board members — many of them Republican donors — got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and “it’s pretty close to airtight,” Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was “contained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don’t know,” according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times. The document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover’s board, was stark. “What struck me,” the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus “as a point of concern, totally unprovoked.” The consultant’s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president’s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent. Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering. To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country. “Short everything,” was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.']",
"In India, doctors warn that deteriorating air quality could make Covid-19 even worse.",2020-10-15,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Hari Kumar,"['As a thick quilt of smog wrapped itself around New Delhi on Thursday, signaling the start of the fall pollution season, doctors and scientists warned that the deteriorating air quality could make the city’s Covid-19 problems even worse. One of the most common symptoms of severe coronavirus cases is breathing difficulty. And doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die. “If two people are shooting at the lungs, then obviously the lungs will have more problems,” said Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi, a group that raises awareness about respiratory problems. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading far and wide, putting the country on track to have the largest reported virus caseload in the coming weeks. With 7.3 million reported infections, it is just behind the United States’ 7.9 million. And each day, India outpaces the United States in new infections by around 10,000 more cases per day, even as India’s death rate remains much lower. In the background is India’s vexing air pollution, which shoots up in the fall and winter. The rapid economic growth of the past two decades — and along with it, increased urbanization and congestion — has left Indian cities horribly polluted.']",
Vatican Puts Priests on Trial Over Alleged Abuse Within Its Walls,2020-10-14,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — One priest accused of sexually abusing an altar boy in a prominent Vatican City seminary and another accused of covering it up went before the Vatican’s criminal tribunal on Wednesday, the first trial in the city-state over sexual abuse said to have occurred within its walls. The charges date from 2007 and 2012 and center on allegations of abuse at the St. Pius X youth seminary, a residence for boys — typically between 12 and 18 — who are thinking of becoming priests. Students in the seminary often serve as altar boys in St. Peter’s Basilica, sometimes during papal Masses. The priest accused of abuse, the Rev. Gabriele Martinelli, was 17 at the time of the initial alleged assault and was a senior altar boy at the seminary. The victim was 16. In 2017, Father Martinelli was ordained as a priest in Como, Italy. Father Martinelli is accused of forcing the victim — who has been publicly identified only by his initials — through threats and violence to “submit to carnal relations, acts of sodomy, and masturbation” on a number of occasions in Vatican City, according to the charges read by a court clerk on Wednesday. The Rev. Enrico Radice, who was the rector of the seminary at the time, has been accused of aiding and abetting the abuse. He lied to Vatican investigators, telling them in 2018 that he had no knowledge of abuse at the seminary, statements that hampered the investigation, according to the charges read by the clerk. Both defendants were present in court on Wednesday for the procedural hearing, which lasted just eight minutes before the trial was adjourned until later this month, when both men are expected to take the stand. Neither defendant has responded publicly to the accusations, and lawyers for the defendants did not respond to requests for comment. Reports of the crimes first emerged in Italian news outlets in 2017, but the two priests were not indicted until 2019. The reports relied primarily on the accounts of Kamil Jarzembowski, the victim’s roommate, who said he witnessed the abuse and who was subsequently kicked out of the seminary. He said he first reported the abuse to the church authorities in 2012. The charges read in court on Wednesday suggested the abuse had been known about since at least 2013, when Father Radice wrote a letter to a bishop rebutting the victim’s accusations against Father Martinelli. The Vatican City seminary is run by a religious association based in Como, a city in northern Italy. Soon after the 2019 indictment, the diocese of Como issued a statement saying that the accusations against Father Martinelli were brought to officials’ attention in 2013, but that the religious authorities tasked with investigating the allegations had found them to be groundless. In 2017, after the reports of abuse emerged in the Italian media, the Vatican asked the diocese to carry out a fresh investigation. The diocese did not make its findings public, but sent the Vatican a report. The 2019 statement from the diocese of Como also noted that both Father Martinelli and Father Radice had been “limited in the exercise of the ministry and suspended from carrying out pastoral activities involving minors and vulnerable adults.” The scourge of sexual abuse has roiled the Roman Catholic Church for decades, and thousands of cases of assault and subsequent cover-ups have sprung up across the world. While Pope Francis has pledged “zero tolerance” for offenders, holding an unprecedented meeting with bishops on protecting minors and issuing various instructions and laws, including one to specifically hold Vatican City offenders accountable, critics say that the measures don’t go far enough. While the Vatican is criminally prosecuting a sexual abuse crime that took place within the city walls for the first time, it has criminally prosecuted prelates accused of sexual crimes elsewhere. In 2014, the Vatican placed Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who had been accused of sexually abusing boys he met on the street while serving as the Vatican’s ambassador in the Dominican Republic, under house arrest. Father Wesolowski died in 2015, shortly after his trial began. In 2018, a Vatican tribunal sentenced a former Vatican diplomat to five years in prison and a fine of about $5,800 for possessing and distributing child pornography. Although Father Martinelli and Father Radice are now facing trial, advocates for victims’ rights have accused the Vatican of acting only after news reports had revealed the abuse allegations. “This is coming to trial now, but the first accusations were made in 2012,” said Francesco Zanardi, the president of Italy’s first support group for victims of sexual abuse. “It’s a farce.”']","One priest is accused of abusing an altar boy at a seminary near the pope’s residence, and the other of covering it up."
Petition Targeting Murdoch Swamps Australian Parliament’s Website,2020-10-13,By Isabella Kwai,"['Most Australians would probably not choose to spend their weekends browsing Parliament’s website. But a petition calling for a public inquiry into Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in Australia, posted by a former prime minister, generated so much interest over the weekend that it overwhelmed the website’s cyberdefenses and shut down access to the document. The petition — posted on Friday by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd — asks the government to establish a Royal Commission, the country’s highest form of inquiry, into the dominance of Australian media by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corp and its impact on the country’s political landscape. “Murdoch has become a cancer — an arrogant cancer on our democracy,” Mr. Rudd said in a Twitter video on Friday. An inquiry, he added, would “maximize media diversity ownership for the future lifeblood of our democratic system.” The move was a very public attempt to challenge Mr. Murdoch, 89, and his global media empire, which contributed to the rise of right-wing politics and helped reshape democratic governments around the world. In the United States, Mr. Murdoch’s Fox News Channel and New York Post have been leading supporters of President Trump and critics of President Obama and other Democrats. His British newspapers are conservative stalwarts and one of them, the tabloid The Sun, was a leading booster of the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. But nowhere is his influence greater than in Australia, where News Corp controls about two-thirds of daily newspaper circulation, and Mr. Murdoch also controls prominent news channels like Sky News Australia. Ousted prime ministers like Mr. Rudd, of the center-left Australian Labor Party, have said News Corp and its outsized presence were partly to blame for their falls. And, critics say, News Corp outlets have undermined efforts to fight climate change, pushed governments into hard-line policies on issues like migration, and employed language and images widely seen as racist. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Murdoch has said that he is a climate-change skeptic, and his outlets have repeatedly denied charges of racism. A center-right former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has also been very vocal about his clashes with Mr. Murdoch, who he says helped drive him from power, in favor of a politician farther to the right. By Monday night, over 200,000 people had signed Mr. Rudd’s petition — even as technical issues over the weekend prevented some users from accessing the site. Such was the volume of traffic that it triggered defenses designed to stop bots from manipulating the site, the Australian House of Representatives said, adding that the website saw a 500 percent spike in traffic over the weekend. The site has since increased its capacity, it said, and the petition will close on Nov. 4. Even if support for the petition rises, the government, a coalition of conservative parties, is unlikely to approve a Royal Commission, and would not want to antagonize Mr. Murdoch, media and political analysts say. Even Anthony Albanese, the head of the opposition Labor party, has distanced himself from the petition filed by Mr. Rudd, who has long called for an investigation into News Corp’s influence in Australia. Mr. Rudd served as Australia’s prime minister from 2007 to 2010, and for a few months in 2013, and is currently the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. But the petition has tapped into a “a deep reservoir of discontent and frustration,” said Timothy Dwyer, an associate professor of media and communications at the University of Sydney, particularly among younger, center-left voters who oppose the climate change skepticism that has been a feature of Mr. Murdoch’s media outlets. David McKnight, an associate professor of media at the University of New South Wales, said Mr. Murdoch’s role in Australia highlighted the need for more public interest journalism. “Mr. Murdoch has a long history of interfering or trying to swing the result in elections,” he said. The blurring of opinion and news, and the shift in media consumption to online and social media, have given more even weight to News Corp, he added. Critics have pointed to a New York Times interview, published on Saturday, with one of Mr. Murdoch’s adult children, James Murdoch, who was once seen as a potential successor to run his father’s business. James Murdoch said that he had resigned from the News Corp board because of growing discomfort over the agenda of Fox News and other outlets. “A contest of ideas shouldn’t be used to legitimize disinformation,” he said. Even without immediate action from the government, analysts say anger against the elder Mr. Murdoch will continue to simmer. The question is whether a movement to build more media diversity — and in turn, address Mr. Murdoch’s dominance — will gain more momentum in the future, said Mr. McKnight. “People have long memories,” he said.']","More than 200,000 people signed a petition drawn up by a former prime minister calling for an examination of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire in Australia."
E.U. Preparing Sanctions on Putin Allies Over Navalny’s Poisoning,2020-10-14,By Michael Schwirtz and Katrin Bennhold,"['The European Union is preparing to impose financial sanctions on six high-ranking Russian officials from the Defense Ministry, domestic spy service and the Kremlin who are believed to have been involved in the poisoning of Aleksei A. Navalny, the prominent Russian opposition leader. The individuals, who face asset freezes and travel bans to the European Union, are believed to have had direct knowledge of the poisoning or were involved in the planning, three senior European officials said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the sanctions had not yet been made public. Several of those facing penalties are members of the tight circle of elites who for years have surrounded the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin: Aleksandr Bortnikov, the head of Russia’s domestic spy agency, the Federal Security Service; Sergei Kiriyenko, first deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration; and Andrei Yarin, the head of the presidential administration’s domestic policy directorate. The others are Aleksei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov, two deputy ministers of defense, and Sergei Menyaylo, Mr. Putin’s envoy to the Siberian Federal District. The European Union is also expected to impose sanctions on the Russian State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology. Western intelligence services say the facility developed and produced the Novichok nerve agent that was used to poison Mr. Navalny. Germany and France compiled the list and presented the names along with a 500-page packet of evidence outlining their involvement to other European Union member states this week. Senior European Union diplomats met and approved the list on Wednesday, diplomats said, and national capitals had a few hours to register last-minute objections in writing before the list is set to be formally adopted Thursday morning. Mr. Navalny, the most prominent critic of Mr. Putin, collapsed on a flight to Moscow on Aug. 20 after spending several days meeting with supporters in central Siberia. After being held against the will of his family and supporters at a Siberian hospital, he was eventually allowed to be flown to Berlin, where he remained in a coma for a month. German officials have been saying for some time that they have no doubt that the highest levels of the Russian government were involved in the poisoning, though Russian officials have strenuously denied it. Mr. Navalny, who awoke from a coma last month and is recuperating in Berlin, has accused Mr. Putin of being behind the attack. Shortly after Mr. Navalny arrived in Berlin, German military scientists determined that he had been poisoned with a new nerve agent from the Novichok family that could have been produced only in a highly secure government laboratory. The findings were later confirmed by laboratories in France and Sweden, as well as by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the world’s leading chemical weapons watchdog. The substance was also used in an attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in Salisbury, England, in 2018. In that attack, the British authorities determined that two assassins from Russia’s military intelligence agency had applied the poison, hidden in a perfume bottle, to Mr. Skripal’s front door. Mr. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, who was visiting from Moscow, fell critically ill but survived. So did a police detective who visited the Skripal residence and a man who later fished the perfume bottle from a trash container. The man’s girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, died after spraying the poison on her skin, thinking it was perfume. Details about how exactly Mr. Navalny was poisoned remain murky. German experts, who have reviewed the evidence, now say that the Novichok agent was a powder that was dissolved in liquid, most likely in tea that Mr. Navalny consumed at the airport before his flight, said a senior German security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the inquiry. Photographs of Mr. Navalny drinking tea from a red paper cup at an airport cafe in the Siberian city of Tomsk circulated online shortly after he fell ill. Still, questions remain. German scientists found concentrations of the Novichok nerve agent in Mr. Navalny’s blood and urine as well as on a plastic water bottle that Mr. Navalny’s aides say they took from the hotel room he was staying in the day before the poisoning. This would suggest that Mr. Navalny had come in contact with the poison before arriving at the airport, or perhaps that he was poisoned twice. Matina Stevis-Gridneff contributed reporting.']",Six high-ranking Russian officials who are believed to be involved in the attack on the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny face asset freezes and bans on travel to the bloc.
"For Nagorno-Karabakh’s Dueling Sides, Living Together Is ‘Impossible’",2020-10-13,By Anton Troianovski,"['SHGHARJIK, Armenia — The concrete memorial to 30 Azerbaijani soldiers — pockmarked, stained and cracked — pokes out of the craggy mountainside next to the crumbling remnants of two junked cars. They died fighting for the Soviet Union in World War II, but the time has come, the current head of the village says, for the soldiers’ monument to go. “We also have our heroes now,” said the village head, Shahen Babayants, who is Armenian. Armenians and Azerbaijanis lived side by side in the Soviet days, until conflict over the disputed mountain territory called Nagorno-Karabakh exploded in the late 1980s into riots, expulsions and a yearslong war. The violence left personal wounds festering for decades, as stubborn as the tan and gray stone ruins of Azerbaijani villages still scattered in the Armenian countryside. In the last two weeks, those unhealed scars have erupted into a modern-day conflagration of trench warfare, drone strikes and artillery bombardments. More than 500 Armenian soldiers have died, along with scores of civilians and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis. A cease-fire brokered in Moscow over the weekend has failed to hold, and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan has threatened a further escalation of his offensive. The new war over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Azerbaijan insists it is ready to fight to recapture the swath of land Armenia conquered in the 1990s, is emerging as this century’s deadliest conflict in the southern Caucasus region that separates Europe from Asia, between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The conflict has the potential to spiral into an even bigger crisis with unforeseeable consequences. It is already drawing in Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey, which is a member of NATO; Russia, which has a mutual-defense treaty with Armenia; and even Iran, which borders the region to the south. For the region’s populace, the war is a continuation of on-off strife over both territory and history, with roots going back more than a century. The days when the Soviet Union kept a lid on such conflicts, and Azerbaijanis and Armenians mostly lived together in peace, feel like an irrevocably lost world. “Each wants to say that he is the master of this land,” said Mr. Babayants, himself a refugee who left Azerbaijan in 1989. “To live together is, put simply, impossible.” He settled in Armenia, just over the border, in a village that had recently been home to Azerbaijanis. A few years after he arrived, the village took fire from Azerbaijani forces. The Azerbaijani graveyard, of all places, was hit. Beyond that border, a gray-green expanse of mountains, is territory that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but has been effectively controlled by Armenia ever since the 1990s war. It includes both the Armenian-majority enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and land that surrounds it and links it to Armenia. Some 500,000 Azerbaijanis were expelled, often violently, from that territory, and more than 200,000 were forced out of Armenia proper. For decades, international mediators have been looking for a way to hand territory back to Azerbaijan while preserving the safety of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. To Mr. Babayants, the lesson of history is that returning those territories is out of the question. For Azerbaijan, the loss of them has been a national tragedy. Azerbaijanis who lost their homes in Armenia and Armenian-controlled territory make up some 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s population. Their desire to leave cramped housing and to return to village life has been a potent political force in Azerbaijan, and it helps explain the domestic support for the escalation of the conflict by Mr. Aliyev, the Azerbaijani president. “They kept pressuring the authorities to return their homes to them,” said Avaz Hasanov, an Azerbaijani peace advocate who held frequent talks with Armenians during civil-society efforts to mediate in the conflict. “It was impossible to set that fact aside.” In Azerbaijan, many blame Armenian intransigence under Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who took power after a revolution in 2018, for pushing Mr. Aliyev to seek to resolve the conflict militarily. While Azerbaijan lost the war that ended in 1994, its rising energy wealth in recent years has allowed Mr. Aliyev to build up his military with armed drones and other sophisticated weaponry from Israel, Russia and Turkey that, analysts say, exceeds Armenia’s capabilities. Mr. Hasanov said that Azerbaijan had been bearing the situation for 26 years. “Now both we and them have ended up in this hole, and coming out of it will be very hard,” he added. Mr. Aliyev himself has roots in Armenia. The ethnic geography of the southern Caucasus is so complicated that part of Azerbaijan, the region called Nakhchivan, is cut off from the rest of the country by a slice of Armenia. The family of Mr. Aliyev’s father and predecessor as president, Heydar Aliyev, moved to Nakhchivan from an Azerbaijani village, now called Tanahat, on the Armenian side of the border. These days, Tanahat is an expanse of stone ruins, with plum trees, bearing sweet yellow and red fruit, growing out of them. One of its few residents, Arsen Ogamyan, 67, was a teacher at the local driving school in 1990. Most of the village’s 38 Azerbaijani families loaded their belongings onto the driving school’s trucks — they even took their firewood, he says — and he and other Armenians drove them to the Azerbaijani border. Russian soldiers were on hand to ensure security. Mr. Ogamyan said the departure was peaceful. Historians and human rights groups say the larger exodus was precipitated by beatings and the threat of more violence. Down the road from Tanahat, in the village of Arevis, the mountains marking the border with Azerbaijan loom just a few miles away. The villagers were so nervous on Monday about the potential for an Azerbaijani attack that they refused to allow any photographs to be taken. The Armenians who moved to Arevis after the Azerbaijanis left kept the old Azerbaijani cemetery intact; but when Armenian villagers died in recent years, they were buried on the opposite hillside. The guard of the village school, Tigran Saakyan, recalled the inflection point as his once-friendly attitudes to his Azerbaijani neighbors shifted: the day in 1988 that his cousin arrived, fleeing the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, where anti-Armenian riots had taken at least 32 lives. That history of violence now underpins Armenians’ insistence that any territorial concessions to Azerbaijan in and around Nagorno-Karabakh could bring about the destruction of the Armenian population there. Reaching farther back into history, many Armenians note Azerbaijani ethnic violence directed against Armenians during and after World War I, and cite Turkey’s outspoken support for the Azerbaijani cause. “Turkey committed a genocide of the Armenians in 1915,” Mr. Saakyan said. “Now they want to finish the job.” There was violence by Armenians against Azerbaijanis, as well, including the killing of hundreds of Azerbaijani civilians in 1992, near the town of Khojaly. In both Azerbaijan and Armenia, views of the other as the enemy have hardened as a generation has come of age with no memory of living with each other on friendly terms. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has been posting drone footage to Twitter, set to dramatic music, showing what appear to be the last moments of Armenian soldiers’ lives as they try to flee incoming missiles. The Armenian Defense Ministry, which has less sophisticated drone technology, has released graphic video of dead Azerbaijani soldiers. “I can’t imagine two peoples in the world that hate each other as much as Armenians and Azerbaijanis,” said Serob Smbatyan, 30, a cardiologist in the southern Armenian city of Kapan who previously served in the military in Nagorno-Karabakh. Thomas de Waal, a British expert on the region who wrote a book on Nagorno-Karabakh, “Black Garden,” said he feared a further escalation by Azerbaijan now that more than two weeks of war had weakened Armenia’s defenses and frayed its fragile supply lines. In a worst-case scenario, he said, Azerbaijan could seek to capture all of Nagorno-Karabakh — not just the sparsely populated surrounding territories that were previously home to Azerbaijanis and are now controlled by Armenia. “It certainly does look like that peaceful coexistence in Soviet times was a bit of an illusion,” Mr. de Waal said. “They were living together — but also in parallel worlds, as far as their understanding of history went, and what belonged to whom.”']","Armenians and Azerbaijanis coexisted in Soviet days.

"In City Where China Welcomed the World, Xi Prepares for a Colder One",2020-10-14,By Chris Buckley,"['When China first opened to overseas investors, the country was desperate for foreign technology to revive its growth. Now, as China faces rising global barriers, its leader, Xi Jinping, is urging greater domestic innovation. Mr. Xi delivered this message on Wednesday while making an anniversary pilgrimage to the southern city of Shenzhen, which in 1980 was established as a “special economic zone” next to the global financial hub of Hong Kong. Shenzhen quickly became an incubator for “reform and opening up,” the strategy championed by the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping that paved the way for the country’s decades-long economic takeoff. Forty years later, Mr. Xi said China still welcomed foreign investors, but he also said it must prepare for a less welcoming world. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the rise of barriers to the free flow of goods and technology, Mr. Xi said, a theme that he has stressed recently. “The world economy is at low ebb and international trade and investment have drastically shrunk,” Mr. Xi said to a conference hall packed with officials and guests wearing protective masks, in a speech that was promoted heavily by the Chinese news media. Mr. Xi did not refer directly to the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict Chinese companies’ access to American technology amid escalating tensions between the two countries. Instead, Mr. Xi broadly warned that “the world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation.” Shenzhen’s experience, he said, showed that China must “gain the initiative in the global technological revolution.” China is striving to revive its economy and repair its international standing amid the coronavirus pandemic, which began late last year in the central city of Wuhan. The pandemic has driven negative views of China to new heights in the United States and other wealthy democracies, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center that was published last week. Mr. Xi is also trying to quell jitters about Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory where a sweeping security law was recently imposed in response to tumultuous antigovernment protests last year. Mr. Xi’s speech in Shenzhen gave a likely preview of a Communist Party leaders’ meeting late this month, when he will lay out China’s economic strategy for the next five years, including harnessing more domestic innovation and consumer spending. Mr. Xi pledged to make Shenzhen a proving ground for upgrading China’s economy and strengthening innovation, citing plans to step up spending on technology research. He stressed Shenzhen’s importance in a regional economic initiative that also encompasses Hong Kong, a strategy that could enhance Chinese influence over the former British colony and underscore its reduced importance for Beijing. Mr. Xi’s speech and other comments during his trip this week to Guangdong Province, which includes Shenzhen, have also underscored his effort to redefine China’s decades-old strategy of “opening up.” Past leaders stressed drawing in foreign capital and technology to help China catch up; Mr. Xi wants to shift the balance by taking Chinese technology, investment and power to the world. “We’re experiencing a transformation the likes of which hasn’t happened for a century,” Mr. Xi said on Monday while visiting a factory in Chaozhou, another coastal city in Guangdong. “We must take the road toward a higher level of self-reliance.” Officials have already spent years trying to shift Shenzhen from low-end industry to high-tech design and manufacturing. Mr. Xi wants to wean China off foreign suppliers for crucial components, such as silicon chips, and the city is a part of those plans. Shenzhen is home to the headquarters of big Chinese tech firms such as Huawei, one of the world’s biggest smartphone sellers. The United States has imposed several restrictions against Huawei in the past year, deeming the company a security threat, a claim that the company denies. “This is a new spin using Shenzhen to say, ‘We can be economically strong, we can be technologically innovative, we can be socially progressive, on Chinese terms,’” said Juan Du, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong and author of a recent study, “The Shenzhen Experiment.” “A lot is riding on this for Shenzhen to be able to set an example for other cities in China,” she said. “Shenzhen’s importance to the national psyche is far greater than just its economic importance.” But China remains greatly dependent on imported technologies, especially semiconductors, the brains of all electronic devices. Despite billions of dollars in state support, Chinese chip makers are still far behind rivals in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States. The Trump administration is threatening to block Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China’s most advanced chip manufacturer, from using American software and equipment out of fear that its products are used by the Chinese military, which the company denies. The technology involved in chip production is fiendishly complex to master, making it difficult for Chinese companies to easily catch up with foreign makers. “The Chinese government is pretty much aware that technology, by and large, comes from the private sector,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University. Shenzhen and its tech companies, he said, are “very much part of this effort to leapfrog and catch up with Western countries in high-tech.” Mr. Xi’s vision of Shenzhen as a base for China’s rising technological prowess carries extra resonance because his father, Xi Zhongxun, was an official who helped to establish the region as a scrappy boomtown. After Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a surge of people fled to Hong Kong, and Xi Zhongxun, then the party secretary of Guangdong, hoped zones like Shenzhen would help revive the economy and stanch the departures, said Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University in Washington who is writing a biography of the elder Mr. Xi. The younger Mr. Xi mentioned his father indirectly in his speech, citing him only as an unnamed provincial leader. Hong Kong investment and expertise were crucial to Shenzhen’s rise in the 1980s, but Mr. Xi’s speech on Wednesday showed the financial hub’s reduced role in China’s ambitions. The officials applauding Mr. Xi in Shenzhen included Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who is charged with enforcing the draconian new national security law. Earlier this week, Mrs. Lam abruptly postponed her annual policy speech to avoid it coinciding with Mr. Xi’s visit to Shenzhen. “It shows again that Hong Kong is a kind of appendage to mainland China,” Professor Cabestan said. Mr. Xi also used his speech in Shenzhen to vow a bigger role for markets, but Chinese entrepreneurs and economists have expressed skepticism about his commitment. Since coming to power in 2012, he has stressed that the party must keep a tight grip on the economy, and that state companies must dominate key sectors of industry. Last month, the Chinese party announced plans to extend its role in private businesses. Mr. Xi’s visit to Shenzhen did not signal any shift from his established economic course, said Deng Yuwen, a former editor for a party newspaper who now lives in the United States. “I think the propaganda pitch has been set this high this time to try to shift the outside world’s view saying that China is not reforming and is closing itself off,” Mr. Deng said by telephone. “Oftentimes, what action you take is not the same thing as in the propaganda.” Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.']","China’s leader, Xi Jinping, speaking in the early trading center of Shenzhen, emphasized domestic innovation amid tensions with the United States."
What Happens When Covid-19 Meets Toxic Air? India Is About to Find Out,2020-10-15,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Hari Kumar,"['NEW DELHI — As a thick quilt of smog wrapped itself around New Delhi on Thursday, signaling the start of the fall pollution season, doctors and scientists warned that the deteriorating air quality could make the city’s Covid-19 problems even worse. One of the most common symptoms of severe coronavirus cases is breathing difficulty. And doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die. “If two people are shooting at the lungs, then obviously the lungs will have more problems,” said Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi, a group that raises awareness about respiratory problems. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading far and wide, putting the country on track to have the largest reported virus caseload in the coming weeks. With 7.3 million reported infections, it is just behind the United States’ 7.9 million. And each day, India outpaces the United States in new infections by around 10,000 more cases per day, even as India’s death rate remains much lower. In the background is India’s vexing air pollution, which shoots up in the fall and winter. The rapid economic growth of the past two decades — and along with it, increased urbanization and congestion — has left Indian cities horribly polluted. Last year, India was once again home to 14 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air globally, and health experts have detailed how such conditions can lead to brain damage, respiratory problems and early death. In the fall, air temperatures and wind speeds drop, condensing pollutants over India’s cities, especially in the north. And farmers in the surrounding rural areas burn the stalks and refuse from their crop, sending up huge clouds of black smoke that drift for miles. This year there have been five times the number of farm refuse fires in northern India as the same period last year, and experts say it is a bad sign of what’s to come. The agricultural sector has been a rare bright spot in an Indian economy that has been shattered by the pandemic, and pollution experts fear that more farming will mean more burning. “My gut is it’s going to be a bumper, bumper harvest and a bumper, bumper combustion event, probably the biggest of our lifetime,” said Jai Dhar Gupta, an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur. “And now that you’ve got the combined impact of a respiratory virus and respiratory contaminants, every public health specialist is holding their breath to see what happens,” Mr. Gupta said. “We’re just sitting ducks,” he added. Doctors say long-term exposure to severely polluted air can cause chronic lung inflammation, which can leave people who are exposed to the coronavirus more vulnerable. A recent study from Italy found a correlation between long-term exposure to dirty air and an increase in excess mortality — a measure of deaths above normal — from the coronavirus. “Pollution-afflicted areas will have a higher incidence of Covid,” said Dr. Kumar, the chest surgeon. “And once this population gets Covid, they then have a higher chance of mortality.” Up until now, people in New Delhi this year had been spoiled in terms of breathable air. When a coronavirus lockdown in the spring shut down many industries and kept cars off the road, Delhi’s skies turned a miraculous blue. It was the cleanest air in decades, and at night, residents felt as if they were being treated to a star show. Constellations that hadn’t been seen for years shone above the apartment blocks. But that has become a dim memory. The sky is back to its usual hazy brown, and the city now smells of smoke. The Delhi government is doing more this year to fight pollution, including setting up a war room to track pollution hot spots and turning to anti-smog guns that blast mist into the air to knock down the dust. On Thursday, officials in Delhi, which is controlled by a progressive opposition political party, got locked into a blame game with national politicians who are part of the right-leaning administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Delhi officials blamed the Modi government for not doing enough to stop crop burning in the states that ring the capital. Modi administration officials argued that crop burning contributed only a minuscule amount to overall air pollution, and they blamed the Delhi government for not doing enough to control dust. Many more people in India’s cities are donning masks these days because of the pandemic, but experts say this probably won’t help much. Most people wear cloth masks or surgical-type masks that don’t seal well and won’t stop someone from inhaling small pollution particles (or the virus, either). Pollution alerts whizzed around the city via WhatsApp messages on Thursday. “Delhi pollution level reported hazardous. 335,” read one message, referring to an Air Quality Index reading of 335, about six times as bad as that of New York City. The message continued: “Be Careful. Seniors don’t go out. Wear mask.”']","Every fall, air pollution spikes in India. Doctors worry what it will mean for coronavirus patients with breathing problems."
Turkish Defector Says He Was Ordered to Kill Politician in Austria,2020-10-13,By Katrin Bennhold and Carlotta Gall,"['One afternoon last month, a man claiming to be a Turkish intelligence operative walked into a police station in Vienna. His confession was explosive: The man said he had been ordered to shoot a Kurdish-Austrian politician, which he did not want to do, and asked for police protection. He also said that he had been forced to give false testimony used to convict an employee at the American Consulate in Istanbul. If true, the claims by the man, who identified himself as Feyyaz Ozturk, provide new insight into how far President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is prepared to go to pursue his foes. Mr. Ozturk’s confession, detailed in a police report which was obtained by The New York Times, could blow a hole in the conviction of Metin Topuz, who worked for the U.S. State Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration in Istanbul. In June, Mr. Topuz was sentenced by a Turkish court to more than eight years in prison on charges of aiding an armed terrorist group. The Topuz case is one of several against American citizens and U.S. government employees that American officials have said are groundless and that they see as an attempt by Mr. Erdogan to exert leverage in his increasingly antagonistic relations with the United States. Mr. Erdogan’s growing authoritarianism over the past decade has been accompanied by an aggressive campaign against perceived enemies at home and abroad, which began as he fell out with the European Union and intensified after a failed coup in 2016 that the president has blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. In Turkey, the crackdown has resulted in the imprisonment of tens of thousands of Mr. Erdogan’s political enemies, often on evidence that critics say is flimsy or fabricated. Abroad, it has involved the forced renditions of 100 or more Gulen supporters and has even stretched, according to French investigators, to the assassination of three Kurdish militants in Paris in 2013, although Turkish intelligence denies any involvement in those killings. Others living abroad have had notices served through Interpol for their arrest and complain of harassment and surveillance by Turkish agents. The Austrian government has long been concerned about the influence of Turkey’s secret service in Austria and this latest case has raised the alarm. “We are taking this very seriously,” Karl Nehammer, the Austrian interior minister, told The New York Times on Tuesday. He said he would not comment on the details of the case because the investigation was continuing. The prosecutor’s office declined to comment, saying in an emailed statement that the case was so sensitive that it was “classified.” A senior government official who is familiar with the case and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue while the investigation remained open, said that if the plot to attack a Kurdish-Austrian politician were confirmed, it would signal a new level of Turkish meddling in Austria. Just last month, a special police commission concluded that Turkey’s secret service had recruited agitators to help provoke violent clashes during a Kurdish street protest in the Vienna district of Favoriten in June and collect information on demonstrators. At the time, Mr. Nehammer said, “Turkish espionage and Turkish meddling in democratic rights has no place in Austria.” There are about 270,000 people with Turkish roots in Austria, the Interior Ministry said, and about a third of them are Kurds. Susanne Raab, the Austrian minister for integration, was even more blunt. “Austria has become a target of Turkish espionage,” she said. “Erdogan’s long arm reaches all the way to Vienna-Favoriten.” When Mr. Ozturk turned himself in on Sept. 15, he told the police that he was retired from a long career at the Turkish intelligence agency, known as the M.I.T., but had recently been tasked to carry out an attack on Aygul Berivan Aslan, a former Green Party lawmaker of Kurdish descent and a vocal Erdogan critic. He has since been detained by Austrian prosecutors, who are now investigating him on suspicion of working for a foreign military intelligence service. Asked for comment, a senior official in the Communications Directorate of the Turkish presidency said in an emailed statement that the claims were nonsense. “Mr. Ozturk was never affiliated with, nor did he ever act on behalf of, the Turkish intelligence,” the statement said. But the Turkish attempts to undermine Mr. Ozturk’s credibility in turn seem to raise questions about his reliability as a witness in the prosecution against Mr. Topuz. Over a four-hour interview with the Austrian police, the account by Mr. Ozturk, 53, was vague at times, especially when it came to his alleged job as a hit man. But it became very concrete when an officer asked him about Mr. Topuz’s case. According to the police transcript, Mr. Ozturk said that he had worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration until 2004 and that he had last met Mr. Topuz in 2005. Mr. Topuz, too, had worked for the D.E.A. as a translator, he added, something American officials have confirmed. A press officer for the D.E.A. in the United States said in an email that the agency had no record of Mr. Ozturk’s employment there but was checking with the office in Turkey. Mr. Ozturk said that in early September 2017, he had been asked to sign a witness statement against Mr. Topuz or risk going to prison himself. “They slotted me in as a witness and put an empty piece of paper in front of me, which I signed,” Mr. Ozturk said. “Otherwise I would go to prison with Metin Topuz.” “In Turkey, they always do it that way,” he added.  The police officers then turned back to Mr. Ozturk’s account of the alleged plot to attack a politician in Austria. Mr. Ozturk said he had been given orders to shoot Ms. Aslan and was first contacted for the job by a Turkish prosecutor in Istanbul in 2018. Originally, he was supposed to carry out the attack in March, but the lockdown got in the way of his travel to Vienna, he told the police. Mr. Ozturk, who has an Italian passport, said he got stuck in Rimini, Italy, where he ended up breaking a leg in an accident. In the end, he told his handlers that he could not go ahead with the attack. Then in August, he said, he was contacted on WhatsApp by a man who told him to travel to Belgrade, Serbia, and meet a contact in a Turkish coffee shop. “It doesn’t matter if she dies or is only injured,” his contact told him there, Mr. Ozturk recounted to the Austrian police. The main point was “that the politician gets the message,” he reported that the contact had said, telling him to travel to Vienna and await further instructions. Asked in the police interview why he had turned himself in, Mr. Ozturk said it was perhaps to save himself. “The Austrian police could catch me afterward,” he continued. “I don’t like this kind of thing. I am no contract killer.” “If this had happened, they would have distanced themselves from me and said I am a criminal,” he said of the Turkish authorities. He also said that the Turkish authorities had frozen his and his family’s bank accounts.  In a later police interview, Mr. Ozturk also named other targets he had been given in addition to Ms. Aslan, the Austrian-Kurdish politician. Peter Pilz, the publisher of the online magazine ZackZack, which was the first to publish Mr. Ozturk’s account, said that the police had told him he was one of those targets and had offered him protection. Mr. Pilz, also a former Green Party lawmaker, served on the intelligence oversight committee and is a longstanding and vocal critic of Mr. Erdogan and his treatment of the Kurdish population. He knows Ms. Aslan well. She has been threatened many times over the years, he said. “He got the order to shoot a politician in Austria, the question is: Who gave the order?” Mr. Pilz said. “In the case against Mr. Topuz, things are legally absolutely clear,” he added. “The key witness in the case has retracted his statement. The case needs to be reopened.” The U.S. embassy in Ankara, the Turkish capital, and Mr. Topuz’s lawyers declined to comment on Mr. Ozturk’s claims or the effect that they may have on the case, which has gone to appeal. But Mr. Ozturk’s statement in the indictment was central to Mr. Topuz’s conviction, alleging that Mr. Topuz had worked closely with members of the Gulen organization in the Turkish police and prosecutor’s office. Yet Mr. Ozturk never appeared in court in person and was never cross-examined. The judge prolonged the trial several times to wait for Mr. Ozturk to return from abroad. In June, the judge ruled that the trial would proceed without his appearance. But contrary to normal legal procedure, he did not order Mr. Ozturk’s testimony to be ignored.']","The testimony by the man, who claimed to be an intelligence agent, offers insight into President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s pursuit of foes and undermines the conviction of a U.S. Consulate employee in Istanbul."
"At a campaign rally, Trump offers to give ‘a big fat kiss’ to attendees.",2020-10-13,By Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni,"['President Trump, eager to prove he is healthy and energetic despite his recent hospitalization for Covid-19, returned to the campaign trail on Monday night in Florida, telling supporters he was fully recovered and therefore immune to the coronavirus — a claim for which there is no conclusive scientific backing. Onstage at a hangar at the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Mr. Trump said he felt “so powerful” and offered to wade into the crowd. “I’ll kiss everyone in that audience,” he said. “I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women. Just give you a big fat kiss.” The president spoke for about an hour. Many supporters in the crowd did not wear masks, including some of those chosen to stand behind the president’s lectern and within the camera shot. Mr. Trump claimed that vaccines against the virus “are going to be distributed very shortly,” although the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved one. The president also implied without evidence that the agency was deliberately holding back on vaccine approvals to hurt his chances of re-election. (Read a fact check of Mr. Trump’s claims on Monday here.) “Frankly, it’s a big political deal going on where they don’t want it to be before the election,” the president said. Mr. Trump, whose response to a pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans remains the biggest threat to his re-election, also claimed without evidence that his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., would delay the vaccine and “prolong the pandemic.” Mr. Trump’s arrival in Florida took place only hours after the White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said the president had tested negative “on consecutive days” using a rapid coronavirus test not intended for that purpose. Experts cautioned that the test’s accuracy has not yet been investigated enough to be sure that the president is virus-free or, as his doctor claimed, “not infectious to others.” With three weeks left in the race, Mr. Trump is running behind Mr. Biden. His polling numbers with seniors, a crucial constituency that has been disproportionately harmed by the coronavirus, have been flagging. Hours before Monday’s rally, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, warned that holding large rallies was “asking for trouble” with cases of the virus surging in many states. Dr. Fauci, in an interview with CNN, said that Americans needed to be more cautious in the fall and winter months, and warned that rising rates of infections in a number of states suggested Americans should be “doubling down” on precautions rather than casting them aside.']",
"A W.H.O. official urges tighter restrictions in Europe, and London will face new limits.",2020-10-14,"By Karen Zraick, Zach Montague, Anna Schaverien, Mark Landler, Aurelien Breeden, Christopher F. Schuetze and Nick Cumming-Bruce","['The weekly number of new coronavirus cases in Europe is now at its highest point since the start of the pandemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday, urging governments to impose tighter, targeted controls on social gatherings. The number of confirmed cases in Europe rose by a million to seven million in just 10 days, Hans Kluge, the WH.O.’s director for Europe, told reporters, and the number of daily deaths had passed the level of 1,000 for the first time in months. (An earlier version of this item stated incorrectly the last time daily deaths in Europe had passed 1,000; it was earlier this year, not ever.) His warning came as Britain announced tightened restrictions on several areas, including London, where people from different households will be barred from meeting indoors starting after midnight on Friday. People will also be discouraged from using public transportation. The new measures will also apply to the city of York, in northern England, as well as to parts of central and southeastern England. Many European countries are adopting stricter controls, which Dr. Kluge called “absolutely necessary,” as increased caseloads are raising fears of another surge as winter approaches. On Wednesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France announced that, starting on Saturday, the authorities would impose a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the Paris region and around eight other major cities. The curfews will run for at least four weeks. The measure is part of a renewed state of emergency that allows the national government to restrict public gatherings and movement countrywide. It was first declared in the spring but had ended in July. “We need this — and if we don’t want to take harsher measures in 15 days, or three weeks, or one month, we have to do it and comply with it,” Mr. Macron said. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors have also agreed to nationwide restrictions on social gatherings and domestic travel, in response to a rise in infections. “I am convinced that what we do — and what we don’t do — in these coming days and weeks will be decisive in how we get through this pandemic,” Ms. Merkel at a news conference on Wednesday.']",
Cyprus Ends ‘Golden Passport’ Program After Corruption Accusations,2020-10-15,By Isabella Kwai,"['The small Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus has given citizenship and passports to more than 3,000 foreigners who agreed to invest at least $2 million in the country — a “golden passport” that allowed the holders to travel visa-free throughout the European Union. But this week Cyprus announced that it was ending the initiative after an undercover investigation by journalists appeared to show two lawmakers helping to arrange a passport for a fictitious businessman, despite being told he had a criminal record. One of those lawmakers, Demetris Syllouris, the president of Parliament and the country’s second-most powerful official, resigned on Thursday. The other, Christakis Giovanis, resigned on Tuesday, and both men have denied any wrongdoing. Cyprus was only one of several European countries that turned to offering what became widely known as “golden passports” to attract investments after their economies were crippled in the global economic downturn that began in 2008. In the last seven years, Cyprus has raised over 6 billion euros through the program — about $7 billion dollars. But some of the passport programs are now seen as gateways for crime and corruption, and a threat to the integrity of the European Union, since such passports grant the right to travel to the union’s 27 member countries. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has said that programs in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta are at particular risk for corruption. The Commission is considering possible legal action against Cyprus over the matter, said Christian Wigand, a Commission spokesman. He said that European officials had “watched in disbelief” as the undercover investigation, produced by Al Jazeera and made public on Monday, purported to show high-level Cypriot officials willing to trade European citizenship for financial gain. “European values are not for sale,” said Mr. Wigand, repeating a statement made by the Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, in her State of the Union address last month. The passport program bars anyone with a criminal record from applying. But Mr. Syllouris and Mr. Giovanis were filmed saying that they would help obtain a passport for a wealthy Chinese businessman — who, they were told, had fled China after being sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of bribery and money laundering. “If there is a problem, we are not going to stop,” Mr. Syllouris said in the footage aired by Al Jazeera. “You will have full support from Cyprus.” Another associate is shown in the video saying it was possible to use a fake name on the passport. Cyprus’s attorney general, George Savvidis, said the authorities would conduct an investigation to determine whether any criminal acts were involved. Both lawmakers rejected the allegations of corruption, saying that they had actually been gathering evidence to relay to the authorities that fight money laundering. Mr. Giovanis also said that the situation was staged, and that he was entrapped into making the statements. Al Jazeera reporters posed as associates of the businessman. Cyprus’ ministry of finance said the country had granted more than 3,000 visas to applicants who invested two million Euros — or about $2.34 million dollars. The government said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that it will end the program on Nov. 1, citing ongoing weaknesses and exploitation of the program. This is not the first report by Al Jazeera about the passport initiative. In August, leaked documents obtained by its journalists indicated that at least 60 people approved for Cypriot citizenship should have been rejected under tighter rules that were introduced in 2019 but then eased this year. In September, the government announced that it was reviewing foreigners who received citizenship through the program. Many of the passports have gone to Russian, Ukrainian and Chinese investors. Cyprus also revoked the passports of 26 people last year after Reuters reported that new citizens under the program included high-ranking Cambodian officials and close associates of Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen. The leader has denied accusations that members of his inner circle have second passports that allow them to live overseas. Activists who work to fight corruption welcomed the end of Cyprus’s program. They said the European Union needed to regulate such initiatives more strictly, if not repeal them entirely. The Cypriot government has not ruled out making changes and reinstating the program. Maíra Martini, a research and policy expert at Transparency International, said in a statement that a full analysis of passports awarded under the initiative was needed. “The overwhelming evidence is that the country’s ‘golden visa’ scheme serves corrupt interests, not the people of Cyprus,” she said.']",An investigation into an initiative that grants citizenship to wealthy foreign investors appeared to show lawmakers helping to arrange a passport for a businessman despite being told he was a convicted criminal.

Separatists Kill 14 in Attack on Oil Convoy in Restive Pakistani Province,2020-10-15,By Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud and Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Militants attacked a convoy of Pakistan’s biggest oil and gas exploration company in restive Baluchistan Province on Thursday, killing at least 14 people, officials said. The attack reflected an escalation of violence in the resource-rich province, where separatists have waged a low-intensity insurgency for decades and where the local population has long complained of getting an inequitable share of Baluchistan’s wealth of minerals, oil and natural gas. The province’s strategic value has grown, too. China has invested heavily in a major seaport in the city of Gwadar in Baluchistan, and the province is a showcase for China’s Belt and Road development plan to create a lucrative transportation corridor to western China. Chinese citizens have been among those coming under separatists’ attacks in recent years, particularly by the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States. Baloch Raji Ajoi Sangar, an alliance of several separatist groups including the B.L.A., claimed the responsibility for Thursday’s assault. Seven paramilitary soldiers and seven private security guards, all assigned to protect the convoy, were killed in the attack. No company workers or militants were reported killed. Officials said a convoy of the exploration firm, the Oil and Gas Development Company, was heading from Gwadar to Karachi, about 150 miles to the west, when it was ambushed by a large number of militants around midday. The separatist group, in claiming responsibility for the attack, said exploration and drilling in the province without the assent of the Baluch people was unacceptable. Separatist groups have repeatedly clashed with military and security forces in the province. Baluch nationalists, for their part, complain that security forces have waged a campaign of enforced disappearances and targeted killings in the region, accusations the military denies. The Pakistani government and military have recently made efforts to win over the Baluch population by offering jobs and economic incentives. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the army chief, unveiled a “Prosperous Baluchistan” project in 2017, an effort to foster stability and development in the region. The military has also tried to recruit more local residents into its ranks. Officials say there are currently 1,200 Baluch officers and at least 25,000 Baluch soldiers in the ranks of the Pakistan Army, which counts more than a half-million active duty personnel. In a separate episode six army soldiers, including a captain, were killed by a roadside bomb near Razmak, in North Waziristan in the northwestern part of the country, the military said Thursday. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.']","The assault was an escalation of violence in the resource-rich province of Baluchistan, which has become a nexus of Chinese development projects and heavy security crackdowns."
Italy tightens rules for the second time in a week to slow infections.,2020-10-13,By Emma Bubola,"['The Italian government continued to tighten restrictions in an effort to stem a resurgence in virus cases, announcing on Tuesday a ban on informal amateur contact sports, parties and school trips. The decree, signed by Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte, represents a second crackdown in less than a week as the second wave of the coronavirus, which seemed to have hit Italy less violently than other European countries, is now gaining strength, with 4,619 new cases registered on Monday. The new decree introduces a general ban on parties and recommends private gatherings be limited to no more than six people inside homes. It also sets a limit of 30 guests for banquets organized after religious or civil ceremonies. To avoid crowds, Mr. Conte also ordered restaurants, bars and ice-cream sellers to stop serving non-seated customers after 9 p.m. While contact sports, such as soccer or basketball, are now banned in informal contexts, trainings and matches organized by clubs are still permitted. Italy is still in a better position compared with countries such as Spain or France, and while the number of daily infections is similar to those reached in Italy during the spring, the number of deaths and of patients in intensive care units remains lower. But in Italy, the first and one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, the level of alert and the fear of a new lockdown remain high. “I would exclude a new lockdown,” Mr. Conte told reporters on Monday, “We specifically worked to prevent a new generalized lockdown.”']",
Leading Slovak Extremist Sentenced to 4 Years in Jail Over Use of Neo-Nazi Symbol,2020-10-13,By Miroslava German Sirotnikova,"['BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — A Slovakian court has sentenced the country’s leading neo-fascist politician to more than four years in prison after he used a well-known neo-Nazi symbol. The politician, Marian Kotleba, the head of the extremist People’s Party Our Slovakia, was convicted of founding, supporting and promoting a movement and ideology aimed at suppressing civil rights and democratic freedoms. His sentencing on Monday was the culmination of a high-profile trial that lasted several months. “It is a testimony of change,” Grigorij Meseznikov, a political scientist at the Public Affairs Institute in Bratislava, said on Tuesday. “What it means for the country is that the legal tools against those who undermine the democracy are finally working.” The conviction of Mr. Kotleba was a blow to the country’s far-right movement, which gained popularity at the height of the migration crisis in 2015. Mr. Kotleba’s party, which opposes Slovakia’s membership in the European Union and NATO, entered the Parliament in 2016. The party drew energy from broad public disgust with a political system rife with corruption. But in February 2018, the murders of a young investigative reporter and his fiancée set off the largest protests since the 1989 Velvet Revolution, leading to the collapse of the longtime governing party and paving the way for a new, conservative government coalition. The current government has presided over a more effective enforcement of laws to battle extremism and corruption. Mr. Kotleba’s party kept its support, winning roughly 8 percent of the vote in the February election and remaining part of the opposition in Parliament. Mr. Kotleba used to appear in uniforms reminiscent of those worn during the wartime Slovak State, which was run by the Nazi puppet regime led by a former Roman Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso. But as Mr. Kotleba’s party moved into the mainstream, he shifted his attacks from Jews to immigrants and the country’s Roma minority. The case against Mr. Kotleba centered on the distribution of three checks for 1,488 euros to families in need at a public event in 2017. The prosecutor Tomas Honz argued in court that the amount of each check — 1,488 — was a clear reference to neo-Nazi ideology. According to the prosecutors and expert witnesses, the number 14 was a reference to “14 Words,” a popular white supremacist slogan. They said the number 88 was an allusion to the Nazi salute “Heil Hitler,” in which each word begins with the eighth letter in the English alphabet. The special court for organized crime in the town of Pezinok sentenced Mr. Kotleba to four years and four months in prison. He has said he will appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court, and he will remain in Parliament until the appeal process is complete. But if his conviction is upheld, he can never run for election again and he would be the first sitting member of parliament to go to jail since Slovakia became independent in 1993. “The words themselves don’t mean anything,” Judge Ruzena Sabova said in her verdict, adding that the numbers had meaning only in the context that they are signs of extremism. In an eight-hour speech on Monday, Mr. Kotleba argued that the numbers were coincidental and the trial unfair. In an attempt to drag out the proceedings, he pulled a number of stunts. They included reading out long lists of items or contracts priced with similar sums and commenting on all of the witness testimony. “The event was not neo-Nazi,” Mr. Kotleba said during the trial. “The event had a beautiful, Christian and national character, and I handed charity checks to three families.” Losing patience with the theatrics in the courtroom, Judge Sabova fined him €500, or about $590, for disrespecting the court. Mr. Honz, the prosecutor, told reporters that the court’s ruling was a victory in Slovakia’s fight against extremism. “It is a message for all the democrats in Slovakia that the courts and prosecution will stand up for people who are victims of extremism, violence, racial hatred, fascism or neo-Nazism,” he said. Rights organizations and many politicians in Slovakia also welcomed the verdict. “No democracy is immune to the threat of extremism,” a group of local anti-extremism organizations said in a joint statement released on Monday. “We are glad that extremism in Slovakia is finally being punished and addressed with the appropriate attention.” Andrea Buckova, the Slovak government representative for Roma communities, which are often targeted by Mr. Kotleba’s party, said the verdict was the “only possible fair decision.” “It is also a satisfaction for everyone who Marian Kotleba is trying to turn into second-class citizens with his hateful rhetoric and actions,” she said on Facebook. “Fascism has no place in our society.”']","Marian Kotleba, the head of a neo-fascist political party, was convicted of spreading an ideology aimed at suppressing democratic rights and freedoms."
Fires on Slopes of Kilimanjaro Threaten a Diverse Ecosystem,2020-10-15,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — As fires swept up the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s tallest mountain, for the fifth day on Thursday, hundreds of volunteers from local villages joined firefighters racing to stop a blaze threatening to ravage one of the world’s richest and most diverse ecosystems. The fires, which first started to burn at a rest stop for climbers, have been raging for five days with dry grass and strong winds hampering efforts to bring the flames under control. “This devastating fire is cutting through the most prestigious natural space in the whole of Tanzania,” Padili Mikomangwa, an environmentalist based in the port city of Dar es Salaam, said in a telephone interview. “The nation at large is following this seriously and shocked.” Already, vast areas of forest and low shrubs have been reduced to embers. Videos and images from the scene showed volunteers struggling to put out the fires as thick white smoke hung heavy in the sky behind them. Helicopters were set to be deployed on Thursday for the first time to help stop the fires. With a summit of 5,895 meters, or 19,341 feet, Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest point in Africa and is considered the highest free-standing volcanic mass in the world. The mountain’s snow-capped peaks and the surrounding national park were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, with endemic plants and dozens of animal species, including endangered ones, calling it home. In recent years, the mountain and the surrounding ecosystem have faced challenges including water and air pollution, intrusion on the park’s perimeters, illegal logging, and poaching. Climate change has also pushed the mountain’s glaciers and icecaps to thaw. With thousands of climbers arriving each year, concern has grown in recent years that overtourism threatens the natural splendor of Kilimanjaro. “The extent of the fire which we see today is at a new level,” Marcell Peters, a senior lecturer at the University of Würzburg in Germany who has studied the ecosystems of Kilimanjaro since 2010, said in an email. He said that the loss of plant life — particularly Erica and Podocarpus trees — could leave the area more vulnerable to fire in the coming years. Tanzanian parks officials said the fires began on Sunday at the Whona rest area, which is popular with mountaineers using the Mandara and Horombo routes to scale the mountain. The authorities said an investigation into the origin of the blaze was underway, but preliminary evidence suggested that it was sparked accidentally by porters warming food for visitors. “It was all bad luck,” Pascal Shelutete, an official with Tanzania National Parks, told journalists this week. “But we will continue to follow the issue in depth.” In addition to the plants and forests that have been destroyed, the fires have also razed facilities used by tourists at the Horombo Center. No deaths or injuries have been reported. Officials estimate that the fire has so far destroyed an alpine area stretching over roughly two miles. “We are still in the midst of putting out the fire,” Hamisi Kigwangalla, Tanzania’s minister of natural resources and tourism, said on Twitter on Thursday, a day after visiting the site of the fire. “The task is harder and bigger than it is thought to be.” The mountain has long held a special place in the imagination of the world, written about extensively by visitors awed by its majesty. For those who live in its shadow, it has been both a source of income and pride. When Tanzania gained its independence in December 1961, the new leader, Julius K. Nyerere, dispatched a team of climbers to ascend the continent’s highest peak. They planted a torch, meant to serve as a metaphor for the aspirations of a nation. However, with presidential elections set for Oct. 28, there is concern that the nation is sliding into autocratic rule. Since President John Magufuli was elected in 2015, the government has cracked down on the media and civil society, passing laws targeted at silencing critical voices. “It’s no coincidence that the Tanzanian government has increased its repression of the opposition, activists groups, and the media so close to the elections,” Oryem Nyeko, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “Instead of upholding the right to free expression at this critical time, authorities have instead adopted measures that raise concerns about the elections being free and fair.” He is facing off a slew of candidates, including Tundu Lissu, an opposition figure who survived an assassination attempt three years ago and is now back in the country. No one has ever been arrested in the case. The nation of roughly 58 million people depends heavily on tourism, and Mr. Magufuli has been eager to draw people back to the country after the coronavirus pandemic ground everything to a halt around the world. Five months ago, he declared the nation coronavirus-free, an announcement that public health officials and neighboring nations alike greeted with skepticism. Mr. Magufuli’s government has restricted reporting about the virus in Tanzania, according to Human Rights Watch. Tourism has been allowed to resume, including at Mount Kilimanjaro. Mr. Mikomangwa said that the authorities could learn from the disaster by better equipping parks and firefighters to respond to fires. “They are now scrambling for a few helicopters,” he said. “But this episode shows that we need to take robust measures to better care for our resources and ensure we end this fire once and for all.”']",Strong winds and dry weather have hampered efforts to extinguish the spreading blaze on Africa’s highest peak.
"As Virus Surges and Brexit Bears Down, Boris Johnson Stalls for Time",2020-10-15,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reached a moment of truth on the two issues that have dominated Britain this year: the pandemic and Brexit negotiations with the European Union. But he is still playing for time — a strategy that could put lives or livelihoods at risk if he waits too long. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson inched closer to imposing a second lockdown on the country, moving London to a higher level of restrictions and signaling that he wanted to move Manchester to the highest level, joining Liverpool. But he stuck to his claim that the best way to curb the virus was through targeted responses, not the two-week nationwide lockdown pushed by the opposition Labour Party and his own scientific advisers. The prime minister also seemed ready to string out trade talks with Brussels, letting a self-imposed deadline pass on Thursday without a deal. While Mr. Johnson could torpedo the negotiations on Friday, after a two-day summit meeting of European Union leaders, analysts said the British government still appeared eager to strike an agreement by the legal deadline of Dec. 31. For Mr. Johnson, Brexit and the virus are linked: the economic turmoil unleashed by the pandemic has raised the pressure on him to avoid the self-inflicted disruption of a ruptured negotiation with the European Union, and the damaging prospect of beginning the new year without a trade agreement in place. Yet his reluctance to move decisively on either of them, analysts say, risks making both worse. Dragging out the talks with Brussels could put Britain in a bind if the two sides hit an impasse as the clock runs out. Putting off a short lockdown — which experts have dubbed a “circuit breaker” — could vitiate its effectiveness in curbing the virus’s spread and necessitate a longer lockdown later, according to medical experts. “If you’re going to do it, do it early, fast and hard,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “The longer they delay, the less likely a two-week circuit breaker will work.” Scientists have proposed that the government schedule the temporary lockdown for the last week of October and first week of November, when schools are closed for mid-term break, to make it less disruptive. But some experts questioned whether that would leave enough time to prepare the public for the restrictions. Britain has missed its chance at earlier action on a mid-term lockdown that might have stemmed the latest surge, but it could still be valuable in slowing the spread, said Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises the government. “We haven’t missed the boat of it epidemiologically as a strategy,” he said. Britain has recorded about 16,000 new coronavirus cases per day, on average, over the past week — the most since the pandemic began, and a tenfold increase in just six weeks. Nearly 800 people were admitted to hospitals on Thursday, and 563 patients were on ventilators, raising fears that intensive care units will soon be overwhelmed. The figures have climbed sharply despite an array of new restrictions adopted after government scientists warned last month that without further action, the caseload could reach 50,000 a day by this point. While the outbreak has been worst in the north and west of England, there are signs that it is spreading across the country. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, pressed the government to raise the city’s status to a high alert level, which prohibits indoor socializing by people from different households, as of Saturday. But other mayors lashed out against the restrictions. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, rejected the move to elevate his city to the highest-risk tier, which involves closing pubs and gyms. Mr. Burnham, who like Mr. Khan is a member of the Labour Party, demanded that the government provide more financial aid to pubs and other businesses that he said would be devastated by the lockdown. “We will not cave into all the pressure that is being applied to us,” the mayor said in an angry video posted on Twitter. “We will not let them be leveled down by this government through this pandemic.” For weeks now, Mr. Johnson has balanced calls from his scientific advisers for tighter measures with warnings from members of his Conservative Party that a lockdown or similarly draconian measures would wreck the economy. The political consensus that once characterized Britain’s response to the pandemic has now fractured in both parties, however. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, threw his weight behind a temporary lockdown, while Mr. Johnson remains at odds not only with members of his party but also with some in his cabinet: the popular chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is resisting the push for a lockdown. “We are effectively burning the furniture to keep warm now,” said Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker and one of the leaders of a campaign for Parliament to have a greater say over coronavirus rules. “If we have to continue like that for another three to six months until there is a vaccine, that poses grave risks to the economy.” Adding to the pressure on Mr. Johnson, public-opinion surveys show clear support in the British public for stricter measures, up to and including a “circuit breaker” — though Britons are split about a lengthier lockdown. By embracing the idea, analysts said, Mr. Starmer had effectively boxed in Mr. Johnson. “If the prime minister moves toward a national lockdown, that will look like he’s changed his mind and moved toward Keir Starmer,” said Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos/MORI, a polling company. “If he doesn’t, then Labour will presumably say in response to any bad news, ‘You should have listened to us.’ From a political situation, Keir Starmer doesn’t face much risk.” However treacherous the political landscape for Mr. Johnson, the Labour Party’s call for a lockdown might actually strengthen the prime minister’s hand with his own party in the short term. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative critics, some observers say, may realize that with public opinion and the opposition running against them, they cannot hope for more than the prime minister’s efforts to seek a middle ground. “It is dawning on them that this is as good as you are going to get,” said David Gauke, a Conservative former lawmaker who fell out with Mr. Johnson over Brexit. “No prime minister is going to be more libertarian than Boris Johnson in this particular set of circumstances.” This time last year, Mr. Johnson faced down resistance by Mr. Baker and his hardline allies on Brexit. He did it by talking tough with Brussels and then cutting a deal that he presented as a triumph — a playbook he appears to be trying to use again. Mr. Johnson’s aides insist a trade agreement is within reach if talks can be intensified on the key issues: fishing quotas and state aid to industry. But the longer they drag on, the greater the uncertainty for British exporters — and the greater the leverage for Brussels.']","The prime minister’s delaying strategy carries severe risks if he misplays his hand, with the pandemic worsening and a Brexit deadline approaching."
Can a Bill Have a Gender? Feminine Wording Exposes a Rift,2020-10-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — A dispute over grammar between two federal ministries has reopened a front in Germany’s longstanding battle about gender equality, forcing officials to redraft a debt protection bill. Last month, the Justice Ministry presented a draft of the bill, which aims to shield debtors and businesses from insolvency in the wake of the coronavirus. While the bill drew little attention at the time, the draft language was written employing “Femininum,” a grammatical device that includes the use of the feminine form of plural nouns to describe groups that include both men and women. An equivalent in English would be to refer to a group of both male and female actors collectively as “actresses.” On Monday, the Interior Ministry announced that the draft would be rejected based on its use of the generic feminine form, dealing a blow to those who say the usual masculine marginalizes people who do not identify as men. In a country like Germany, where gender norms remain entrenched, the dispute shows how the traditional norms of language can become an obstacle to equality. Christine Lambrecht, the justice minister who rolled out the draft bill, ran into resistance from the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who warned that the document’s language could, in legal terms, exclude men from its protections. Steve Alter, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said that Mr. Seehofer’s objections were focused solely on the question of whether it was legally valid to use such language in a bill. “The generic feminine for use for female and male people has not yet been linguistically recognized,” Mr. Alter said. “This applies completely independently of whether a certain social state is desired.” German has gendered nouns — masculine, feminine and neutral — but as in several other European languages, the masculine form takes precedence when referring to groups of men and women, especially on official and legal documents. Katrin Gottschalk, a deputy managing editor of the Berlin-based daily TAZ, said, “The current debate is important because we still haven’t found the language in which women and nonbinary people are not only meant to be, but also feel, addressed.” “It’s not clear yet how we deal with that problem in the German language,” Ms. Gottschalk wrote in an op-ed on the draft bill and the debate it has unleashed. Other countries with gendered languages have also grappled with the issue: In 2017, the French prime minister forbade the use of “inclusive writing” in official texts. The debate over whether German usage should be changed to be more inclusive has been simmering for a decade.  The choice in private or professional settings is largely up to individuals or institutions — progressive news outlets in Germany, for example, often use gender-neutral language where possible — but the debate over the draft bill has raised the question to the federal level. Several regional governments have already taken up the issue. This year, the state government of Saxony announced that it would start using gender-inclusive language in state laws. “The language of our laws is still shaped by a time when women and men did not have the same rights,” the state justice minister, Katja Meier of the Greens, said at the time. And last year, the city of Hanover, then under the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, announced that it would adopt gender-neutral language in all its communication. The decision only ratified what had been common practice for more than a decade, but it was enough to prompt a group of 70 influential, mostly conservative figures to publish an public appeal against the policy. Although language is not considered the most important battlefield for those fighting for a fairer and more inclusive society in Germany, the debate over the draft bill is the latest chapter in the long struggle for equality. Those efforts have included demands for more accessible child care, equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs and more female representation on corporate boards. When a federal official made a passing suggestion to change the word “fatherland” to “homeland” in the German national anthem in 2018, it led to a minor political storm. The far-right party Alternative for Germany called it “gender nonsense.” Ms. Lambrecht, the justice minister, is a member of the Social Democratic Party, the furthest left in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition. Mr. Seehofer was the longtime head of the Christian Social Union, the conservative Bavarian sibling party to Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. The Justice Ministry said that using the feminine form in the draft bill was simply the easiest way to write it and that it was not meant to send a political message. “We weren’t trying to float a trial balloon,” Stefan Zimmermann, a spokesman, said. The conservative German language association, VDS, criticized the draft text on the grounds that using the feminine form muddled the writing of legal documents. Alternative for Germany was searing in its denunciation. “Legal texts are not a romping place for left-wing ideological craziness,” Stephan Brandner, a member of the party who sits in Parliament, wrote on his official Facebook page on Tuesday. In his post, Mr. Brandner compared the justice minister to a misbehaving toddler. Katja Mast, a Social Democratic lawmaker who publicly defended the ministry’s decision to release the bill, wrote in an email that women still faced discrimination in Germany. “This also happens through language,” she noted, adding that she was grateful for the discussions. In the end, political expediency won out. On Wednesday, the Justice Ministry submitted a new version of the bill to the cabinet.  “Because the project is of great importance to us and because it is important to us to reach an agreement between the ministries as quickly as possible, we have decided in favor of the conventional variant,” said Mr. Zimmermann, the spokesman for the Justice Ministry.']","When proposed legislation in Germany used the feminine form for groups of men and women rather than the usual masculine, it was rejected as potentially invalid."
"From Hiding, Head of Central Asia’s Only Democracy Says He’s Quitting",2020-10-15,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — After more than a week in hiding following a disputed election, the president of Kyrgyzstan — Central Asia’s only democracy — on Thursday announced his plans to resign, saying he did not want to go down in history as a leader “who shed blood and shot at his own citizens.” In a statement issued from an undisclosed location, the president, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, said he had “taken a decision to resign,” though he did not specify whether he had already quit. Just a few hours earlier, Mr. Jeebenkov had assured a delegation of former senior officials and political veterans that he had no plans to step down and would stand firm against a power grab widely believed to be backed by criminal elements. Feliks Kulov, a former prime minister who met with the president on Thursday morning, voiced concern over Mr. Jeenbekov’s abrupt change of heart, speculating in a post on Facebook that the leader had been “presented with a choice: voluntary resignation or a real war.” The day’s dizzying events, which left a freed prisoner in charge of the government as prime minister, seemed to signal the end of what began as a protest by mainstream opposition forces over a rigged election and degenerated last week into a reign of chaos fueled by thugs and criminals. Mr. Jeenbekov vanished from view after protesters, enraged by Oct. 4 parliamentary elections that were marred by widespread vote-buying, stormed the president’s office and other government buildings in the capital, Bishkek. He was rumored to have taken refuge in a Russian military air base in the town of Kant, about 12 miles from Bishkek, but his exact whereabouts remained unclear. His departure is the third time in 15 years that violent protests have toppled a president of Kyrgyzstan, the only country in the region with a vibrant civil society, a relatively free press and regular competitive elections for Parliament and the presidency. The Kremlin, which in 2010 helped engineer the toppling of a Kyrgyz president who had resisted Russian pressure to shut down a since closed United States air base in his country, responded coolly to the announcement on Thursday. Mr. Jeenbekov has had good relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Russia is watching the events in Bishkek “very closely,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, told journalists in Moscow, and wants “the situation there to calm down as soon as possible.” But he added that Russia, which suspended financial aid to Kyrgyzstan after last week’s unrest, would not resume funding until the country has a functioning government. He noted that it currently has no cabinet and that the president’s resignation cannot take effect until approved by Parliament. With the president apparently out of the way, his role as head of state — and commander in chief of the armed forces — will be taken by the speaker of Parliament, who has also come under mounting pressure to resign. In what is formally a parliamentary democracy, however, the governing of Kyrgyzstan falls to Sadyr Japarov, a convicted kidnapper who was sprung from jail last week by antigovernment protesters. He was named prime minister on Saturday by lawmakers who gathered for an unusual and his opponents say illegal session without a quorum at the president’s official residence. In announcing his resignation, President Jeenbekov, who last week ordered troops into the capital to restore order, called on Mr. Japaraov and rival politicians to “withdraw their supporters from the capital and give back a peaceful life to the people of Bishkek.” Hundreds of protesters — some of them Mr. Japarov’s supporters, but also a group that included men whom observers in Bishkek described as paid thugs linked to criminal groups — gathered outside the president’s official residence on Thursday to demand that Mr. Jeenbekov give up the presidency. A group of Mr. Japarov’s followers, mostly young men, clashed violently last week with supporters of another would-be prime minister. Since that confrontation, there have been growing fears that Mr. Japarov, reviled by his critics as a bare-knuckled nationalist rabble-rouser, would again mobilize his followers if the president did not step down. Mr. Jeenbekov, who was elected in 2017, had said he would leave office once calm returned to the capital, which has in recent days been free of the turmoil that engulfed it last week. Mr. Japarov, the new prime minister, has long insisted that his 2017 conviction on charges of organizing the kidnapping of a regional governor was politically motivated in a country where each new government has often jailed members of the previous one and rival politicians. Mr. Jeenbekov had his presidential predecessor, Almazbek Atambayev, arrested and jailed on corruption charges soon after taking office. Mr. Atambayev, who was serving an 11-year sentence, was among those sprung from jail last week, along with Mr. Japarov. He was rearrested on Saturday.']",The president of Kyrgyzstan said he did not want to be remembered as a leader “who shed blood and shot at his own citizens.”
Iceland’s tourism industry is preparing for a comeback.,2020-10-13,By Paige McClanahan,"['Tourism is undergoing a downturn all over the world, but several factors make Iceland particularly vulnerable to the industry’s crash: geographic isolation, a small domestic population, strict border measures and an economy that — after an extraordinary, decade-long tourism boom — had come to depend heavily on foreign tourists. A recent surge in coronavirus cases has added to Iceland’s challenges. But while visitor numbers are low, Iceland is positioning itself for a major tourism rebound after the pandemic. The government is investing more than $12 million in tourism infrastructure, while improving roads and harbors across the country. To keep the tourism industry afloat in the short term, the government is also investing more than $9 million in a program that distributes free travel vouchers to Icelandic citizens and residents. A marketing campaign targeting domestic tourists was rolled out in the late spring; an international version will be unveiled as soon as travel restrictions are lifted. The voucher campaign helped to jump-start demand for hotels, restaurants and attractions. So far, Icelanders have used more than $1.2 million worth of their free travel vouchers, which are valid through the end of the year. The summer was “pretty good, considering everything,” said Bjarnheidur Hallsdottir, the chairwoman of the board of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association and the chief executive of two tourism companies. “And then suddenly out of nowhere, the government decided to change the rules at the borders. Since then, everyone is crying.” Under the new rules, which took effect in August, arriving passengers may choose either to submit to two screening tests for the virus, separated by five days’ self-quarantine, or to skip border screening and self-quarantine for 14 days after arrival.']",
‘Chaos and confusion’ could follow vaccine approvals.,2020-10-13,By Carl Zimmer,"['The United States may be within months of a profound turning point in the country’s fight against the coronavirus: the first working vaccine. Demonstrating that a new vaccine is safe and effective in less than a year would shatter the record for speed, the result of seven-day workweeks for scientists and billions of dollars of investment by the government. The path has not been without bumps. Johnson & Johnson announced Monday night that it was halting its Phase 3 trial after a volunteer got sick. And AstraZeneca also paused its trial, last month, after two participants became ill. Still, it’s tempting to look at the first vaccine as President Trump does: an on-off switch that will bring back life as we know it. “As soon as it’s given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus,” he said at a September news conference. Instead, vaccine experts say, we should prepare for a perplexing, frustrating year. The first vaccines may provide only moderate protection, low enough to make it prudent to keep wearing a mask. By next spring or summer, there may be several of these so-so vaccines. Because of this array of options, makers of a superior vaccine in early stages of development may struggle to finish clinical testing. And some vaccines may be abruptly withdrawn from the market because they turn out not to be safe. “It has not yet dawned on hardly anybody the amount of complexity and chaos and confusion that will happen in a few short months,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, the director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic.']",
"Indonesian Defense Chief, Accused of Rights Abuses, Will Visit Pentagon",2020-10-14,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — For two decades, Prabowo Subianto, a former Indonesian general, was a pariah in international affairs. Mr. Prabowo, once a son-in-law of the dictator Suharto, who died in 2008, and a past commander of Indonesia’s feared special forces, was blamed for atrocities committed by troops he had led. Under Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, he was prohibited from visiting the United States. But now, Mr. Prabowo is Indonesia’s minister of defense and the ban has been lifted. At the invitation of Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Mr. Prabowo arrived in Washington this week and is expected to meet with top officials at the Pentagon on Thursday. For Mr. Prabowo, who will turn 69 on Saturday while on his trip, the visit is the culmination of a yearslong quest to gain respectability. For Washington, it highlights the significance of Indonesia, a potentially important U.S. ally against China, and further signals the relegation of human rights to a minor diplomatic concern. “The ban that applied to Minister Prabowo has been lifted, and he will visit the U.S. to discuss cooperation,” said Irawan Ronodipuro, a spokesman for Mr. Prabowo and his political party, Gerindra. Amnesty International and six other human rights groups called on the Trump administration to cancel the visit, saying that it could violate the United States’ own rules on the entry of people accused of human rights violations and would undermine efforts in Indonesia to hold abusers accountable. “Prabowo Subianto is a former Indonesian general who has been banned, since 2000, from entering the U.S., due to his alleged direct involvement in human rights violations,” the groups said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “The State Department’s recent decision to lift the ban on Prabowo Subianto is an abrupt, complete reversal of longstanding U.S. foreign policy.” As commander of the country’s special forces under Suharto in the late 1990s, Mr. Prabowo was discharged from the army by a panel of generals for ordering the kidnapping of student activists in a failed effort to keep his father-in-law in power. Mr. Prabowo was also accused of atrocities in East Timor, a former province that broke away in 1999 and became independent in 2002. After Suharto stepped down, ending more than three decades of kleptocratic rule, Mr. Prabowo was unceremoniously discharged from the army on allegations of repeatedly breaking the law, violating human rights and disobeying orders. However, like other high-ranking officials accused of committing atrocities and rights violations, he was never charged or put on trial. To the dismay of human rights advocates, he and others accused of abuses received important posts in subsequent democratically elected governments and have never been held accountable. Mr. Prabowo, who once saw himself as a possible successor to his father-in-law, made four unsuccessful attempts to win election as president of Indonesia, the most recent in 2019. In a surprise move, the president who twice defeated him, Joko Widodo, named him minister of defense a year ago this month. Mr. Joko’s apparent goal in appointing him was to build support among the major political parties in Parliament as he pushed through his economic agenda. Less than two months later, Mr. Prabowo hired a Washington lobbyist, James N. Frinzi, to represent him, according to a form Mr. Frinzi filed under the United States Foreign Agents Registration Act. The document provides no information about the purpose of his lobbying. This year, Mr. Prabowo quietly received the invitation from Mr. Esper, and the State Department issued him a visa. Mr. Irawan, the spokesman, said that Mr. Prabowo recognized the United States’ “critical role in maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region” and that the trip was aimed at “exploring how our two militaries can work together in the future to ensure our mutual interests are protected.” “America is an important country,” Mr. Prabowo said before his departure. “I am invited. I have to fulfill the invitation.” The human rights groups questioned whether the visa gave Mr. Prabowo immunity in the United States and, if so, urged that it be rescinded. If he did not receive immunity, they said, the United States would be obligated to investigate whether he was criminally responsible for torture and possibly bring him to trial or extradite him. “We urge you to clarify that the visa issued to Prabowo Subianto does not extend any form of immunity to him, and to ensure that if he does travel to the U.S., he is properly and promptly investigated, and if there is sufficient evidence, brought to trial for his alleged responsibility for crimes under international law,” the groups said in their letter to Mr. Pompeo. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, an Indonesian rights organization, expressed its disappointment with the decision to allow Mr. Prabowo’s visit and said it would hinder continuing efforts to secure justice for the victims of human rights abuses. “This legitimization by the United States government helps the Indonesian government, and especially Prabowo himself, avoid resolution of past cases of gross human rights violations that involve his name,” said the group’s chairwoman, Fatia Maulidiyanti.

"Nearly 900,000 people in the U.S. filed new state unemployment claims last week.",2020-10-15,By Nelson D. Schwartz,"['American employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate as a resurgent coronavirus and the absence of new federal aid take a toll on economic growth. The Labor Department reported Thursday that 885,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, an increase from the previous week. That figure is not adjusted for seasonal variations. After dropping in late spring and early summer as pandemic-related lockdowns eased, new claims for state jobless benefits had been steadily totaling about 800,000 a week, far above the level in previous recessions. “The numbers are extremely worrisome, in my opinion, and they point to a labor market that is struggling to make progress,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Over the past month, large employers including United Airlines, Disney and Allstate announced tens of thousands of layoffs, and more are expected as sectors like leisure and hospitality struggle. In some states, restaurants have salvaged some business by serving diners outside, but many will lose that option as temperatures fall. Despite the widespread economic pain, Republicans and Democrats in Washington have been unable to agree on a new relief package, a failure that may cause the economy to slow further in the coming months. Federal benefits created in March to supplement state payments to the unemployed are set to expire by the end of the year. A jump in coronavirus cases in the Midwest and Western states has stirred fears of renewed lockdowns even as layoffs by large employers batter the work force. “The course of the virus determines the course of the economy,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. “You can’t fully reopen with the contagion so high.”']",

Singapore currently requires travelers from Hong Kong to quarantine for seven days after arrival. “Both our cities have low incidence of Covid-19 cases and have put in place robust mechanisms to manage and control Covid-19,” Singapore’s travel minister, Ong Ye Kung, said in a statement. Hong Kong’s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, called the agreement “a milestone in our efforts to resume normalcy while fighting against the long-drawn battle of Covid-19.” Singapore and Hong Kong have both been reporting daily new cases in the single or double digits since late August. Efforts to establish reciprocal travel bubbles in Asia and other parts of the world have been halting as case numbers fluctuate and new outbreaks emerge. Starting Friday, Australia will waive quarantine requirements for travelers from New Zealand, which recently stamped out the virus for a second time, though New Zealand will still require quarantine for travelers arriving from Australia. Singapore has also lifted restrictions on general visitors from Brunei, Vietnam, New Zealand and Australia except for the state of Victoria, the center of the outbreak there. But all four of those countries are still closed to almost all foreigners, and in the case of Brunei and Australia residents must apply for permission to leave the country as well. In other global developments: The European Parliament announced on Thursday that it would cancel a meeting scheduled to be held next week in Strasbourg, in northern France, as the outbreak widens. The meeting would have been its first in-person session in Strasbourg since the start of the pandemic. Belgium, where most parliamentary staff and members are based, is also seeing a sharp rise in cases. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, went into quarantine for a second time in two weeks after being exposed to the virus. She tweeted on Thursday that she had tested negative, but a member of her office had tested positive. She wrote that she was leaving a European Council meeting in Brussels that was being held with strict social-distancing measures. Portugal announced new virus restrictions on Thursday, including a five-person limit on public gatherings, after a rise in new cases. In Spain, which is seeing an even sharper increase, the city of Salamanca, famous for its 12th-century university, became the latest area to be cut off from the rest of the country, under new lockdown restrictions imposed by the regional government. The restrictions take effect on Saturday. Two officials in Qingdao, China, have been fired amid a new virus outbreak there, the city government said on Thursday. The director of the health commission and the president of the Qingdao Chest Hospital are under investigation after six confirmed infections and six asymptomatic cases were linked to the hospital. The new cases are the first local transmissions China had reported in almost two months.  The weekly number of new cases in Europe is now at its highest point since the start of the pandemic, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s director for Europe, said on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases rose by one million to seven million in just 10 days, and the number of daily deaths passed 1,000 for the first time in months. Many European countries are adopting stricter controls, which Dr. Kluge called “absolutely necessary,” as increased caseloads are raising fears of another surge as winter approaches. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading, putting the country on track to have the largest reported caseload in the world in the coming weeks. It’s also the start of the fall pollution season, and doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die.']",
‘This Is a War’: Cross-Border Fight Over Water Erupts in Mexico,2020-10-14,By Natalie Kitroeff,"['BOQUILLA, Mexico — The farmers armed themselves with sticks, rocks and homemade shields, ambushed hundreds of soldiers guarding a dam and seized control of one of the border region’s most important bodies of water. The Mexican government was sending water — their water — to Texas, leaving them next to nothing for their thirsty crops, the farmers said. So they took over the dam and have refused to allow any of the water to flow to the United States for more than a month. “This is a war,” said Victor Velderrain, a grower who helped lead the takeover, “to survive, to continue working, to feed my family.” The standoff is the culmination of longstanding tensions over water between the United States and Mexico that have recently exploded into violence, pitting Mexican farmers against their own president and the global superpower next door. Negotiating the exchange of water between the two countries has long been strained, but rising temperatures and long droughts have made the shared rivers along the border more valuable than ever, intensifying the stakes for both nations. The dam’s takeover is a stark example of how far people are willing to go to defend livelihoods threatened by climate change — and of the kind of conflict that may become more common with increasingly extreme weather. Along the arid border region, water rights are governed by a decades-old treaty that compels the United States and Mexico to share the flows of the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers, with each side sending water to the other. Mexico has fallen far behind on its obligations to the United States and is now facing a deadline to deliver the water this month. But this has been one of the driest years in the last three decades for Chihuahua, the Mexican border state responsible for sending the bulk of the water Mexico owes. Its farmers have rebelled, worried that losing any more water will rob them of a chance for a healthy harvest next year. “These tensions, these tendencies, are already there, and they’re just made so much worse by climate change,” said Christopher Scott, a professor of water resources policy at the University of Arizona. “They are in a fight for their lives, because no water, no agriculture; no agriculture, no rural communities.” Since February, when federal forces first occupied the dam to ensure water deliveries to the United States continued, activists in Chihuahua have burned government buildings, destroyed cars and briefly held a group of politicians hostage. For weeks, they’ve blocked a major railroad used to ferry industrial goods between Mexico and the United States. Their revolt has alarmed farmers and politicians in Texas. Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, appealed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month, demanding that he persuade Mexico to deliver the water by the deadline next week, or risk inflicting pain on American farmers. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has repeatedly bent to President Trump’s demands on immigration, has vowed that his country will make good on its water obligations to the United States — whether the state of Chihuahua likes it or not. He sent hundreds of members of the National Guard to protect Chihuahua’s dams, and his government temporarily froze bank accounts belonging to the city where many of the protesters live. For farmers, the government’s stance is a betrayal. Mr. Velderrain, 42, said he never saw himself as the type of person who would lead hundreds over a hill to overwhelm a group of soldiers protecting a cache of automatic weapons. But there he was in a video posted on Facebook, escorting a Mexican general out of the Boquilla Dam on the day he led the takeover.  Surprised and heavily outnumbered, the National Guard quickly surrendered. Later that day, one protester was shot and killed by the National Guard. “We have always dedicated ourselves to work; we’ve never been known as protesters,” Mr. Velderrain said back on his farm, shucking an ear of corn that wasn’t quite ready for harvest. “What happened at the Boquilla dam was impressive, because we took off our farmer clothes and put on the uniform of guerrilla fighters.” The federal government argues that the protesting farmers are also hurting other Mexicans by preventing water from flowing to their compatriots downstream, and that the growers would still have access to at least 60 percent of the water they need for next year. “Agriculture, like any other profession, has risks,” said Blanca Jiménez, the head of Mexico’s National Water Commission. “One of the risks is that there are years when it rains more and years when it rains less.” With the intensity of the drought in Chihuahua this year, Mexico has fallen far behind on its water shipments to the United States. It now has to send more than 50 percent of its average annual water payment in a matter of weeks. The Mexican government insists it will still comply, despite the takeover of the dam, which spans the Conchos River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande. But some Texans have their doubts. “It’s just not going to happen, unless a storm develops and helps Mexico, which is normally what they count on,” said Sonny Hinojosa, the general manager of an irrigation district in Hidalgo County, Texas. “They gamble and hope that a storm or mother nature will bail them out.” Texans also contend that, on balance, Mexico benefits more from the water-sharing agreement between the two countries, signed in 1944, than they do. Mr. Abbott, the state’s governor, has pointed out that the United States sends Mexico about four times as much water as it receives from its neighbor. The treaty doesn’t punish either side for shirking its duties but, eager to avoid conflict, Mexico is scrambling to find a way to meet its water obligations as the deadline nears. One of the likeliest solutions is that Mexico will hand over a significant amount of the water it owns in reservoirs, normally used by more than a dozen Mexican cities. In exchange, Mexico has asked the United States to lend it drinking water for those cities, if Mexico ends up running out. Part of the problem, scientists say, is that Mexico’s need for water has grown since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, as more people settled in the country’s dry border region and agricultural production ramped up to satisfy American consumers. Francisco Marta, a 23-year-old who manages his father’s corn and alfalfa fields, suspects that his fellow farmers don’t have the Mexican president’s sympathies in the water dispute because they are generally not members of his poor and working class political base. The farmers live in the north, traditionally a stronghold of the conservative opposition against Mr. López Obrador, who ran on a leftist platform. “He believes that we are rich and that nothing will happen to us if we don’t work next year, but that’s not true,"" Mr. Marta said. “I myself will migrate if I don’t have anywhere to work here.” Mr. López Obrador has accused politicians and “big agriculture” of fomenting strife in Chihuahua, which, he said at a recent news conference, “has nothing to do with small farmers.” But Jéssica Silva, 35, the protester who was killed the day the farmers took the Boquilla Dam, didn’t have a farm of her own, her parents said. She and her husband, Jaime Torres, rented about 22 acres of pecan trees and helped her parents cultivate an even smaller plot. “She had so many plans,” said Ms. Silva’s mother, Justina Zamarripa, tears falling into the creases of her cheeks. The National Guard shot Ms. Silva several times in the back through the window of her husband’s truck. He was wounded but survived.  “She was defending what belongs to us,” said her father, José Luis Silva.  In a photo her parents have of the two just after the attack, Ms. Silva is slumped over in the passenger seat, wearing her seatbelt and a mask to protect against the coronavirus. “She was always so cautious,” her mother said.']",
"While Boris Johnson Sinks, Rishi Sunak Is on the Rise",2020-10-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Breakfast starts at 8 a.m. and guests help themselves to croissants and juice before the sleek figure of Rishi Sunak, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, works his way around the crowded, oak-paneled dining room of his official London home, No. 11 Downing Street. For Mr. Sunak, meetings with groups of Conservative Party lawmakers help him reach out and forge a network of support in Parliament. For the lawmakers, it’s a chance to meet someone many expect to one day move next door — to No. 10, the prime minister’s home. Virtually unknown 10 months ago, Mr. Sunak’s vertiginous rise has surprised almost everyone in British politics — in all likelihood even the man who promoted him, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose approval ratings have plummeted during the pandemic. “Rishi Sunak has the strengths that the prime minister so conspicuously lacks, not only basic competence, but a grasp of detail,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, “and no one has mounted such an obvious, in-your-face social media campaign as Rishi Sunak.” It seems to be working. A recent poll of party members by the ConservativeHome website placed Mr. Sunak, 40, easily top of cabinet satisfaction ratings, while Mr. Johnson was almost bottom of the list. Contrast that with a survey Professor Bale conducted last December in which Conservative Party members were asked who should take over were Mr. Johnson to step aside. “Just five out of 1,191 named Rishi Sunak,” he said, “and I’m not sure that all of them spelt his name correctly.” When he was catapulted into his job in February, after two years as a minister — including six months in the No. 2 job at the Treasury — Mr. Sunak was firmly in the shadow of Mr. Johnson, who had just won a landslide election victory. But while Mr. Johnson has floundered during the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Sunak has been a beacon of calm and competence, intervening swiftly to spend billions of pounds supporting jobs as the economy went into lockdown free fall. With new restrictions coming into force in parts of the country, Mr. Sunak has announced new state support for affected areas and on Monday he gave a fluent defense of his latest measures at a media conference alongside Mr. Johnson. Perhaps wisely, given the speculation about his ambitions, Mr. Sunak tried to burst his own bubble when the Conservative Party held its recent party conference virtually. In a surprisingly short speech, he lavished praise on Mr. Johnson and warned that uncomfortable economic choices lay ahead. The subliminal message seemed to be: You might like me a little less when all this cash has to be paid back. But right now, they like him a lot, and his appeal among nonpartisan Britons has been burnished through slick social media posts on Instagram and Twitter designed around “Brand Rishi.” Allies insist that Mr. Sunak is simply using digital media techniques to communicate more effectively rather than to promote his ambitions. His posts stand out from the drab detritus of political advertising, though. Often they feature a stylish photograph of the chancellor endorsing a policy with his distinctive signature, rather like a sporting celebrity might promote an expensive fitness accessory. This was probably not what Mr. Johnson expected when he promoted Mr. Sunak to take over from Sajid Javid, the previous chancellor who resigned after refusing to accept curbs on his right to hire his own advisers. Mr. Sunak agreed, leading some to speculate that he would be more compliant. In Britain, the relationship between prime minister and chancellor — although a central pivot of government — is often one of rivalry and tension. So the idea in February was to ensure that there was one center of power on economic policy: No. 10 Downing Street. But few prime ministers can afford to fire two chancellors, so Mr. Johnson was taking a risk in appointing someone as adept and diligent as Mr. Sunak. Not only is Mr. Sunak a smooth communicator but, with his Indian heritage, he is a walking success story of modern multiracial Britain. His grandparents, originally from Punjab, arrived in England from British colonial East Africa in the 1960s. As a teenager, he says he suffered racist abuse. “It stung, I still remember, it’s seared in my memory,” he told the BBC, recounting how he had been abused in a restaurant. But while Mr. Javid, his predecessor, was the son of a bus driver from Pakistan, Mr. Sunak’s father was a doctor and his mother ran a pharmacy. Together, they earned enough to send him to an elite private school, Winchester College. Without that expensive education, Mr. Sunak might well still have reached Oxford University (He graduated with top grades.) But his schooling seems to have helped instill the confidence and social polish that has allowed him to move effortlessly through the ranks of the Conservative Party. Before his political career began in earnest, Mr. Sunak also earned an M.B.A. at Stanford University. There, he met his future wife, Akshata Murthy, daughter of Narayana Murthy, the billionaire co-founder of the IT giant Infosys and one of India’s richest men. Mr. Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and two hedge funds before being elected to Parliament in 2015. In the 2016 referendum on European Union membership, he voted to leave. That decision sped his promotion through the ranks, though some hard-line Brexit supporters say that they suspect it was a tactical move and that they believe he is pressing Mr. Johnson to strike a trade deal with the European Union. One of Mr. Sunak’s few political vulnerabilities is his wealth. There was barbed commentary when he was photographed with a $235 “smart mug” that keeps coffee or tea at a precise drinking temperature for up to three hours and when he described working out on an exercise bike that retails at around 10 times that amount. But Mr. Sunak is generally good at avoiding gaffes and is well plugged into the media world. He was the best man at the wedding of a school friend, James Forsyth, and Allegra Stratton. Mr. Forsyth is the political editor of The Spectator, a conservative weekly, and Ms. Stratton is a former journalist and broadcaster. She is currently employed by Mr. Sunak as an adviser but is expected to become the spokeswoman for Mr. Johnson, in which capacity she will conduct televised news conferences. Mr. Sunak’s allies see this as an illustration of the close ties between the Downing Street neighbors. But, while relations appear good at the moment, tensions have surfaced. Last month Mr. Sunak moved to protect the economy by fighting off many lockdown restrictions suggested by scientists advising the government. Those differences are likely to grow. Some day, Britain will have to start to repay its huge pile of debt. Mr. Johnson neither wants to return to austerity nor to raise taxes, but some decision cannot be delayed indefinitely. Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group and a fellow at the London School of Economics, said, “The chancellor has been in the privileged position of playing Father Christmas throughout the pandemic, one of the few politicians bearing gifts rather than taking them away.” “Tax rises are on the horizon,” she added, “and he will soon have to take tough decisions about which industries to prop up and which parts of the electorate to shield from the worst of the pandemic’s economic hit.” Should unemployment rise to levels not seen since the 1980s, Mr. Sunak would surely take at least some of the blame. But, Ms. Gaston noted, he has already shown himself to be an outstanding communicator and a consultative and pragmatic leader. “If his branding can remain strong during the next six months of economic doom and gloom, there can be no limits on the scope of his political ambitions,” she said. So far, Mr. Sunak has successfully distanced himself from the questions over competence that have gathered around Mr. Johnson and much of his cabinet. He has also avoided the culture wars regularly stirred by some of Mr. Johnson’s pugilistic, pro-Brexit advisers, who seem never happier than when attacking the pillars of the establishment. That leaves him neatly positioned as an exponent of a more competent and inclusive type of politics, an enticing package should a vacancy arise next door on Downing Street. “In his position, you can’t afford to look too eager,” Professor Bale of Queen Mary University of London said. “But, on the other hand, you can’t afford to miss your moment when it comes.”']","A virtual unknown 10 months ago, the wealthy and polished British finance chief gained stature during the pandemic, while remaining in his boss’s good graces."
"As Motorcade Rolls By, Thai Royal Family Glimpses the People’s Discontent",2020-10-14,By Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — The cream-colored stretch Rolls-Royce limousine crawled past the angry crowds. The queen of Thailand smiled. But what Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya saw on Wednesday, on a stately road in Bangkok, may have been sobering. Antigovernment protesters yelled “my taxes!,” referring to their personal contributions to royal coffers. The police held them back but could not hide the demonstrators’ defiant salutes. For months now, pro-democracy protesters have gathered by the thousands to call for reforms to the monarchy and military, influential institutions that have dominated Thailand’s power structure for decades. But the royal limousine’s route on Wednesday was the first time that members of the nuclear royal family had gotten such a close look at the faces of Thais who are openly questioning the monarchy’s exalted position in the country. Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun and some of his immediate family — the queen, who is his fourth wife, and his youngest son, the heir apparent — live most of the year in Germany. By Thursday morning, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand, a retired general, had ordered riot police to clear the protesters from their rally site near his offices at Government House, where they had camped out overnight calling for his removal. Officials imposed an emergency decree in Bangkok, and gatherings of five or more people were not permitted. The decree also banned news or online content that “could create fear or intentionally distort information” by compromising national security or damaging peace and order. The government of Mr. Prayuth, who came to power in a 2014 military coup, was also given purview to declare any area off-limits to potential demonstrators. The protesters have vowed to regroup on Thursday afternoon in a busy shopping district. The simple act of a royal motorcade driving near an antigovernment protest, and the swift crackdown that followed, might not seem a watershed moment. But Thailand is no ordinary constitutional monarchy. It is bound by some of the world’s strictest lèse-majesté laws criminalizing criticism of the crown. During public occasions, Thais are expected to stand for an anthem praising some of the richest royals on the planet. When politicians are given an audience with the king, they typically prostrate themselves and crawl forward in a sideways slither. But as the protest movement has strengthened over the past three months, taboos surrounding the monarchy have fallen in rapid succession. In Parliament, opposition legislators are demanding an investigation of royal budgets. (After his father’s death in 2016, King Maha Vajiralongkorn took personal control of the crown’s assets.) In cinemas, people no longer feel obliged to stand for a photo montage of the king that precedes each screening. And protesters, old and young alike, have demanded that the 10th king of the Chakri Dynasty, who was formally crowned last year with a 16-pound Great Crown of Victory, not be positioned above the country’s Constitution. “We are going to fight for democracy, fight for freedom, fight for the equality of us as human beings,” a protest leader popularly known as Justin Samutprakan said on Wednesday. “We will not bow, prostrate, crawl ever again.” “As humans, no one is bigger than anyone,” he added. “No one has power more than others.” Dozens of protest leaders, many students, have been arrested in recent weeks and charged with crimes like sedition that carry imprisonment for up to seven years. Early on Thursday, at least three protest leaders, Arnon Nampa, Parit Chirawat and Panupong Jadnok, were arrested, according to the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group. Each had been arrested before. The rally on Wednesday also brought out large numbers of royalist counterprotesters in yellow shirts symbolizing their loyalty to the king. Some had the matching buzz cuts often worn by members of the security forces, suggesting that their defense of the Thai crown was an official duty rather than a personal mission. As the crowds for both sides swelled on Wednesday, some people in a country conditioned to regular bouts of political violence feared that clashes might break out. But aside from a few scuffles, the antigovernment rally, which pushed past barricades to march toward Government House, was peaceful. Before the police swept away the protesters on Thursday, the protesters had planned to stay on the streets for at least three days. King Maha Vajiralongkorn is now back in Bangkok for weeks, a rarity for a monarch who normally spends no more than a couple days in the country he reigns over. Last week, Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, called into question the Thai king’s engagement in politics while living in Germany. “We have made it clear that politics concerning Thailand should not be conducted from German soil,” said Mr. Maas in a parliamentary session. Street protests have regularly gripped Thailand over the past two decades. The security crackdowns on some of those mass rallies have been bloody, with dozens of people killed. Over the past few years, outspoken dissidents who fled overseas after criticizing the monarchy and the military have disappeared. Some of their bodies have washed up with obvious signs of foul play. “Thailand’s international friends should call on the government to stop arresting peaceful protesters, listen to their views, and allow them to freely and safely express their visions for the future,” Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The security presence on Wednesday was formidable. About 15,000 police were dispatched to the protest area near Democracy Monument, built to commemorate the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Public buses were parked to block the path toward Government House. Thai political history is littered with army coups that have nullified the results of national elections. The junta leaders that conceived of the past two putsches justified their actions as necessary to protect the monarchy from naysayers. The last coup, in 2014, was followed by the passage of an army-drafted Constitution that has eroded democratic institutions further. The Senate, for instance, is now entirely appointed. The protesters have called for a new charter and for fresh elections, after a national vote last year that was dismissed by some international observers as neither free nor fair. “We have been imprisoned in a special prison called Thailand for a long time,” said Attapon Buapat, another protest speaker. The protest movement has woven together disparate strands of dissatisfaction, ranging from frustration with school uniform rules to anger at the lavish lifestyle of the king at a time when a coronavirus ban on international tourism has hit Thailand’s economy hard. The date of the protest on Wednesday evoked a student-led uprising on Oct. 14, 1973 that led to the toppling of a military dictatorship. During the turmoil, under the reign of the current king’s father, the gates to one of the royal palaces were opened to shelter students fleeing the gunfire. Three years later, however, security forces and paramilitary mobs killed scores of student protesters. Right-wing rule was restored to Thailand. On Wednesday evening, after dark fell, a group of protesters tried to extend part of the rally toward a royal palace. But rows of yellow-shirted royalists stood guard. The protesters fell back. By Thursday morning, they were all gone. Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, a protest leader who has been one of the fiercest critics of the monarchy’s role in Thai society, even as she has cautioned that she does not want the royal institution overthrown, said on Thursday morning that the right to free assembly should be guaranteed in a democracy. “It is the fundamental right of all human beings from birth,” said Ms. Panusaya, who was arrested later Thursday morning. “The emergency decree could be interpreted as the monarchy setting itself up as an opponent of democracy.”']","As antigovernment protesters took to the streets, officials imposed an emergency decree in Bangkok, and gatherings of five or more people were banned."
He Built a Trump Statue and Worshiped It. Then He Collapsed.,2020-10-14,By Shalini Venugopal Bhagat and Mike Ives,"['NEW DELHI — In India, where throngs admire President Trump, one rural farmer worshiped him like a god, praying to a life-size statue of Mr. Trump in his backyard every morning. His village’s headman said that the young farmer, Bussa Krishna, had been drawn to Mr. Trump’s “straightforward ways and blunt speech.” When Mr. Trump announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus, it devastated Mr. Krishna. The farmer posted a tearful video on Facebook, in which he said: “I feel very sad that my god, Trump, has contracted the coronavirus. I ask everyone to pray for his speedy recovery.” He stopped eating to show solidarity with his idol’s suffering from Covid-19, his family said. He fell into a deep depression. On Sunday, he died of cardiac arrest. Mr. Krishna’s devotion had made him into a minor celebrity in his country, and he was the subject of national headlines. His death made news across India. One of his cousins, Vivek Bukka, said that Mr. Krishna had been physically fit and had no health problems or history of heart disease. There is no evidence linking Mr. Krishna’s death to his fasting. There is no indication that the White House or Mr. Trump — who said he had recovered from the virus and felt “powerful” after being treated with a cocktail of drugs — was aware of his biggest fan in India. Many of the country’s urban intellectuals dislike the American president, and he is regularly mocked on Indian social media platforms. But Mr. Trump has broad support among Indians: A February study by the Pew Research Center found that 56 percent of people surveyed in India said that Mr. Trump would “do the right thing when it comes to world affairs,” up from 16 percent when he was elected. Mr. Trump’s popularity in some parts of India is notable because the cult of personality he has tried to cultivate — an unapologetically brash figure leading the United States to a bright new future while espousing “America First” — mirrors how India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, projects himself to his own supporters. Mr. Krishna, a widowed farmer in his 30s who lived in the village of Konne in the southern state of Telangana, had been a Trump devotee for about four years. He became a fan when the president appeared to him in a dream, his relatives said, and predicted that India’s national cricket squad would beat its archrival, Pakistan, in a match the next day. India won, “and from that day he started worshiping Donald Trump,” said Mr. Vivek, Mr. Krishna’s cousin. “At first everyone in the family thought he was mentally disturbed, but he kept at it and everyone eventually came around,” Mr. Vivek said. The farmer deeply admired the president as a leader, said Mr. Vivek, 25, who lives near the southern city of Hyderabad. Neighbors did not know much about American politics and had no opinion of Mr. Trump, he added. But since Mr. Krishna was such a huge fan, they embraced his cause as a courtesy, even if it struck them as a little odd. As Mr. Krishna’s devotion to Mr. Trump intensified, he began fasting every Friday, and he commissioned the construction of a shrine in his backyard with the life-size statue, Mr. Vivek said. He worshiped it with Hindu rituals for an hour or two each morning, as one might when praying to Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha or other gods in the Hindu pantheon. One video of Mr. Krishna that has circulated widely online shows him performing a prayer ritual, or pooja, before an altar that holds a picture of Mr. Trump. In another, he wears a T-shirt that reads “Trump” in white block letters as he pours water over the head of the statue, which is wearing a red tie and a garland of fresh flowers, and giving a thumbs-up.  Mr. Krishna’s obsession with Mr. Trump echoes that of people in other countries. In Afghanistan, a couple named their third child Donald Trump. The father admired the tycoon in Mr. Trump. But later, saying he no longer felt safe as a Trump supporter, he and his family fled Afghanistan. Mr. Krishna’s creation of a statue of Mr. Trump is also not unique. An architect built a giant wooden statue of Mr. Trump with vampire’s teeth in Slovenia, the native country of the first lady, Melania Trump. Some critics denounced it as a “waste of wood.” That statue’s creator, Tomaz Schlegl, an architect, told Reuters, “I want to alert people to the rise of populism, and it would be difficult to find a bigger populist in this world than Donald Trump.” A life-size wooden sculpture of Mrs. Trump, meanwhile, near the town of Sevnica, Slovenia, was set on fire. The commissioning artist replaced it with a bronze statue. As for Mr. Krishna, he made a valiant attempt to meet his idol. He traveled to the United States Embassy in New Delhi ahead of Mr. Trump’s trip to India in February to try to arrange a meeting, said Vemula Venkat Goud, the headman of Mr. Krishna’s village. “It’s really sad that his dream never came true,” he added. Mr. Krishna kept the faith until the end. When he learned of Mr. Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis, he locked himself in his room, Mr. Vivek said. “We tried to force him to eat, but he barely ate anything,” he said. On Sunday, Mr. Krishna collapsed, and his relatives took him to the hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Mr. Krishna is survived by his parents and his 7-year-old son. The village headman said his neighbors were discussing how best to maintain their neighbor’s Trump shrine. Shalini Venugopal Bhagat reported from New Delhi, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong. S.M. Bilal contributed reporting from Hyderabad, India.']","Bussa Krishna, a farmer who called President Trump his god, stopped eating after Mr. Trump became infected with the coronavirus, his family said.

Jewelry Ad Featuring Interfaith Couple Sparks Outrage in India,2020-10-13,By Geneva Abdul,"['An Indian jewelry brand withdrew an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple after Hindu nationalists accused the company of “love jihad,” a pejorative used to describe marriage between Muslim men and Hindu women in India. The forty-three second ad, released last week, featured a pregnant woman in a sari, making her way through a luminous home to a garden prepared for her baby shower. The advertisement, since removed from Facebook and YouTube, was described by the jeweler, Tanishq, as a “beautiful confluence of two different religions, traditions and cultures,” reported the BBC. It was meant to promote a new jewelry collection called “Ekatvam,” a Sanskrit word that translates as “oneness.” “Beautiful things happen when people come together,” reads a description on the company’s website, including the slogan: “The beauty of oneness. One as humanity. One as a nation.” But on social media, the ad quickly created fault lines, and #BoycottTanishq soon topped Twitter trends. “Why are you showing a Hindu ‘daughter-in-law’ to a Muslim family and glorifying it,” Khemchand Sharma, a member of the country’s governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, asked on Twitter. Mr. Sharma accused the company of love jihad, and of favoring one faith over another. “Why don’t you show a Muslim daughter-in-law in your ads with a Hindu family?” “Love jihad” is a term coined by right-wing Hindu nationalists who have accused India’s Muslim minority of persuading Hindu women into marriage to convert them to Islam. The term was previously used by Yogi Adityanath, also a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who was later reprimanded for hate speech. Shashi Tharoor, one of the country’s most influential opposition politicians, pushed back against the ad’s critics. “If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” Mr. Tharoor wrote on Twitter. Others said it was “foolish” of the company to “bow down” to online trolls, and described the removal of the ad as a “very sad state of affairs.” Chetan Bhagat, an Indian author, tweeted for Tanishq to “Keep the ad. Stay Strong. Stay Indian.” In a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, the company said that the ad was meant to “celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life,” and that the severe reactions to it were “contrary to its very objective.” The ad was removed to protect the “well being of our employees, partners and store staff,” according to the company’s statement. Interfaith relationships are very rare in India, and when they do exist, they create additional social pressures, said Amit Thorat, an assistant professor at the Center for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University. A survey that Mr. Thorat helped conduct found that only 5 percent of marriages in India are intercaste. A 2016 survey found that a majority of people opposed marriages across both caste and religion. “Society is not ready, the social protection which is required from the state is just not there,” said Mr. Thorat. “And the environment which we have right now, a kind of a Hindu religious fundamentalist kind of government, it’s going to be that much more difficult.” Critics argue that policies enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have fanned religious hatred. Muslims make up around 14 percent of the population in India while Hindus account for roughly 74 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people. The centuries-old practice of arranged marriages is still common and interreligious couples often face threats and violence. India’s Muslim minority has been increasingly demonized in the pandemic. The health ministry has blamed Muslims for spreading the virus across the country, which now has more than seven million cases. Following a crackdown in Kashmir and a new, contested citizenship law, Muslims have also faced a wave of violence in recent months. In 2018, India’s Supreme Court upheld the right of citizens to choose their spouse and convert to another religion. The ruling was considered a blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party, leading right-wing Hindu nationalists to embrace the term “love jihad.”']",The jeweler withdrew its forty-three second advertisement after Hindu nationalists accused the company of promoting “love jihad” on social media.
July is the new January: More companies delay a return to the office.,2020-10-13,By Gillian Friedman and Kellen Browning,"['When the coronavirus pandemic closed offices around the United States in March, many companies told their employees that it would be a short hiatus. Workers, they said, would be back in cubicles within a matter of weeks. Weeks turned into September. Then September turned into January. And now, with the virus still surging in some parts of the country, a growing number of employers are delaying return-to-office dates once again, to the summer of 2021. Google was one of the first to announce that July 2021 was its return date. Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon followed. In the past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor and The New York Times said they, too, had postponed the return of in-person work to next summer and acknowledged the inevitable: The pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon. Many more companies are expected to delay their return-to-office dates to keep workers safe. And workers said they were in no rush to go back, with 73 percent of U.S. employees fearing that being in their workplace could pose a risk to their personal health and safety, according to a study by Wakefield Research commissioned by Envoy, a workplace technology company. More companies are also saying that they will institute permanent work-from-home policies. In May, Facebook was one of the first to announce that it would allow many employees to work remotely even after the pandemic. Twitter, Coinbase, Shopify and Microsoft have also said they would do so. The postponement of return dates is a “psychological blow for those who expected this to be a transition phase,” said Tsedal Neeley, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. “The reality is hitting that, ‘There won’t be a vaccine as I expected very quickly. This is going to be my life, and I’d better learn how to do this.’”']",
"Europe, Which Thought It Had the Virus Tamed, Faces a Resurgence",2020-10-14,By Mark Landler,"['Follow our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic here. LONDON — From France to Russia, from Britain to the Czech Republic, European leaders are confronting a surge in coronavirus cases that is rapidly filling hospital beds, driving up death tolls and raising the grim prospect of further lockdowns in countries already traumatized by the pandemic. The continent, which once compared favorably to the United States in its handling of the pandemic, is being engulfed by a second wave of infection. With an average of more than 100,000 new infections per day over the past week, Europe now accounts for about one-third of new cases reported worldwide. In the most vivid sign of the deteriorating situation, President Emmanuel Macron of France on Wednesday imposed a curfew of 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the Paris region and eight other metropolitan areas, beginning on Saturday. “The virus is everywhere in France,” he told the French public, as he declared a state of emergency. The resurgence has prompted officials to close bars and clubs in Prague and Liverpool, and to make face masks mandatory in public indoor spaces in Amsterdam. In Russia, which reported its largest daily increase in infections on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin sought refuge from the torrent of bad news by announcing that his government had approved a second vaccine. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany better captured the anxious mood when she said on Tuesday, “I am watching with great concern the renewed increase in infection numbers in almost every part of Europe.” Ms. Merkel added, “We mustn’t throw away what we achieved via restrictions over the past months.” To some extent, Europe’s setback is hardly a surprise. Public health experts have long warned that the virus could roar back when the days grew colder, driving people indoors, where the risk of transmission is far greater. In several European countries, lockdowns were lifted abruptly, sowing complacency among people who felt they could return to their normal lives. In the face of intense political pressures, European leaders have been reluctant to impose new, economically damaging lockdowns, often opting for the lightest possible measures. For Germany and a handful of its neighbors, this second wave is particularly demoralizing because they had navigated the first wave relatively well. In late June, revelers in Prague celebrated the end of the outbreak with a dinner party stretching across the Charles Bridge. Spain and Italy, which were hard hit in March and April, threw open their doors to vacationers in July and August. Now, with these countries experiencing an alarming spread of the virus, the carefree days of summer are a distant memory. On Wednesday, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron announced a raft of nationwide restrictions in their countries, ranging from the closing of bars and restaurants to the mandatory use of masks. The curfews in Paris and other French cities, including Lyon, Toulouse and Marseille, will last at least four weeks. “We haven’t lost control,” Mr. Macron insisted. “We are in a situation that is worrying that justifies being neither inactive nor panicked.” Germany reported 5,132 new infections on Tuesday, up from 2,639 a week earlier; France reported 120,000 new cases over the past seven days, one of the highest rates in the world. French officials warned that in the Paris region, intensive care units would be 70 percent to 90 percent filled with Covid-19 patients by the end of the month. The surge in cases has thrown into disarray Mr. Macron’s plan to shift his focus to economic recovery, with a fiscal stimulus plan worth 100 billion euros ($117 billion). “All of the government’s strategy is destabilized,” said Jérôme Fourquet, a political analyst at the IFOP polling institute. Mr. Macron’s ambitions, he said, were “colliding with the necessity to put out the fire, from a health standpoint.” In the Spanish region of Catalonia, where cases have risen 40 percent in the past week, the authorities closed bars and restaurants for 15 days, except for takeout food. Shops were told to limit their traffic to 30 percent of capacity. “We are in an extremely complicated situation,” the acting regional leader of Catalonia, Pere Aragonès, said on Twitter. In the Navarre region in northern Spain, which has in recent days superseded Madrid as the area with the country’s highest official infection rate, new restrictions came into force on Tuesday that included closing playgrounds and outdoors sports areas, as well forcing restaurants to close at 10 p.m. In the Netherlands, where the number of cases almost doubled this week to 44,000, the government announced a limited lockdown. After 10 p.m. on Wednesday, all bars and restaurants will be closed for at least four weeks. Gatherings will be limited to 30 people, while most sports events will be halted. In an about-face, Prime Minister Mark Rutte issued “strong advice” for people to wear masks inside public places. The Dutch authorities had long said that masks provided a false sense of security, emphasizing other forms of social distancing. Mr. Rutte said his government would seek to make them legally obligatory. The aversion to masks, experts say, could help explain why the Netherlands is suffering such a serious spike, despite being wealthy and well-organized, with one of the best health care systems in the world. It also has a lack of testing capacity, which has prompted the Dutch to consider hiring labs in Abu Dhabi. “Despite spending large amounts of money, they couldn’t get these things done,” said Sheila Sitalsing, a columnist for the newspaper De Volkskrant. “The problem is with our management, although of course also many ordinary people have ignored obvious health rules.” In Britain, which has suffered the greatest number of virus deaths in Europe, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has walked a tightrope between scientific advisers who are pushing for another nationwide lockdown and members of his Conservative Party who warn that such a draconian response would wreck the economy. On Monday, Mr. Johnson rolled out a three-tier system of restrictions. Though the government initially put only put hard-hit Liverpool in the highest-level tier, other cities, like Manchester, are likely to be added soon. The opposition Labour Party and medical experts are urging Mr. Johnson to impose a two-week shutdown, which experts have dubbed a “circuit breaker,” to arrest the virus, which is now spreading from the north of England across the country. “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to look at that and realize you’re going to end up with the majority of people living under more severe restrictions,” said Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Other parts of the United Kingdom are already taking strong measures. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland announced it would begin a four-week lockdown, and close schools for two weeks. It is reporting an average of nearly 900 new daily cases this week, compared to just over 100 during the height of the first wave in mid-April. “This is deeply troubling, and more steps are urgently needed,” said Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s First Minister, as she announced the new restrictions. Wales announced that it would bar entry to people coming from other parts of the United Kingdom with high infection rates. Among European countries, only Russia has put the emphasis on positive developments. But its new vaccine, like an earlier one that Mr. Putin announced in August as world-beating triumph for Russian science, has yet to complete critical, late-stage clinical trials to determine safety and effectiveness. Tatiana Golikova, a deputy prime minister coordinating Russia’s response to the pandemic, said the new vaccine had so far been tested on only 100 volunteers. Ms. Golikova, who said she had been injected herself and “did not feel any complications,” added that trials would now be carried out across the country with 40,000 volunteers. News of the vaccine led news reports on state-controlled television, obscuring news earlier in the day that Russia had recorded 14,231 new infections, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. The spike has been particularly sharp in Moscow, which reported 4,573 new cases on Wednesday. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered schools to switch to distance learning for grades six through 11. Moscow schools reopened in early September but a month later, students were told to take an unscheduled two-week vacation to try to slow the spread. On Tuesday, Russia’s deputy health minister, Oleg Gridnev, said hospital beds for virus patients were nearly 90 percent occupied. But Mr. Putin, speaking Wednesday by from the country residence where he has sheltered for much of the last seven months, insisted there was no shortage yet of beds. The data “suggests that the situation in Russia, although quite tense and difficult, is nevertheless under control,” Mr. Putin said. Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden, Constant Méheut and Antonella Francini in Paris, Andrew Higgins in Moscow, Thomas Erdbrink in Amsterdam, Megan Specia in London, Christopher F. Schuetze in Berlin, and Raphael Minder in Madrid.']","France imposed a curfew on Paris and other major cities, and other countries are taking similar steps as record caseloads fill hospitals and governments try to respond without lockdowns."
Court Sentences Leaders of Greece’s Golden Dawn to Prison,2020-10-14,By Niki Kitsantonis,"['ATHENS — An Athens court sentenced the leaders of Greece’s Golden Dawn party to 13 years in prison on Wednesday, a week after declaring the neo-fascist party a criminal organization in a landmark verdict that wrapped up one of the most important political trials in the country’s modern history. Last week, the court convicted the party leaders of crimes related to a campaign of attacks against migrants and leftist critics in 2012 and 2013. At the end of a trial that lasted more than five years, the party was tied to a string of attacks, including the fatal stabbing in 2013 of a left-wing rapper, Pavlos Fyssas. Giorgos Roupakias, a party member convicted of murdering Mr. Fyssas, received the harshest sentence, life plus 10 years. The court could still suspend some of the sentences. The convictions were widely seen in Greece as a final blow to Golden Dawn — which lost all of its seats in Parliament in general elections last year, as the trial gradually eroded its popularity — though the sentences fell short of what some observers and opponents had been expecting. The sentences “do not seem to me as appropriately severe as one might have expected,” said Seraphim Seferiades, an associate professor of politics and history at Panteion University in Athens. Many of the group’s opponents jubilantly posted on Twitter under a hashtag in Greek that translates to “jail the nazis.” In English, #jail_golden_dawn was trending, too. But there was also disappointment that the court did not impose the maximum of 15 years in prison for leading a criminal organization. In all, the court convicted 50 people of membership in a criminal organization — 18 of them former politicians for Golden Dawn, including its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos. In addition to Mr. Roupakias’s conviction, five other party supporters or members were found guilty of the attempted murders of three Egyptian fishermen in 2012. Four others were convicted of causing bodily harm in assaults on members of Greece’s Communist Party trade union in 2013. Thanassis Kampagiannis, the lawyer for the Egyptian fishermen, said on Facebook that the sentences for Golden Dawn’s leadership are “high but not as strict as they could be” while the terms for party members and for the perpetrators of individual crimes “are lower than appropriate.” Mr. Michaloliakos and five other former members of Parliament for Golden Dawn were all sentenced to 13 years in prison. One other former lawmaker who was among the party leaders was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The group’s remaining 11 former lawmakers to be sentenced received prison terms of five to seven years. “Today’s sentencing of the neo-Nazi organization demonstrates the resilience of our democracy and the rule of law,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote on Twitter. “This verdict marks the end of a traumatic period in Greece’s history.” Before the sentencing, defense attorneys had urged the court to consider mitigating circumstances, citing good character, lawful behavior and, in some cases, their clients’ marriages to foreign women. The party’s leadership was arrested in September 2013, a few days after the killing of Mr. Fyssas — the first time a leader of a Greek political party and its members of Parliament were arrested since the fall of the country’s military dictatorship in 1974. Some of them served the legal maximum of 18 months in pretrial custody and were then released in early 2015 — time that will be deducted from their sentences. After the sentences were announced, the court was to deliberate on whether to suspend any of them, a decision that may not come until Thursday. If the court deems any of those convicted not to be a flight risk, it might allow their sentences to be suspended pending the outcome of their appeals. The arrests of those who were convicted will be ordered, if necessary, after the court makes its announcement on whether to suspend the sentences. Golden Dawn’s fall was as spectacular as its rise. It was catapulted from obscurity into the front line of Greek politics at the peak of the country’s financial crisis in 2012-2013 by tapping into public discontent over austerity measures and a growing influx of migrants. In a post on Twitter last week, Mr. Michaloliakos, the party’s leader, said Greeks would remember Golden Dawn “when illegal immigrants are the majority in Greece, when they concede earth and water to Turkey, when millions of Greeks are unemployed on the streets.” He was referring to arrivals of migrants from Turkey and a recent political crisis between the two neighbors over longstanding territorial disagreements and corresponding energy rights. Mr. Michaloliakos insisted that the party was the victim of a witch hunt. Mr. Seferiades said a failure by successive governments to alleviate the impact of years of austerity, and by the European Union to find a humane solution to the migration problem, had helped “normalize racist discourse.” “Everybody knew about Golden Dawn since the ’80s, but there was no political response,” he said, adding that the 2013 crackdown was a reaction to a public outcry over the death of Mr. Fyssas, the rapper. The government “finally reacted because they ran the risk of a social uprising which they could not have handled.” In spite of Golden Dawn’s dramatic decline, neo-fascism in Greece has not disappeared. Former members of Parliament, including Ilias Kasidiaris, Golden Dawn’s onetime spokesman, have formed parties that embrace similar views. Less extreme right-wing parties have also sprung up, including the nationalist Greek Solution. In the immediate political fallout from the convictions, former Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis resigned last week from the central political committee of the main leftist opposition party, Syriza and was subsequently ejected from the party. In addition to infighting within the party, he cited concerns that a criminal code introduced last year by the previous leftist administration could lead to lighter sentences for Golden Dawn. The code, backed by the Syriza leader, former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, would treat the leader of a criminal organization the same as any other member, he said. The governing conservative New Democracy party responded that Mr. Kontonis’ comments “exposed Mr. Tsipras’ blatant cynicism and profound hypocrisy.” “He stood outside the appeals court demanding the conviction of Golden Dawn’s officials,” the party said, “when, as prime minister, he had ensured a ‘softer fall’ for them.”']","The neo-fascist party’s leaders were convicted of running a criminal organization, and some of its members were found guilty of acts of violence."
Covid-19 vaccines are a chance at salvation for drug makers.,2020-10-13,"By Jesse Drucker, David Gelles and Katie Thomas","['For a long time, drug makers have been the most hated industry in America, blamed for gouging prices on lifesaving drugs and enriching themselves through the opioid crisis, among other sins. Now, with pharmaceutical companies racing to find vaccines to end the coronavirus pandemic, the industry is hoping to redeem itself in the public’s mind. The primary goal, of course, is to rescue the world from the grips of a vicious virus. But a big fringe benefit is to get public credit — and to use an improved image to fend off government efforts to more heavily regulate the industry. Consider Johnson & Johnson. In recent years, its reputation has been battered by accusations that products like its artificial hips and talcum powder have harmed customers. In 2019, an Oklahoma judge ordered the company to pay $572 million for contributing to the opioid epidemic. This spring, Johnson & Johnson jumped into the hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine; its candidate is in the final stage of clinical trials, though that trial has been paused, the company said on Monday night, after a participant got sick. Regardless of whether the vaccine ever comes to market, the company is looking to create a surge of positive publicity from its work. Its chief executive, Alex Gorsky, went on the “Today” show this spring and called Johnson & Johnson’s lab workers heroes.  For an industry demonized by consumers and politicians, the hunt for a vaccine “offers a path to redemption,” said J. Stephen Morrison, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. Last fall, a Gallup poll found that drug makers had the worst reputation of any American industry.  The pandemic — and the high hopes for a fast, safe, effective vaccine — appears to be changing that perception. This spring, other opinion polls showed that Americans’ views of the industry were improving. When Gallup released the results of this year’s annual survey, conducted in the first half of August, the results confirmed that the pharmaceutical industry’s reputation had gotten a bit better. Now, it is second-to-last, having inched past the U.S. government.']",
The Jailed Activist Left a Letter Behind. The Message: Keep Fighting.,2020-10-15,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — The outspoken Vietnamese journalist and activist Pham Doan Trang knew it was only a matter of time before the police came for her. She wrote a letter last year and gave it to an American friend with instructions to release it upon her arrest. In the letter, she asked that her friends not just campaign for her freedom but use her incarceration to fight for free elections and an end to single-party rule in Vietnam. “I don’t want freedom for just myself; that’s too easy,” wrote Ms. Pham, 42, who has walked with difficulty since a police beating in 2015. “I want something greater: freedom for Vietnam.” Shortly before midnight on Oct. 6, the police raided her apartment in Ho Chi Minh City and arrested her on charges of making and disseminating propaganda against the Vietnamese state. She faces up to 20 years in prison. Ms. Pham is one of the most prominent critics to have been arrested in recent years by Vietnam’s Communist regime, which has long made a practice of harassing, beating and imprisoning outspoken activists. The widespread use of smartphones and the internet in Vietnam has meant that daring activists and journalists like Ms. Pham can independently publish stories in which they uncover corruption or expose malfeasance. But that also puts a huge target on their backs. “She is the kind of prolific writer and thinker the Vietnamese government does not want to be free,” said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “They are going to throw the book at her and she is not going to compromise.” The Communist Party has long feared that free speech would undermine its hold on power, and it has built a large apparatus to stifle dissent. Activists say Ms. Pham’s arrest was likely prompted by the party’s upcoming congress in January, which occurs every five years.  At a time when Vietnam has repositioned itself as a strategic American ally and important global manufacturing hub, the authorities are newly emboldened to crack down on dissent with little fear of repercussions. They have also been invigorated by a United States administration that has widely ignored human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch estimates that Vietnam has jailed at least 130 political prisoners, more than any other country in Southeast Asia. Just four years ago, then-President Barack Obama made human rights in Vietnam a priority. During a 2016 visit, he invited Ms. Pham and other dissidents to meet with him publicly. But the police kept her from attending by detaining her. The Trump administration has not prioritized human rights in Vietnam in the same way. The police arrested Ms. Pham hours after the two governments held their 24th annual “Human Rights Dialogue.” After Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists and other groups called for her release, the State Department on Saturday pressed Vietnam to set Ms. Pham free. “The United States condemns \u200bthe arrest of writer, democracy, and human rights activist Pham Doan Trang,” Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, said in a statement. “We urge the Government of Vietnam to immediately release her and drop all charges.” Ms. Pham began her career as a journalist, but in a country where most media is state-controlled, she chafed at the restrictions.  In her 2019 book “Politics of a Police State,” she wrote about the continual harassment she had suffered for a decade as a writer and activist. The police once put glue in her apartment door lock so she could not leave, she wrote. They placed her under house arrest, publicly posted intimate photos taken from her computer and stole her identity cards. She left the country in 2013, but she was not happy in exile. “It’s really hard to watch from outside what happens in Vietnam,” she said at the time. “It makes me feel helpless.” She returned to Vietnam in 2015, and had lived in hiding since 2017. In addition to the upcoming Congress, Ms. Pham’s arrest may also have been prompted by a report she co-wrote last month challenging the official account of a deadly police raid in Dong Tam village, near Hanoi. In Vietnam, all land is owned by the state, and officials have the power to seize prime parcels and give them to their cronies or foreign companies, a practice that fuels corruption. The dispute in the village began in 2015 when officials transferred 145 acres to the country’s largest telecommunications company, the government-owned Viettel Corp., but residents refused to give up their land. During a confrontation in 2017, villagers held 19 police and security officials captive for a week. In January of this year, about 3,000 officers raided the village. The 84-year-old village head, Le Dinh Kinh, a lifelong Communist Party member who had led the opposition to the land seizure, was shot and killed by the police. Three police officers also died. The authorities arrested 29 villagers on murder or obstruction charges. In their report, Ms. Pham and her co-author challenged the official claim that Mr. Le had been holding a hand grenade when the police shot him. In fact, they wrote, he had been holding a cane. Since the report’s release, three other contributors have been arrested, activists said. Another author, the American activist Will Nguyen, was previously deported from Vietnam, in 2018, after being forced to make a video confession that was shown on television. It was Mr. Nguyen who released Ms. Pham’s letter last week foretelling her arrest. “Trang has been a thorn in the government’s side for a long time, and the authorities have been hunting her down since 2017,” Mr. Nguyen said in an email. “At heart, she has an acute sense of justice and a profound love for Vietnam,” he said. “She wishes for it to be better, even if it means sacrificing her freedom and herself.” Ms. Pham also reported on a 2016 environmental disaster caused when a Taiwanese-owned steel factory discharged toxic waste into the sea along a stretch of Vietnam’s central coast. Other activists who wrote about the disaster landed in prison, including Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, a blogger better known as Mother Mushroom, who was later released and allowed to fly to the United States. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Pham predicted that the authorities’ effort to intimidate activists by imprisoning Mother Mushroom would fail. “She has a lot of supporters,” Ms. Pham said. “Many of them will replace her or follow in her path.” Perhaps she was already thinking ahead to the likelihood of her own incarceration. In her letter, titled “Just in case I am imprisoned,” she told friends not to believe the police if they claimed she had confessed. She asked for a movement not to “free Trang,” but to “free Trang and ensure free and fair elections.” “No one wants to sit in prison,” she wrote. “But if prison is inevitable for freedom fighters, if prison can serve a predetermined purpose, then we should happily accept it.”']","Pham Doan Trang was harassed for years by the Vietnamese police, and beaten. In a letter, she foretold her arrest and called for an end to one-party rule."
Freshman enrollment drops significantly at U.S. universities and community colleges.,2020-10-15,By Shawn Hubler,"['Freshman enrollment has dropped more than 16 percent from last year at American colleges and universities — and by nearly a quarter at community colleges — as the threat of the coronavirus has disrupted the nation’s higher education system, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reported Thursday. A month into the fall semester, overall undergraduate enrollment is running 4 percent below last year’s levels, as the pandemic has forced classes online and plunged the national economy into turmoil, the report found. Even an upward trend in graduate enrollment has been dampened since last month’s survey, slipping to 2.7 percent. The drop in enrollment is just the latest turmoil affecting America’s institutions of higher education. Facing an uncertain autumn, some schools opted to hold most or all classes online, while others opted for in-person instruction, installing a host of measures to try to contain the virus, with mixed success. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 178,000 virus cases have been reported at more than 1,400 colleges as of Oct. 8, according to a Times database. So far, 29 games in the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football’s premier tier, have been postponed or rescheduled for virus-related reasons, and one of college sport’s biggest names, Alabama Coach Nick Saban, announced he had tested positive on Wednesday.   Doug Shapiro, the center’s executive director, said the trend reflected enrollment numbers from a little more than half of the 3,600 postsecondary institutions tracked by the center, sharpening the worrisome picture that emerged last month in early data. That preliminary look\xad\xad in September, with only about a quarter of schools reporting, had pegged the fall in enrollment at only about 2.5 percent. A third, even more complete data set will be released Nov. 12. “Most strikingly, freshman students are by far the biggest decline of any group from last year,” Mr. Shapiro said, noting that many students may have opted for gap years or deferred admissions or decided to work for a year before enrolling. Undergraduate enrollment, he said, was down in every region and at every type of institution except four-year, for-profit colleges, with first-time students accounting for 69 percent of the drop. But the “staggering” news, he said, was from community colleges, where the 22.7 percent enrollment decline from last year eliminated what had been “one of higher education’s bright spots.” In the 2008, recession, he said, community college enrollment went up. “This is uncharted territory,” agreed Terry Hartle, senior vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education, a higher education trade group. And, he said, the societal stakes are high: the community college system is where most Black, Latino and low-income students enter the higher education system. Members of those groups all have been disproportionately hit by the virus, and he said the drop also may reflect concern that campuses aren’t safe from infection. “But the big worry is that people who interrupt their education with the intention of completing it later don’t always do so,” he said. “The progress we’ve made in expanding education to lower income students could be undermined.”']",
White House embraces a declaration from scientists that opposes lockdowns and relies on ‘herd immunity.’,2020-10-13,By Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"['The White House has embraced a declaration by a group of scientists arguing that authorities should allow the coronavirus to spread among young healthy people while protecting the elderly and the vulnerable — an approach that would rely on arriving at “herd immunity” through infections rather than a vaccine. Many experts say “herd immunity” — the point at which a disease stops spreading because nearly everyone in a population has contracted it — is still very far-off. Leading experts have concluded, using different scientific methods, that about 85 to 90 percent of the American population is still susceptible to the coronavirus. On a call convened Monday by the White House, two senior administration officials, both speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to give their names, cited an October 4 petition titled The Great Barrington Declaration, which argues against lockdowns and calls for a reopening of businesses and schools. “Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,” the declaration states, adding, “The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.” The declaration has more than 9,000 signatories from all over the world, its website says, though most of the names are not public. The document grew out of a meeting hosted by the American Institute for Economic Research, a libertarian-leaning research organization. Its lead authors include Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, an economist at Stanford University, the academic home of Dr. Scott Atlas, President Trump’s science adviser. Dr. Atlas has also espoused herd immunity. The declaration’s signatories include Sunetra Gupta and Gabriela Gomes, two scientists who have proposed that societies may achieve herd immunity when 10 to 20 percent of their populations have been infected with the virus, a position most epidemiologists disagree with. Last month, at the request of The New York Times, three epidemiological teams calculated the percentage of the country that is infected. What they found runs strongly counter to the theory being promoted in influential circles that the United States has either already achieved herd immunity or is close to doing so, and that the pandemic is all but over. That conclusion would imply that businesses, schools and restaurants could safely reopen, and that masks and other distancing measures could be abandoned. “The idea that herd immunity will happen at 10 or 20 percent is just nonsense,” said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which produced the epidemic model frequently cited during White House news briefings as the epidemic hit hard in the spring. The move comes amid a coronavirus outbreak at the White House that has now grown to more than 20 people, as evidence mounts that the administration did little to prevent or contain the virus’s spread. On Tuesday night, officials with the Department of Labor said that the wife of the secretary, Eugene Scalia, tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the day. Trish Scalia, who was said to be experiencing “mild symptoms,” and her husband were at a Rose Garden event honoring Judge Amy Coney Barrett that is being eyed as the source of several infections in people connected to the White House. The secretary tested negative, officials said, but he will work from home “for the time being.”']",
"Central Europe, Spared in the Spring, Suffers as Virus Surges",2020-10-14,By Marc Santora and Hana de Goeij,"['Much of Central Europe locked down quickly in the spring, before the coronavirus took root, and largely avoided widespread infection during the first wave of the pandemic. But now — from the Polish port city of Gdansk on the Baltic to the ancient fortress town of Kotor on the Adriatic in Montenegro — the virus is sweeping across the region. Hospitals beds are filling up in Poland; doctors in Hungary are issuing dire warnings about a lack of medical workers; the authorities in Romania are struggling to track new cases; and health care workers are falling ill in Bulgaria. The Czech Republic has the highest coronavirus transmission rates in Europe. Everywhere, new infections are setting daily records, and deaths are slowly but steadily rising. The increases are part of a second wave of the coronavirus spreading across Europe. But there is particular concern about the damage it could sow in the former Communist countries of Central Europe, some of which have weak health care systems, critical shortages of doctors and nurses, and inadequate testing programs. Many Central European countries also struggle with a deep distrust of government among their citizens stemming from years of systemic corruption. The region is home to a large older population at high risk of suffering serious illness. At the same time, older people in the region tend to live within large family groups, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center, increasing their risks of contracting the coronavirus. “These multigenerational living arrangements would be an important risk factor for accelerating transmission from younger to older adults, placing these countries at higher risk for hospitalizations and mortality,” said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford. Petr Smejkal, the chief of infectious diseases and epidemiology at the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague, said the limited spread of the virus during the first wave in the spring — viewed widely as a success at the time — was likely a factor in the explosion of cases this fall. Antibody tests in the Czech Republic show far lower levels of exposure than have been documented in hard hit places like London, meaning there could be less natural resistance. But Dr. Smejkal said deeper societal dynamics were also driving the epidemic now. This part of Europe, he said, is still plagued by what was thought to be an advantage in the spring — the legacy of communist rule and the willingness of people to follow state directives. The early lockdowns in many of these countries had a distinctly militarized feel. It worked, but at a cost. “What it did was made the public a passive player in the game,” Dr. Smejkal said. As the crisis in the spring faded, he said, messages from governments became confused and misinformation about the coronavirus took root in societies that already had a bent toward conspiratorial thinking. “We can now clearly see the effect of people’s attitude and the behavior and the culture itself,” he said. For example, by the end of June, many in the Czech Republic believed they had weathered the worst of the pandemic. In celebration, some 2,000 revelers gathered for a feast of homemade Czech delicacies, including roast pork, dumplings and apple pie, spread across a table that stretched a third of a mile on Prague’s Charles Bridge. That declaration of victory was premature. On Wednesday, the death toll in the Czech Republic reached 1,158, with more than half the deaths — 731 — coming since September. Schools were closed, as were all bars, restaurants and clubs. Places serving takeout food could do so only until 8 p.m., and just through windows. The most pressing concern in the Czech Republic, and elsewhere, is a shortage of doctors and nurses, many of whom left as part of the broader emigration of skilled workers to wealthier European and other countries over the past two decades. Mr. Smejkal said most health care facilities also lack physician assistants, respiratory therapists and other specialist workers. In Poland — where the prime minister is self-isolating after coming into contact with an infected individual — there are just 238 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest ratio in the European Union. At University Hospital in Krakow, the intensive care unit is filled. “We don’t have any places for patients with coronavirus who require the use of ventilators,” Marcin Jędrychowski, the hospital’s director, told the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza. “We can’t admit anyone.” The president of the Supreme Doctors’ Councils, a physicians group, on Wednesday called for the immediate establishment of military field hospitals to deal with the flood of patients. But the pandemic has been caught up in the maelstrom of Polish politics. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the deputy prime minister and head of the ruling party, threatened to veto any European Union budget and coronavirus relief package if it was tied to concerns about the state of the nation’s judiciary. “We won’t let them terrorize us with money,” he said in an interview this week with Gazeta Polska Codziennie, a pro-government tabloid. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary made a similar threat this summer but has grown quieter on the issue as the virus surges in his country. As Hungary’s underfunded health care system buckles under the weight of the pandemic, the government passed sweeping legislation to increase pay for doctors, the largest increase in a decade. Ferenc Falus, Hungary’s former chief medical officer, said the government had failed to build a proper testing and tracing system. “To intents and purposes, there is practically no contact tracing in Hungary,” he said. In Romania, authorities not only have a problem managing the crisis, but are also having trouble agreeing on how many people live in different areas of the country in order to implement policies. On Tuesday, the National Institute of Public Health announced that the positivity test rate in Bucharest, the capital, had reached 3 per 1,000 residents over the last 14 days — a red line that was meant to trigger the closing of all schools. But a different government agency put the figure at 2.69 cases per 1,000, below the threshold, based on a higher calculation of residents in the city. The institute went with the higher number of residents, avoiding tighter restrictions — for now. Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian president, warned the nation on Tuesday that more action would likely be needed. “Let’s not delude ourselves,” he said. “This stage will not pass by itself.” In Bulgaria, the only pulmonologist in the municipal hospital in the small town of Aytos, in the east of the country, is being treated for Covid-19 in her own facility, where the beds in the coronavirus ward are nearly filled. On good days, she cares for the other patients. Another public hospital in the southern town of Gotse Delchev lost its only anesthesiologist to the coronavirus in September. Unlike most other European nations, Bulgaria does not plan to impose new national restrictions. “We will intervene wherever we see a problem,” said Angel Kunchev, the chief state health inspector. Marc Santora reported from London, and Hana de Goeij from Prague. Reporting was contributed by Boryana Dzhambazova in Sofia, Bulgaria; Kit Gillet in Bucharest, Romania; Anatol Magdziarz in Warsaw; and Benjamin Novak in Budapest.']","The Czech Republic, with the highest transmission rate in Europe, closed schools, bars and restaurants.

Johnson & Johnson pauses its coronavirus vaccine trial because of a volunteer’s ‘unexplained illness.’,2020-10-13,"By Virginia Hughes, Katie Thomas, Carl Zimmer and Katherine J. Wu","['Johnson & Johnson has paused the large late-stage clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine because of an “unexplained illness” in one of the volunteers, the company said on Monday. The company did not say whether the sick participant had received the experimental vaccine or a placebo. The pause was first reported by the health news website Stat. On Tuesday morning, shares of Johnson & Johnson fell about 2 percent on the S&P 500. Johnson & Johnson, which just began the so-called Phase 3 trial of its vaccine last month, was behind several of its competitors in the vaccine race, but its vaccine had some advantages over others. It does not need to be frozen, and it could need just one dose instead of two. It would also be the largest trial, with a goal of enrolling 60,000 volunteers. “Adverse events — illnesses, accidents, etc. — even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” the company said in a statement. “We’re also learning more about this participant’s illness, and it’s important to have all the facts before we share additional information.” Trial pauses are often lifted quickly after the illness is investigated and deemed not to be a serious safety risk. “It’s actually a good thing that these companies are pausing these trials when these things come up,” said Dr. Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco, a trial site for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. “We just need to let the sponsor and the safety board do their review and let us know their findings.” “It doesn’t mean that the adverse event is related to the vaccine, but it needs to be investigated thoroughly,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, who oversaw public health preparedness for the National Security Council under President Trump and was acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration under former President Barack Obama. Depending on the findings, she said, additional data may be collected, trial rules may be modified, or other steps may be taken to ensure safety. Johnson & Johnson’s is not the first trial to be paused because of safety concerns. Two participants in AstraZeneca’s trial became seriously ill after getting its vaccine. That trial was halted twice — most recently last month — and has still not resumed in the United States, though locations abroad swiftly broke the pause. Both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca developed their vaccines using adenovirus vectors, modified viruses engineered to carry coronavirus genes into human cells. AstraZeneca’s vaccine used an adenovirus that causes common colds in chimpanzees. Johnson & Johnson’s used another adenovirus, called Ad26, which has also been used in its approved vaccine for Ebola. Experts say safety issues must be investigated and are one reason late-stage trials cannot be rushed —\xa0even for a president who has repeatedly claimed that a vaccine will be ready before the U.S. election on Nov. 3. “This kind of event epitomizes why vaccine development can’t be influenced by artificial timelines such as an election,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine.']",
"President Trump supports a bigger relief bill, but a deal is far from certain.",2020-10-15,By Alan Rappeport,"['President Trump, struggling to gain traction among voters just weeks before the election, called on Thursday for a bigger stimulus package than he had previously offered, and the White House signaled it was willing to make concessions to Democrats. But the proposals were unlikely to win the necessary backing from Senate Republicans who are preparing a far smaller bill of their own. White House negotiators have proposed a $1.8 trillion relief package. Mr. Trump said that he wanted one that was even bigger and suggested, without explanation, that China would pay for it. “I would go higher,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with the Fox Business Network. “Go big or go home.” The comments came after Mr. Mnuchin said that the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election. But the $1.8 trillion package that he has proposed has already proven to be a non-starter with Senate Republicans who have panned it as too costly, making Mr. Trump’s call for a more expensive bill another complication in the already fraught negotiations. Investors, who have been following the stimulus talks closely, seemed unmoved by statements from Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday, with stocks on Wall Street dropping for a third consecutive day. In the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more “targeted” relief bill.  But Mr. McConnell downplayed the prospects of a larger bill on Thursday. “He’s talking about a much larger amount than I can sell to my members,” Mr. McConnell said about the president’s comments.']",
"For Indian Women Working as Cooks and Nannies, No #MeToo Moment",2020-10-14,By Emily Schmall and Hari Kumar,"['Nannies, cooks, construction workers, farmhands and other women who are primarily employed in India’s informal jobs sector are still routinely sexually harassed and abused at work because a groundbreaking federal law is rarely enforced, a study has found. Ninety-five percent of India’s female workers, some 195 million people, are employed in so-called informal jobs, according to Human Rights Watch, which found that the country’s federal and local governments have not done enough to promote and carry out the functions of the country’s 2013 Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act. The law, known as the Posh Act, mandates that employers with 10 or more workers set up committees to receive and investigate complaints of sexual harassment. While the global #MeToo movement inspired a host of Bollywood actors and well-known Indian writers to come forward with allegations of sexual harassment, poorer Indian women are less likely to speak out. The Human Rights Watch report focuses on workplace harassment, but Indian women are routinely subjected to harassment and abuse in and outside of their homes, sometimes with deadly consequences. Poor women and those from lower castes are most likely to be victimized. Mina Jadav, a trade union leader who represents women in the informal sector in the western Indian state of Gujarat, said sexual harassment, including slurs and physical violence, were commonplace. “On many occasions, women will not complain. If the victim is a young girl, then more chances that she will not speak. Families try to hide the incidents,” Ms. Jadav said. Under the Posh Act, complaint committees must be led by a woman and include at least one outside expert in the field of sexual harassment. The committees have the power of a civil court to subpoena witnesses and evidence, and can recommend remedies, including actions against the alleged perpetrator ranging from fines to termination. But it is up to local governments to create district-level committees to educate women about their rights and to receive and process sexual harassment complaints. Gender discrimination, the stigma associated with speaking out and a backlogged court system where cases of all kinds linger for years have led women to avoid seeking and receiving justice. The Posh Act was created to give women an alternative to the courts, said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “More people are reluctant to go to the police or go to the court — that is almost always a barrier for people to report because they find that it could take away years of their lives,” she said. Employers have been slow to adapt to the law, according to Vishal Kedia, founder of Complykaro, a Mumbai-based consultancy that helps companies with compliance. According to Complykaro, more than 40 percent of companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange reported zero sexual harassment complaints between the fiscal years 2015 and 2019. “They may not be doing awareness, hence the fear still exists of coming forward to file a complaint,” Mr. Kedia said. The situation is most stark for women in the informal sector, according to Human Rights Watch, which relied on 85 interviews in three Indian states with workers, trade union officials, activists, lawyers and academics. “In many of the places either the committees are not in existence, or if they have come to existence then the members are not notified, or not enough training has taken place. So there are challenges of implementation,” said Sunieta Ojha, a lawyer in Delhi who has represented many women in civil sexual harassment suits against male colleagues or bosses. In response to general criticism about the Posh Act, India’s powerful home minister, Amit Shah, presided over a committee of ministers that in January made a list of recommendations, including adding workplace sexual harassment to India’s penal code.']",A new study by Human Rights Watch found that poor Indian women who work in the informal jobs sector are routinely subjected to sexual harassment and abuse despite a groundbreaking law.
Pelosi defends demand for broad stimulus package as Senate prepares scaled-down bill,2020-10-13,By Emily Cochrane,"['Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California defended her unwillingness to accept anything less than a broad coronavirus stimulus package in negotiations with the administration, on the same day that President Trump called on Twitter for negotiators to “go big or go home!!!” Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are heading toward a vote to advance a scaled-down package that Democrats are unlikely to support. In a heated CNN interview, Ms. Pelosi chastised Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchor, and his colleagues as “apologists for the Republican position” after Mr. Blitzer noted that some Democrats, including Andrew Yang and Representative Ro Khanna of California, have urged her in recent days to cut a deal with the administration. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, last put forward a $1.8 trillion framework in negotiations. “Honest to God, I can’t get over it,” Ms. Pelosi said, who muscled a $2.2 trillion proposal through the House earlier this month. “Andrew Yang, he’s lovely. Ro Khanna, he’s lovely. They are not negotiating this situation. They have no idea of the particulars. They have no idea of what the language is here.” The interview on Tuesday further underscored Ms. Pelosi’s unwillingness to accept a scaled-down bill, even as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced the Senate would vote to advance such a package when the full chamber returns later this month. Senate Democrats have also accused their Republican counterparts of prioritizing a Supreme Court confirmation over negotiating a stimulus bill. The scaled-down package, Mr. McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky, is likely around $500 billion and containing funds for hospitals, schools, enhanced unemployment benefits and the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular federal loan program for small businesses that has expired without congressional action. It is unlikely that such a package would secure the necessary Democratic support needed to clear the chamber, a reality further highlighted by the combative CNN interview with Ms. Pelosi. When Mr. Blitzer pressed her again to not let perfect be the enemy of the good, given the mounting toll of the pandemic, she said the administration’s offer was “not even close to the good.” In a private caucus call before the interview, she and her top lieutenants on Tuesday continued to rail against the administration’s latest offer was inadequate. “We really need to have an agreement, but we cannot have an agreement by just folding,” she said. “I don’t think our leverage has ever been greater than it is now.” Ms. Pelosi pushed back on the suggestion that she should accept anything less than the latest $2.2 trillion Democratic proposal, after coming down from the original $3.4 trillion proposal the House approved in May. “I appreciate, shall we say, a couple people saying, ‘Take it, take it, take it,’” Ms. Pelosi said. “Take it? Take it? Even the president is saying, ‘Go big or go home.’” But the $1.8 trillion offer also faced additional resistance among the majority of Senate Republicans, who lashed out at top administration officials on Saturday for putting forward a counteroffer that they felt to be too expensive and veering toward catering too much to Democratic priorities.']",
Will a Half-Step by Macron Be Enough to Blunt France’s Second Wave?,2020-10-15,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — France thought it had beaten the coronavirus. Its comeback in a roaring second wave left the government scrambling this week for a half-measure that underscored its ugly choices. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, highlighted his own dilemma on Wednesday in announcing a curfew for Paris and eight other major cities. A new lockdown for an already reeling economy would have been “disproportionate,” he said, yet the pressure on intensive care beds was intolerable. “Our caregivers are exhausted,” he said. “The virus is recirculating very rapidly in Europe and in our country,” Mr. Macron said in an interview on national television. France had to “take back control.” If the virus ever was under control in France, that was before the summer. But, experts say, after that moment, the French, like so many others elsewhere in Europe, let their guard down. France’s attachment to its summer holidays, young people’s exuberance in going out and partying, a lack of vigilance in wearing masks and social distancing, the risks of resuming routine life, and the government’s failure — from the very start — to effectively test, trace and isolate infected people have all contributed to an explosive second wave of infections. Whether ordering people, starting Saturday, to stay in their homes from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. is the answer — restaurant owners and young people are already grumbling — cannot be known immediately. But the dire outlook was undeniable. With an average of nearly 20,000 new cases a day, health experts have been warning all week that the virus is out of control in France, particularly in cities. “Right now, we’ve got to put the brakes on it,” said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist on the French government’s Covid-19 advisory panel. “This curfew will limit contacts,” he said. “We’ve got to lower the rate right away. We don’t really have a choice.” Mircea Sofonea, an epidemiologist at the University of Montpellier, said that the new curfew came in “the last possible week to react” to prevent hospital saturation. He noted that a new study found that a curfew imposed in French Guiana reduced infections by 36 percent. Until Wednesday night, Mr. Macron’s own indecision had emphasized the quandary faced by governments all over Europe caught between faltering economies — France is facing a recession of nearly 9 percent — restriction-weary populations and a virus that will not quit. The government’s hesitancy was palpable this week. The prime minister, Jean Castex, chided the French for having “decided a little too quickly” that the virus no longer posed a threat. The same day, the tourism minister, Jean Baptiste Lemoyne, urged people to go on vacation during the upcoming school break, to prop up the country’s vital tourism industry, whose revenues are half what they were a year ago. Mr. Macron himself acknowledged the impossibility of barring upcoming French vacation-going in his remarks on Wednesday night. Lulled by a relatively successful handling of the first wave, the government failed to firmly put in place a critical triptych over the summer — testing, tracing and isolation. The numbers are not as high as they were last spring, but they are bad enough. Nearly 100 people died in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning, far below the 1,000-plus death tolls of mid-April but still alarming. Cases, flat through June and July, have been rising steadily since August, with 27,000 positive tests reported last Saturday. An infection rate of 5 to 6 cases per 100,000 people over the summer has spiraled to nearly 200 across France. It is up to 800 for 20- to 30-year-olds in Paris. The government has set the red alert limit at 150. In the interim, bars and gyms have been shut in major cities. Establishments that serve food remain open, even if cafe owners report confusion about what qualifies as enough of a meal to keep the police off their backs. There have been mixed messages, too, about going back to offices. The president of the region that includes Paris, Valérie Pécresse, appealed for a return last month, even as infections started to rise. The result is that central Paris bustles with office workers, compared with moribund downtowns in the United States, though nearly everybody wears a mask. On Wednesday, Mr. Macron encouraged at least a partial return to telecommuting. The gestation of the current infection boom was plainly visible in July, August and September. Visitors packed France’s summer watering holes after the government encouraged tourism, anxious also not to get crosswise of the sacred ritual that is the French summer holiday. A wave of indignation greeted mild suggestions that workers should give up some vacation days to compensate for those lost during the lockdown. In Paris, as they returned from these hot spots, young people spilled from crowded bars onto the sidewalks in the city’s bohemian eastern districts and massed along the banks of the Seine. There was no social distancing and few masks. France thought the virus was tamed. “There was certainly a lack of understanding in a part of the population that didn’t believe in a second wave,” said Renaud Piarroux, an epidemics specialist at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. “Some in the younger population abandoned the necessary precautions,” he said, like wearing a mask and social distancing. Before Mr. Macron’s announcement on Wednesday, several health experts predicted a severe reckoning in the coming weeks. “It’s all over,” William Dab, a former national director of public health who has been critical of the government’s response, said earlier this week. “We’ve lost the fight. It’s out of control.” Mr. Dab chided the government for what he called a “strategy deficit” that had not motivated individuals to change their behavior. In the Paris region, he added, “there is nothing left to be done.” On Thursday, the police searched the homes and offices of several current and former officials, including the health minister, Olivier Véran, as part of an inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic. The French Court of Justice, a special court that hears accusations of official mismanagement, opened the investigation in July. The one ray of hope in France, as elsewhere, is that treatment methods have improved since the spring, allowing more patients to be saved. Still, the head of Paris hospitals, Martin Hirsch, warned on Tuesday that coronavirus patients would most likely fill up to 90 percent of intensive care beds in the capital by next week. Already more than 1,600 of France’s 5,000 intensive-care beds are filled. A report from independent experts, commissioned by the government and released this week, concluded that France had done far better than Britain, Sweden, the United States and Southern Europe, but not as well as Austria or Germany. The French obeyed the lockdown imposed by the government in March, April and May. Then, with cases flatlining, they flocked back into the streets, stores, cafes and restaurants. Citizens let down their guard, reinforcing what Bernard Jomier, a member of the French Senate commission examining the government’s pandemic response, termed a “collective deficit of public health culture in our country.” “We are a country where the politics of prevention is not part of our culture,” he said in an interview this week. “There are elements in French society that are favorable to the development of the virus.” The consequence has been a “hesitation in the government’s official line,” said Mr. Jomier, a Greens party lawmaker who represents a Paris district. “The governance of public health is not well organized.” “Testing, tracing, isolating — this has been a failure,” he said. “Badly elaborated, badly implemented.” At Charles de Gaulle Airport for example, arriving travelers are tested, but they do not get the results for at least a week.  Contact tracing has also “failed,” Mr. Jomier said; Mr. Dab, the former public health director, called it a “fiasco” in an interview in the Journal du Dimanche in September, noting that the five contacts traced per case in July had dropped to two. “The number of contacts is very far below the actual number of contacts,” said Mr. Piarroux, the epidemics specialist. “It’s all happening over the phone. So there’s less motivation” to divulge the contacts. Both he and Mr. Jomier also said that isolation, the third part of the triptych, had hardly been enforced, pointing to out-of-control infection rates in shelters that house migrants. On Thursday, French newspapers grimly recalled the curfew imposed during the German occupation, and industry groups called for new help for struggling restaurants. “We can’t work from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.,” said Denis Kouch, the owner of a restaurant off the Champs-Élysées. “People don’t even have time to arrive, and then they have to leave right away?” Constant Méheut and Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']",The imposition of a curfew in several major cities underscored a difficult choice: further dampening the economy or risking more lives.
L.S.U.-Florida is the latest college football game to be postponed because of an outbreak.,2020-10-14,By Alan Blinder,"['For the second time this week, the Southeastern Conference has postponed a college football game because of the coronavirus pandemic, unnerving the league less than a month into the season that sustains an economic and cultural juggernaut throughout the South. The league said Wednesday that Saturday’s game between No. 10 Florida and Louisiana State, the reigning national champion, would not be played until at least Dec. 12, a week before the conference title game.  The postponement came two days after Florida’s coach, Dan Mullen, described the football program as “a model of safety” during the pandemic and a day after the team paused football activities because of “an increase” in positive tests for the virus. Florida’s game against L.S.U., which was to be played in Gainesville, Fla., was the 29th Football Bowl Subdivision game since last August to be upended because of the pandemic, and the third Power 5 matchup to be postponed this week. The Big 12 Conference announced on Sunday that Baylor and Oklahoma State would not play this weekend because of an outbreak at Baylor. And on Monday, the SEC postponed a game between Missouri and Vanderbilt after Vanderbilt concluded that once injuries, opt-outs and virus-related concerns were considered, it would not have enough scholarship players available to compete on Saturday.']",
Boris Johnson ignored scientists’ advice for a brief national lockdown.,2020-10-13,By Mark Landler,"['Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has brushed aside advice from an influential group of scientists to lock down the economy for a brief period to try to halt a surge in coronavirus cases. The recommendation, contained in newly published minutes from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or Sage, has intensified the debate in Britain over whether Mr. Johnson’s government is doing enough to avert a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Mr. Johnson ordered pubs and gyms in the city of Liverpool to close, part of a new three-tiered system of restrictions targeting places hardest hit by the virus. But he has resisted pressure to impose a so-called “circuit breaker” lockdown — a brief national shutdown designed to stop the exponential increase in infections — saying it would come at too high an economic and social cost. In the minutes of its Sept. 21 meeting, posted online late Monday night, Sage recommended a brief lockdown as one of several measures to stop what it warned could be a “very large epidemic with catastrophic consequences.” The scientists also advised closing restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, urging people to work from home, and converting universities to remote learning. And they expressed doubts about the effectiveness of one of the measures Mr. Johnson has imposed: closing pubs and restaurants at 10 p.m. The politics of lockdowns are fraught for Mr. Johnson. He has long pledged to be guided by scientific advice. But he faces fierce opposition from members of his own Conservative Party and from local and regional officials in the north of England, who contend that the measures are crippling their economies.']",
"Virginia’s governor was also a possible target of an anti-government plot, the F.B.I. says.",2020-10-13,By Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and Neil MacFarquhar,"['Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia was discussed as a possible target by members of an anti-government group charged last week with plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the F.B.I. said on Tuesday. During a hearing in Grand Rapids, Mich., Special Agent Richard J. Trask II of the F.B.I. said that Mr. Northam and other officials were targeted because of their aggressive lockdown orders to restrict the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, 13 men accused of involvement in the alleged plot were charged with a variety of state and federal crimes including terrorism, conspiracy and weapons possession.  During Tuesday’s hearing, the authorities revealed that the suspects also spoke about “taking” the Virginia governor “based” on coronavirus lockdown orders that restricted businesses. The F.B.I. alerted members of Mr. Northam’s security team throughout their investigation, Alena Yarmosky, Mr. Northam’s press secretary, said in a statement. The governor was not informed, “per security protocols,” Ms. Yarmosky said, but added that “at no time was the governor or his family in imminent danger.” Mr. Northam,  a Democrat, issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 30, instructing residents to leave their homes only for work, medical appointments, family care, shopping for essentials and “outdoor activity with strict social distancing requirements.” In April, President Trump had openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in Virginia, Michigan and other states with stay-at-home orders, a day after his administration had announced guidelines for governors to set their own timetables for reopening. “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment,” the president wrote on Twitter at the time. “It is under siege!”']",
This Urban Safari Comes With a Warning: Watch Out for Snakes,2020-10-15,By Mike Ives,"['HONG KONG — The snake didn’t see the catcher coming, at least not in time to avoid being caught. “This is the fourth-most-toxic land snake in the world, and the most toxic snake in Asia by far,” the catcher, William Sargent, told a group of hikers on a recent night in Hong Kong. He delivered the news calmly, in the way one explains that dinner is ready. Which of us, he asked, wanted to touch it first? Mr. Sargent, 44, runs Hong Kong Snakes Safari, an outfit that takes residents on night hikes through the territory’s wooded hinterlands. Some are more apprehensive than others as they learn firsthand about what he says is a chronically misunderstood reptile. The hikes highlight the scale of biodiversity in Hong Kong, a financial hub of 7.5 million people that is better known for its high-rises than its sprawling protected areas. It’s also a way for city slickers with snake phobias to confront their fears in the wild. Hong Kong is nearly the size of Los Angeles, but about 40 percent of its land area consists of parks that were created in the 1970s when the Chinese territory was still a British colony. Human-animal conflicts are inevitable because so much of the protected land lies within walking distance of dense urban areas. Wild boars, in particular, often cause a stir when they wander into busy streets or subway stations. Last month, a family of boars made the local papers by sauntering through Hong Kong’s central business district and taking a swim in the fountain outside the Bank of China’s 72-story office tower. Snakes generally keep a lower profile in Hong Kong, but because eight native species are capable of inflicting fatal bites, the health risks can be serious if they end up in close quarters with humans. The Hong Kong Police Force said in a statement that whenever a snake endangers the public, it is “safely boxed and bagged” by approved catchers, then sent to live at Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, a local nonprofit that also shelters rescued bats, birds, crocodiles, monkeys, pangolins and turtles. Most of the snakes are later released into the wild. Mr. Sargent, who kept snakes as pets while growing up on one of Hong Kong’s outer islands, has been a police-approved expert since 2015. He said his snake-catching assignments had taken him to prisons, schools, supermarkets, an airport hangar and a construction site for a coronavirus ward, from which he extracted a 10-foot python. Last month, he was summoned to a fishing village at 3 a.m. to remove a Chinese cobra — from beneath the bed of a 90-year-old woman. He said a group of the village’s elderly residents formed a kind of receiving line around him as he walked by, “yelling their five cents’ worth about this foreign snake catcher.” “Even the police were laughing,” said Mr. Sargent, who is British-Swiss and works in event planning by day. Separately, he runs the hiking business and an educational Facebook group about local snakes that has more than 10,000 members. It was set up partly to help correct viral misinformation, like the suggestion that snakebites are common in the city. The World Health Organization estimates that about 81,000 to 138,000 people around the globe die each year from snakebites, mostly in developing countries, and that about three times as many suffer permanent disabilities. Most of the world’s estimated 1.8 million to 2.7 million annual “envenomings,” or snake poisonings, occur in Asia, many in countries with weak health systems and sparse medical resources. The countries that lack the capacity to manufacture antivenom are the most at risk. But in Hong Kong, which has a first-rate medical system, no one has been killed by a venomous snake since at least 2005, according to a spokesman for the city’s Hospital Authority. In 2018, the last year for which data is available, the authorities recorded just 73 snakebites, making the chances of being bitten about one in 100,000. “It’s not mystical,” said Mr. Sargent during the night hike. “It’s very clear-cut what the risk is. But there’s such a huge gap of misconception.” I was one of several hikers who met Mr. Sargent at a village near Hong Kong’s border with mainland China on a sweltering weekday evening. Before we entered an adjacent country park, he explained that the best way to avoid a snakebite was simply to watch our feet and walk with a high-quality headlamp. Check. And check. As we set out on a concrete path, our carefully monitored footsteps were bathed in a reassuringly bright LED halo. But the ambient light seemed to fade with every step, and sections of the path were starting to look worryingly overgrown — at least to my snake-fearing eyes. “Look everywhere you can look,” said James Kwok, a wildlife enthusiast who had tagged along for the safari and offered snake-spotting advice. The group forded a thigh-high stream and traversed slippery rocks in the dark. A few hikers lost their footing and tumbled into the water. Mr. Sargent spotted our first quarry — a mountain water snake — and plucked it off a stream-side rock with his bare hands. As he showed us the snake, it nibbled at his hand, drawing a trickle of blood. He shrugged: It was nonvenomous, and therefore harmless. But it didn’t look happy in Mr. Sargent’s confident grip. “No,” he said. “I mean, I’m a predator, right?” That seemed like more than enough drama for the night. But a few minutes later, a longer, thicker, black-and-white-striped snake slithered into the light of the group’s headlamps. “Quick, quick, quick!” Mr. Sargent yelled in a stage whisper, as the group scrambled into formation behind him, headlamp beams bouncing across the subtropical foliage like spotlights at a rock concert. In a fluid motion, he sprinted ahead, slipped his hand into a puncture-resistant glove and scooped up the snake. As it writhed around in the humid air, he said it was a many-banded krait, a nocturnal species whose highly toxic venom targets the nervous system. We all tittered with anxiety. But Mr. Sargent, who still looked serenely calm, reassuringly said that in three decades of handling wild kraits, he had yet to see one strike. The animal’s primary instinct was to flee, not bite. So we gathered around to touch the krait’s belly — which was surprisingly smooth and delicate, like a baby’s cheeks — and to marvel at how beautiful its scales looked up close. “It’s not what you expect,” said Ruth Stather, a fellow hiker, who works in marketing. The krait was not exactly pleased, but it seemed willing to tolerate the curious humans for a few minutes. As we stood there touching it in the silent darkness, I felt my snake phobia easing. “They’re not interested in fighting,” Mr. Sargent said. I worried that he was tempting fate. But, sure enough, when he released the snake into the undergrowth, it slithered away.']","On nighttime hikes in Hong Kong’s surprisingly lush forests, a snake catcher teaches city slickers about the reptiles — and their bites."
Will we remember how hugging works when we are allowed to do it again?,2020-10-17,By A.C. Shilton,"['As the weeks of coronavirus quarantine stretched into months, hugs are among the many things isolated people found themselves aching for. Hugs are good for humans — perhaps more valuable than many of us realized, until we found ourselves missing them. Research has shown that hugs can lower our cortisol levels during stressful situations, and can raise oxytocin levels and maybe even lower our blood pressure. A 2015 paper published in Psychological Science even found that study subjects who got more hugs were less likely to get sick when exposed to a cold virus than those who weren’t hugged as often. So when hugging is deemed safe again, will we remember how navigate when you should and shouldn’t hug someone — and how not to hold on too long? The first rule of Hug Club: You don’t have to hug anyone you don’t want to, and it’s best to ask before going in for a squeeze — especially if it’s someone you don’t know well. Once you’ve established that your hugging partner wants a hug, you’ll probably pick up on cues as to how long it should last, like pats on the back. And don’t worry too much about hugging too tightly. The HuggieBot 1.0, a hugging robot, had three pressure settings: light, medium and extra squeeze. Alexis Block, the inventor of the squeeze machine, said that in her research, study participants most often rated the tightest hugs as their favorites.']",
"As the virus spread, private briefings from the Trump administration fueled a stock sell-off.",2020-10-15,By Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti,"['On the afternoon of Feb. 24, President Trump declared on Twitter that the coronavirus was “very much under control” in the United States, but hours earlier, senior members of the president’s economic team, privately addressing board members of the conservative Hoover Institution, were less confident. Tomas J. Philipson, a senior economic adviser to the president, told the group he could not yet estimate the effects of the virus on the American economy. To some in the group, the implication was that an outbreak could prove worse than Mr. Philipson and other Trump administration advisers were signaling in public at the time. The next day, board members — many of them Republican donors — got another taste of government uncertainty from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Hours after he had boasted on CNBC that the virus was contained in the United States and “it’s pretty close to airtight,” Mr. Kudlow delivered a more ambiguous private message. He asserted that the virus was “contained in the U.S., to date, but now we just don’t know,” according to a document describing the sessions obtained by The New York Times. The document, written by a hedge fund consultant who attended the three-day gathering of Hoover’s board, was stark. “What struck me,” the consultant wrote, was that nearly every official he heard from raised the virus “as a point of concern, totally unprovoked.” The consultant’s assessment quickly spread through parts of the investment world. U.S. stocks were already spiraling because of a warning from a federal public health official that the virus was likely to spread, but traders spotted the immediate significance: The president’s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent. Interviews with eight people who either received copies of the memo or were briefed on aspects of it as it spread among investors in New York and elsewhere provide a glimpse of how elite traders had access to information from the administration that helped them gain financial advantage during a chaotic three days when global markets were teetering. To many of the investors who received or heard about the memo, it was the first significant sign of skepticism among Trump administration officials about their ability to contain the virus. It also provided a hint of the fallout that was to come, said one major investor who was briefed on it: the upending of daily life for the entire country. “Short everything,” was the reaction of the investor, using the Wall Street term for betting on the idea that the stock prices of companies would soon fall.']",
"In India, doctors warn that deteriorating air quality could make Covid-19 even worse.",2020-10-15,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Hari Kumar,"['As a thick quilt of smog wrapped itself around New Delhi on Thursday, signaling the start of the fall pollution season, doctors and scientists warned that the deteriorating air quality could make the city’s Covid-19 problems even worse. One of the most common symptoms of severe coronavirus cases is breathing difficulty. And doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die. “If two people are shooting at the lungs, then obviously the lungs will have more problems,” said Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi, a group that raises awareness about respiratory problems. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading far and wide, putting the country on track to have the largest reported virus caseload in the coming weeks. With 7.3 million reported infections, it is just behind the United States’ 7.9 million. And each day, India outpaces the United States in new infections by around 10,000 more cases per day, even as India’s death rate remains much lower. In the background is India’s vexing air pollution, which shoots up in the fall and winter. The rapid economic growth of the past two decades — and along with it, increased urbanization and congestion — has left Indian cities horribly polluted.']",
U.S. Rebuffs Putin Bid to Extend Nuclear Arms Pact for a Year,2020-10-16,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Russia on Friday proposed extending a soon-to-expire nuclear arms treaty for one year without any changes, a move seen in Washington as a tactic to delay action on the treaty until after the American presidential election. The Trump administration swiftly dismissed Moscow’s proposal as a “non-starter.” The Russian offer came just two days after the Kremlin rejected as “nonsense” what the Trump administration hailed as a tentative deal to salvage the pact, the New Start treaty, the last remaining major arms control pact between the two biggest nuclear powers. Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, who had previously pushed hard for a five-year extension of the accord, made the surprise proposal during a videoconference with his Kremlin Security Council, saying it would be “extremely sad if the treaty ceased to exist.” While boasting that “we clearly have new weapons systems that the American side does not have, at least not yet,” Mr. Putin cast his offer as a gesture of good will toward “all states of the world that are interested in maintaining strategic stability.” A one year-extension, he added, would allow for “meaningful negotiations” to continue up to and possibly beyond early February, when the current treaty expires. It would also mean Russia could well be negotiating with a new United States president less hostile to the terms of the original Obama-era treaty than President Trump has been. The offer drew a cool reception in Washington. Within hours, the Trump administration issued a statement from Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, rejecting the offer from the Russian president. “President Putin’s response today to extend New Start without freezing nuclear warheads is a non-starter,” Mr. O’Brien said. “The United States is serious about arms control that will keep the entire world safe. We hope that Russia will reevaluate its position before a costly arms race ensues.” Mr. O’Brien repeated the administration’s proposal to extend New Start for one year, “in exchange for Russia and the United States capping all nuclear warheads during that period.” The proposal to cap all nuclear warheads would expand New Start beyond strategic weapons, its current focus, to also cover tactical nuclear warheads. Russia considers this a ploy to hobble a new generation of weapons in whose development in recent years Mr. Putin has invested large amounts of money and pride.  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, was involved in the negotiation of the original 2010 agreement and has indicated that, if elected, he would agree to a straightforward, five-year extension and work later to expand its scope. Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian Legislature’s international affairs committee, said Mr. Putin’s proposal would remove pressure for a deal before the accord expires and disentangle arms talks from pre-election politics in the United States. The Trump administration has balked at agreeing to a five-year extension without revisions, an option provided for in the original treaty and one that would not require Senate approval. Mr. Trump has deemed that unacceptable because the treaty signed by President Obama did not cover all of Russia’s nuclear arms, or any of China’s. China, however, has refused to join any revised version of New Start, arguing that its nuclear arsenal is tiny compared with those of the United States or Russia. While eager to salvage New Start, Russia has shown little interest in giving President Trump a foreign policy victory ahead of a United States presidential election now less than three weeks away, indicating, perhaps, that it expects Mr. Biden to win. Senior Russian officials this week poured scorn on claims on Tuesday by Mr. Trump’s lead negotiator, Marshall Billingslea, of an “agreement in principle, at the highest levels of our two governments, to extend the treaty.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, dismissed this as fantasy. “Washington is describing what is desired, not what is real,” Mr. Ryabkov, Russia’s chief negotiator, said in a statement. Russia’s open mockery of the supposed deal, however, left Moscow looking churlish and risked compromising Mr. Putin’s longstanding efforts to present his country as deeply committed to arms control — in contrast to the United States, which has walked away from a number of accords in the past. Mr. Putin’s proposal on Friday, said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and a veteran foreign policy analyst, suggested an attempt to correct any damage to Russia’s image from this week’s dispute, more than an offer with a real chance of being accepted. “It is just a public relations shot in the direction of discussion in the United States,” Mr. Trenin said in a telephone interview. “It just returns the ball to the U.S. and not much more.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Weston, Vt. and Michael Crowley contributed from Washington.']","With negotiations for a five-year extension stalled, the Russian president’s proposal puts pressure on President Trump to salvage an Obama-era accord."
"Its most famous coach has the virus, but college football rolls on.",2020-10-16,,"['Kurt Streeter, a sports columnist for The Times, writes about colleges’ determination to hold a football season during the pandemic. The news that Alabama Coach Nick Saban tested positive this week for the coronavirus gave an uppercut jolt to big-time college football, which is doing all it can to continue with its season — pandemic be damned. What will the jolt change? So far, after announcing the positive test, Saban has said he feels fine. “I’m not really concerned that much about my health,” he told reporters in a Zoom call from the isolation of his home. This is, of course, an unpredictable disease. Saban is 68 years old, a particularly vulnerable age for this virus. But that does not seem to matter to major college football, which keeps twisting itself into knots, straining to rationalize playing games amid a pandemic that has led to at least 217,000 deaths in the United States — with no end in sight. Even with infection hitting its most famous coach, the mind-set of the college game’s most vigorous enablers has not altered. They are bent on moving forward. “He knows the risks,” they say. “Let’s keep going.” “Move on.” Just look at how this season is unfolding. We’ve got teams playing on campuses that are seeding outbreaks in cities, regions and towns. Tuscaloosa, the University of Alabama’s home, is just one of them. None of that matters to those who would grasp for any rationalization just so they can have some college football. Move on, they say. Go ahead and play.']",
"Will Jacinda Ardern Win a Second Term? New Zealand’s Election, Explained",2020-10-16,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is popular around the world, generating gushing reviews and inspiring a progressive fan base. She has been praised for managing the pandemic, the Christchurch terrorist attack and the birth of her first child. Now, Ms. Ardern’s star turn looks likely to translate into votes at home. She is expected to return to power in this week’s general election, with polls giving her Labour Party a comfortable double-digit lead over the more conservative National Party. An especially strong showing might even give Labour the country’s first majority government since an electoral overhaul in the mid-1990s that empowered minor parties and favored coalitions. But New Zealand’s proportional voting system could also lead to some surprises, and Ms. Ardern has been vague about her plans for a potential second term. Here’s how the campaign has played out, and what to watch for as the results come in on Saturday. Support for Ms. Ardern has been surging for months, mainly because of her successful management of the coronavirus pandemic. She led a comprehensive campaign for elimination of the virus centered on a “go hard, go early” approach, with borders locked down beginning in March, expanded testing and contact tracing, and a four-level alert system that made clear what was expected of everyone. Her daily briefings with Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, became appointment viewing in part because Ms. Ardern deployed comfort and solidarity while letting science shape policy. She also connected directly with her constituents, often turning at night to Facebook Live, where she clarified complex decisions, answered questions and empathized with what she called New Zealand’s “team of five million.” New Zealanders, who warmed to Ms. Ardern after her response last year to the Christchurch terrorist attacks and the White Island volcano eruption, became even more loyal and proud as their prime minister came to be seen as the antithesis of President Trump and his response to the pandemic. New Zealand first announced the end of community transmission of the virus in May. After a new cluster emerged in August, the country returned to a targeted lockdown in Auckland, its largest city, until the virus faded again. In all, the country has recorded fewer than 2,000 cases and just 25 deaths. “In this election campaign, everything that happened before the virus no longer mattered — the first two years no longer matter, and the only thing that people are voting on is the past eight months, and which party’s going to be the strongest and the safest over the next three years,” said Morgan Godfery, a political commentator who specializes in issues affecting the Indigenous Maori. “And that’s the reason why Jacinda Ardern and the Labour Party are so widely popular — they’re the only answer for that.” It was a mixed picture. Ms. Ardern’s global popularity as a liberal standard-bearer has generally outpaced the love for her at home. As recently as January, the election was expected to be quite close, in part because Ms. Ardern had failed to fulfill many of her 2017 campaign promises — especially those related to creating an economy focused on well-being that narrows the gap between rich and poor. Income inequality has barely budged, along with child poverty, as housing costs have continued to rise, pricing more and more New Zealanders out of the market. And the government’s efforts to add supply have done little to alleviate the problem. Labour pledged to increase the housing stock by 100,000 in a decade, but reduced its own target last year after only 258 affordable homes were built. Ms. Ardern has pointed to an increase in the minimum wage as evidence of her government’s commitment, but generally, the legislation her government has passed worked around the edges of the economy. Even the pandemic has yielded what economists describe as an orthodox response focused on stimulus for infrastructure, small businesses and exports. It’s tough to tell. During the campaign against Judith Collins, the leader of the National Party, Ms. Ardern was disciplined — and very vague. “It’s a very status quo kind of campaign. There are no big promises from it,” said Ben Thomas, a former National Party press secretary. “‘We kept you safe; we steered New Zealand through Covid.’ That’s the sales pitch.” Mr. Godfery agreed. “At no point has it been clear — not in the debates where Jacinda Ardern seemed to do her best not to talk on policy — exactly what she stands for over the next three years, other than what’s already been done,” he said. The election results may dictate the extent of her boldness. If Labour wins a majority, Ms. Ardern may actually be more cautious as she looks to hold on to traditional National Party voters who have cast ballots for Labour. “Theoretically, she is unshackled now. She could do whatever she wanted to,” Mr. Hartwich said. “But I don’t think she would, because she’ll probably be thinking about the next election. The more successful she becomes, the more centrist she is likely to be.” If Ms. Ardern and Labour have to form a coalition government with the Greens, however, she may be pushed to the left, and pushed to move more quickly. Climate change would probably become a bigger priority, along with efforts to disrupt the cycle of intergenerational poverty and intergenerational wealth — issues that can be found elsewhere, but that are especially pressing in New Zealand, where there is no capital gains tax, and poverty has become entrenched in some parts of the country. Granting more local autonomy for Maori communities could also be in the cards. “Working with the Greens will give her the opportunity to expand her repertoire of how to enact policy that looks after people,” said Jennifer Curtin, director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland. “She actually may have more room to enact the things she’s aspired to with the kind of language she’s used.” New Zealanders will also decide two ballot initiatives. The first involves voluntary euthanasia. The End of Life Choice Act would give New Zealanders the option of legally requesting help to end their lives, if they meet certain criteria, which includes suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to cause their deaths within six months. If it passes, as expected, New Zealand would become the sixth country to approve assisted dying, along with several states in the United States and Australia. The second referendum, if approved, would legalize recreational use of marijuana. During the campaign, Ms. Ardern acknowledged her own marijuana use (“a long time ago,” she said), placing her squarely in the national mainstream. Roughly 80 percent of New Zealanders have tried marijuana, according to independent studies — more than double the rate for Australians, and far above what Americans report, too. But polls suggest that the initiative, which requires voters to approve specific regulations for the creation of a legal market rather than just a general principle of legalization, is likely to fail. Only Greens voters support the marijuana proposal by a wide margin in polls. Natasha Frost contributed reporting from Rotorua, New Zealand.

New Charge Adds to Ex-French President Sarkozy’s Legal Troubles,2020-10-16,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — The legal woes of the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy mounted Friday as prosecutors said he was facing a new charge in a long-running investigation into possible illegal Libyan financing of his 2007 presidential campaign. The affair has put a serious dent in the renewed political aspirations of Mr. Sarkozy, president from 2007 to 2012, and still supported by millions of center-right French voters. On Friday, after a new round of questioning from investigative magistrates in Paris, prosecutors said Mr. Sarkozy had been charged with criminal conspiracy, which ties him to the actions of a former aide, Thierry Gaubert, accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in Libyan money through a bank account in the Bahamas The new charge comes on top of three existing ones in the Libyan campaign finance affair. In the spring of 2018, the first three charges were filed, formally accusing him of misappropriating Libyan public funds, illegal campaign financing and passive corruption, a charge relating to people accused of having received money or favors. So far concrete evidence of Mr. Sarkozy’s guilt has been sparse. But in 2016 the Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, also charged and now on the run since his conviction in a separate case, said he had turned over nearly $6 million to Mr. Sarkozy and an aide at the end of 2006 and beginning of 2007. Investigators have determined that Mr. Takieddine’s bank accounts were fed by the regime of the now-dead Libyan strongman Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Whether the new charge brings Mr. Sarkozy any closer to trial in the affair, first opened the year after he left office, is unclear. On Friday the former president, best known for tough talk about illegal immigrants, Islamic terrorism, and crime, vigorously maintained his innocence. “I learned of these new charges with the greatest stupefaction,” Mr. Sarkozy wrote on Facebook on Friday. “Once again my innocence is trampled by a decision that carries not the slightest proof of any illegal financing whatsoever,” he wrote. In addition to the Libyan financing affair, Mr. Sarkozy is embroiled in two other cases in which he has been ordered to stand trial, one relating to attempts to obtain confidential information from a judge, and the other for exceeding campaign finance limits. Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Sarkozy has managed to remain a force in center-right French politics. His counsel is still sought by many in the Republican political party, whose makeover he engineered, and even by President Emmanuel Macron. The French news media regularly reports on contacts between the two men, and Mr. Macron’s rightward shift in the latter part of his presidency owes much to the themes championed by Mr. Sarkozy.

Man Beheads Teacher on the Street in France and Is Killed by Police,2020-10-16,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — A knife-wielding man decapitated a teacher near a school in a suburb north of Paris on Friday afternoon and was later shot dead by the police, officials said, abruptly hitting France with a national trauma that revived memories of recent terrorist attacks. A police officer and parents with knowledge of the attack confirmed French media reports that the victim was a history teacher at the school who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression, which had incited anger among some Muslim families.  The teacher, still unidentified by Friday evening, was immediately depicted as a martyr to freedom of expression across the political spectrum. Representatives in France’s Parliament rose to their feet to “honor the victim’s memory,” as the president of the session, parliamentary deputy Hugues Renson, declared. And President Emmanuel Macron hurried to the scene of the attack Friday night. “This was an attempt to strike down the republic,” Mr. Macron said. Seizing on the symbolic nature of an attack against a schoolteacher, and reprising anti-Islamist themes he has lately emphasized, Mr. Macron said the teacher had been “the victim of a terrorist, Islamist attack.” The teacher was struck down “because he taught, because he taught the liberty of expression, the liberty to believe and not believe,” the French president said in a brief televised address. France’s antiterrorism prosecutors immediately took over the investigation of the attack, which happened at the junction of two adjoining Paris suburbs, Eragny and Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. Much remained obscure Friday night in the absence of an official police narrative. But the underlying themes of what was known conjured up France’s recent history of terrorist attacks: an assailant carefully choosing a victim thought to symbolize an offense against Islam. Turmoil at the school over the teacher’s method of instruction — Mr. Macron alluded to this in his remarks — had evidently preceded the killing. “We have seen the principal, who in these last weeks has withstood with remarkable courage a great deal of pressure,” Mr. Macron said. In a video that widely circulated on YouTube before the attack, a Muslim parent at the teacher’s school, College du Bois-d’Aulne, expresses anger that an unidentified teacher had asked Muslims in the class of 13-year-olds to leave because “he was going to show a photo that would shock them.” The parent asks on the video: “Why this hatred? Why does a history teacher act like this in front of 13-year-olds?” The assailant is not known to have a connection to the school. French media reported that he was 18 and of Russian origin. A police union official told the French television station BFM that witnesses had seen the assailant cutting the victim’s throat. The national police were called, officials said, and after having discovered the decapitated victim, confronted the assailant nearby, close to the school. Brandishing a large knife, he threatened the officers, and after refusing to surrender, was shot 10 times, they said. French media, quoting witnesses, said the assailant was heard to yell “Allahu akbar” at the moment of the knife attack. A photograph of a corpse lying in the middle of a leafy suburban street appeared on French television not long afterward. The attack came three weeks after a knife-wielding assailant wounded two people in Paris near the site of the former Charlie Hebdo office — the scene of a 2015 terrorist attack targeting the satirical newspaper for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. French officials of all political stripes rushed to denounce the teacher’s killing. The interior minister, in charge of the police, cut short an official trip to Morocco and flew home to Paris. “The assassination of a history teacher is an attack on freedom of expression and the values of the republic,” the president of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, said on Twitter. “To attack a teacher is to attack all French citizens and freedom.” “Frightful. Huge emotion and anger in the face of this terrorist barbarism,” a leading Socialist parliamentarian, Boris Vallaud, wrote on Twitter. In the video, the parent details what his daughter told him had transpired in the class. “So this week, he allowed himself to tell them, the Muslims, Muslim students raise your hands,” the parents says. “So they raised their hands, and he said, ‘right, leave the class.’ So my daughter refused to leave and asked him, ‘why?’ And he said he was going to show a photo that would shock them. And then he showed them a naked man, telling them it was the prophet.” Another parent, Carine Mendes, 41, whose child had attended the class, offered a more nuanced view of what happened. She called the teacher “a very sweet person, in his words, in his expressions.” Ms. Mendes said the teacher had suggested to Muslim students who did not want to see the cartoon that they leave the classroom temporarily, and had asked those who remained not to tell their Muslim classmates about the cartoon in order not to offend their faith. “He really tried to do things with respect, he didn’t want to hurt anyone,” she said. But in a second class where the teacher gave the course, a shocked student refused to leave the room and told her father about what happened. He was the father who later complained in the video posted online. The next day, the teacher apologized to his students and the principal sent an email message to parents to try to clear up the situation. The teacher’s suggestion to leave the classroom, the principal said, had been insensitive. “Without wanting to offend anyone, it turned out that by offering this possibility to the students, he still offended the student,” the principal’s email read. Ms. Mendes said that what happened “was awful.” “He was just giving a course on freedom of expression,” she said. “A teacher was killed just for doing his job,” Sophie Venetitay, a teachers’ union official, told BFM.

"Faced with twin crises, Britain’s leader is stalling for time.",2020-10-16,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['For Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the pandemic and the looming domestic upheaval it has overshadowed — Brexit — are linked. The economic turmoil unleashed by the pandemic has raised the pressure on Mr. Johnson to avoid the self-inflicted disruption of ruptured negotiations with the European Union over Britain’s withdrawal. The prime minister has now reached a moment of truth on the two issues that have dominated Britain this year: the pandemic and the withdrawal talks. But he is still playing for time, a strategy that could put lives or livelihoods at risk if he waits too long. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson inched closer to imposing more limits on the country. But he stuck to his argument that the best way to curb the coronavirus was through targeted responses, not the two-week nationwide lockdown pushed by the opposition Labour Party and his own scientific advisers. The prime minister also seemed ready to string out trade talks with Brussels, letting a self-imposed deadline pass on Thursday without a deal. While Mr. Johnson could torpedo the negotiations on Friday, after a two-day summit meeting of European Union leaders, analysts said the British government still appeared eager to strike an agreement by the legal deadline of Dec. 31. Mr. Johnson’s reluctance to move decisively on either front, the virus or Brexit, risks making both worse, analysts say. Dragging out the talks with Brussels could put Britain in a bind if the two sides hit an impasse as the clock runs out. Putting off a short lockdown — which experts have dubbed a “circuit breaker” — could necessitate a longer lockdown later, according to medical experts. “If you’re going to do it, do it early, fast and hard,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “The longer they delay, the less likely a two-week circuit breaker will work.” Most bars and pubs will be closed starting Saturday in Lancashire, in northwest England, as the region of about one million people moves into the highest level of the country’s three-tier alert system, which is reserved for areas with the highest rates of infection. People will also be barred from socializing indoors with members of other households.']",
"In Hong Kong, Communist Party Officials Stride Out of the Shadows",2020-10-16,"By Austin Ramzy, Vivian Wang and Chris Buckley","['HONG KONG — It was a classic scene from the Chinese Communist Party’s repertoire: A high-ranking official descended on the home of a poor, patriotic worker, bearing gifts and wishes for a happy National Day, receiving declarations of gratitude and loyalty in return. But the visit this month did not take place in a hardscrabble village in mainland China, where officials often make such scripted trips to show their bond with the masses. It played out in Hong Kong, the semiautonomous territory where such overt displays by the Communist Party apparatus were once rare. The much-publicized meeting carried a clear message, made all the more potent since China imposed a new national security law in Hong Kong this summer. The days of the central government exercising its will behind the scenes are over. Now, it will rule Hong Kong increasingly in the open. “Hong Kong’s responsibility to the nation should be emphasized more than ever,” Luo Huining, Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong, who leads the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government, said in a speech a day before his visit. “Loving our country is an obligation and a righteous path rather than a choice.” For Hong Kong, the shift to more direct management by Beijing is a drastic change. The Communist Party for decades allowed the former British colony to be steered by its proxies in the civil service and the business elite. For Beijing, subduing Hong Kong is seen as fundamental to broader national control. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, is intent on extending party dominance across the entire country, especially in Hong Kong, an enclave of resistance that erupted in protest last year. At the heart of Beijing’s new drive for control is the liaison office, its official arm in Hong Kong. Historically, the office kept a low profile, serving — as its name implies — as a go-between, shuttling messages and demands between top Chinese officials and the Hong Kong authorities. But in recent months, the office has started regularly blaring orders and warnings that underscore its newly elevated role. The liaison office accused a professor of instigating an anti-party insurrection. It demanded that pro-democracy politicians cancel informal primary elections. It warned Hong Kong teachers to make sure their students are immersed in patriotic Chinese values. On Monday, two days before Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was set to deliver her annual policy address, she abruptly announced a postponement until she could consult top Chinese leaders about her proposals. She said she would travel to Beijing to “personally explain why these measures are important.” Many of Hong Kong’s traditional power brokers appear resigned to the new reality. “It has become one-way traffic,” said James Tien, a former pro-Beijing lawmaker and influential magnate. The liaison office was born in secrecy, posing during the British colonial era as an outlet of China’s main news agency. When Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, China’s rulers were eager to harness the commercial energy of Hong Kong and to learn from its business leaders — and the office operated in the background. “Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong” was the mantra. But in recent years, central leaders appeared to lose faith in that hands-off arrangement, especially as demonstrations convulsed the city. Beijing pushed through the security law with little input from Hong Kong. It gave local leaders, including Mrs. Lam, little advance notice. “They learned from our bitter experience,” said Regina Ip, a member of Mrs. Lam’s cabinet, referring to a Hong Kong government effort she led in 2003 to enact similar legislation, which was derailed by popular opposition. “What’s the point of consultation?” The law allows China’s security agencies to set up offices and operate openly in Hong Kong, and a mainland official heads a new national security office. Mr. Luo, the liaison office head, is also the national security adviser. Mr. Luo, who was appointed in January, embodies the central government’s push for tighter control. While Beijing’s previous top officials had spent considerable time in the city before getting promoted, Mr. Luo had minimal experience there. There is little evidence that Mr. Luo speaks much Cantonese, the local Chinese language, and he has kept his distance from the city’s elite. Mr. Luo rarely meets with pro-Beijing lawmakers, leaving such talks to his deputy, said Mrs. Ip. What he does have is the trust of Mr. Xi, who appears to favor Mr. Luo as a provincial official with a specialty in cleaning up unruly provinces and wayward cadres. Mr. Luo rose through the party ranks in Anhui, a rural, inland province. When he was transferred to Qinghai Province, he pressed forward efforts to absorb the large Tibetan minority into China’s mainstream. Mr. Luo later won Mr. Xi’s plaudits for purging officials in Shanxi, a coal-rich province where corruption was endemic. Some now half-jokingly describe Mr. Luo as Hong Kong’s Communist Party secretary. That title does not officially exist but conveys the shift under Mr. Luo’s watch. In China, the party secretary outranks other local officials. “The relationship between the liaison office and the Hong Kong government is already likened to a party secretary versus a mayor in China,” said Eliza Lee, a professor of politics at the University of Hong Kong. “That kind of relationship will become increasingly normalized.” The liaison office’s growing status can be seen in its physical footprint. The number of properties it owns in the city has tripled over the past three decades, to include hundreds of apartment buildings, offices, retail units and parking spots. Reflecting its increased staff in the city, an office subsidiary bought at least 20 residential properties last year, according to Hong Kong records. It also oversees a publishing company, Sino United, that dominates retail book sales in Hong Kong. At one of its bookstores, a table was piled with titles such as “Hong Kong’s Disturbance,” a collection of reports about the 2019 protests by China’s state news agency, and “The Dawn Breaking Through Hong Kong’s Dark Night” — a reference to the security law.  Newspapers owned by the liaison office, long dismissed as propaganda, are now studied for clues about Beijing’s intentions in Hong Kong. Lately, the newspapers — Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po — have railed against what they call overly lenient judges who have dismissed prosecutions of protesters, and establishment lawmakers have followed with calls for judicial reforms, including establishing a council to set sentences.  Late last month, the liaison office convened a meeting with establishment politicians to discuss the legislature’s priorities. According to a meeting summary sent to other members by Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, the office made clear that it wanted to prioritize the “three mountains” of reforming education, the judiciary and social services. Other officials confirmed the meeting but disputed his characterization, saying the office was simply attempting to canvas views. They also said such meetings were typical, as the liaison office has traditionally helped organize the establishment bloc in the Legislative Council, by mediating conflicts and deciding who runs where in elections. The office’s expanded playbook was clear in Mr. Luo’s recent visits to low-income residents. After chatting with one man, a chef who lost his job last year, Mr. Luo told his deputies to quickly find him work, according to an office statement. Such photo ops have been relatively uncommon, and a focus on specific policies and questions of social welfare is even more unusual. The next day, several pro-Beijing politicians called on the Hong Kong government to expand its support for low-income residents. One of them, Bill Tang, said Hong Kong had not done enough to help the unemployed, and cited the central government’s campaign to end poverty in the mainland. “I really hope that such a spirit can also be on Hong Kong,” Mr. Tang said in an interview. Xu Tianmin, the chef visited by Mr. Luo, was thrilled by the attention from Beijing. On social media, Mr. Xu, who arrived from the mainland seven years ago, seems ardently patriotic, rallying against Hong Kong demonstrators and removing protest messages from the so-called Lennon Walls. He told one state-owned newspaper that his pro-government activism was the reason he had lost his last job. “I never thought that I would be visited,” he told another paper. “I’m so thankful to the liaison office for its concern for residents at the grass roots.” But in the days after the visit, the glow faded a little. The city’s opposition camp questioned the scripted nature of the visit and reported donations of protective gear to Mr. Xu’s hometown. Mr. Xu declined to be interviewed in person, but in a brief exchange over a messaging app, he said he had not yet found full-time work and was still scraping by with temporary construction jobs. Many people had tried to help him find a job after the news of his meeting, he said. But it was friends who reached out with potential opportunities — not the liaison office. Cao Li contributed reporting in Hong Kong.']",The growing power and profile of the Chinese government’s liaison office has brought the party’s playbook into the open.
"Suspect Stalked French School Before Beheading Teacher, Officials Say",2020-10-17,By Norimitsu Onishi and Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — The suspect in the beheading of a history teacher in a Paris suburb was an 18-year-old immigrant of Chechen descent who was angered by the classroom display of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, French officials said on Saturday. The suspect, identified by the authorities as Abdoulakh A., stalked the area outside the school on Friday afternoon before following the teacher, whom he stabbed and decapitated with a knife, Jean-François Ricard, the top antiterrorism prosecutor, said at a news conference. “The individual was in front of the college in the afternoon and asked students to indicate the future victim to him,’’ Mr. Ricard said, referring to the middle school where the teacher, Samuel Paty, had taught. The suspect was fatally shot by the police in a confrontation soon after the killing, which took place in Eragny, a suburb near the school. Investigators found a message planning the attack on the suspect’s cellphone, written a few hours before, Mr. Ricard said. Then, shortly before he was killed by the police, the suspect uploaded a photograph of the victim to Twitter, he added. The gruesome killing appeared to be the culmination of a couple of weeks of tension at the school, Collège du Bois-d’Aulne, in a quiet, middle-class suburb north of Paris. Muslim parents upset over the classroom display of two caricatures published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo had contacted school and police officials, but videos uploaded on social media by one father widened the dispute to an outside audience. Investigators were still trying to piece together how the suspect spent his days before the attack, Mr. Ricard said. But the suspect did not appear to have any direct ties to the school or to have been previously involved in the dispute. Born in Moscow, the suspect lived in France with the status of a refugee, Mr. Ricard said, adding that he was not known to antiterrorism officials. The brutal killing was the second violent episode within weeks to be linked to the caricatures published by Charlie Hebdo, which had led to deadly attacks in Paris in 2015. Last month, as the trial of accomplices in the 2015 attack got underway, the magazine republished the drawings — an act that was seen as a bold statement in the name of freedom of expression by some but as reckless and unnecessary provocation by others. Last month, a 25-year-old Pakistani immigrant attacked two people outside the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, apparently angered after watching videos showing protests in Pakistan against the republication of the cartoons. Beyond its brutality, Friday’s killing hit a far bigger nerve in France as President Emmanuel Macron and other top government officials rushed to the scene on Friday evening. Jean-Michel Blanquer, the minister of national education, said that in Friday’s killing, it was “the republic that was attacked.’’ France said a ceremony would be organized to pay national homage to the slain teacher. The minister’s words reflected the central role played by France’s public schools — hewing to a national curriculum established by the central government — in instilling civic values and a national identity. But they also underscored the recurring tensions between France’s traditional republican values and those of newer arrivals, especially those of Muslim faith who oppose the publication of the caricatures. The tensions at Collège du Bois-d’Aulne emerged early this month as the teacher — who was 47 and, according to parents and students, had taught at the school for only few years — broached the topic of freedom of expression. To illustrate the topic, the teacher showed his students — mostly 13-year-olds — two caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that had appeared in Charlie Hebdo, Mr. Ricard said. According to an email sent later to the parents by the school principal, the teacher asked students who might be offended by the material to look away or to temporarily leave the classroom. The teacher realized his clumsiness and apologized, according to the email, which was obtained by The New York Times. Cécile Ribet-Retel, the president of PEEP de Conflans, the local chapter of a national parents’ association, said her group heard from about 20 parents, who expressed their anger or their support for the teacher. Parents met with school officials and both sides appeared to be working toward an understanding, Ms. Ribet-Retel said. “But then the information got on social media, was amplified and distorted,’’ Ms. Ribet-Retel said. “And it became impossible to manage.’’ One particularly vocal parent — the father of a 13-year-old girl who was upset by the caricatures — met with the principal and demanded that the teacher be fired, Mr. Ricard said. The father uploaded critical and angry videos on social media on Oct. 7 and Oct. 12, identifying the teacher and the school, he said. Laurent Brosse, the mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, the Paris suburb where the school is, said local officials warned police intelligence that the situation appeared to be spiraling out of control because of the video. “We did what seemed important to us at that moment,’’ Mr. Brosse said, adding, “We know that this question about the freedom of expression stirs up tensions in society.’’ But despite these warnings, “there was no action,’’ Ms. Ribet-Retel said. The video was widely shared on social networks by individuals denouncing anti-Muslim racism and even official accounts of mosques and of Muslim organizations. “It was blown out of proportion in the Muslim community,’’ said Siham Touazi, a councilor in an adjoining municipality, who received messages linking to the video in several WhatsApp groups. The killing came just weeks after Mr. Macron unveiled a plan to combat what he described as the threat of “Islamist separatism” to France’s secularism. Mr. Macron focused in part on education, especially on beating back what he described as threats to the secular values taught in the nation’s schools and citing the example of Muslim parents who were opposed to letting their children take swimming lessons. “The situation has become so tense in our country over the issues of secularism and Islam that it’s become impossible to have a reasonable conversation,’’ said Gérard Pommier, the national president of PEEP, the parents’ association. The slain teacher — described by Ms. Ribet-Retel and many current and former students as a committed and serious instructor — appeared to try to navigate the tensions in his class on freedom of expression. While he showed two caricatures to his class, he suggested that those who might be offended — implicitly Muslim students — leave or look away. In France, where it is illegal to ask people their religion, the teacher’s proposal seemed to violate the country’s secularism, said Rodrigo Arenas, co-president of the F.C.P.E., another parents’ association. Aude Clabaut, a teacher at another school in the area, said that the slain teacher should not have asked students to leave the classroom. But she said that she was frustrated by the growing challenges to secularism in her own classroom, with some students refusing to remove their veils and Muslim parents contesting secularism courses. “I am sad and I am furious,” said Ms. Clabaut, who joined a group of people on Saturday in front of the school where the slain teacher worked. Hundreds of students and parents, as well as residents of the city, gathered to pay tribute to the teacher, at one point singing “La Marseillaise,” the national anthem. Some held signs that read “I am a teacher,” in direct reference to the “I am Charlie” support signs that popped up by the thousands hours after the 2015 attack on the magazine. Several students hugged each other, their eyes swollen with tears. But tensions were also present on Saturday afternoon, as some did not hesitate to directly point to Islamism. A man holding a sign — “ Political Islam is a cancer. We eliminate it or we die from it” — was briefly interrogated by the police and had his sign seized. Norimitsu Onishi reported from Paris, and Constant Méheut from Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.

Trump and Biden offer starkly different views of the pandemic during dueling events.,2020-10-16,By Annie Karni and Reid J. Epstein,"['In one of his final prime-time television events before Election Day, President Trump, who is trailing in national and battleground polls, offered little new to voters who may still be undecided, staking out positions on the coronavirus that are at odds with both the scientific consensus and public opinion. Simultaneously, on another network, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. presented a very different vision of the country, promoting a federal response to the pandemic led by health experts. Mr. Trump arrived at his town-hall event, which took place in Miami and aired on NBC, with a simple pitch: People should vote for him “because we’ve done a great job.” Mr. Biden’s goal for the evening was to both push back on that argument and allow Mr. Trump to keep the focus on himself — something the president appeared happy to do. With 19 days until Election Day and cases of the virus rising again in much of the country, Mr. Trump said, falsely, “We’re coming around the corner.” He added, “Vaccines are coming soon and our economy is strong.” In reality, it is not clear when a coronavirus vaccine will be widely available to the public and no medical experts have agreed with him that the country — which recorded at least 65,000 new virus cases on Thursday and has averaged about 700 deaths a day over the past week — is rounding the corner. Mr. Biden, appearing on ABC from Philadelphia, attacked Mr. Trump for his handling of the pandemic, saying, “He missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true.” Mr. Biden called for a national standard” to combat the outbreak, which has killed over 215,000 people in the United States.']",
"In One of the World’s Longest Lockdowns, One Man is Omnipresent",2020-10-16,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. MELBOURNE, Australia — Last weekend, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews surpassed a rather astonishing milestone: 100 consecutive daily news conferences, many of them lasting hours, to address the state’s coronavirus response and what has become one of the world’s longest pandemic-related lockdowns. News conferences from state-level politicians are often bigger news in Australia than they might be elsewhere — maybe it reflects voter engagement or just a slower news cycle. But because most of metropolitan Melbourne’s five million residents are stuck at home, and because Andrews’ remarks serve as the best and most reliable update on the circumstances of our lives, these daily events have become a kind of communal spectacle. It is now a ritual for many of us to wake up, wait for the daily tally of new cases to be released, and then wait to hear when Andrews’ news conference will take place. There’s even a Twitter account dedicated to answering that question, with the handle @WhatTimeIsDansPresser. His daily briefings range from the dramatic — like the day he announced that thousands of people in nine public housing towers would effectively and immediately be put under house arrest — to the mundane. They inspire viral moments, hashtags (#dictatordan, #istandwithdan, #getonthebeers) and memes, and we are all there to watch these cultural curiosities unfold in real time. Mr. Andrews, who has been Victoria’s premier since 2014, has a policy of staying through every single question from the press gallery, and much of the recent Australian media coverage of his pandemic marathon has focused on what these 100 days of conferences tell us about journalism, and also about the online abuse many participating journalists face from the pro and anti-Andrews camps. It’s true that this situation has allowed the public to see the minutiae of certain forms of journalism play out in ways that are usually not broadcast to a wide audience (if at all), but to me it is Andrews himself — and our relationship to him — that is so fascinating. During the worst days of the pandemic, when it was clear that the premier was barely sleeping, the daily conferences presented him in an almost Shakespearean light, and I was afraid we were watching the psychological crumbling of a man in real time. Despite the partisan hashtags populating Twitter, most of the people I know were simply worried for Andrews’ health and well-being — along with the health and well-being of our other fellow Victorians. If this has been a Herculean act of stamina, it has also been an impressive — and sometimes frustrating — political performance. Andrews may stay for every question, but he certainly does not give answers beyond his own predetermined message: Stay the course; get tested; this is hard; it is also neccessary. But that’s part of what has made these news conferences so compelling — it’s rare to see a politician be so human, and in turn observe how a regular human could be so viscerally political. I feel I know Andrews as well as I’ve ever known any politician in my lifetime. I’ve certainly spent more (virtual) time with him. And like so many others, I’m ready for the relationship and the sense of crisis to fade. With Melbourne’s coronavirus numbers today as low as they’ve been since the beginning of the pandemic, here’s hoping this test of endurance — for the city and for the premier — will be over soon. I’ll be tuning in on Sunday, when Andrews is set to announce the next steps out of lockdown — along with everyone else. Have you been watching Andrews’ daily news conferences? What stands out to you?

"Armenia and Azerbaijan Reach New Cease-Fire for Nagorno-Karabakh, Then Report Violations",2020-10-17,By Anton Troianovski,"['GORIS, Armenia — Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a new cease-fire in their conflict over a disputed territory, the countries said Saturday, days after a truce negotiated a week earlier had unraveled. The warring neighbors in the southern Caucasus region announced the agreement over the disputed territory, Nagorno-Karabakh, in terse statements issued by their foreign ministries late Saturday, describing it as a “humanitarian truce” to allow prisoners and the remains of the dead to be exchanged. The new cease-fire took effect at midnight, but, as with a Russian-brokered cease-fire reached a week earlier, the fighting has continued, with each side accusing the other on Sunday of violating the truce. France said it mediated the latest cease-fire in the days and hours leading up to Saturday’s announcement, in coordination with Russia and the United States. “This cease-fire must be unconditional and strictly observed by both parties,” the office of President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a statement. “France will be very attentive to this and will remain committed so that hostilities cease on a lasting basis and that credible discussions can quickly begin.” Any halt in the conflict would be welcome for people in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, in the volatile southern Caucasus region between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. The war has already killed more than 600 Armenian soldiers, scores of civilians and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis. It has threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict, with the potential to further draw in Turkey, Azerbaijan’s main ally; Russia, which has a mutual defense agreement with Armenia; and even the region’s southern neighbor, Iran. Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnically Armenian enclave that is part of Azerbaijan under international law but is closely aligned with Armenia. A previous war over Nagorno-Karabakh, in the early 1990s, killed some 20,000 people and displaced about a million, most of them Azerbaijanis. Years of tensions since then between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave’s status erupted into open warfare on Sept. 27, with Azerbaijan seeking to take control of the territory by force. On Saturday, Azerbaijan said 14 people were killed in the city of Ganja, the country’s second-largest, in an overnight missile attack by Armenia. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, had also been attacked overnight Friday, the din of air raid sirens and explosions echoing through the largely empty city into early Saturday morning. Along the front, Azerbaijan and Armenia have engaged in trench warfare and artillery combat, taking heavy casualties while fighting for small bits of territory.']",A truce brokered just a week earlier failed to hold.

Bill Offering L.G.B.T. Protections in Italy Spurs Rallies on Both Sides,2020-10-17,By Emma Bubola,"['ROME — Protesters turned out in force on Saturday for rival demonstrations on a bill that would make anti-L.G.B.T. violence a hate crime carrying harsher penalties than under current law, coming out by the hundreds in Rome despite a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the country. Demonstrations were planned throughout the country ahead of a parliamentary vote planned for this coming week, with supporters framing the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights and protection from attack, and opponents depicting it as an overreaching step that would also suppress opinion and religious beliefs. “We have been through centuries of discrimination,” said Marlon Landolfo, 21, who recounted a vicious homophobic attack on him and another man in northern Italy last month. “Now it’s 2020 and we are still discussing a law that protects us for what we are.” The bill under debate would explicitly recognize anti-L.G.B.T. and anti-women hate crimes and hate speech by including those offenses under an existing law that makes discrimination, violence or incitement to violence based on someone’s race or religion a crime punishable by up to four years in prison. Current law does not have a specific designation for such offenses against L.G.B.T. people, and as a result, homophobic or transphobic assaults are tried on lesser charges than racially motivated or anti-Semitic ones. The bill, which appears to have the support of a parliamentary majority, makes discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity an aggravating circumstance, which could mean added time to sentences. Decades of efforts and multiple attempts to extend protections to L.G.B.T people have failed in Italy, making the country an outlier among Western European democracies such as Britain, France and Spain. Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016 but does not allow same-sex marriage. Within the European Union, it is joined by Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria in not responding to European Parliament appeals for member states to prosecute hate crimes and hate speech motivated by homophobia and transphobia. Supporters of the bill face resistance from traditional opponents such as conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church, but also from some less expected corners, such as one group of feminists. Proponents say a change would allow the authorities to keep statistics on homophobic and transphobic attacks, provide a deterrent and send a clear message that these are hate crimes. Mr. Landolfo, his ankle still sore after a beating last month in the city of Padua, said he felt disheartened by the debate around the new bill. He and another young man, Mattias Fascina, had held hands and exchanged a quick kiss during a date on a September night when a gang mocked them, then punched and kicked them while shouting homophobic slurs. Under Italian law, the pair cannot be considered victims of a hate crime. The attack on Mr. Landolfo is not an isolated case. Arcigay, Italy’s leading L.G.B.T. association, records more than 100 episodes of violence, hate and discrimination every year. In September, in the northern city of Novara, a man kicked his lesbian neighbor and broke her nose. In the city of Bergamo, residents of an apartment complex insulted and threatened two homosexual neighbors, prompting them to temporarily move out of their apartment. “These episodes rarely turn into official complaints,” said Francesca Rupalti, a lawyer with Rete Lenford, a network of lawyers for L.G.B.T. rights. “Without a specific law, it is hard to prove homophobic acts.” Alessandro Zan, a member of Parliament with the center-left Democratic Party who proposed the bill, said its ratification would denote a significant cultural shift in a society with deep patriarchal and conservative roots. “These people are particularly exposed to hate crimes,” he said. “This is why we particularly need to protect them.” Unlike the United States, where speech is largely protected by the First Amendment, Italy and many other European countries scarred by fascism and Nazism have stricter laws against preaching racial or ethnic superiority. They have also outlawed blatantly discriminatory associations or groups. “Laws need to balance freedom of expression and hatred,” Mr. Zan said. “This law says clearly that discriminating against L.G.B.T. people and inciting violence against them is not an opinion.” Some opponents of the bill say it will cross the line into censorship. They have presented hundreds of amendments — including one that mockingly asked to extend protection to bald or white-haired people — in order to slow down the legislative process. One objection is that the bill, which opponents have dubbed a “gag law,” could be used to suppress dissenting opinions about same-sex marriage or adoption by homosexual couples. A prominent opponent, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, said the bill “puts ideas on trial” and has insisted that Italy does not discriminate anyway. Supporters say the bill would not infringe on free speech or religious liberty. Groups or individuals, they say, will still be able to promote and discuss their values as long as they do not engage in violent behavior or incite violence and hatred. The nationalist and conservative political opposition has been joined by Italy’s Catholic bishops. That has unnerved advocates for the bill who had been encouraged by tolerant remarks from Pope Francis. The pope told a gay man in 2018 that God had made him that way, and in 2013 famously said “Who am I to judge?” when asked about a priest said to be gay — a dramatic change of tone in Vatican comments on homosexuality. But the Italian bishops conference, which is influential in domestic politics, has argued that the measure could criminalize expression of the church’s belief that marriage should be between a woman and a man, if it were interpreted as incitement to discrimination. The bishops said in a statement that Italian law already has tools available to punish violent and discriminatory behavior, and that adding more “incriminatory norms” would threaten liberty. Some opponents from the left have also joined the fight against the proposed law. Although many leading feminist groups in the Western world have expressed support for L.G.B.T. protections, a group of well-known Italian feminists has criticized the pending bill for embracing a broader definition of women by using the term “gender identity,” which would include transgender women. In an open letter published on a notable feminist website, the 13 signatories argued that the progress made against sexual discrimination against women in Italy would be undercut if the broader concept of gender identity is applied. Francesca Izzo, a former member of Parliament with the Democratic Party who signed the letter, said that while it was important to fight homophobia and transphobia, it was a separate issue from the overall rights of women. Proponents of the law reject that argument. Mr. Zan, the lawmaker, said that feminists and L.G.B.T. people were fighting the same battle. “Violence against L.G.B.T. people is just another consequence of sexism,” he said. “Anatomy is not a person’s destiny.”']",Supporters frame the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights.

India Is About to Find Out,2020-10-15,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Hari Kumar,"['NEW DELHI — As a thick quilt of smog wrapped itself around New Delhi on Thursday, signaling the start of the fall pollution season, doctors and scientists warned that the deteriorating air quality could make the city’s Covid-19 problems even worse. One of the most common symptoms of severe coronavirus cases is breathing difficulty. And doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die. “If two people are shooting at the lungs, then obviously the lungs will have more problems,” said Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi, a group that raises awareness about respiratory problems. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading far and wide, putting the country on track to have the largest reported virus caseload in the coming weeks. With 7.3 million reported infections, it is just behind the United States’ 7.9 million. And each day, India outpaces the United States in new infections by around 10,000 more cases per day, even as India’s death rate remains much lower. In the background is India’s vexing air pollution, which shoots up in the fall and winter. The rapid economic growth of the past two decades — and along with it, increased urbanization and congestion — has left Indian cities horribly polluted. Last year, India was once again home to 14 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air globally, and health experts have detailed how such conditions can lead to brain damage, respiratory problems and early death. In the fall, air temperatures and wind speeds drop, condensing pollutants over India’s cities, especially in the north. And farmers in the surrounding rural areas burn the stalks and refuse from their crop, sending up huge clouds of black smoke that drift for miles. This year there have been five times the number of farm refuse fires in northern India as the same period last year, and experts say it is a bad sign of what’s to come. The agricultural sector has been a rare bright spot in an Indian economy that has been shattered by the pandemic, and pollution experts fear that more farming will mean more burning. “My gut is it’s going to be a bumper, bumper harvest and a bumper, bumper combustion event, probably the biggest of our lifetime,” said Jai Dhar Gupta, an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur. “And now that you’ve got the combined impact of a respiratory virus and respiratory contaminants, every public health specialist is holding their breath to see what happens,” Mr. Gupta said. “We’re just sitting ducks,” he added. Doctors say long-term exposure to severely polluted air can cause chronic lung inflammation, which can leave people who are exposed to the coronavirus more vulnerable. A recent study from Italy found a correlation between long-term exposure to dirty air and an increase in excess mortality — a measure of deaths above normal — from the coronavirus. “Pollution-afflicted areas will have a higher incidence of Covid,” said Dr. Kumar, the chest surgeon. “And once this population gets Covid, they then have a higher chance of mortality.” Up until now, people in New Delhi this year had been spoiled in terms of breathable air. When a coronavirus lockdown in the spring shut down many industries and kept cars off the road, Delhi’s skies turned a miraculous blue. It was the cleanest air in decades, and at night, residents felt as if they were being treated to a star show. Constellations that hadn’t been seen for years shone above the apartment blocks. But that has become a dim memory. The sky is back to its usual hazy brown, and the city now smells of smoke. The Delhi government is doing more this year to fight pollution, including setting up a war room to track pollution hot spots and turning to anti-smog guns that blast mist into the air to knock down the dust. On Thursday, officials in Delhi, which is controlled by a progressive opposition political party, got locked into a blame game with national politicians who are part of the right-leaning administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Delhi officials blamed the Modi government for not doing enough to stop crop burning in the states that ring the capital. Modi administration officials argued that crop burning contributed only a minuscule amount to overall air pollution, and they blamed the Delhi government for not doing enough to control dust. Many more people in India’s cities are donning masks these days because of the pandemic, but experts say this probably won’t help much. Most people wear cloth masks or surgical-type masks that don’t seal well and won’t stop someone from inhaling small pollution particles (or the virus, either). Pollution alerts whizzed around the city via WhatsApp messages on Thursday. “Delhi pollution level reported hazardous. 335,” read one message, referring to an Air Quality Index reading of 335, about six times as bad as that of New York City. The message continued: “Be Careful. Seniors don’t go out. Wear mask.”']","Every fall, air pollution spikes in India. Doctors worry what it will mean for coronavirus patients with breathing problems."
Indonesia overtakes the Philippines as the hardest-hit country in Southeast Asia.,2020-10-16,By Richard C. Paddock and Dera Menra Sijabat,"['Indonesia, where coronavirus cases have been rising steadily for months, has overtaken the Philippines and now leads Southeast Asia in the number of reported cases and deaths from the coronavirus. Together, Indonesia and the Philippines account for nearly 90 percent of the confirmed cases in the region, and both countries expect to see their economies contract this year. As of Friday, Indonesia has reported 353,461 cases and the Philippines 351,750. More significantly, Indonesia’s death toll of 12,347 is nearly double that of the Philippines and is the highest in East Asia. “Indonesia’s death rate has always been high, and it shows that we have failed in the early detection of cases,” said Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist at Australia’s Griffith University. “Indonesia has to change its strategy by increasing testing massively and aggressively.” Because of the lack of testing, he said, many patients come to the hospital only when they are too sick to be helped. The actual number of cases is likely to be two to 10 times higher than the official figure, he said. The virus in the Philippines remains out of control, he added, but the government there has had more success in containing it by increasing its testing. As a whole, Southeast Asia’s 11 countries have done relatively well in containing the virus. With a population of 655 million, the region reports about 820,000 cases. That is fewer than either California or Texas, which have much smaller populations, although both states have significantly higher testing rates. Vietnam and Thailand have led the way, and neither country has reported a case of local transmission in weeks. Between them, they report fewer than 4,800 cases and only 94 deaths since the pandemic began. But other countries, such as Myanmar and Malaysia, have seen a large spike in cases over the past 10 days and have imposed partial lockdowns in some areas. Both countries had limited the virus’s spread earlier this year but are now wrestling with the surge in cases even as they face possible leadership changes.']",
Cyprus Ends ‘Golden Passport’ Program After Corruption Accusations,2020-10-15,By Isabella Kwai,"['The small Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus has given citizenship and passports to more than 3,000 foreigners who agreed to invest at least $2 million in the country — a “golden passport” that allowed the holders to travel visa-free throughout the European Union. But this week Cyprus announced that it was ending the initiative after an undercover investigation by journalists appeared to show two lawmakers helping to arrange a passport for a fictitious businessman, despite being told he had a criminal record. One of those lawmakers, Demetris Syllouris, the president of Parliament and the country’s second-most powerful official, resigned on Thursday. The other, Christakis Giovanis, resigned on Tuesday, and both men have denied any wrongdoing. Cyprus was only one of several European countries that turned to offering what became widely known as “golden passports” to attract investments after their economies were crippled in the global economic downturn that began in 2008. In the last seven years, Cyprus has raised over 6 billion euros through the program — about $7 billion dollars. But some of the passport programs are now seen as gateways for crime and corruption, and a threat to the integrity of the European Union, since such passports grant the right to travel to the union’s 27 member countries. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has said that programs in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta are at particular risk for corruption. The Commission is considering possible legal action against Cyprus over the matter, said Christian Wigand, a Commission spokesman. He said that European officials had “watched in disbelief” as the undercover investigation, produced by Al Jazeera and made public on Monday, purported to show high-level Cypriot officials willing to trade European citizenship for financial gain. “European values are not for sale,” said Mr. Wigand, repeating a statement made by the Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, in her State of the Union address last month. The passport program bars anyone with a criminal record from applying. But Mr. Syllouris and Mr. Giovanis were filmed saying that they would help obtain a passport for a wealthy Chinese businessman — who, they were told, had fled China after being sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of bribery and money laundering. “If there is a problem, we are not going to stop,” Mr. Syllouris said in the footage aired by Al Jazeera. “You will have full support from Cyprus.” Another associate is shown in the video saying it was possible to use a fake name on the passport. Cyprus’s attorney general, George Savvidis, said the authorities would conduct an investigation to determine whether any criminal acts were involved. Both lawmakers rejected the allegations of corruption, saying that they had actually been gathering evidence to relay to the authorities that fight money laundering. Mr. Giovanis also said that the situation was staged, and that he was entrapped into making the statements. Al Jazeera reporters posed as associates of the businessman. Cyprus’ ministry of finance said the country had granted more than 3,000 visas to applicants who invested two million Euros — or about $2.34 million dollars. The government said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that it will end the program on Nov. 1, citing ongoing weaknesses and exploitation of the program. This is not the first report by Al Jazeera about the passport initiative. In August, leaked documents obtained by its journalists indicated that at least 60 people approved for Cypriot citizenship should have been rejected under tighter rules that were introduced in 2019 but then eased this year. In September, the government announced that it was reviewing foreigners who received citizenship through the program. Many of the passports have gone to Russian, Ukrainian and Chinese investors. Cyprus also revoked the passports of 26 people last year after Reuters reported that new citizens under the program included high-ranking Cambodian officials and close associates of Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen. The leader has denied accusations that members of his inner circle have second passports that allow them to live overseas. Activists who work to fight corruption welcomed the end of Cyprus’s program. They said the European Union needed to regulate such initiatives more strictly, if not repeal them entirely. The Cypriot government has not ruled out making changes and reinstating the program. Maíra Martini, a research and policy expert at Transparency International, said in a statement that a full analysis of passports awarded under the initiative was needed. “The overwhelming evidence is that the country’s ‘golden visa’ scheme serves corrupt interests, not the people of Cyprus,” she said.']",An investigation into an initiative that grants citizenship to wealthy foreign investors appeared to show lawmakers helping to arrange a passport for a businessman despite being told he was a convicted criminal.
Separatists Kill 14 in Attack on Oil Convoy in Restive Pakistani Province,2020-10-15,By Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud and Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Militants attacked a convoy of Pakistan’s biggest oil and gas exploration company in restive Baluchistan Province on Thursday, killing at least 14 people, officials said. The attack reflected an escalation of violence in the resource-rich province, where separatists have waged a low-intensity insurgency for decades and where the local population has long complained of getting an inequitable share of Baluchistan’s wealth of minerals, oil and natural gas. The province’s strategic value has grown, too. China has invested heavily in a major seaport in the city of Gwadar in Baluchistan, and the province is a showcase for China’s Belt and Road development plan to create a lucrative transportation corridor to western China. Chinese citizens have been among those coming under separatists’ attacks in recent years, particularly by the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States. Baloch Raji Ajoi Sangar, an alliance of several separatist groups including the B.L.A., claimed the responsibility for Thursday’s assault. Seven paramilitary soldiers and seven private security guards, all assigned to protect the convoy, were killed in the attack. No company workers or militants were reported killed. Officials said a convoy of the exploration firm, the Oil and Gas Development Company, was heading from Gwadar to Karachi, about 150 miles to the west, when it was ambushed by a large number of militants around midday. The separatist group, in claiming responsibility for the attack, said exploration and drilling in the province without the assent of the Baluch people was unacceptable. Separatist groups have repeatedly clashed with military and security forces in the province. Baluch nationalists, for their part, complain that security forces have waged a campaign of enforced disappearances and targeted killings in the region, accusations the military denies. The Pakistani government and military have recently made efforts to win over the Baluch population by offering jobs and economic incentives. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the army chief, unveiled a “Prosperous Baluchistan” project in 2017, an effort to foster stability and development in the region. The military has also tried to recruit more local residents into its ranks. Officials say there are currently 1,200 Baluch officers and at least 25,000 Baluch soldiers in the ranks of the Pakistan Army, which counts more than a half-million active duty personnel. In a separate episode six army soldiers, including a captain, were killed by a roadside bomb near Razmak, in North Waziristan in the northwestern part of the country, the military said Thursday. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.']","The assault was an escalation of violence in the resource-rich province of Baluchistan, which has become a nexus of Chinese development projects and heavy security crackdowns."
Fires on Slopes of Kilimanjaro Threaten a Diverse Ecosystem,2020-10-15,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — As fires swept up the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s tallest mountain, for the fifth day on Thursday, hundreds of volunteers from local villages joined firefighters racing to stop a blaze threatening to ravage one of the world’s richest and most diverse ecosystems. The fires, which first started to burn at a rest stop for climbers, have been raging for five days with dry grass and strong winds hampering efforts to bring the flames under control. “This devastating fire is cutting through the most prestigious natural space in the whole of Tanzania,” Padili Mikomangwa, an environmentalist based in the port city of Dar es Salaam, said in a telephone interview. “The nation at large is following this seriously and shocked.” Already, vast areas of forest and low shrubs have been reduced to embers. Videos and images from the scene showed volunteers struggling to put out the fires as thick white smoke hung heavy in the sky behind them. Helicopters were set to be deployed on Thursday for the first time to help stop the fires. With a summit of 5,895 meters, or 19,341 feet, Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest point in Africa and is considered the highest free-standing volcanic mass in the world. The mountain’s snow-capped peaks and the surrounding national park were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, with endemic plants and dozens of animal species, including endangered ones, calling it home. In recent years, the mountain and the surrounding ecosystem have faced challenges including water and air pollution, intrusion on the park’s perimeters, illegal logging, and poaching. Climate change has also pushed the mountain’s glaciers and icecaps to thaw. With thousands of climbers arriving each year, concern has grown in recent years that overtourism threatens the natural splendor of Kilimanjaro. “The extent of the fire which we see today is at a new level,” Marcell Peters, a senior lecturer at the University of Würzburg in Germany who has studied the ecosystems of Kilimanjaro since 2010, said in an email. He said that the loss of plant life — particularly Erica and Podocarpus trees — could leave the area more vulnerable to fire in the coming years. Tanzanian parks officials said the fires began on Sunday at the Whona rest area, which is popular with mountaineers using the Mandara and Horombo routes to scale the mountain. The authorities said an investigation into the origin of the blaze was underway, but preliminary evidence suggested that it was sparked accidentally by porters warming food for visitors. “It was all bad luck,” Pascal Shelutete, an official with Tanzania National Parks, told journalists this week. “But we will continue to follow the issue in depth.” In addition to the plants and forests that have been destroyed, the fires have also razed facilities used by tourists at the Horombo Center. No deaths or injuries have been reported. Officials estimate that the fire has so far destroyed an alpine area stretching over roughly two miles. “We are still in the midst of putting out the fire,” Hamisi Kigwangalla, Tanzania’s minister of natural resources and tourism, said on Twitter on Thursday, a day after visiting the site of the fire. “The task is harder and bigger than it is thought to be.” The mountain has long held a special place in the imagination of the world, written about extensively by visitors awed by its majesty. For those who live in its shadow, it has been both a source of income and pride. When Tanzania gained its independence in December 1961, the new leader, Julius K. Nyerere, dispatched a team of climbers to ascend the continent’s highest peak. They planted a torch, meant to serve as a metaphor for the aspirations of a nation. However, with presidential elections set for Oct. 28, there is concern that the nation is sliding into autocratic rule. Since President John Magufuli was elected in 2015, the government has cracked down on the media and civil society, passing laws targeted at silencing critical voices. “It’s no coincidence that the Tanzanian government has increased its repression of the opposition, activists groups, and the media so close to the elections,” Oryem Nyeko, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “Instead of upholding the right to free expression at this critical time, authorities have instead adopted measures that raise concerns about the elections being free and fair.” He is facing off a slew of candidates, including Tundu Lissu, an opposition figure who survived an assassination attempt three years ago and is now back in the country. No one has ever been arrested in the case. The nation of roughly 58 million people depends heavily on tourism, and Mr. Magufuli has been eager to draw people back to the country after the coronavirus pandemic ground everything to a halt around the world. Five months ago, he declared the nation coronavirus-free, an announcement that public health officials and neighboring nations alike greeted with skepticism. Mr. Magufuli’s government has restricted reporting about the virus in Tanzania, according to Human Rights Watch. Tourism has been allowed to resume, including at Mount Kilimanjaro. Mr. Mikomangwa said that the authorities could learn from the disaster by better equipping parks and firefighters to respond to fires. “They are now scrambling for a few helicopters,” he said. “But this episode shows that we need to take robust measures to better care for our resources and ensure we end this fire once and for all.”']",Strong winds and dry weather have hampered efforts to extinguish the spreading blaze on Africa’s highest peak.
"As Virus Surges and Brexit Bears Down, Boris Johnson Stalls for Time",2020-10-15,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reached a moment of truth on the two issues that have dominated Britain this year: the pandemic and Brexit negotiations with the European Union. But he is still playing for time — a strategy that could put lives or livelihoods at risk if he waits too long. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson inched closer to imposing a second lockdown on the country, moving London to a higher level of restrictions and signaling that he wanted to move Manchester to the highest level, joining Liverpool. But he stuck to his claim that the best way to curb the virus was through targeted responses, not the two-week nationwide lockdown pushed by the opposition Labour Party and his own scientific advisers. The prime minister also seemed ready to string out trade talks with Brussels, letting a self-imposed deadline pass on Thursday without a deal. While Mr. Johnson could torpedo the negotiations on Friday, after a two-day summit meeting of European Union leaders, analysts said the British government still appeared eager to strike an agreement by the legal deadline of Dec. 31. For Mr. Johnson, Brexit and the virus are linked: the economic turmoil unleashed by the pandemic has raised the pressure on him to avoid the self-inflicted disruption of a ruptured negotiation with the European Union, and the damaging prospect of beginning the new year without a trade agreement in place. Yet his reluctance to move decisively on either of them, analysts say, risks making both worse. Dragging out the talks with Brussels could put Britain in a bind if the two sides hit an impasse as the clock runs out. Putting off a short lockdown — which experts have dubbed a “circuit breaker” — could vitiate its effectiveness in curbing the virus’s spread and necessitate a longer lockdown later, according to medical experts. “If you’re going to do it, do it early, fast and hard,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “The longer they delay, the less likely a two-week circuit breaker will work.” Scientists have proposed that the government schedule the temporary lockdown for the last week of October and first week of November, when schools are closed for mid-term break, to make it less disruptive. But some experts questioned whether that would leave enough time to prepare the public for the restrictions. Britain has missed its chance at earlier action on a mid-term lockdown that might have stemmed the latest surge, but it could still be valuable in slowing the spread, said Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises the government. “We haven’t missed the boat of it epidemiologically as a strategy,” he said. Britain has recorded about 16,000 new coronavirus cases per day, on average, over the past week — the most since the pandemic began, and a tenfold increase in just six weeks. Nearly 800 people were admitted to hospitals on Thursday, and 563 patients were on ventilators, raising fears that intensive care units will soon be overwhelmed. The figures have climbed sharply despite an array of new restrictions adopted after government scientists warned last month that without further action, the caseload could reach 50,000 a day by this point. While the outbreak has been worst in the north and west of England, there are signs that it is spreading across the country. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, pressed the government to raise the city’s status to a high alert level, which prohibits indoor socializing by people from different households, as of Saturday. But other mayors lashed out against the restrictions. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, rejected the move to elevate his city to the highest-risk tier, which involves closing pubs and gyms. Mr. Burnham, who like Mr. Khan is a member of the Labour Party, demanded that the government provide more financial aid to pubs and other businesses that he said would be devastated by the lockdown. “We will not cave into all the pressure that is being applied to us,” the mayor said in an angry video posted on Twitter. “We will not let them be leveled down by this government through this pandemic.” For weeks now, Mr. Johnson has balanced calls from his scientific advisers for tighter measures with warnings from members of his Conservative Party that a lockdown or similarly draconian measures would wreck the economy. The political consensus that once characterized Britain’s response to the pandemic has now fractured in both parties, however. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, threw his weight behind a temporary lockdown, while Mr. Johnson remains at odds not only with members of his party but also with some in his cabinet: the popular chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is resisting the push for a lockdown. “We are effectively burning the furniture to keep warm now,” said Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker and one of the leaders of a campaign for Parliament to have a greater say over coronavirus rules. “If we have to continue like that for another three to six months until there is a vaccine, that poses grave risks to the economy.” Adding to the pressure on Mr. Johnson, public-opinion surveys show clear support in the British public for stricter measures, up to and including a “circuit breaker” — though Britons are split about a lengthier lockdown. By embracing the idea, analysts said, Mr. Starmer had effectively boxed in Mr. Johnson. “If the prime minister moves toward a national lockdown, that will look like he’s changed his mind and moved toward Keir Starmer,” said Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos/MORI, a polling company. “If he doesn’t, then Labour will presumably say in response to any bad news, ‘You should have listened to us.’ From a political situation, Keir Starmer doesn’t face much risk.” However treacherous the political landscape for Mr. Johnson, the Labour Party’s call for a lockdown might actually strengthen the prime minister’s hand with his own party in the short term. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative critics, some observers say, may realize that with public opinion and the opposition running against them, they cannot hope for more than the prime minister’s efforts to seek a middle ground. “It is dawning on them that this is as good as you are going to get,” said David Gauke, a Conservative former lawmaker who fell out with Mr. Johnson over Brexit. “No prime minister is going to be more libertarian than Boris Johnson in this particular set of circumstances.” This time last year, Mr. Johnson faced down resistance by Mr. Baker and his hardline allies on Brexit. He did it by talking tough with Brussels and then cutting a deal that he presented as a triumph — a playbook he appears to be trying to use again. Mr. Johnson’s aides insist a trade agreement is within reach if talks can be intensified on the key issues: fishing quotas and state aid to industry. But the longer they drag on, the greater the uncertainty for British exporters — and the greater the leverage for Brussels.']","The prime minister’s delaying strategy carries severe risks if he misplays his hand, with the pandemic worsening and a Brexit deadline approaching."
"The federal deficit balloons to a record $3.1 trillion, even as the pain for jobless workers sharpens.",2020-10-16,"By Alan Rappeport, Emily Badger and Quoctrung Bui","['The federal budget deficit soared to a record $3.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, official figures showed on Friday, as the coronavirus pandemic fueled enormous government spending while tax receipts plunged as households and businesses struggled with economic shutdowns. The shortfall underscores the long-term economic challenge facing the United States as it tries to emerge from the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression. Interest rates are low — meaning it costs less for the government to borrow money — but the ballooning deficit is already complicating policy choices as Republicans resist another large stimulus package, citing concerns about the U.S. debt burden.  The deficit — the gap between what the U.S. spends and what it earns through tax receipts and other revenue — was $2 trillion more than what the White Houses budget forecast in February. It was three times as large as the $984 billion deficit in the 2019 fiscal year. In a statement accompanying the annual budget report, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin highlighted the extraordinary level of money that has been pumped into the economy this year to combat the virus and prop up the economy.  Federal spending enabled a $600 weekly unemployment benefit on top of state benefits, a remarkably effective expansion of the safety net.  It helped pay many workers more than their lost wages. It enabled families to spend more than during normal times. It even allowed households to put away savings as the economy was teetering. When the money stopped at the end of July, workers quickly burned through those reserves. Of the savings many households were able to build up over the course of four months of unusually generous government help, much of it was gone by the end of August, according to banking data from about 80,000 households receiving unemployment and analyzed by researchers at the JPMorgan Chase Institute and the University of Chicago.  Two and a half months after the benefits ended, Congress and the White House have been unable to reach an agreement on a broad stimulus package to revive them. Faced with dwindling savings and constant bills, most households face a dilemma. “The choices are to stop spending on regular everyday purchases, or stop making payments like mortgages, student loans, auto loans, credit cards,” said Peter Ganong, an economist at the University of Chicago who studied the banking data. “That’s a terrible choice for a family to have to make. It’s a terrible choice for the macro economy.”']",
Can a Bill Have a Gender? Feminine Wording Exposes a Rift,2020-10-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — A dispute over grammar between two federal ministries has reopened a front in Germany’s longstanding battle about gender equality, forcing officials to redraft a debt protection bill. Last month, the Justice Ministry presented a draft of the bill, which aims to shield debtors and businesses from insolvency in the wake of the coronavirus. While the bill drew little attention at the time, the draft language was written employing “Femininum,” a grammatical device that includes the use of the feminine form of plural nouns to describe groups that include both men and women. An equivalent in English would be to refer to a group of both male and female actors collectively as “actresses.” On Monday, the Interior Ministry announced that the draft would be rejected based on its use of the generic feminine form, dealing a blow to those who say the usual masculine marginalizes people who do not identify as men. In a country like Germany, where gender norms remain entrenched, the dispute shows how the traditional norms of language can become an obstacle to equality. Christine Lambrecht, the justice minister who rolled out the draft bill, ran into resistance from the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who warned that the document’s language could, in legal terms, exclude men from its protections. Steve Alter, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said that Mr. Seehofer’s objections were focused solely on the question of whether it was legally valid to use such language in a bill. “The generic feminine for use for female and male people has not yet been linguistically recognized,” Mr. Alter said. “This applies completely independently of whether a certain social state is desired.” German has gendered nouns — masculine, feminine and neutral — but as in several other European languages, the masculine form takes precedence when referring to groups of men and women, especially on official and legal documents. Katrin Gottschalk, a deputy managing editor of the Berlin-based daily TAZ, said, “The current debate is important because we still haven’t found the language in which women and nonbinary people are not only meant to be, but also feel, addressed.” “It’s not clear yet how we deal with that problem in the German language,” Ms. Gottschalk wrote in an op-ed on the draft bill and the debate it has unleashed. Other countries with gendered languages have also grappled with the issue: In 2017, the French prime minister forbade the use of “inclusive writing” in official texts. The debate over whether German usage should be changed to be more inclusive has been simmering for a decade.  The choice in private or professional settings is largely up to individuals or institutions — progressive news outlets in Germany, for example, often use gender-neutral language where possible — but the debate over the draft bill has raised the question to the federal level. Several regional governments have already taken up the issue. This year, the state government of Saxony announced that it would start using gender-inclusive language in state laws. “The language of our laws is still shaped by a time when women and men did not have the same rights,” the state justice minister, Katja Meier of the Greens, said at the time. And last year, the city of Hanover, then under the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, announced that it would adopt gender-neutral language in all its communication. The decision only ratified what had been common practice for more than a decade, but it was enough to prompt a group of 70 influential, mostly conservative figures to publish an public appeal against the policy. Although language is not considered the most important battlefield for those fighting for a fairer and more inclusive society in Germany, the debate over the draft bill is the latest chapter in the long struggle for equality. Those efforts have included demands for more accessible child care, equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs and more female representation on corporate boards. When a federal official made a passing suggestion to change the word “fatherland” to “homeland” in the German national anthem in 2018, it led to a minor political storm. The far-right party Alternative for Germany called it “gender nonsense.” Ms. Lambrecht, the justice minister, is a member of the Social Democratic Party, the furthest left in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition. Mr. Seehofer was the longtime head of the Christian Social Union, the conservative Bavarian sibling party to Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats. The Justice Ministry said that using the feminine form in the draft bill was simply the easiest way to write it and that it was not meant to send a political message. “We weren’t trying to float a trial balloon,” Stefan Zimmermann, a spokesman, said. The conservative German language association, VDS, criticized the draft text on the grounds that using the feminine form muddled the writing of legal documents. Alternative for Germany was searing in its denunciation. “Legal texts are not a romping place for left-wing ideological craziness,” Stephan Brandner, a member of the party who sits in Parliament, wrote on his official Facebook page on Tuesday. In his post, Mr. Brandner compared the justice minister to a misbehaving toddler. Katja Mast, a Social Democratic lawmaker who publicly defended the ministry’s decision to release the bill, wrote in an email that women still faced discrimination in Germany. “This also happens through language,” she noted, adding that she was grateful for the discussions. In the end, political expediency won out. On Wednesday, the Justice Ministry submitted a new version of the bill to the cabinet.  “Because the project is of great importance to us and because it is important to us to reach an agreement between the ministries as quickly as possible, we have decided in favor of the conventional variant,” said Mr. Zimmermann, the spokesman for the Justice Ministry.']","When proposed legislation in Germany used the feminine form for groups of men and women rather than the usual masculine, it was rejected as potentially invalid."
"From Hiding, Head of Central Asia’s Only Democracy Says He’s Quitting",2020-10-15,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — After more than a week in hiding following a disputed election, the president of Kyrgyzstan — Central Asia’s only democracy — on Thursday announced his plans to resign, saying he did not want to go down in history as a leader “who shed blood and shot at his own citizens.” In a statement issued from an undisclosed location, the president, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, said he had “taken a decision to resign,” though he did not specify whether he had already quit. Just a few hours earlier, Mr. Jeebenkov had assured a delegation of former senior officials and political veterans that he had no plans to step down and would stand firm against a power grab widely believed to be backed by criminal elements. Feliks Kulov, a former prime minister who met with the president on Thursday morning, voiced concern over Mr. Jeenbekov’s abrupt change of heart, speculating in a post on Facebook that the leader had been “presented with a choice: voluntary resignation or a real war.” The day’s dizzying events, which left a freed prisoner in charge of the government as prime minister, seemed to signal the end of what began as a protest by mainstream opposition forces over a rigged election and degenerated last week into a reign of chaos fueled by thugs and criminals. Mr. Jeenbekov vanished from view after protesters, enraged by Oct. 4 parliamentary elections that were marred by widespread vote-buying, stormed the president’s office and other government buildings in the capital, Bishkek. He was rumored to have taken refuge in a Russian military air base in the town of Kant, about 12 miles from Bishkek, but his exact whereabouts remained unclear. His departure is the third time in 15 years that violent protests have toppled a president of Kyrgyzstan, the only country in the region with a vibrant civil society, a relatively free press and regular competitive elections for Parliament and the presidency. The Kremlin, which in 2010 helped engineer the toppling of a Kyrgyz president who had resisted Russian pressure to shut down a since closed United States air base in his country, responded coolly to the announcement on Thursday. Mr. Jeenbekov has had good relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Russia is watching the events in Bishkek “very closely,” Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, told journalists in Moscow, and wants “the situation there to calm down as soon as possible.” But he added that Russia, which suspended financial aid to Kyrgyzstan after last week’s unrest, would not resume funding until the country has a functioning government. He noted that it currently has no cabinet and that the president’s resignation cannot take effect until approved by Parliament. With the president apparently out of the way, his role as head of state — and commander in chief of the armed forces — will be taken by the speaker of Parliament, who has also come under mounting pressure to resign. In what is formally a parliamentary democracy, however, the governing of Kyrgyzstan falls to Sadyr Japarov, a convicted kidnapper who was sprung from jail last week by antigovernment protesters. He was named prime minister on Saturday by lawmakers who gathered for an unusual and his opponents say illegal session without a quorum at the president’s official residence. In announcing his resignation, President Jeenbekov, who last week ordered troops into the capital to restore order, called on Mr. Japaraov and rival politicians to “withdraw their supporters from the capital and give back a peaceful life to the people of Bishkek.” Hundreds of protesters — some of them Mr. Japarov’s supporters, but also a group that included men whom observers in Bishkek described as paid thugs linked to criminal groups — gathered outside the president’s official residence on Thursday to demand that Mr. Jeenbekov give up the presidency. A group of Mr. Japarov’s followers, mostly young men, clashed violently last week with supporters of another would-be prime minister. Since that confrontation, there have been growing fears that Mr. Japarov, reviled by his critics as a bare-knuckled nationalist rabble-rouser, would again mobilize his followers if the president did not step down. Mr. Jeenbekov, who was elected in 2017, had said he would leave office once calm returned to the capital, which has in recent days been free of the turmoil that engulfed it last week. Mr. Japarov, the new prime minister, has long insisted that his 2017 conviction on charges of organizing the kidnapping of a regional governor was politically motivated in a country where each new government has often jailed members of the previous one and rival politicians. Mr. Jeenbekov had his presidential predecessor, Almazbek Atambayev, arrested and jailed on corruption charges soon after taking office. Mr. Atambayev, who was serving an 11-year sentence, was among those sprung from jail last week, along with Mr. Japarov. He was rearrested on Saturday.']",The president of Kyrgyzstan said he did not want to be remembered as a leader “who shed blood and shot at his own citizens.”
"Nearly 900,000 people in the U.S. filed new state unemployment claims last week.",2020-10-15,By Nelson D. Schwartz,"['American employers continue to shed workers at a staggering rate as a resurgent coronavirus and the absence of new federal aid take a toll on economic growth. The Labor Department reported Thursday that 885,000 Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, an increase from the previous week. That figure is not adjusted for seasonal variations. After dropping in late spring and early summer as pandemic-related lockdowns eased, new claims for state jobless benefits had been steadily totaling about 800,000 a week, far above the level in previous recessions. “The numbers are extremely worrisome, in my opinion, and they point to a labor market that is struggling to make progress,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Over the past month, large employers including United Airlines, Disney and Allstate announced tens of thousands of layoffs, and more are expected as sectors like leisure and hospitality struggle. In some states, restaurants have salvaged some business by serving diners outside, but many will lose that option as temperatures fall. Despite the widespread economic pain, Republicans and Democrats in Washington have been unable to agree on a new relief package, a failure that may cause the economy to slow further in the coming months. Federal benefits created in March to supplement state payments to the unemployed are set to expire by the end of the year. A jump in coronavirus cases in the Midwest and Western states has stirred fears of renewed lockdowns even as layoffs by large employers batter the work force. “The course of the virus determines the course of the economy,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. “You can’t fully reopen with the contagion so high.”']",
Detention of Government Critic in Poland Raises Fears of a Crackdown,2020-10-16,By Monika Pronczuk and Marc Santora,"['A prominent lawyer and outspoken critic of Poland’s government was detained on accusations of money laundering on Thursday, and was later taken to the hospital after a fall, in circumstances that remain unclear. The lawyer, Roman Giertych, who has been involved in a series of high-profile cases against members of the governing Law and Justice party, was placed in handcuffs by a special anticorruption unit outside a Warsaw court. He has also represented prominent opposition figures, including Donald Tusk, the former president of the European Council. Later, during a search of his home, Mr. Giertych fell unconscious on his bathroom floor and was rushed to the hospital. Further details about the incident were not immediately available from the authorities, but his daughter, Maria Giertych, said he had scuffled with an officer. Mr. Giertych’s detention comes on the heels of one of the closest presidential elections in Poland since the nation ended communist rule in 1989, with the ruling party winning a narrow victory. And in the bitterly divided country, the opposition was quick to argue that the detention was evidence that the ruling party was using the country’s legal system to achieve political aims. The authorities denied accusations that the detention was politically motivated. The ruling party “made it fashionable to make a show out of putting handcuffs on innocent people,” Radek Sikorski, an opposition lawmaker, told TVN24, a Polish televsion station. Mr. Sikorski said the detention was designed to distract the public as anger builds over the government’s handling of the pandemic and to intimidate both lawyers and judges. Late Thursday, Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the authorities, said Mr. Giertych was in “good condition” and undergoing medical examinations. But Jacek Dubois, a lawyer who has worked with Mr. Giertych, contradicted that assessment and said he had been told by the family that Mr. Giertych’s condition was “very serious.” A government spokesman, Piotr Müller, said he was unfamiliar with the details of the case. But, he added, “I understand the anticorruption services had grounds for detention.” Mr. Giertych was expected to be charged with “appropriating company funds and inflicting upon it financial losses of great proportions, as well as of money laundering,” said Anna Marszalek, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office. The Polish Bar Council expressed its “greatest concern” over the detention. “Regardless of the grounds for the detention of Roman Giertych and for searching his house, these actions are exceptional because of his professional involvement in cases in which politicians of the ruling party are involved,” the head of the council said in a statement. In recent years Mr. Giertych has become one of the most vocal critics of the government in Poland, taking special aim at judicial changes pushed through by Law and Justice and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. After coming to power in 2015, the government took control of a tribunal responsible for upholding the Constitution and gave authority over the country’s prosecutors to the Justice Ministry. It also asserted new powers to select judges and tried to purge the Supreme Court. The actions have been condemned by international observers and have been at the heart of tensions between Poland and the European Union, which views the changes as a threat to the rule of law and the bloc’s democratic values. Mr. Kaczynski, who has also been trying to quell a rebellion in his governing coalition as he faces growing public anger over the government’s handling of the coronavirus, took a new post this month as deputy prime minister. The position gives him authority over the nation’s security apparatus, and some observers fear that he is using that power to target critics. Few critics of the government have been more vocal than Mr. Giertych. Most recently he accused it of mismanaging the pandemic, writing on Twitter that there was “blood on their hands.” Poland reported a record number of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations this week. There is increasing concern that the country’s health care system will be overwhelmed, and critics of the government say it has not done enough to prepare for the virus’s current second wave. Mr. Giertych was also involved in cases that threatened to touch on the dealings of high-ranking government officials. Mr. Dubois, who worked with Mr. Giertych on the case of Leszek Czarnecki, a high-profile businessman at odds with Law and Justice, said the timing of the detention was not coincidental. “Mr. Giertych told me last week he got hold of documents discrediting important members of the government,” Mr. Dubois said in an interview. “They wanted to eliminate him one day before the trial of Mr. Czarnecki was supposed to take place.” Mr. Czarnecki was a central figure in a corruption scandal in 2018, when he accused a government financial regulator of soliciting a bribe. Adam Bodnar, Poland’s official ombudsman, said the manner of the arrest raised the “highest concerns and demanded explanations.” He declined to comment on the merits of the case, but said he wanted to know “what circumstances justify this kind of course of action.” Mr. Giertych’s wife, Barbara, who is also a lawyer, said she had been given little information about her husband’s detention. “For the first time in my life, in my professional career, I’m experiencing a situation where I don’t know what is the context of the detention,” she told TVN 24, a local media outlet. Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.']","Roman Giertych, who has been involved in high-profile cases against members of the governing party, was put in handcuffs and had his home searched by the authorities."
"Singapore and Hong Kong agree to set up a travel bubble, and other news from around the world.",2020-10-15,"By Tiffany May, Jennifer Jett, Anna Schaverien, Monika Pronczuk, Karen Zraick and Raphael Minder","['Officials in Singapore and Hong Kong said Thursday that they had reached a preliminary agreement to establish a travel bubble between the two Asian financial centers, allowing travelers of all kinds to bypass quarantine. Under the agreement, travelers must test negative for the virus and fly only on designated flights. Officials did not say when the bubble, which was first reported by The South China Morning Post, would begin. Travelers from Singapore would be the first allowed to enter Hong Kong since the semiautonomous Chinese territory barred all nonresidents in March; residents returning to Hong Kong are required to quarantine for 14 days. Singapore currently requires travelers from Hong Kong to quarantine for seven days after arrival. “Both our cities have low incidence of Covid-19 cases and have put in place robust mechanisms to manage and control Covid-19,” Singapore’s travel minister, Ong Ye Kung, said in a statement. Hong Kong’s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, called the agreement “a milestone in our efforts to resume normalcy while fighting against the long-drawn battle of Covid-19.” Singapore and Hong Kong have both been reporting daily new cases in the single or double digits since late August. Efforts to establish reciprocal travel bubbles in Asia and other parts of the world have been halting as case numbers fluctuate and new outbreaks emerge. Starting Friday, Australia will waive quarantine requirements for travelers from New Zealand, which recently stamped out the virus for a second time, though New Zealand will still require quarantine for travelers arriving from Australia. Singapore has also lifted restrictions on general visitors from Brunei, Vietnam, New Zealand and Australia except for the state of Victoria, the center of the outbreak there. But all four of those countries are still closed to almost all foreigners, and in the case of Brunei and Australia residents must apply for permission to leave the country as well. In other global developments: The European Parliament announced on Thursday that it would cancel a meeting scheduled to be held next week in Strasbourg, in northern France, as the outbreak widens. The meeting would have been its first in-person session in Strasbourg since the start of the pandemic. Belgium, where most parliamentary staff and members are based, is also seeing a sharp rise in cases. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, went into quarantine for a second time in two weeks after being exposed to the virus. She tweeted on Thursday that she had tested negative, but a member of her office had tested positive. She wrote that she was leaving a European Council meeting in Brussels that was being held with strict social-distancing measures. Portugal announced new virus restrictions on Thursday, including a five-person limit on public gatherings, after a rise in new cases. In Spain, which is seeing an even sharper increase, the city of Salamanca, famous for its 12th-century university, became the latest area to be cut off from the rest of the country, under new lockdown restrictions imposed by the regional government. The restrictions take effect on Saturday. Two officials in Qingdao, China, have been fired amid a new virus outbreak there, the city government said on Thursday. The director of the health commission and the president of the Qingdao Chest Hospital are under investigation after six confirmed infections and six asymptomatic cases were linked to the hospital. The new cases are the first local transmissions China had reported in almost two months.  The weekly number of new cases in Europe is now at its highest point since the start of the pandemic, Hans Kluge, the W.H.O.’s director for Europe, said on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases rose by one million to seven million in just 10 days, and the number of daily deaths passed 1,000 for the first time in months. Many European countries are adopting stricter controls, which Dr. Kluge called “absolutely necessary,” as increased caseloads are raising fears of another surge as winter approaches. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading, putting the country on track to have the largest reported caseload in the world in the coming weeks. It’s also the start of the fall pollution season, and doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die.']",
Killing of White Farmer Becomes a Flash Point in South Africa,2020-10-16,By Lynsey Chutel and Monica Mark,"['SENEKAL, South Africa — A young white farm manager was found earlier this month strangled and tied to a pole on a farm in the eastern part of the Free State province, police said. Two Black men were accused of the murder. At a packed court hearing on Friday, the police captain investigating the case said that the suspects were part of a ring of livestock thieves operating in the area, and that it appeared that the motive was robbery rather than racial animus. But the killing of the farm manager, Brendin Horner, has become the latest flash point for racial conflict in South Africa, where the segregationist apartheid regime fell almost 30 years ago. Tension is particularly high in rural farming areas where white people still own a vast majority of the farms and Black people still serve as their often impoverished laborers. Groups representing white farmers accuse the South African government of deliberately failing to protect them. Some white activist groups say that what they call “farm murders” represent the beginning of a “white genocide” aimed at driving whites out of South Africa. Critics see this as a deeply distorted narrative promoted by the white beneficiaries of apartheid to drum up international sympathy. They point out that violent crime is common in South Africa. The vast majority of the victims are Black. Of 21, 325 murder victims last year, 49 were white farmers — accounting for much less than 1 percent of the country’s total, according to police statistics. White South Africans make up about 9 percent of the country’s 58 million citizens. At Friday’s hearing, white farmers and motorcycle riders faced off with Black protesters in the red polo shirts of the leftist political party Economic Freedom Fighters, or E.F.F., outside the small rural courthouse in Senekal, a town on the banks of the Sand River. Police erected barbed wire to separate the groups, but at one point they stood nose to nose — a situation defused when volunteer marshals from both sides intervened. On a hill outside town, white farmers waved a banner with the face of Mr. Horner and carried white wooden crosses. Some wore bulletproof vests. After reading the Bible and praying, they sang South Africa’s apartheid-era national anthem. Some of the farmers said in interviews that South Africa’s lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the resulting economic downturn, have made poor Black South Africans more desperate. “Usually they steal for food on the table, now they’re killing,” said Derek Meyer, a farmer at the protest. Khanyi Magubane, a political commentator and journalist, said of the white farmers, “They don’t see the bigger picture of dysfunctionality in South Africa. Everybody is being targeted, everybody is being robbed.” The farmers jeered as buses and minivans ferrying supporters of the E.F.F. drove by, some passengers singing “Kill the Boer,” a liberation-era song that has since been declared hate speech. The founding leader of the E.F.F., Julius Malema, a firebrand expelled from the ruling African National Congress party, addressed the crowd of about 2,500 from a portable stage outside the courthouse, saying, “We are here to fight and die against apartheid, because South Africa still has got apartheid.” He has tapped into long-simmering anger by calling for land redistribution. In Parliament, the E.F.F. controls 44 out of 400 seats, and accuses the majority party, the African National Congress, of moving too slowly and too cautiously on land redistribution. A 2017 government survey found that white farmers control nearly 70 percent of farms held by individual owners in South Africa. Much of that land was brutally confiscated from African inhabitants generations ago. Of the vast tracts in Free State, where Mr. Horner was killed, three quarters of farms are owned by white South Africans, while Black South Africans own just 3 percent, the survey found. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, spoke out about the killing of Mr. Horner on Monday, expressing horror and sympathy, but cautioning against falsely equating the murders of white farmers with ethnic cleansing. “They are not genocidal. They are acts of criminality and must be treated as such,” Mr. Ramaphosa said in his weekly presidential address. “What happened in Senekal shows just how easily the tinderbox of race hatred can be ignited,” he said. In a nation with the world’s fifth-highest murder rate, Mr. Ramaphosa has in recent months used his addresses to name murder victims, particularly women killed during the lockdown. He pointed out that three young Black men were shot dead in a car in South Africa in the same week that Mr. Horner was killed. But the violent protests over the killing of Mr. Horner grabbed immediate and outsized attention. On Oct. 6, several hundred white protesters gathered outside the courthouse in Senekal where the two suspects were appearing for a hearing. Some protesters set a police van on fire and stormed the court holding cells, demanding that the defendants be turned over to them.  A 51-year-old white businessman, Andre Pienaar, was later arrested and charged with attempted murder, malicious damage to property and public violence. He was denied bail. AfriForum, a large advocacy group for Afrikaners, the descendants of the white Dutch and Huguenot settlers of South Africa, has led international efforts to draw attention to their discredited claims that white farmers are being systematically forced off their land and killed in large numbers. In 2018, after Ernst Roets, deputy chief executive of AfriForum, appeared on a segment on Fox News in the United States with the host Tucker Carlson, President Trump said on Twitter that he was directing his secretary of state to investigate what he called “large-scale killing” of white farmers. In a telephone interview, Mr. Roets said that the government does not protect white farmers: “It’s very clear this is not a priority for them to do anything,” he said. In the courtroom on Friday, the judge was flanked by four armed police officers, government ministers occupied the benches near the front and journalists packed the room. The country’s minister of police, Bheki Cele, who had visited the town earlier in the week in a bid to de-escalate the tensions, noted in an interview afterward that four people — three of them Black — had been killed in the area since April. “One of them is this young white man,” he said. Lynsey Chutel reported from Senekal and Monica Mark from Johannesburg.']","Outside a court hearing for two Black suspects in a murder case, white Afrikaners nostalgic for the apartheid era and Black protesters angry that whites still own most farmland squared off."
The Jailed Activist Left a Letter Behind. The Message: Keep Fighting.,2020-10-15,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — The outspoken Vietnamese journalist and activist Pham Doan Trang knew it was only a matter of time before the police came for her. She wrote a letter last year and gave it to an American friend with instructions to release it upon her arrest. In the letter, she asked that her friends not just campaign for her freedom but use her incarceration to fight for free elections and an end to single-party rule in Vietnam. “I don’t want freedom for just myself; that’s too easy,” wrote Ms. Pham, 42, who has walked with difficulty since a police beating in 2015. “I want something greater: freedom for Vietnam.” Shortly before midnight on Oct. 6, the police raided her apartment in Ho Chi Minh City and arrested her on charges of making and disseminating propaganda against the Vietnamese state. She faces up to 20 years in prison. Ms. Pham is one of the most prominent critics to have been arrested in recent years by Vietnam’s Communist regime, which has long made a practice of harassing, beating and imprisoning outspoken activists. The widespread use of smartphones and the internet in Vietnam has meant that daring activists and journalists like Ms. Pham can independently publish stories in which they uncover corruption or expose malfeasance. But that also puts a huge target on their backs. “She is the kind of prolific writer and thinker the Vietnamese government does not want to be free,” said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “They are going to throw the book at her and she is not going to compromise.” The Communist Party has long feared that free speech would undermine its hold on power, and it has built a large apparatus to stifle dissent. Activists say Ms. Pham’s arrest was likely prompted by the party’s upcoming congress in January, which occurs every five years.  At a time when Vietnam has repositioned itself as a strategic American ally and important global manufacturing hub, the authorities are newly emboldened to crack down on dissent with little fear of repercussions. They have also been invigorated by a United States administration that has widely ignored human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch estimates that Vietnam has jailed at least 130 political prisoners, more than any other country in Southeast Asia. Just four years ago, then-President Barack Obama made human rights in Vietnam a priority. During a 2016 visit, he invited Ms. Pham and other dissidents to meet with him publicly. But the police kept her from attending by detaining her. The Trump administration has not prioritized human rights in Vietnam in the same way. The police arrested Ms. Pham hours after the two governments held their 24th annual “Human Rights Dialogue.” After Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists and other groups called for her release, the State Department on Saturday pressed Vietnam to set Ms. Pham free. “The United States condemns \u200bthe arrest of writer, democracy, and human rights activist Pham Doan Trang,” Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, said in a statement. “We urge the Government of Vietnam to immediately release her and drop all charges.” Ms. Pham began her career as a journalist, but in a country where most media is state-controlled, she chafed at the restrictions.  In her 2019 book “Politics of a Police State,” she wrote about the continual harassment she had suffered for a decade as a writer and activist. The police once put glue in her apartment door lock so she could not leave, she wrote. They placed her under house arrest, publicly posted intimate photos taken from her computer and stole her identity cards. She left the country in 2013, but she was not happy in exile. “It’s really hard to watch from outside what happens in Vietnam,” she said at the time. “It makes me feel helpless.” She returned to Vietnam in 2015, and had lived in hiding since 2017. In addition to the upcoming Congress, Ms. Pham’s arrest may also have been prompted by a report she co-wrote last month challenging the official account of a deadly police raid in Dong Tam village, near Hanoi. In Vietnam, all land is owned by the state, and officials have the power to seize prime parcels and give them to their cronies or foreign companies, a practice that fuels corruption. The dispute in the village began in 2015 when officials transferred 145 acres to the country’s largest telecommunications company, the government-owned Viettel Corp., but residents refused to give up their land. During a confrontation in 2017, villagers held 19 police and security officials captive for a week. In January of this year, about 3,000 officers raided the village. The 84-year-old village head, Le Dinh Kinh, a lifelong Communist Party member who had led the opposition to the land seizure, was shot and killed by the police. Three police officers also died. The authorities arrested 29 villagers on murder or obstruction charges. In their report, Ms. Pham and her co-author challenged the official claim that Mr. Le had been holding a hand grenade when the police shot him. In fact, they wrote, he had been holding a cane. Since the report’s release, three other contributors have been arrested, activists said. Another author, the American activist Will Nguyen, was previously deported from Vietnam, in 2018, after being forced to make a video confession that was shown on television. It was Mr. Nguyen who released Ms. Pham’s letter last week foretelling her arrest. “Trang has been a thorn in the government’s side for a long time, and the authorities have been hunting her down since 2017,” Mr. Nguyen said in an email. “At heart, she has an acute sense of justice and a profound love for Vietnam,” he said. “She wishes for it to be better, even if it means sacrificing her freedom and herself.” Ms. Pham also reported on a 2016 environmental disaster caused when a Taiwanese-owned steel factory discharged toxic waste into the sea along a stretch of Vietnam’s central coast. Other activists who wrote about the disaster landed in prison, including Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, a blogger better known as Mother Mushroom, who was later released and allowed to fly to the United States. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Pham predicted that the authorities’ effort to intimidate activists by imprisoning Mother Mushroom would fail. “She has a lot of supporters,” Ms. Pham said. “Many of them will replace her or follow in her path.” Perhaps she was already thinking ahead to the likelihood of her own incarceration. In her letter, titled “Just in case I am imprisoned,” she told friends not to believe the police if they claimed she had confessed. She asked for a movement not to “free Trang,” but to “free Trang and ensure free and fair elections.” “No one wants to sit in prison,” she wrote. “But if prison is inevitable for freedom fighters, if prison can serve a predetermined purpose, then we should happily accept it.”']","Pham Doan Trang was harassed for years by the Vietnamese police, and beaten.

"He Dismembered His Boss, but a Judge Ruled It Manslaughter",2020-10-16,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — After nearly three decades of covering bizarre and sensational crimes, I thought I had seen it all. There was the case of Seemona Sumasar, a petite woman from Queens, N.Y., who was framed by her rapist for armed robberies that never took place, landing her in jail for seven months. There was the phenomenon of “blood feuds” in Albania where victims’ families avenged the slayings of their relatives by killing any of the killers’ male family members. There was the London jewel heist undertaken by a geriatric gang wielding power tools and armed with their medication — a burglary so audacious I wrote a book about it. And now a Canadian crime has joined this pantheon of fact-is-stranger-than-fiction stories: an immigrant who killed his millionaire boss, who also happens to be a relative, at his hillside Vancouver mansion before chopping him into 108 pieces. Last week, the case ended with a surprising twist: The killer, Zhao Li, 60, was sentenced by a Vancouver court to 10 years and six months in prison, prompting criticism that the punishment didn’t fit the crime. [Read: Killer in Canada Who Dismembered Rich Relative Gets 10-Year Sentence]. As it is, legal observers were stunned when the judge ruled in January that Mr. Zhao wasn’t guilty of murdering the victim, Yuan Gang. Instead, he was convicted of manslaughter and of “interfering with human remains.” “Given the brutality of the crime in a placid, upper-crust Vancouver neighborhood and the very deliberate dismemberment of the body, the sentence is glaringly on the low side,” Chris Johnson, a lawyer for the victim’s estate, told me. When I first heard about the killing while on assignment in Vancouver two years ago, I was both riveted and repulsed. Beyond its chilling violence, the motives of Mr. Zhao, who grew up Harbin, in northeast China, seemed murky. Its flamboyant cast of characters included a wealthy victim with a fondness for stuffed black panthers, and a glamorous reality show star. The number 108 was also jarring: According to Chinese legend, it’s the optimal number when carving up a whole Peking duck. While investigating the crime, I went to the hulking mansion in an exclusive West Vancouver neighborhood with sweeping views of the Pacific. I tried to imagine the scene after the police were called and officers were observing Mr. Zhao from the house’s large back windows, pacing with a rifle and washing blood from a knife. I noticed something else: The address of the house — 963 King George’s Way — had been changed to 961. The sticker covering the old address was visible. I later learned that the ruse was the work of a real estate agent, fearful that buyers would be spooked. The case has grabbed headlines in Canada as well as China. Ian Young, Vancouver correspondent for the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, told me that it underscored how Vancouver had become a global bolt-hole for the Chinese superrich.  “There is a fascination in Hong Kong and China about what China’s idle rich do overseas,” he said. Mr. Zhao’s wife was related to Mr. Yuan by marriage, and the millionaire had invited the poorer, Montreal-based Zhao family to move into his mansion. Mr. Zhao managed Mr. Yuan’s Saskatchewan farm business but regarded Mr. Yuan as a 41-year-old playboy and brutish womanizer, who had as many as 100 girlfriends. On a Saturday in May 2015, the two men came to blows after Mr. Zhao, an avid inventor, asked Mr. Yuan to invest in his latest invention — a rifle stand. Mr. Yuan eventually agreed, but he had a caveat: permission to marry Mr. Zhao’s daughter Florence. Mr. Zhao became apoplectic. “You are worse than a beast!” he raged, according to his court testimony. The men tussled over a hammer, before Mr. Zhao shot Mr. Yuan twice with a rifle. Then he cut up the body with an electric hand saw, hiding an elbow in a large meat freezer in the garage. Li Zhao’s past intrigued me. When he was a child, his father, a doctor, had been sent to a labor camp for opposing the Chinese state and he was viciously bullied at school. After the killing, one of his employees told a Vancouver investigator that his boss had done target practice by asking an employee to hold the target at arm’s length while he shot his rifle. Had a lifetime of simmering resentments and his early history of being bullied make him snap? Was he really trying to protect his daughter? Or, at barely over five feet, did he fear the burlier Mr. Yuan? Mr. Yuan’s lifestyle — and shadowy past — added another layer of intrigue. He owned two imposing mansions, a fleet of luxury cars and a private island. A 2015 Chinese court judgment showed that he had bribed a senior communist official with a 1,000 gram gold bar in return for coal mining rights.

Thailand Steps Up Response as Antigovernment Protests Escalate,2020-10-16,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — A confrontation between the Thai authorities and antigovernment demonstrators that has escalated in recent days jumped to an uncertain new phase on Friday, as protesters were forcibly dispersed and two of the movement’s participants were charged with violating an obscure law against endangering the royal family. Riot police officers deployed powerful water cannons for the first time, drenching demonstrators with a stinging liquid and carrying out a spate of new arrests in a crackdown that has hit the protests with an arsenal of threats, diktats and detentions.  The invoking of the arcane law, which carries up to life imprisonment for committing “an act of violence against the queen’s liberty,” added to the tensions in Thailand, which has been periodically engulfed by political turmoil and is known for  strict measures to prevent disparaging the king and his kin. The “act of violence” was, apparently, yelling at a royal motorcade. Two days earlier, a stretch Rolls-Royce carrying Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya and Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, the heir apparent, had made a surprise detour past some of the protesters, who have been calling for fresh elections and reforms to the monarchy for months. “Oh, the royal motorcade,” said Aekachai Hongkangwan, a veteran political activist, throwing his hand up in the defiant three-fingered salute that the protesters have borrowed from “The Hunger Games.” “Stay in line and keep the peace,” added Bunkueanun Paothong, a college student, through a megaphone. That was it. Both accounts were confirmed by eyewitnesses and video footage. But by Friday, both Mr. Aekachai and Mr. Bunkueanun had been charged with violating Section 110 of Thailand’s criminal code — a provision so arcane that a database of Thai Supreme Court cases makes no mention of it. With an army-drafted Constitution and some legal provisions that hark back to when the country was an absolute monarchy, Thailand has plenty of draconian offenses that can land people in jail for speaking out. A lèse-majesté law criminalizes criticism of the royal family and can mean prison sentences of up to 15 years. (Mr. Aekachai once served two years in prison for insulting the crown.) Sedition and computer crime acts have been used to incarcerate others. The use of Section 110, however, was unexpected. Human rights lawyers and legal scholars were left scrambling to understand what exactly constituted an “act of violence against the queen’s liberty.” Punishment for the crime, which also applies to acts against the heir apparent, ranges from 16 years to life in prison. “When I was a student, the lecturer didn’t teach this and just skipped this law,” said Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, an opposition politician and former law professor. On Friday, the police searched the offices of Mr. Piyabutr’s political movement, under a new emergency decree that the government announced on Thursday morning. It bans gatherings of five or more people in Bangkok and allows the police to declare any place off-limits to protesters. The demonstrators can be held without charge for up to 30 days, without access to lawyers or relatives. “Don’t be reckless because everyone can die today or tomorrow,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said during a news conference on Friday, in what was seen as a warning to stop the rallies. “Don’t challenge the grim reaper.” The protesters ignored Mr. Prayuth’s advice. On Friday afternoon, thousands of them, mostly student-aged, gathered again amid a steady rain, just as they had the day before in defiance of the emergency decree. On Friday evening, hundreds of riot police officers charged toward the protesters and used water cannons against them for the first time. They gushed a stinging blue liquid, compelling the demonstrators to pull back. With a smaller contingent remaining, protest leaders called an end to the rally, saying that a retreat did not signify defeat. The police said that seven people had been arrested and that there had been injuries among both the security forces and civilians. The emergency decree was extended to Nov. 13. The appearance of the royal motorcade on Wednesday was a shock for the protesters, who had never expected to be in such proximity to the queen and the prince. King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, the queen and the heir apparent spend most of the year in Germany and rarely return to Thailand. (The queen is the king’s fourth wife, and the prince is the son of his third wife; the king also has a noble consort, akin to an official mistress.) Criticism of the royal family’s elevated status in Thailand has been taboo for decades, but the student-led protest movement has shattered this convention. “The goal is to change the whole political system, including the monarchy and the prime minister,” said Napassorn Saenduean, a political science student at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, who watched the royal motorcade glide past on Wednesday. It was the first time that members of the royal family had gotten an extended up-close look at these discontented subjects. Mr. Prayuth, a retired general, became prime minister in 2014, after leading an army coup that was justified, in part, as necessary to protect the monarchy. Thailand’s royal family is among the world’s richest, and King Maha Vajiralongkorn has extended his authority over military units and palace assets. On Friday, a speech given by the king the day before was made public, in which the 68-year-old monarch underlined the role of the crown in Thailand. “Now it is understood that the country needs people who love the country and love the monarchy,” he said. The protests have drawn thousands of high-school and college students, who are chronicling their political awakening on social media, even as their parents worry about a violent crackdown. Dozens of people were killed when a protest movement was cleared from the streets in 2010, the most recent bout in a country accustomed to deadly political violence. “Every one of us wants a country that belongs to the people,” said Nattarika Donhongpai, a high school student who attended the rally on Thursday evening in her school uniform. “We want everyone to come out and use their rights and voices to express everything.” Ryn Jirenuwat and Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']","Water cannons were used for the first time to clear protesters off the streets, and two demonstrators face charges that could put them in prison for life."
Freshman enrollment drops significantly at U.S. universities and community colleges.,2020-10-15,By Shawn Hubler,"['Freshman enrollment has dropped more than 16 percent from last year at American colleges and universities — and by nearly a quarter at community colleges — as the threat of the coronavirus has disrupted the nation’s higher education system, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reported Thursday. A month into the fall semester, overall undergraduate enrollment is running 4 percent below last year’s levels, as the pandemic has forced classes online and plunged the national economy into turmoil, the report found. Even an upward trend in graduate enrollment has been dampened since last month’s survey, slipping to 2.7 percent. The drop in enrollment is just the latest turmoil affecting America’s institutions of higher education. Facing an uncertain autumn, some schools opted to hold most or all classes online, while others opted for in-person instruction, installing a host of measures to try to contain the virus, with mixed success. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 178,000 virus cases have been reported at more than 1,400 colleges as of Oct. 8, according to a Times database. So far, 29 games in the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football’s premier tier, have been postponed or rescheduled for virus-related reasons, and one of college sport’s biggest names, Alabama Coach Nick Saban, announced he had tested positive on Wednesday.   Doug Shapiro, the center’s executive director, said the trend reflected enrollment numbers from a little more than half of the 3,600 postsecondary institutions tracked by the center, sharpening the worrisome picture that emerged last month in early data. That preliminary look\xad\xad in September, with only about a quarter of schools reporting, had pegged the fall in enrollment at only about 2.5 percent. A third, even more complete data set will be released Nov. 12. “Most strikingly, freshman students are by far the biggest decline of any group from last year,” Mr. Shapiro said, noting that many students may have opted for gap years or deferred admissions or decided to work for a year before enrolling. Undergraduate enrollment, he said, was down in every region and at every type of institution except four-year, for-profit colleges, with first-time students accounting for 69 percent of the drop. But the “staggering” news, he said, was from community colleges, where the 22.7 percent enrollment decline from last year eliminated what had been “one of higher education’s bright spots.” In the 2008, recession, he said, community college enrollment went up. “This is uncharted territory,” agreed Terry Hartle, senior vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education, a higher education trade group. And, he said, the societal stakes are high: the community college system is where most Black, Latino and low-income students enter the higher education system. Members of those groups all have been disproportionately hit by the virus, and he said the drop also may reflect concern that campuses aren’t safe from infection. “But the big worry is that people who interrupt their education with the intention of completing it later don’t always do so,” he said. “The progress we’ve made in expanding education to lower income students could be undermined.”']",
"With Brexit Clock Ticking, Boris Johnson Vows, Again, to Walk Away",2020-10-16,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Britain’s Brexit negotiations with the European Union teetered on a precipice yet again Friday, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that his government was fed up and ready for a no-deal exit from the bloc’s trading system, and with his chief negotiator calling off talks scheduled for next week in London. European leaders reacted coolly to Mr. Johnson’s threat, making clear that they were ready to keep talking and acknowledging that both sides needed to give ground to reach a trade agreement by the deadline of Dec. 31. Mr. Johnson, who had set a self-imposed deadline of this week to judge whether the talks should go on, delivered his warning after a summit meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels that resulted in what the prime minister called an unreasonable demand that Britain make the major concessions. “They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country,” Mr. Johnson said in a taped statement from Downing Street. “With high hearts and complete confidence, we will prepare to embrace the alternative.” For all his bluster, history suggested that the negotiations were less likely to collapse than to enter a climactic final act, promising even more of the theatrics and brinkmanship that have characterized the Brexit drama from the start. There are genuine gaps between Britain and the European Union: The two are at odds over quotas for fishing — an issue that is highly sensitive politically in neighboring France. And the two sides have yet to agree on rules governing state aid to industry or a way to resolve disputes over this funding. The calendar poses another risk: With the deadline for a deal fast approaching, even the loss of a week or more of talks could make it difficult for the two sides to reach a settlement in time. If they fall short, Britain would have to start trading with the bloc under what Mr. Johnson euphemistically calls Australia-style rules — in other words, under the default terms set by the World Trade Organization. “We will prosper mightily as an independent free-trading nation, controlling our own borders, our fisheries, and setting our own laws,” he said. In fact, analysts said, Britain would face severe disruptions, including long lines of trucks at the English Channel, and a heavy blow to its economic growth, on top of the already painful dislocation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Britain’s battle to contain the latest wave of infections has all but eclipsed the latest Brexit news. Given those daunting realities, analysts said they still believed that Mr. Johnson was bluffing and would end up striking a deal. The likelihood that Britain will have to compromise, they said, made it all the more important for the prime minister to look like he is driving a hard bargain with the European Union. Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, a research institute, described the prime minister’s statement as “high-stakes theatrics” and said he still believed that a deal was more likely than not because both sides had recently shifted on some of their red lines. “These sorts of performances are part and parcel of the negotiations,” he said. “We are at a crunch point where the difficult political compromises need to be made, but where there is also a need to appear tough for domestic audiences.” Mr. Johnson’s move was a “controlled explosion,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. But it masked potential openings for compromise, particularly with France on fishing rights. Downing Street argued that the European Union had effectively ended the talks by adopting formal conclusions from its summit that called on Britain to make compromises and made no mention of an intensification of talks. British officials said there was no point in more negotiations next Monday unless the European Union was ready to discuss legal texts in an accelerated way without Britain being required to make all the moves. Without such conditions, officials said, the only matter worth discussing would be practical preparations for a no-deal exit, including how to handle issues such as aviation, road haulage and nuclear cooperation. European leaders, however, seemed to meet some of the conditions demanded by Britain, most notably when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, acknowledged that there needed to be give and take on both sides. “We have asked the United Kingdom to remain open to compromise, so that an agreement can be reached,” Ms. Merkel said on Thursday. “This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises.” On Friday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, promised to “intensify” talks — as Britain has requested — and said her negotiating team would travel to London next week. Later in the day, Downing Street said that Mr. Johnson’s negotiator, David Frost, told the Europeans that it made no sense for them to come, but added that he and his interlocutor, Michel Barnier, will still speak next week — suggesting that lines of communication remain open even if there will be no formal negotiations. Mr. Barnier’s spokesman gave a different account of the conversation, saying that the two men agreed to talk again on Monday “to discuss the structure of these talks.” Financial markets took the latest drama in stride — mindful, perhaps, that as long ago as February, Mr. Johnson threatened to walk away from the negotiations within four months if things did not go his way. “Some saber rattling is part and parcel of any international trade negotiation,” wrote Kallum Pickering, senior economist with Berenberg Bank in London. “In our view, Johnson’s message seems to be more of a negotiating tactic in the hope of clinching a deal rather than a genuine desire to end ongoing talks immediately.” British businesses were less relaxed, however, warning of huge price increases for consumers because of tariffs and border delays and disruptions. “The prime minister’s statement signals that we are heading into very dangerous territory,” said Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, a British industry association, in a statement. “In the event of a no-deal Brexit, shoppers will — literally — pay a heavy price.” Allie Renison, a senior policy adviser at the Institute of Directors, which represents Britain’s business leaders, said that “getting ready for no deal in the middle of a pandemic will be a herculean task for many businesses.”']",The prime minister blew up over what he called Europe’s insistence that Britain make all the compromises. But Europe says it still wants to talk.
"The Beirut Blast Shattered Her Masterpieces. Now, the Rebuilding Starts.",2020-10-16,By Ben Hubbard,"['HAZMIYEH, Lebanon — Her hands created the gentle smile on the face of the Virgin Mary, the folds in the robes of the Four Evangelists and the glow surrounding the cherubic baby Jesus. In three decades of exacting work, Maya Husseini had established herself as Lebanon’s premier stained-glass artist, her work making the light of the Mediterranean dance in many of the country’s best-known churches. As she celebrated her 60th birthday on Aug. 3, she was looking forward to wrapping up a final project and retiring. But Lebanon had other plans. The next day, an enormous explosion in the port of Beirut ripped through entire neighborhoods, gutting apartment buildings, killing more than 190 people and causing billions of dollars in damage. It also tore through churches housing Ms. Husseini’s work, reducing a dozen of her delicate tableaus to jagged shards and twisted metal. “Thirty years of my professional life were gone,” she said in an interview after the blast in her workshop near Beirut. “Dust!” In the aftermath, as her phone filled with images sent by distraught priests and pastors showing her work obliterated, Ms. Husseini decided that retirement would have to wait. “I wanted to stop, but I don’t have the right to stop,” she said. “It is patrimony. You don’t have the right not to bring it back the way it was.” There have always been risks to working in such a fragile medium in a country so prone to violent shocks. Since its 15-year civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon has lived through political assassinations, Israeli airstrikes, jihadist car bombings and the influx of more than a million refugees from neighboring Syria. All of that was before new crises over the last year ravaged downtown Beirut and tanked the economy. But Ms. Husseini’s life and art had always traversed the chaos that before the Beirut blast only occasionally reached into sacred spaces. One of those was a church damaged in the 2005 car bombing that killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Her first major project, extensive stained-glass images in the Notre Dame du Mont church in the mountain town of Adma, was also damaged when Israel bombed a nearby television antenna during its war with the Hezbollah militant group in 2006. But last month’s blast, the largest explosion in Lebanon’s history, greatly surpassed the other blows, and the toll on her work was clear during a recent visit to her workshop outside Beirut, where the large metal door had been punched in by the impact. In the entryway sat the remains of shattered stained-glass windows from three churches and one home, in hopes that they could be repaired. Inside, an energetic Ms. Husseini looked on as two assistants pieced together the paper pattern of a large portrait of Jesus, Mary and Joseph during the flight to Egypt. She had installed the original in Beirut’s Saint Joseph Church in 1992 and dug up the original pattern after it was destroyed in the blast to make it all over again. Ms. Husseini grew up in a Maronite Christian family in Beirut, where she and her four sisters went to church regularly and she began drawing at age 12. She was 15 at the outbreak of Lebanon’s civil war, when an array of militias battled for turf, scarring and dividing the city. She studied at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts and did a two-month stint focused on stained glass at Ateliers Loire in Chartres, France, home to the cathedral thought by many experts to have the finest stained-glass windows in the world. Although Lebanon has more Christians per capita than any other Arab state, stained-glass windows were not common in its churches before the war, Ms. Husseini said. But after the guns fell silent in 1990, some congregations wanted to add them as the country rebuilt. The first barrier she had to overcome, she said, was the hesitation of male church leaders to hire a woman for what was seen as physically demanding work. “It was not often that they would trust you,” she said. Her father, an engineer who built churches, convents and religious schools, helped her get started, and she completed her first commission in 1991 — more than 1,300 square feet of glass in the church in Adma, featuring scenes from the life of Christ. The next year, she crafted images of saints and a mural of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Egypt for the St. Joseph Church in Beirut. As her name spread, she got more jobs, ultimately designing and producing stained glass for more than 35 churches and related facilities around Lebanon. She also did facades and murals for homes and the red, yellow and blue windows of the Sursock Museum, a private contemporary art museum in Beirut. In 2016, she completed one of her most important projects: 39 windows in the 150-year-old St. Louis Cathedral in downtown Beirut, with the annunciation of Mary, Jesus’s birth, Jesus washing the disciples’ feet, the crucifixion and the resurrection. Around the cathedral’s cupola, she put 10 angel musicians. “It was a lot of work,” she said. Some pieces were fired in the kiln four times because of all the detail. Her process has changed little over the years. She works only on blown glass and by hand, with no computers. After getting a commission and visiting the site to assess the light, she draws the design full size in pencil and felt-tip pen. Each section of the drawing gets two numbers: one for its place, the other for its color. She then cuts them with special scissors and uses the pieces as patterns to cut the glass. Panes with illustrations such as faces and clothes are painted by hand and fired in a kiln to bind the paint to the glass. The pieces are then assembled with lead strips, welded into a frame and covered with mastic, a kind of sealant, for protection. Nearly all of the supplies are imported — the glass from France and the lead from Canada — which has made it harder for Ms. Husseini to get them, because Lebanon’s currency has lost about 80 percent of its value since last year. “Everything is from abroad,” she said. “Only the head and hands are Lebanese.” Before the blast, Ms. Husseini’s major remaining project was the glass for a new basilica in Jordan, near the spot in the Jordan River where it is said that John the Baptist baptized Jesus. That was to take two years, after which she planned to shift to instructing young Lebanese artisans in the craft. Ms. Husseini was in her family’s house in the mountains above Beirut when she heard the blast on Aug. 4, but she did not immediately grasp its magnitude. Her son-in-law’s grandmother was injured and rushed to the hospital, and her patrons flooded her phone with heartbroken messages and photos of her shattered work blown across church floors. A few days later, she began visiting sites that had once held her glass, and it was the St. Louis Cathedral that shocked her most. Of the 39 windows she had labored over for two years, only three remained. “That’s when I felt the size of the catastrophe,” she said. In the weeks since, she has returned to work, hiring new assistants to accelerate repair jobs and beginning the lengthy process of getting materials from abroad. Fixing everything could take years, and her most extensive projects are on hold while congregations gather money for restoration. In Europe, the stained-glass trade was traditionally passed from father to son, she said, but neither of her adult children is interested. Her son is pursuing a doctorate in Switzerland and her daughter, an interior designer, plans to emigrate to Canada. But Ms. Husseini hopes that the repair process will teach younger artisans the trade and keep it going when she finally retires. “If I stopped, this work would completely stop in Lebanon,” she said. “And it would be a shame if it stopped.”']","Over three decades as Lebanon’s premier stained-glass artist, Maya Husseini advanced a fragile medium in a country prone to violent shocks.

A Chinese city says it has given some residents a vaccine.,2020-10-16,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['A city in eastern China has started inoculating some people against the coronavirus with a vaccine that has not finished late-stage clinical trials, ignoring warnings from scientists that the campaign could carry major health risks. The announcement on Thursday, by health officials in the eastern city of Jiaxing, highlights how China has expanded its mass vaccination campaign  even before rigorous testing concludes. The push  has bewildered several scientists, who have pointed out that China’s outbreak has been well under control for months. The vaccine, developed by the private Chinese company Sinovac Biotech, is being provided on an “emergency use” basis in Jiaxing, the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. The agency said the government would prioritize people in relatively high-risk jobs, including medical workers, port inspectors and public service personnel. After that, ordinary citizens would be allowed to make reservations at community-level vaccination sites, the agency said. Two doses would be made available to people aged 18 to 59 for around $60, to be given at an interval of 14 to 28 days. Since July, Chinese vaccine makers have vaccinated tens of thousands of employees at state-owned companies, government officials and executives from vaccine companies. The Chinese government has indicated in recent weeks that it would expand the campaign to include  teachers, travelers and supermarket workers. Zhejiang, the eastern province where Jiaxing lies, “has steadily and orderly promoted the emergency use of the coronavirus vaccine” Chen Guangsheng, a top provincial official in charge of epidemic prevention efforts, said on Friday. He added that Zhejiang had also started “the voluntary vaccination of key recommended subjects.” Mr. Chen told a news briefing that the government had administered 743,000 doses of flu and coronavirus vaccines. An official refused to provide a breakdown. Mr. Chen’s comments prompted several Chinese media outlets to misreport that the figure was referring to the number of people who had taken a vaccine for the coronavirus. ']",
"Who Was ‘El Padrino,’ Godfather to Drug Cartel? Mexico’s Defense Chief, U.S. Says",2020-10-16,By Azam Ahmed and Alan Feuer,"['MEXICO CITY — American law enforcement agents were listening in as Mexican cartel members chattered on a wiretap, talking about a powerful, shadowy figure known as El Padrino, or The Godfather. Agents had been closing in on him for months, suspecting that this central figure in the drug trade was a high-ranking official in the Mexican military. All of a sudden, one of the people under surveillance told his fellow cartel members that El Padrino happened to be on television at that very moment. The agents quickly checked to see who it was — and found it was the Mexican secretary of defense, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, according to four American officials involved in the investigation. In that moment, the authorities say, they finally confirmed that the mystery patron of one of the nation’s most violent drug cartels was actually the leader in charge of waging Mexico’s war against organized crime. It was a stunning display of how deep the tendrils of organized crime run in Mexico, and on Thursday night General Cienfuegos was taken into custody by the American authorities at the Los Angeles airport while traveling with his family. Even for Mexico, a country often inured to the unrelenting violence and corruption that have gripped it for years, the arrest was nothing less than extraordinary, piercing the veil of invincibility that the nation’s armed forces have long enjoyed. Mr. Cienfuegos, Mexico’s defense minister from 2012 to 2018, is being charged with laundering money and trafficking heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and marijuana from late 2015 through early 2017, according to an indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of New York on Friday. The charges are the result of a multi-year sting that investigators called Operation Padrino. Officials say that General Cienfuegos helped the H-2 cartel, a criminal group that committed horrific acts of violence as part of its drug smuggling business, with its maritime shipments. In exchange for lucrative payouts, officials say, General Cienfuegos also directed military operations away from the cartel and toward its rivals. The news not only casts a pall over Mexico’s fight against organized crime, but also underscores the extent of corruption at the highest levels of government. General Cienfuegos was defense minister throughout the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who left office two years ago. The damage to Mexico is hard to overstate. The general’s arrest comes only 10 months after another top Mexican official — who once led the Mexican equivalent of the F.B.I. — was indicted in New York on charges of taking bribes while in office to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful criminal mafias. That official, Genaro García Luna, served as the head of Mexico’s Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005, and for the next six years was Mexico’s secretary of public security, a cabinet-level position. In that role, he had the task of helping the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, create the nation’s strategy to battle drug cartels. If the men are convicted, it means that two of the highest-ranking and most widely respected commanders ever to oversee the war on drugs in Mexico were working with organized crime — helping the very cartels that continue to kill record numbers of Mexicans. The two cases call into question the American role in the drug war as well. For years, American officials have helped shape and fund Mexico’s strategies, and they have relied on their Mexican counterparts for operations, intelligence and broad security cooperation. If the allegations hold up, some of those same Mexican leaders were playing a double game. “The difficulty in working in Mexico where you have this level of corruption is that you never really know who you’re working with,” said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. “There’s always a concern that Mexican law enforcement could compromise you, or compromise an informant, or compromise an investigation.” Both Mr. García Luna and General Cienfuegos served at the top of the government when homicides spiked to historic levels, drug cartels waged war and military operations were expanded. A mercurial presence, General Cienfuegos symbolized the prominent role the military plays in Mexico. Commanders are granted an extraordinary amount of autonomy, seldom bowing to political pressures and typically enjoying protection by the president. “There has never been a minister of defense in Mexico arrested,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former Mexican foreign minister. “The minister of defense in Mexico is a guy that not only runs the army and is a military man, but he reports directly to the president. There is no one above him except the president.” Because of that power and autonomy, analysts and others have long suspected some top leaders of corruption. But with their elevated status, no one dared investigate — at least not in Mexico. “This is a huge deal,” said Alejandro Madrazo, a professor at CIDE, a university in Mexico. “The military has become way more corrupt and way more abusive since the war on drugs was declared, and for the first time they may not be untouchable — but not by the Mexican government, by the American government.” On Friday, responding to the arrest, Mexico’s current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, both defended the military and decried the bad actors in it. But it was unclear whether Mr. López Obrador would step back from his heavy reliance on the military, whose role has expanded during his administration to include everything from construction to public security. Mexico’s military has been a central part of the nation’s domestic security since the crackdown on drug cartels began in 2006, with soldiers deployed to regions overrun by organized crime. The secretary of defense oversees that effort. The use of soldiers trained in combat but not in policing has brought problems well beyond corruption. With the military front and center in the fight against narcotics trafficking, the Mexican government has never built an effective police force. In December 2017, Mexico passed a security law cementing the military’s role in fighting the drug war, outraging the United Nations and human rights groups. They warned that the measure would lead to abuses, leave troops on the streets indefinitely and militarize police activities for the foreseeable future. General Cienfuegos played a crucial role in convincing politicians to pass the law, which gave the military legal permission to do what it had been doing for a decade without explicit authorization. At one point, he threatened to withdraw his troops from the streets, arguing they were not trained for domestic security and were exposed legally. But General Cienfuegos also defended the military, saying it was the only institution effectively confronting organized crime. As drug violence rocketed, he asked again and again that the federal government provide a legal framework to protect the forces. “Today the crimes we are dealing with are of another level and importance; they involve a lot of people, sometimes entire families, and we are acting without a legal frame,” General Cienfuegos said in March 2018. “Without it, our help is impeded.” The military has repeatedly been singled out for human rights abuses and the use of excessive force, including accusations of extrajudicial killings that dogged the armed forces throughout General Cienfuegos’s tenure as defense minister. His arrest does not appear to have been a joint operation with the Mexican government. It reaches back to an American-led investigation in late 2013 of a Mexican drug cartel run by Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, a successor to the once powerful Beltran-Leyva drug organization, according to two American law enforcement officials. Even though a group of American agents was able at the time to identify General Cienfuegos as a corrupt partner in the Meza Flores organization, there was pushback from other American and Mexican law enforcement agencies, and General Cienfuegos was never fully investigated, one of the officials said. But by 2015, the official said, pressure to do something about General Cienfuegos increased. At least two separate American wiretaps began to pick up chatter about a powerful underworld figure who was referred to as “Padrino” and was believed to be General Cienfuegos. The wiretaps had targeted the Sinaloa cartel and the H-2 cartel, a smaller criminal organization connected to Mr. Meza Flores’s group, the former official said. The U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn has in recent months become ground zero for cases related to official corruption in Mexico. Prosecutors there have not only charged Mr. García Luna and two of his former associates, Ramon Pequeno and Luis Cardenas Palomino, but have also prosecuted Edgar Veytia, the former attorney general of the state of Nayarit. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison last October for conspiring with the H-2 cartel. The case against General Cienfuegos helps illustrate in some ways why it has been so difficult for Mexico to take the lead in these investigations. Among the findings by U.S. authorities: General Cienfuegos was actively corrupting other Mexican officials by introducing high-level cartel members to those willing to swap bribes for favors. At one point, court records say, he alerted the cartel that there was a U.S. investigation into their activities, prompting them to kill a fellow member they falsely believed to be sharing information with the authorities.

Retired French Surgeon Faces 312 Pedophilia and Abuse Charges,2020-10-16,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — A retired French surgeon has been charged with the rape and sexual assault of more than 300 people, a vast majority of whom were under 15, in what could be France’s biggest-ever pedophilia and sexual abuse case. Joël Le Scouarnec, 70, a specialist in abdominal surgery, is accused of having abused 312 people over three decades at several hospitals in central and western France. The authorities said details about the identities of the victims, whose average age was 11, were included in private diaries kept by Mr. Le Scouarnec, where he described at length the sexual abuses he is accused of perpetrating. Fewer than 50 were adults. “It is an unusual case to say the least, correctly described as extraordinary, both because of the number of its victims and the conditions that led to the exposure of the crimes,” Stéphane Kellenberger, the state prosecutor in charge of the case, told reporters on Thursday. Mr. Le Scouarnec had already been charged with sexual abuse of minors in 2017, a case that led investigators to discover the diaries. France has been rocked by a series of sexual abuse and pedophilia scandals; the most recent was that of Gabriel Matzneff, a writer who, for decades, wrote openly of his pedophilia with the protection of some French elites. But Mr. Le Scouarnec’s case is perhaps the largest ever in France involving sexual abuse and pedophilia by an individual. “The scale of the case is really unprecedented,” said Pierre Verdrager, a sociologist who has studied pedophilia. “I am not aware of a case with so many victims.” The public prosecutor’s office had initially identified 343 potential victims but eventually dismissed 31 cases because the statute of limitations had lapsed or for lack of evidence. Among the remaining 312 people, all thought to have been abused between 1986 and 2014, about 100 were most likely raped and about 200 sexually assaulted, Mr. Kellenberg said. French laws prohibit sex between an adult and a minor under the age of 15, but it is not automatically considered rape. Further circumstances, such as the use of coercion, threats, or violence, are necessary to characterize such sexual relationships as rape. France recently toughened laws against sex crimes and extended the statute of limitations for rape against a minor to 30 years from 20 years. “We are faced with the pedophilia case of the century, because of the personality of the perpetrator and because of the facts,” said Francesca Satta, a lawyer representing about 20 accusers in the case. Mr. Le Scouarnec was first arrested in 2017 after a 6-year-old girl living in his neighborhood reported him to her parents. Mr. Le Scouarnec allegedly showed her his penis and digitally penetrated her, said Ms. Satta, who is also the girl’s lawyer. That led to an investigation on sexual abuses committed against four underage girls between 1989 and 2017, including the 6-year-old girl and two members of Mr. Le Scouarnec’s own family, resulting in charges of rape, sexual assault and exhibitionism. Mr. Le Scouarnec is in prison awaiting trial in the case, scheduled for late next month. What investigators did not anticipate, however, was that a search of Mr. Le Scouarnec’s home as part of this first investigation revealed much more than expected. Along with three-foot-tall toy dolls, mannequin wigs and child pornography images, police officers said they found secret diaries recounting in great detail Mr. Le Scouarnec’s sexual encounters with scores of children at hospitals where he practiced between 1989 and 2017. Mr. Kellenberg, the state prosecutor, said Thursday that investigators carried out “the most exhaustive and methodical analysis possible of these elements,” which took “the form of an unbearable enumeration.” The diaries, which consisted of notes typed on a computer, included “some paragraphs, elaborate and detailed, rich in details that are difficult to bear.” The children were, most of the time, abused in a hospital, while under anesthetic substances, sedation and other medical treatments, Mr. Kellenberg said. Mr. Le Scouarnec’s diaries included dates and details about the identities of the children, officials said, allowing the police to trace them to obtain their testimony, leading to the indictment Thursday on charges of rape and sexual assault. Thibaut Kurzawa, Mr. Le Scouarnec’s lawyer, denounced what he called a “show procedure,” saying his client’s rights of defense had been violated and his safety endangered. But he declined to comment on the charges. Mr. Le Scouarnec had already been given a four-month suspended jail sentence in 2005 for possessing child pornography. But the sentence did not prevent him from practicing medicine. “This is a major institutional dysfunction,” said Mr. Verdrager, the sociologist, who said medical and judicial authorities bore responsibility. He added that, as was the case with Mr. Matzneff, the writer, Mr. Le Scouarnec was part of an elite that might have shielded him from retaliation. Mr. Kellenberger announced that an investigation had been started to determine if other people had been aware of Mr. Le Scouarnec’s actions and failed to report them.']","Prosecutors said the rapes and sexual assaults took place at several hospitals over three decades, and were documented in a diary. Most of the accusers were 15 or younger."
"For Young Rohingya Brides, Marriage Means a Perilous, Deadly Crossing",2020-10-17,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — Haresa counted the days by the moon, waxing and waning over the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Her days on the trawler, crammed into a space so tight that she could not even stretch her legs, bled into weeks, the weeks into months. “People struggled like they were fish flopping around,” Ms. Haresa, 18, said of the other refugees on the boat. “Then they stopped moving.” Dozens of bodies were thrown overboard, some beaten and some starved, survivors said. Ms. Haresa’s aunt died, then her brother.  Six full moons after she boarded the fishing boat in Bangladesh with hopes that human traffickers would ferry her to Malaysia for an arranged marriage, Ms. Haresa, who goes by one name, and almost 300 other Rohingya refugees found sanctuary in Indonesia last month. Her sister, 21, died two days after the boat landed. Banished from their homes in Myanmar and crammed into refugee settlements in neighboring Bangladesh, thousands of Rohingya have taken the perilous boat crossing to Malaysia, where many from the persecuted minority group toil as undocumented workers. Hundreds have died along the way.  Most of those now undertaking the trip, like Ms. Haresa, are girls and young women from refugee camps in Bangladesh whose parents have promised them in marriage to Rohingya men in Malaysia. Two-thirds of those who landed in Indonesia last month with Ms. Haresa were female. Amira Bibi and her family escaped their native Rakhine State, in Myanmar’s far west, as the military torched hundreds of Rohingya villages three years ago. The fourth of nine siblings, she said she knew her place in life.  “My parents are getting old and my brothers are with their own families,” she said. “How long are my parents going to bear the burden of me?” Through the matchmaking of a cousin in Malaysia who works as a grass-cutter, Ms. Bibi’s parents found a fiancé for her. She asked for details about the man but none were provided, apart from his name, she said. After surviving more than six months at sea in a failed attempt to reach him, Ms. Bibi spoke from Indonesia with her fiancé a country away. The phone call lasted two minutes. “He sounded young,” she said. That is the extent of what she knows about him. Ms. Bibi initially told staff from the United Nations refugee agency that she was 15 years old, but later amended her age to 18. Child marriage is common among the Rohingya, especially in rural populations. Mostly stateless, the Muslim minority has been subjected to an apartheidlike existence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Over the past few years, waves of pogroms have pushed the Rohingya across the border to Bangladesh, where human traffickers prey on the young and desperate in the refugee camps, along with their families. The flow of people has surged since 2017, when more than three-quarters of a million Rohingya fled an ethnic cleansing campaign in Myanmar. With the coronavirus pandemic tightening borders, the journey by sea has gotten even more difficult. For months this year, boats laden with hundreds of Rohingya migrants drifted at sea, unable to find a safe haven. The authorities in Thailand and Malaysia repeatedly pushed them away. Fishermen in Aceh, on the tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, are among the few who have welcomed the Rohingya. A battered trawler with around 100 refugees landed in June, followed by the larger boat on Sept. 7. “The question is how Southeast Asia as a region responds to this humanitarian crisis on its doorstep,” said Indrika Ratwatte, the director for Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations refugee agency. The Bangladeshi government, struggling with its own vulnerable population amid the pandemic, has threatened to relocate thousands of Rohingya from the camps to a cyclone-prone islet in the Bay of Bengal. The silty island was uninhabited until the Bangladeshi Navy forced about 300 Rohingya — many of them women and children — to shelter there this summer, when their attempt to sail to Malaysia ended after months at sea. Earlier this month, several Rohingya died in clashes between different gangs in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, which is considered the largest settlement of refugees in the world. Some women say they venture out as little as possible to use public latrines for fear of sexual violence. Shamsun Nahar, 17, said she was desperate to leave the camps, even though she had heard the stories of how dangerous the crossing could be. Her father, a cleric, found her a match, a man from the same village in Rakhine who is working as a carpenter in Malaysia. “I talked to him on a video call, and I liked him from every angle,” Ms. Nahar said of their brief courtship by phone. “He was not too big, not too small. He looked good.” Her fiancé was to pay $4,500 for her passage, Ms. Nahar said. The spot she occupied for months on the boat was near the engine, so noisy that she could not hear others’ voices.  The smugglers and brokers, both Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, beat them with plastic pipes, she said. Food was served on a plastic sheet smeared with remnants from the previous weeks, shrouding every meal with a putrid smell. “I am safe now, but I am separated from my family and my fiancé,” Ms. Nahar said after arriving in Indonesia last month. “What will happen next? I do not know.” Although previous waves of Rohingya who landed in Indonesia have mostly made their way to Malaysia, only a few from this year’s crossings have been able to unite with their families or future husbands. When Naemot Shah married his wife, Majuma Bibi, he was 14 and she was 12. The roofs of their childhood houses in Rakhine touched, he said, as close as could be. In 2014, Mr. Shah paid human smugglers to take him from Rakhine to Malaysia, a 28-day journey that nearly killed him, he said. His daughter was only six months old when he left. Three years later, his family fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military’s campaign of killings, rapes and forced displacement against the Rohingya. From a refugee camp in Bangladesh, Mr. Shah’s wife pleaded with him to pay for her and their daughter to join him in Malaysia. Knowing how risky the trip was, he refused. But his wife, whom Mr. Shah described as “very clever,” quietly saved the money that he sent her from his job as a construction worker. In late March, she and her daughter boarded a fishing trawler bound, they hoped, for where her husband lived. “I was very upset that they went without my permission,” Mr. Shah said. As news of mass drownings reached him, he assumed his family had died at sea. But in June, Mr. Shah, 24, heard that a boat had landed in Indonesia. Scanning the crowds on a video, he recognized his wife and daughter. “I never felt such happiness as the day I found out they were alive,” Mr. Shah said. Other Rohingya in Malaysia have taken second or third wives, he said. But he will not. Instead, he traveled to Indonesia to reunite with his wife and daughter. “I will stick to one wife,” Mr. Shah said. “She traveled all this way, suffered this difficult time, for me.”']","Girls and young women from refugee camps in Bangladesh, promised to men they have never met, are undertaking the dangerous journey to Malaysia to join them."
"Badly Ill With Coronavirus, Some Ultra-Orthodox in Israel Choose Home Care",2020-10-16,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — When the elderly father of an ultra-Orthodox radio personality in Israel contracted the coronavirus recently, his family dreaded the prospect of his entering an isolated hospital ward and possibly never coming out. So the broadcaster made a round of calls that turned up an alternative. A small charity was offering an under-the-radar service treating mostly ultra-Orthodox and older Covid-19 patients in their homes, even in severe cases where health experts say it could endanger lives. Drawing on the services of a few doctors — and dozens of volunteers, most without medical training — it was operating out of a basement in Mea Shearim, a Jerusalem stronghold of the most extreme anti-Zionist Jewish sects that shun cooperation with the state. Hundreds had already turned to the charity for care out of a sense that remaining with family — and avoiding public hospitals — outweighed the risks. But the project was also tinged with a general distrust of government among the ultra-Orthodox community, which appears to be increasingly going it alone in handling the pandemic and many other aspects of daily life. Since the home-care initiative was reported by Israel’s N12 news service this week, health officials and experts have responded with a mix of condemnation and curiosity. One leading epidemiologist was among those who said the approach could help ease the burden on hospitals. The debate comes as Israel is under its second national lockdown after daily infection and death rates soared to among the highest in the world, and ultra-Orthodox areas top the virus hot spots. Health officials say that about 50 percent of those aged over 65 and under 18 who are infected in Israel are from the ultra-Orthodox community, though it makes up no more than 13 percent of the country’s nine million citizens. And the actual infection numbers may be even higher: The charity does not report coronavirus cases to the authorities, which may be skewing the national virus data on which policymakers base their decisions. Dr. Sharon Elrai-Price, a senior Health Ministry official, denounced the operation as a “dangerous” departure and said the ministry was looking into the legality of some aspects of it. Dr. Ran Balicer, an Israeli health care official who advises the government on the pandemic, called the charity “a gamble.” A coronavirus patient’s condition can deteriorate rapidly, he said, adding it was “hard to predict a moment of no return for people who might have survived had they reached the hospital in time.” But Dr. Gabriel Barbash, a leading Israeli professor of epidemiology, is among those who view the charity’s approach as a possible way to ease the load on hospitals and worthy of further study. Other advocates insist that even in severe cases, a calm home environment can aid recovery. Yitzhak Markovitz, a member of a small Hasidic sect, started the at-home care service about six months ago through his charity, Hasdei Amram. He said his patients generally avoided taking government Covid-19 tests to evade official attention and pressure to go to hospitals, adding that those factors are also why he does not report cases to the authorities. The charity offers a limited range of treatments compared with a hospital, providing only oxygen support, medication and close monitoring by a doctor. Its services are not exclusively for the ultra-Orthodox, though most patients do come from that community. The hardest part, Mr. Markovitz said, is recruiting doctors because they fear being investigated should anything go wrong. The ultra-Orthodox community has long kept itself apart in an effort to shield members from outside influences. But their ways have riled many other Israelis. Its school system operates independently of the Education Ministry. Many ultra-Orthodox men study the Torah full-time instead of working in paid jobs, and they receive government stipends to remain in seminaries while being largely exempted from mandatory military service. Many from the community live in almost exclusively ultra-Orthodox cities and West Bank settlements. And now, their independent approach to dealing with the pandemic is exacerbating the country’s religious-secular divide. Gilad Malach, who directs the ultra-Orthodox program at the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank, said the second wave of the country’s coronavirus outbreak, which began this summer, was “a microcosm of the whole story of the Haredim” in Israel, referring to the ultra-Orthodox. “They cannot be a state within a state,” he said. “If 50 percent of the sick are Haredim, it affects the whole country.” “There is a huge amount of anger and criticism over their behavior among the general population,” he added. “So we are both linked to one another but more alienated from each other.” Many Israelis blame the community for the country’s second full lockdown after ultra-Orthodox politicians used their political clout to thwart plans for more limited local lockdowns that would have targeted their towns. And while some ultra-Orthodox rabbis have urged compliance with government regulations against large gatherings, others have flouted them, relying more on the power of prayer. Having large families crammed into typically small apartments has contributed to the high infection rates within the community. The independent Haredi school system has remained at least partly open while state schools have been closed. And as in Brooklyn, inter-communal tensions have been fueled by scenes of large weddings, funerals and religious gatherings in ultra-Orthodox communities. Police enforcement has been erratic and has led to clashes. Still, national infection rates in Israel have fallen under the lockdown restrictions, some of which are expected to be eased on Sunday. Although Mr. Markovitz’s service began with treating cases in Mea Shearim, it soon spread to other ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in Jerusalem and other cities. Supporters claim amazing recovery rates, far exceeding the national ones for older people. Mr. Markovitz said that only about 20 of his 2,000 cases had ended up in the hospital and that only a fraction of those 20 ultimately died. “What we see from this whole experience,” he said, “is that when a person is in good mood and spirits, that’s when the situation improves.” But critics say the project’s data is unreliable. Mr. Markovitz said he had begun keeping a register of patients only over the last month and that he currently had about 500 receiving care. He and a volunteer said that up to 170 of them had blood oxygen levels below the point at which health experts would advise hospitalization. Families pay 1,000 shekels (just under $300) for a private visit from a doctor who takes blood samples and sends them to a private lab for testing. The price includes follow-up monitoring by the doctor, mostly remotely. Volunteers, who are mostly seminary students, wear protective clothing to deliver drugs and donated equipment, including devices for measuring blood oxygen levels and oxygen generators. Young family members who are prepared to risk infection help care for the patient. Patients who require intubation are transferred to Israel’s hospitals, which are currently treating about 800 virus cases. A few other organizations in Israel offer some at-home health care services for coronavirus patients, though no other operations on the scale of Mr. Markovitz’s have come to light since the pandemic struck. Yad Sarah, Israel’s largest volunteer organization for health and home care services, has been providing oxygen devices. The public health system offers some degree of home care for mild cases. And a private clinic associated with a major Tel Aviv hospital offers high-end home treatment for wealthy virus patients at a hefty cost, according to Israeli media reports. For Avi Mimran, a popular presenter on the ultra-Orthodox Kol Hai radio station, what mattered was saving his father. Yitzhak Mimran, 85, was running a fever and tested positive for the virus a few weeks ago. Within an hour of calling Mr. Markovitz’s charity, Mr. Mimran said, a doctor was at his father’s door. The fever and some breathing problems persisted for about a week. The doctor stayed in touch twice a day, and three granddaughters tended to him. Because he had been tested, health officials also called to check on him. Within a couple of weeks, he seemed to be feeling better. “In the hospital corona ward, people are isolated, alone and without family,” Mr. Mimran said. “They are completely cut off and that’s what kills.” Mr. Markovitz insisted that his efforts were not driven by ideology or anti-Zionist sentiment. “We are only about saving lives,” he said.']",Health experts say the treatment offered by a religious charity is a gamble. It has also fed concern about the community’s acting with increasing autonomy in an already divided nation.
"President Trump supports a bigger relief bill, but a deal is far from certain.",2020-10-15,By Alan Rappeport,"['President Trump, struggling to gain traction among voters just weeks before the election, called on Thursday for a bigger stimulus package than he had previously offered, and the White House signaled it was willing to make concessions to Democrats. But the proposals were unlikely to win the necessary backing from Senate Republicans who are preparing a far smaller bill of their own. White House negotiators have proposed a $1.8 trillion relief package. Mr. Trump said that he wanted one that was even bigger and suggested, without explanation, that China would pay for it. “I would go higher,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with the Fox Business Network. “Go big or go home.” The comments came after Mr. Mnuchin said that the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election. But the $1.8 trillion package that he has proposed has already proven to be a non-starter with Senate Republicans who have panned it as too costly, making Mr. Trump’s call for a more expensive bill another complication in the already fraught negotiations. Investors, who have been following the stimulus talks closely, seemed unmoved by statements from Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday, with stocks on Wall Street dropping for a third consecutive day. In the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more “targeted” relief bill.  But Mr. McConnell downplayed the prospects of a larger bill on Thursday. “He’s talking about a much larger amount than I can sell to my members,” Mr. McConnell said about the president’s comments.']",
Will a Half-Step by Macron Be Enough to Blunt France’s Second Wave?,2020-10-15,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — France thought it had beaten the coronavirus. Its comeback in a roaring second wave left the government scrambling this week for a half-measure that underscored its ugly choices. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, highlighted his own dilemma on Wednesday in announcing a curfew for Paris and eight other major cities. A new lockdown for an already reeling economy would have been “disproportionate,” he said, yet the pressure on intensive care beds was intolerable. “Our caregivers are exhausted,” he said. “The virus is recirculating very rapidly in Europe and in our country,” Mr. Macron said in an interview on national television. France had to “take back control.” If the virus ever was under control in France, that was before the summer. But, experts say, after that moment, the French, like so many others elsewhere in Europe, let their guard down. France’s attachment to its summer holidays, young people’s exuberance in going out and partying, a lack of vigilance in wearing masks and social distancing, the risks of resuming routine life, and the government’s failure — from the very start — to effectively test, trace and isolate infected people have all contributed to an explosive second wave of infections. Whether ordering people, starting Saturday, to stay in their homes from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. is the answer — restaurant owners and young people are already grumbling — cannot be known immediately. But the dire outlook was undeniable. With an average of nearly 20,000 new cases a day, health experts have been warning all week that the virus is out of control in France, particularly in cities. “Right now, we’ve got to put the brakes on it,” said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist on the French government’s Covid-19 advisory panel. “This curfew will limit contacts,” he said. “We’ve got to lower the rate right away. We don’t really have a choice.” Mircea Sofonea, an epidemiologist at the University of Montpellier, said that the new curfew came in “the last possible week to react” to prevent hospital saturation. He noted that a new study found that a curfew imposed in French Guiana reduced infections by 36 percent. Until Wednesday night, Mr. Macron’s own indecision had emphasized the quandary faced by governments all over Europe caught between faltering economies — France is facing a recession of nearly 9 percent — restriction-weary populations and a virus that will not quit. The government’s hesitancy was palpable this week. The prime minister, Jean Castex, chided the French for having “decided a little too quickly” that the virus no longer posed a threat. The same day, the tourism minister, Jean Baptiste Lemoyne, urged people to go on vacation during the upcoming school break, to prop up the country’s vital tourism industry, whose revenues are half what they were a year ago. Mr. Macron himself acknowledged the impossibility of barring upcoming French vacation-going in his remarks on Wednesday night. Lulled by a relatively successful handling of the first wave, the government failed to firmly put in place a critical triptych over the summer — testing, tracing and isolation. The numbers are not as high as they were last spring, but they are bad enough. Nearly 100 people died in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning, far below the 1,000-plus death tolls of mid-April but still alarming. Cases, flat through June and July, have been rising steadily since August, with 27,000 positive tests reported last Saturday. An infection rate of 5 to 6 cases per 100,000 people over the summer has spiraled to nearly 200 across France. It is up to 800 for 20- to 30-year-olds in Paris. The government has set the red alert limit at 150. In the interim, bars and gyms have been shut in major cities. Establishments that serve food remain open, even if cafe owners report confusion about what qualifies as enough of a meal to keep the police off their backs. There have been mixed messages, too, about going back to offices. The president of the region that includes Paris, Valérie Pécresse, appealed for a return last month, even as infections started to rise. The result is that central Paris bustles with office workers, compared with moribund downtowns in the United States, though nearly everybody wears a mask. On Wednesday, Mr. Macron encouraged at least a partial return to telecommuting. The gestation of the current infection boom was plainly visible in July, August and September. Visitors packed France’s summer watering holes after the government encouraged tourism, anxious also not to get crosswise of the sacred ritual that is the French summer holiday. A wave of indignation greeted mild suggestions that workers should give up some vacation days to compensate for those lost during the lockdown. In Paris, as they returned from these hot spots, young people spilled from crowded bars onto the sidewalks in the city’s bohemian eastern districts and massed along the banks of the Seine. There was no social distancing and few masks. France thought the virus was tamed. “There was certainly a lack of understanding in a part of the population that didn’t believe in a second wave,” said Renaud Piarroux, an epidemics specialist at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. “Some in the younger population abandoned the necessary precautions,” he said, like wearing a mask and social distancing. Before Mr. Macron’s announcement on Wednesday, several health experts predicted a severe reckoning in the coming weeks. “It’s all over,” William Dab, a former national director of public health who has been critical of the government’s response, said earlier this week. “We’ve lost the fight. It’s out of control.” Mr. Dab chided the government for what he called a “strategy deficit” that had not motivated individuals to change their behavior. In the Paris region, he added, “there is nothing left to be done.” On Thursday, the police searched the homes and offices of several current and former officials, including the health minister, Olivier Véran, as part of an inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic. The French Court of Justice, a special court that hears accusations of official mismanagement, opened the investigation in July. The one ray of hope in France, as elsewhere, is that treatment methods have improved since the spring, allowing more patients to be saved. Still, the head of Paris hospitals, Martin Hirsch, warned on Tuesday that coronavirus patients would most likely fill up to 90 percent of intensive care beds in the capital by next week. Already more than 1,600 of France’s 5,000 intensive-care beds are filled. A report from independent experts, commissioned by the government and released this week, concluded that France had done far better than Britain, Sweden, the United States and Southern Europe, but not as well as Austria or Germany. The French obeyed the lockdown imposed by the government in March, April and May. Then, with cases flatlining, they flocked back into the streets, stores, cafes and restaurants. Citizens let down their guard, reinforcing what Bernard Jomier, a member of the French Senate commission examining the government’s pandemic response, termed a “collective deficit of public health culture in our country.” “We are a country where the politics of prevention is not part of our culture,” he said in an interview this week. “There are elements in French society that are favorable to the development of the virus.” The consequence has been a “hesitation in the government’s official line,” said Mr. Jomier, a Greens party lawmaker who represents a Paris district. “The governance of public health is not well organized.” “Testing, tracing, isolating — this has been a failure,” he said. “Badly elaborated, badly implemented.” At Charles de Gaulle Airport for example, arriving travelers are tested, but they do not get the results for at least a week.  Contact tracing has also “failed,” Mr. Jomier said; Mr. Dab, the former public health director, called it a “fiasco” in an interview in the Journal du Dimanche in September, noting that the five contacts traced per case in July had dropped to two. “The number of contacts is very far below the actual number of contacts,” said Mr. Piarroux, the epidemics specialist. “It’s all happening over the phone. So there’s less motivation” to divulge the contacts. Both he and Mr. Jomier also said that isolation, the third part of the triptych, had hardly been enforced, pointing to out-of-control infection rates in shelters that house migrants. On Thursday, French newspapers grimly recalled the curfew imposed during the German occupation, and industry groups called for new help for struggling restaurants. “We can’t work from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.,” said Denis Kouch, the owner of a restaurant off the Champs-Élysées. “People don’t even have time to arrive, and then they have to leave right away?” Constant Méheut and Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']",The imposition of a curfew in several major cities underscored a difficult choice: further dampening the economy or risking more lives.
This Ex-Taliban Commander Is Now the Face of Afghan Security,2020-10-16,By David Zucchino and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL — Rahmatullah Andar was once a feared Taliban commander, locked in bloody skirmishes against American and Afghan government troops in the rugged landscape of eastern Afghanistan. In 2007, an American Special Operations team captured him during a night raid on a house in his ancestral village in Ghazni Province. He spent two years in an American-run prison at Bagram Air Base outside Kabul. Today, Commander Andar is Spokesman Andar — the official spokesman for the National Security Council of the American-backed government of Afghanistan. The story of how a former Talib became a high-ranking government security official is also a chronicle of the endless Afghan war itself: Allegiances shift. Enemies become allies. The players change roles, but the war endures. The 19-year-old conflict is as fiercely contested today as when Mr. Andar commanded Taliban fighters for several years, only to break with the militants and lead one of Afghanistan’s first local uprisings against the Taliban in 2012. He lost his father, 75, his brother, an uncle and two cousins — all killed by the Taliban out of revenge, he said. Today Mr. Andar is a religious scholar with two master’s degrees who serves a government he once vowed to overthrow. And he remains a target of his former comrades in arms, who regard him as a turncoat. “The Taliban intend to assassinate me,” Mr. Andar, 41, said during an interview inside the presidential palace complex in Kabul. “Whether I’m a member of the government or not, they will never leave me alive.” Mr. Andar, alternating among Pashto, Persian and English, was relaxed and voluble as he recounted a life spent on battlefields, on the run, in universities and in prisons. He is a consummate survivor. He described withstanding Taliban kidnapping attempts and ambushes, interrogations by American captors, and two stints in Afghan government prisons — accounts born out by official records and by those who fought alongside him. With his tangled beard and long hair, he might still be mistaken for a Talib, though he insists that he regards the militants with contempt — and hopes to serve as an example of how the insurgents hold no monopoly on Afghan piety. He was appointed to his National Security Council position by President Ashraf Ghani on Sept. 25, in large part because of both his religious credentials — he has earned the religious honorific of Mawlawi, meaning Islamic scholar — and his reputation as a fighter against the Taliban. His appointment was a clear statement from the Afghan government, as a central idea behind the Taliban’s criticism is that the government remains insufficiently Islamic, and is a puppet of the Americans. A single appointment cannot polish the religious image of an entire government, Mr. Andar acknowledged. “But the government can show by its actions that the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is more than just a name,” he said. And he said the Taliban, by signing a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February while freezing out the Afghan government, had undercut its own claims of Islamic purity. “They say government officials are infidels, but they have an agreement with the Americans, whose troops invaded Afghanistan,” he said. “So now they have no logic for this war” against fellow Afghans and Muslims. The Taliban have said that any new government arising from negotiations with Afghan representatives in Doha, Qatar, must be based on Islamic principles. Some analysts have interpreted that to mean the same harsh Shariah law that was imposed when the Taliban governed Afghanistan in the late 1990s. Mr. Andar said the Taliban could not change Afghanistan’s Constitution without the consent of a loya jirga, a traditional gathering where matters of national importance are debated. And Article 3 of the Constitution already stipulates that no law “can be contrary to the beliefs and rules of the holy religion of Islam,” he said. Many Afghan women have expressed fears that a return to government by the Taliban would erase gains they have made since the militants were overthrown in 2001. The Taliban beat women, confined them to their homes and banned them from going to school. Mr. Andar said those prohibitions were not properly rooted in Islam, as the religion does not forbid girls and women from attending school. In fact, he said, the closing of schools by the Taliban in his home district is what precipitated his split from the movement three years after his release from American custody. “The Taliban closed the schools and opposed reconstruction, kidnapping and killing engineers,” said Amanullah Kamran, deputy of the provincial council in Ghazni. He said Mr. Andar, who supported women’s education and the U.S.-led reconstruction effort, took up arms against the Taliban and helped form one of the country’s first local uprisings against the insurgency. Mr. Kamran said the fighting left nearly 500 Afghans dead in the district and another 500 wounded. Mr. Andar himself was wounded in battles that ultimately killed his closest male relatives, he said. “Finally there was no man left in Rahmatullah’s family except Rahmatullah,” Mr. Kamran said. Mr. Andar said he now cares for 21 children and widows. Asked whether he still carried an AK-47 rifle from his combat days, he laughed and said he had only a pistol for personal protection. In recent months, the Taliban have mounted a series of targeted attacks against government officials and those perceived to be government supporters. But Mr. Andar explained his shifting allegiances by blaming both the government and the Taliban. He said he joined the Taliban after the government jailed him for two months in 2003 upon his return from religious studies in Pakistan. “The government pushed me to the Taliban by its actions against me,” he said. Years later, he said, he turned against the Taliban once the militants began closing schools and terrorizing the residents of his district — violations of Islamic strictures. “Even fighting has rules under Islam, and the Taliban broke those religious rules,” he said. A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Mr. Andar and his male relatives were legitimate targets because they had collaborated with Americans while commanding pro-government militias. After the Taliban burned the homes of Mr. Andar and his relatives — torching his personal Quran and killing their livestock — Mr. Andar said he fled to Kabul. There, he earned a second master’s degree, in educational management, to supplement a previous master’s in Islamic studies. He later served as a religious adviser for the National Security Council. In his current position, Mr. Andar encounters former enemies. Asadullah Khalid, the acting defense minister, was governor of Ghazni Province when Mr. Andar was arrested and jailed there. “I see him in meetings now and he tells me he’s my friend. We respect each other,” Mr. Andar said. The spokesman’s job also requires an alliance with American and Afghan military commanders. Asked whether his fighters had killed or wounded American and Afghan troops, Mr. Andar shrugged. “It was a war,” he said. “Of course there were casualties.”']","Rahmatullah Andar once fought the government and then turned against the Taliban. Now he is a prominent spokesman, and his story is an example of the long war’s many plot twists."
Turkey Moves Closer to Activating Its Russian Air Defense System,2020-10-16,By Carlotta Gall and Eric Schmitt,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey fired a missile as a test of its Russian-made air defense system on Friday, a United States official confirmed, a move that breaks an agreement with the Trump administration and risks the imposition of sanctions by Congress. The Turkish military tested the air defense system, known as the S-400, in the Black Sea province of Sinop, A Haber television, a news outlet close to the government, first reported and a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity later confirmed. Video obtained by Reuters showed a white smoke trail rising high in the sky. There was no official confirmation from the Turkish government of the test launch, but also no denial of the news report. Turkey had been seen moving the missiles to Sinop and had issued several recent notices restricting air space and waters off the coastal area to allow for tests. The test launch brings Turkey closer to activating the system, a step that would further strain relations with the United States. A State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States had told Turkish officials at the most senior levels that the acquisition of Russian military systems like the S-400 was unacceptable, and that such systems should not be made operational. If officially confirmed, Ms. Ortagus said, “we would condemn in the strongest terms the S-400 test missile launch as incompatible with Turkey’s responsibilities as a NATO ally and strategic partner of the United States.” “We have also been clear on the potential serious consequences of our security relationship if Turkey activates the system,” she added. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey enraged the United States and other NATO allies last year by buying the advanced S-400 system. The system is aimed at countering American F-35 stealth bombers and other advanced Western weaponry, and military officials have complained that Turkey’s use of it will compromise NATO aircraft in the vicinity. The U.S. government suspended Turkey from its F-35 program and has warned that penalties could be imposed against it under a program known as Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Mr. Erdogan has insisted on Turkey’s right to buy the weapons systems as part of a more militarized and assertive foreign policy, and the S-400 system has become an important purchase in his relationship with Russia. In recent months, though, Mr. Erdogan had seemed to tread more carefully. Under an agreement with the Trump administration, Turkey had kept the missile system under wraps and since April had made no move to activate it. By moving closer to activating the S-400 system Mr. Erdogan was raising his bargaining power with the United States and NATO, but was also risking further penalties, said Asli Aydintasbas, senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “He is raising the value of the bargaining chip, but also the size of the risk,” she said. “It is a Russian roulette of sorts.” Mr. Erdogan may be calculating that President Trump will not win the election and that he has time to activate the S-400 since it would be months before a new administration took office and reviewed its policies toward Turkey, she added. Carlotta Gall reported from Istanbul, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.']","With the firing of a test missile, Turkey appeared to ignore an agreement with the Trump administration to delay putting the S-400 system into operation."
"Jacinda Ardern, Hero to Liberals Abroad, Is Validated at Home",2020-10-17,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Her face has graced magazine covers all over the world. Her leadership style has been studied by Harvard scholars. Her science-and-solidarity approach to the coronavirus has drawn legions of fans in other countries who write to say, “I wish you were here.” The global left (along with a chunk of the center) has fallen hard for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, giving her a prodigious presence for a leader who manages a smaller population than many mayors do. Now her country’s voters have come around as well. On Saturday, Ms. Ardern, 40, was well on her way to a second term. With most of the votes counted, her Labour Party was projected to win a clear majority in Parliament, with around 64 of 120 seats and 49 percent of the vote — its strongest showing by far since New Zealand overhauled its electoral system in the mid-1990s. Riding a wave of support for her “go hard, go early” response to the coronavirus, which has effectively been stamped out in the country, Ms. Ardern has now cemented her position as New Zealand’s most popular prime minister in generations, if not ever. “We will govern as we campaigned — positively,” Ms. Ardern said in her acceptance speech in Auckland Saturday night, adding: “We will build back better from the Covid crisis. This is our opportunity.” The sizable win reflects a rapid rise to political stardom. Three years ago, Ms. Ardern was a last-minute choice to lead the Labour Party, and in her first term she often struggled to fulfill her progressive promises like making housing more affordable, eliminating child poverty and attacking climate change. But after managing the responses to the Christchurch terrorist attacks, the White Island volcano eruption and a pandemic — not to mention the birth of her first child — she has become a global standard-bearer for a progressive politics that defines itself as compassionate and competent in crisis. “The anti-Trump?” That’s what Vogue called her. “Saint Jacinda?” That one comes from the usually staid Financial Times, while a New York Times editorial last year carried the headline “America Deserves a Leader as Good as Jacinda Ardern.” In New Zealand — a small-c conservative or small-c center kind of country where the love for Ms. Ardern had generally lagged behind her profile abroad — she now has a mandate more in line with her international adoration. If Labour gains at least 50 percent of the vote, it will be the first time since 1951 that a party has won an outright majority in New Zealand. What’s unknown is whether that will help deliver the major policy successes that have eluded her. “She has significant political capital,” said Jennifer Curtin, the director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland. “She’s going to have to fulfill her promises with more substance.” Ms. Ardern has said little about her legislative plans. She won primarily with a pandemic-fueled surge in support, as New Zealand recently declared community transmission of the coronavirus eliminated for a second time. The remote Pacific Island nation of five million people, which has tallied only 25 coronavirus deaths, now looks and feels mostly normal: A recent rugby match between Australia and New Zealand in Wellington, the capital, drew 30,000 fans. Given such progress when other countries are seeing coronavirus cases increase, Ms. Ardern sailed through her campaign with the slogan “Let’s keep moving.” Her opponent, Judith Collins, a lawyer and member of the center-right National Party, tried to dent her credibility by arguing that the virus had re-emerged in August on Ms. Ardern’s watch because of some kind of breach in protocol at the border or at a quarantine facility. At a handful of debates, Ms. Collins sought to portray Ms. Ardern as untrustworthy, more shine than steady leader. In the final days of the race, she labeled the prime minister a liar. “She told us on June 23 everybody was being tested. What a lie,” Ms. Collins said at a campaign event this week. “When she said she went hard and fast, she went slow and pathetic. And she lied to us about what was happening.” Polls showed that Ms. Collins never gained much traction with lines of attack like these. But even as Ms. Ardern glided to another term, her next government will confront an unfamiliar set of challenges. New Zealanders have historically liked their politics down the middle. Coalition governments are the norm, and Ms. Ardern’s first term was marked by a partnership with the populist, center-right New Zealand First Party, which was projected to win no seats this time around.  Now Labour will be able to govern on its own with the support of the Greens (they were projected to win around 10 seats) and the Maori Party (one seat), giving her more leeway to move left. The core decision that Ms. Ardern faces is how far to push, with which proposals, at a time when the economy is still threatened by the pandemic. In a parliamentary democracy like New Zealand’s, legislation can move quickly, which means the success or failure of new policies will fall squarely on her shoulders. “If you can’t blame the minor party for putting the hand brake on, then you better make sure you deliver,” said Richard Shaw, a politics professor at Massey University in Palmerston North. One option would be to abandon her usual preference for consensus and reach as far and fast as possible. The more likely choice, observers say, is that she will recognize that she won in part with center-right voters, and will linger in the center as she angles for a third or fourth term — a Labour dynasty. At her core, Professor Curtin said, “she’s a reformist rather than a radical.” Morgan Godfery, a writer and commentator who specializes in political issues affecting the Indigenous Maori people, said Ms. Ardern reflected the political environment from which she arose. “The Labour Party is something of a contradiction at the moment, because they are more popular than at any point since the 1940s, but they are more cautious,” he said. “They don’t seem quite sure on how they’re going to use that popularity. There’s very little new thinking on housing, tax, Maori issues.” During the campaign, Ms. Ardern ruled out a wealth tax favored by the Greens, which would require individuals with wealth of more than 1 million New Zealand dollars, or about $665,000, to pay 1 percent above that threshold as tax. Those whose wealth exceeds 2 million dollars would pay 2 percent. Asked for one new idea to stimulate the post-pandemic economy during the second debate in late September, she provided a conventional response. “Invest in our people,” she said. “Make apprenticeships free. Make vocational training free. Get them into vocational jobs that grow the economy.” Professor Curtin said that in many ways Ms. Ardern’s response to the pandemic’s economic impact — emphasizing infrastructure, small businesses and exporters — reflected traditional thinking that overlooked industries, such as health care and child care, that could do more for the economy and encourage greater equality. “She’s said she’s a feminist,” Professor Curtin said, “but she’s been careful and perhaps a little too slow in addressing the material well-being of many women in New Zealand, particularly poorer women or older women.” Oliver Hartwich, executive director of the New Zealand Initiative, a center-right think tank, said Ms. Ardern had been a more effective communicator than policy strategist. “When it comes to P.R., when it comes to her daily press conference in the Covid crisis — taking the people along and explaining what she wants to do and what she wants to achieve, there’s no one who comes even close to what Jacinda does. She’s phenomenal and a genuine talent,” Mr. Hartwich said. “Where she’s not good,” he added, “is on the details of policy, on the details of strategy, of execution, of implementation, of evaluations, of all the normal things that come along with government.” For many voters this week, though, Ms. Ardern’s clear skills in managing crises were more than enough. Steph Cole, 58, a motel owner in Hamilton, said she usually cast her ballot for the National Party. She voted Labour for the first time, she said, after seeing how Ms. Ardern handled the Christchurch attacks and the pandemic, unifying the country in times of life and death. “I just think Jacinda Ardern epitomizes everything a good leader should be,” Ms. Cole said.

"Trump supports a bigger relief bill, but a deal is far from certain.",2020-10-16,By Alan Rappeport,"['President Trump, struggling to gain traction among voters just weeks before the election, called on Thursday for a bigger stimulus package than he had previously offered, and the White House signaled it was willing to make concessions to Democrats. But the proposals were unlikely to win the necessary backing from Senate Republicans who are preparing a far smaller bill of their own. White House negotiators have proposed a $1.8 trillion relief package. Mr. Trump said that he wanted one that was even bigger and suggested, without explanation, that China would pay for it. “I would go higher,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with the Fox Business Network. “Go big or go home.” The comments came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House was willing to make additional concessions to Speaker Nancy Pelosi in hopes of rekindling a stimulus deal before the election. But the $1.8 trillion package that he has proposed has already proven to be a non-starter with Senate Republicans who have panned it as too costly, making Mr. Trump’s call for a more expensive bill another complication in the already fraught negotiations. In the interview on CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin did not directly address the lack of support for a bill by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, suggesting that he has been briefed on negotiations between the White House and House Democrats while acknowledging that Senate Republicans prefer a more “targeted” relief bill. But Mr. McConnell downplayed the prospects of a larger bill on Thursday. “He’s talking about a much larger amount than I can sell to my members,” Mr. McConnell said about the president’s comments.']",
Will we remember how hugging works when we are allowed to do it again?,2020-10-17,By A.C. Shilton,"['As the weeks of coronavirus quarantine stretched into months, hugs are among the many things isolated people found themselves aching for. Hugs are good for humans — perhaps more valuable than many of us realized, until we found ourselves missing them. Research has shown that hugs can lower our cortisol levels during stressful situations, and can raise oxytocin levels and maybe even lower our blood pressure. A 2015 paper published in Psychological Science even found that study subjects who got more hugs were less likely to get sick when exposed to a cold virus than those who weren’t hugged as often. So when hugging is deemed safe again, will we remember how navigate when you should and shouldn’t hug someone — and how not to hold on too long? The first rule of Hug Club: You don’t have to hug anyone you don’t want to, and it’s best to ask before going in for a squeeze — especially if it’s someone you don’t know well. Once you’ve established that your hugging partner wants a hug, you’ll probably pick up on cues as to how long it should last, like pats on the back. And don’t worry too much about hugging too tightly. The HuggieBot 1.0, a hugging robot, had three pressure settings: light, medium and extra squeeze. Alexis Block, the inventor of the squeeze machine, said that in her research, study participants most often rated the tightest hugs as their favorites.']",
"With Covid-19 under control, China’s economy surges ahead.",2020-10-19,By Keith Bradsher,"['As most of the world still struggles with the pandemic, China is showing once again that a fast economic rebound is possible when the virus is brought under control. The Chinese economy surged 4.9 percent in the July-to-September quarter compared with the same months last year, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday. That brings China almost back up to the roughly 6 percent pace of growth that it was reporting before the pandemic. Many of the world’s major economies have climbed quickly out of the depths of a contraction last spring, when shutdowns caused output to fall steeply. But China is the first to report growth that significantly surpasses where it was at this time last year. The vigorous expansion of the Chinese economy means that it is set to dominate global growth — accounting for at least 30 percent of the world’s economic growth this year and in the years to come, Justin Lin Yifu, a cabinet adviser and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said at a recent government news conference in Beijing. Chinese companies are making up a greater share of the world’s exports, manufacturing consumer electronics, personal protection equipment and other goods in high demand during the pandemic. At the same time, China is now buying more iron ore from Brazil, more corn and pork from the United States, and more palm oil from Malaysia. That has partly softened the impact of the pandemic on some industries.']",
Landslide in Vietnam Kills at Least 20 Military Personnel,2020-10-19,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['A landslide in Vietnam on Sunday killed at least 20 military personnel and left two missing, the local news media reported, following weeks of torrential rains and flooding that have devastated parts of the country and killed dozens of people. The mudslide began in the early hours of Sunday morning and leveled the soldiers’ barracks in Huong Phung Commune, in the central coastal province of Quang Tri. “There have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,” Ha Ngoc Duong, the vice chairman of the commune, told VnExpress, an online state-run news outlet. Mr. Duong added that the mudslides were likely to continue, hindering search-and-rescue efforts. The deaths could be the country’s largest military loss in peacetime, officials said, and came just days after another landslide killed 13 people, most of whom were also members of the military, in neighboring Thua Thien Hue. “We’ve never lost so many military members, including two generals and high-ranking officials, in natural disasters,” the government said in a statement. Pham Tan An, a survivor of the Sunday mudslide, told VnExpress he felt “completely powerless” after seeing his colleagues buried beneath the rubble. “For us who were lucky enough to survive, it’s really heartbreaking to know our 22 teammates didn’t make it. Now, when closing my eyes, all I can think of is us enjoying a meal together,” he told the news outlet. Rapid development and deforestation have exacerbated the damage caused by seasonal flooding. Floods in 2018 killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. “Vietnam has the perfect storm,” Adam Switzer, a sedimentologist at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said of Vietnam’s susceptibility to flooding and landslides. “It has seas, rainfall, it has very heavily vegetated steep slopes, and it has seismic activity.” Extreme downpours have pummeled Vietnam since early October, causing some of the worst flooding in years. More severe rain is expected this week. In Quang Tri Province alone, close to 50 people are dead or missing. More than 12,000 residents have been evacuated because of the floods, which have inundated nearly 45,000 homes, the state news media reported. Seventy schools have also been submerged beneath the floodwaters in areas along the Thach Han River in Quang Tri, according to the government newspaper VGP News. So far, the floods have cost Vietnam around $520,000, Vo Van Hung, the chairman of the Quang Tri People’s Committee, told the paper. “We need to understand why this happened,” said Mr. Switzer, the sedimentologist, who warned that effects of climate change could cause similarly devastating floods in the future, “so that when the next landslide happens, we are better prepared.” Chau Doan contributed reporting.']","Search-and-rescue efforts were underway after a landslide in the central province of Quang Tri, resulting in what may be the country’s greatest military loss in peacetime."
Evo Morales Is Out. His Socialist Project Lives On.,2020-10-19,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — In a presidential election that was widely viewed as a referendum on the legacy of Evo Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, voters appear to have spoken clearly: They want his socialist project to go on. On Monday, exit polls in Bolivia showed Mr. Morales’s handpicked candidate, Luis Arce, with such a wide lead that his main opponent, Carlos Mesa, conceded the election, and Mr. Arce’s supporters began celebrating in the streets — despite the fact that official results may not be available for days. “It is up to us, those who believe in democracy, those who said we would accept the result, favorable or not, to recognize that there is a victor in this election,” said Mr. Mesa. “We accept this result.” One pollster, Ciesmori, said around midnight on Sunday that Mr. Arce had 52.4 percent of votes, and that Mr. Mesa trailed with 31.5 percent. Outside Mr. Arce’s campaign headquarters, more than a hundred people gathered in celebration on Monday, chanting “the pollera will be respected!” — a reference to the traditional skirt that has become the symbol of his party’s Indigenous base.  Mr. Arce is the chosen successor of Mr. Morales, a transformative figure in a nation where power was traditionally concentrated in the hands of a wealthy, white elite. During his 14 years in office, Mr. Morales slashed poverty, built roads and schools, and nationalized the oil and gas industry. But he fled the country last year after his run for a fourth term ended in accusations that he had committed election fraud, deadly protests and a call by the military for him to step down. He called his ouster a coup. He sat out this year’s vote in neighboring Argentina. In the interim, the country has been run by a temporary president, a conservative named Jeanine Añez, who has persecuted the former president’s supporters, rolled back many of his policies and stifled dissent. Mr. Morales has remained a contentious figure in Bolivia, both adored for his role in aiding the poor and criticized for holding on to power for too long. On Election Day, voters frequently voiced frustration with Mr. Morales, but said that they still believed in his party, the Movimiento al Socialismo, or MAS, saying it was the only political movement that would stand by families who had lived on the margins for so many generations. Some said they feared that Mr. Mesa, despite his conciliatory tone and attempt to build a wide coalition, would follow in Ms. Añez’s steps. Mr. Mesa, a former journalist and historian, was president from 2003 to 2005, but resigned amid protests that included calls for the country to nationalize gas resources. He had taken the reins after serving as vice president to another leader, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, known as “Goni,” and some voters continue to associate Mr. Mesa with his predecessor’s policies of privatization. “We can’t go back to the time when we are suffering and others are winning,” said Luisa Alvarez, 40, a voter in the MAS stronghold of El Alto. In El Alto and the adjacent city of La Paz, the administrative capital, versions of “Mesa = Añez” and “Mesa = Goni” are frequent graffiti sightings. Speaking from his campaign office on Monday, Mr. Mesa said that based on the exit polls, he was admitting that his opponent had won and that his party would be “head of the democratic opposition for 2020-2025.” Mr. Arce’s party declined to claim victory, instead saying they were waiting for an official count. At MAS campaign headquarters, party spokeswoman Marianela Paco said they were waiting for the electoral body to announce results, because they didn’t want to “spoil the happiness” by calling the vote without a sanctioned tally. But she called the 20-point exit poll lead an “overwhelming” result, and said that party’s goal now was to “reconstruct the ruins” left behind by Ms. Añez. Mr. Arce has positioned himself as a transition candidate, vowing to carry on Mr. Morales’s legacy, while training younger leaders from his party to take the reins. “We are MAS 2.0,” he said in an interview shortly before the election. He added that Mr. Morales would have no role in his government. A former economics minister for Mr. Morales, Mr. Arce inherits a country that is deeply divided and facing an economic crisis. Wounds from last year’s protests are still raw. The coronavirus has battered the economy. And Mr. Arce will not have a key tool that helped Mr. Morales — a commodities boom that sent money flowing in. On Election Day, in the small city of Achocalla, Victor Apaza, 40, stood with his elderly mother on his arm. She wore a pink sweater and a traditional skirt. Both had just voted. Mr. Apaza, who lost his job in a metal factory amid the pandemic, said that he was voting for Mr. Arce because he believed the candidate was the only one who could rescue Bolivia from its social crisis —\xa0“we want a reconciliation,” he said — while also implementing just economic policies for men like him. The metal factory had just offered him his job back — at a reduced salary. But he also issued a warning. If Mr. Arce “doesn’t bring us solutions,” he said, “we’ll go to the street. There’s no other option.”']","Exit polls in Bolivia’s presidential election show a clear victory for Luis Arce, Evo Morales’s chosen successor, who vowed to carry on his vision.

"Suspect Stalked French School Before Beheading Teacher, Officials Say",2020-10-17,By Norimitsu Onishi and Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — The suspect in the beheading of a history teacher in a Paris suburb was an 18-year-old immigrant of Chechen descent who was angered by the classroom display of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, French officials said on Saturday. The suspect, identified by the authorities as Abdoulakh A., stalked the area outside the school on Friday afternoon before following the teacher, whom he stabbed and decapitated with a knife, Jean-François Ricard, the top antiterrorism prosecutor, said at a news conference. “The individual was in front of the college in the afternoon and asked students to indicate the future victim to him,’’ Mr. Ricard said, referring to the middle school where the teacher, Samuel Paty, had taught. The suspect was fatally shot by the police in a confrontation soon after the killing, which took place in Eragny, a suburb near the school. Investigators found a message planning the attack on the suspect’s cellphone, written a few hours before, Mr. Ricard said. Then, shortly before he was killed by the police, the suspect uploaded a photograph of the victim to Twitter, he added. The gruesome killing appeared to be the culmination of a couple of weeks of tension at the school, Collège du Bois-d’Aulne, in a quiet, middle-class suburb north of Paris. Muslim parents upset over the classroom display of two caricatures published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo had contacted school and police officials, but videos uploaded on social media by one father widened the dispute to an outside audience. Investigators were still trying to piece together how the suspect spent his days before the attack, Mr. Ricard said. But the suspect did not appear to have any direct ties to the school or to have been previously involved in the dispute. Born in Moscow, the suspect lived in France with the status of a refugee, Mr. Ricard said, adding that he was not known to antiterrorism officials. The brutal killing was the second violent episode within weeks to be linked to the caricatures published by Charlie Hebdo, which had led to deadly attacks in Paris in 2015. Last month, as the trial of accomplices in the 2015 attack got underway, the magazine republished the drawings — an act that was seen as a bold statement in the name of freedom of expression by some but as reckless and unnecessary provocation by others. Last month, a 25-year-old Pakistani immigrant attacked two people outside the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, apparently angered after watching videos showing protests in Pakistan against the republication of the cartoons. Beyond its brutality, Friday’s killing hit a far bigger nerve in France as President Emmanuel Macron and other top government officials rushed to the scene on Friday evening. Jean-Michel Blanquer, the minister of national education, said that in Friday’s killing, it was “the republic that was attacked.’’ France said a ceremony would be organized to pay national homage to the slain teacher. The minister’s words reflected the central role played by France’s public schools — hewing to a national curriculum established by the central government — in instilling civic values and a national identity. But they also underscored the recurring tensions between France’s traditional republican values and those of newer arrivals, especially those of Muslim faith who oppose the publication of the caricatures. The tensions at Collège du Bois-d’Aulne emerged early this month as the teacher — who was 47 and, according to parents and students, had taught at the school for only few years — broached the topic of freedom of expression. To illustrate the topic, the teacher showed his students — mostly 13-year-olds — two caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that had appeared in Charlie Hebdo, Mr. Ricard said. According to an email sent later to the parents by the school principal, the teacher asked students who might be offended by the material to look away or to temporarily leave the classroom. The teacher realized his clumsiness and apologized, according to the email, which was obtained by The New York Times. Cécile Ribet-Retel, the president of PEEP de Conflans, the local chapter of a national parents’ association, said her group heard from about 20 parents, who expressed their anger or their support for the teacher. Parents met with school officials and both sides appeared to be working toward an understanding, Ms. Ribet-Retel said. “But then the information got on social media, was amplified and distorted,’’ Ms. Ribet-Retel said. “And it became impossible to manage.’’ One particularly vocal parent — the father of a 13-year-old girl who was upset by the caricatures — met with the principal and demanded that the teacher be fired, Mr. Ricard said. The father uploaded critical and angry videos on social media on Oct. 7 and Oct. 12, identifying the teacher and the school, he said. Laurent Brosse, the mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, the Paris suburb where the school is, said local officials warned police intelligence that the situation appeared to be spiraling out of control because of the video. “We did what seemed important to us at that moment,’’ Mr. Brosse said, adding, “We know that this question about the freedom of expression stirs up tensions in society.’’ But despite these warnings, “there was no action,’’ Ms. Ribet-Retel said. The video was widely shared on social networks by individuals denouncing anti-Muslim racism and even official accounts of mosques and of Muslim organizations. “It was blown out of proportion in the Muslim community,’’ said Siham Touazi, a councilor in an adjoining municipality, who received messages linking to the video in several WhatsApp groups. The killing came just weeks after Mr. Macron unveiled a plan to combat what he described as the threat of “Islamist separatism” to France’s secularism. Mr. Macron focused in part on education, especially on beating back what he described as threats to the secular values taught in the nation’s schools and citing the example of Muslim parents who were opposed to letting their children take swimming lessons. “The situation has become so tense in our country over the issues of secularism and Islam that it’s become impossible to have a reasonable conversation,’’ said Gérard Pommier, the national president of PEEP, the parents’ association. The slain teacher — described by Ms. Ribet-Retel and many current and former students as a committed and serious instructor — appeared to try to navigate the tensions in his class on freedom of expression. While he showed two caricatures to his class, he suggested that those who might be offended — implicitly Muslim students — leave or look away. In France, where it is illegal to ask people their religion, the teacher’s proposal seemed to violate the country’s secularism, said Rodrigo Arenas, co-president of the F.C.P.E., another parents’ association. Aude Clabaut, a teacher at another school in the area, said that the slain teacher should not have asked students to leave the classroom. But she said that she was frustrated by the growing challenges to secularism in her own classroom, with some students refusing to remove their veils and Muslim parents contesting secularism courses. “I am sad and I am furious,” said Ms. Clabaut, who joined a group of people on Saturday in front of the school where the slain teacher worked. Hundreds of students and parents, as well as residents of the city, gathered to pay tribute to the teacher, at one point singing “La Marseillaise,” the national anthem. Some held signs that read “I am a teacher,” in direct reference to the “I am Charlie” support signs that popped up by the thousands hours after the 2015 attack on the magazine. Several students hugged each other, their eyes swollen with tears. But tensions were also present on Saturday afternoon, as some did not hesitate to directly point to Islamism. A man holding a sign — “ Political Islam is a cancer. We eliminate it or we die from it” — was briefly interrogated by the police and had his sign seized. Norimitsu Onishi reported from Paris, and Constant Méheut from Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. Antonella Francini contributed research from Paris.']","The suspect, a Russian immigrant, was angered by a classroom display of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and sought help identifying the teacher involved."
"Armenia and Azerbaijan Reach New Cease-Fire for Nagorno-Karabakh, Then Report Violations",2020-10-17,By Anton Troianovski,"['GORIS, Armenia — Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a new cease-fire in their conflict over a disputed territory, the countries said Saturday, days after a truce negotiated a week earlier had unraveled. The warring neighbors in the southern Caucasus region announced the agreement over the disputed territory, Nagorno-Karabakh, in terse statements issued by their foreign ministries late Saturday, describing it as a “humanitarian truce” to allow prisoners and the remains of the dead to be exchanged. The new cease-fire took effect at midnight, but, as with a Russian-brokered cease-fire reached a week earlier, the fighting has continued, with each side accusing the other on Sunday of violating the truce. France said it mediated the latest cease-fire in the days and hours leading up to Saturday’s announcement, in coordination with Russia and the United States. “This cease-fire must be unconditional and strictly observed by both parties,” the office of President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a statement. “France will be very attentive to this and will remain committed so that hostilities cease on a lasting basis and that credible discussions can quickly begin.” Any halt in the conflict would be welcome for people in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, in the volatile southern Caucasus region between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. The war has already killed more than 600 Armenian soldiers, scores of civilians and an unknown number of Azerbaijanis. It has threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict, with the potential to further draw in Turkey, Azerbaijan’s main ally; Russia, which has a mutual defense agreement with Armenia; and even the region’s southern neighbor, Iran. Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnically Armenian enclave that is part of Azerbaijan under international law but is closely aligned with Armenia. A previous war over Nagorno-Karabakh, in the early 1990s, killed some 20,000 people and displaced about a million, most of them Azerbaijanis. Years of tensions since then between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave’s status erupted into open warfare on Sept. 27, with Azerbaijan seeking to take control of the territory by force. On Saturday, Azerbaijan said 14 people were killed in the city of Ganja, the country’s second-largest, in an overnight missile attack by Armenia. The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, had also been attacked overnight Friday, the din of air raid sirens and explosions echoing through the largely empty city into early Saturday morning. Along the front, Azerbaijan and Armenia have engaged in trench warfare and artillery combat, taking heavy casualties while fighting for small bits of territory.']",A truce brokered just a week earlier failed to hold. The war between the two Caucasus countries has already killed hundreds.
"As Britain Edges Toward Lockdowns, Long-Held Grievances Flare Up",2020-10-19,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain’s desperate attempt to curb a second wave of the coronavirus has exposed multiple fractures in its politics and society, but perhaps none as jagged as that between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the mayor of Greater Manchester, the country’s second-largest urban area. For days, the mayor, Andy Burnham, has been engaged in a war of words with Mr. Johnson and his ministers over the government’s plan to elevate hard-hit Manchester to the highest level of restrictions. That would shut down pubs, bars and gyms and forbid all socializing by people from different households. Mr. Burnham says that the restrictions would devastate the city’s economy, and that the central government has not offered adequate financial aid to the people who would lose their jobs during the lockdown. He has been a nearly ubiquitous presence on television, waging a fierce rebellion on behalf of his 2.8 million constituents. “People can’t just be pressurized into it,” Mr. Burnham said of the new restrictions, to Sky News on Monday. “I’m not going to be pressurized into it. And I’m not just going to kind of roll over at the sight of a check.” Mr. Burnham’s resistance is rooted in the long-held grievances of people in the old industrial cities of the north of England toward the politically dominant government sitting in London. While it has delegated some powers to regional authorities in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Westminster government retains highly centralized control over England and its major urban centers. But the standoff between Manchester and London also reflects mounting frustration with Mr. Johnson’s erratic, often opaque handling of the pandemic, as well as a dash of ambition and old-fashioned political maneuvering. Mr. Burnham, a 50-year-old native of Liverpool, is a Labour Party stalwart who twice ran unsuccessfully for party leader. Having served as health secretary under Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he traded in his seat in the opposition in 2016 to run for mayor of Greater Manchester, a newly created post. He is responsible for a far-flung metropolitan region, though he has less power than big-city mayors in the United States. “With his limited powers, Andy Burnham is taking advantage of his legitimacy,” said Tony Travers, an expert in urban affairs at the London School of Economics. “He has clearly sensed that the central government is weak.” Mr. Burnham’s clash with London carries echoes of the ill will between President Trump and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. As with them, much of the dispute comes down to complaints over a lack of financial support. But Mr. de Blasio has considerably more power than Mr. Burnham, who has little control over budgetary matters and must obtain the consent of council leaders for many decisions. What Mr. Burnham does have is an antenna for national politics — and for the fact that Mr. Johnson won a landslide victory in the election last year by promising to close the economic gap between England’s more prosperous south and the struggling regions of the Midlands and the north. That message lured many traditional Labour voters to the Conservative Party, shattering Labour’s vaunted “red wall.” Mr. Johnson, analysts said, could easily alienate those voters if he foists an economically ruinous lockdown on them. “There is a sense,” Mr. Travers said, “that people in Greater Manchester are having things done to them by a distant government.” Mr. Burnham has complained of being cut out of the deliberations over when to impose the heightened restrictions, saying he often learns of decisions from press reports attributed to unnamed Downing Street officials. And he says the government does not share the epidemiological data that is driving its decisions, which makes it impossible to judge whether a lockdown is necessary in one place but not another. There is no debate that Manchester was hit hard by the resurgence of the virus at the end of the summer, in part because of its large student population. Its current rate of infection is 432 cases per 100,000 people, well above the national average. But its rate of cases has declined from a peak of 583 per 100,000 in the seven days before Oct. 3. Government officials said that infections were continuing to rise there among vulnerable older people, and that based on current projections, intensive care units at hospitals in Greater Manchester would reach capacity by Nov. 8. The supply of hospital beds, officials said, is a more relevant barometer than cases. Mr. Johnson’s aides are frustrated by Mr. Burnham’s resistance, which some view as cynical posturing. On Sunday, Michael Gove, a senior cabinet minister who holds the title of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, urged the mayor and his allies to “put aside for a moment some of the political positioning they’ve indulged in.” But while the government has the power to impose health requirements on any city in England, Mr. Johnson has been reluctant to do it over the objections of the mayors. Public adherence to the rules depends in no small part on how faithfully the local authorities enforce them. As the talks between Manchester and London dragged on Monday, the government began separate negotiations with officials in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire about elevating those regions to so-called Tier 3 status. Wales, which controls its own health policy under the terms of the United Kingdom’s limited self-government, plans to impose a temporary lockdown on the entire region. All told, Britain reported 18,804 new cases on Monday, and 80 deaths. Before elevating Liverpool to the highest-risk category, Mr. Johnson struck an agreement with Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city region. The prime minister hailed that deal as an example of bipartisan cooperation, and clearly hoped it would be a template for other cities. Mr. Burnham, however, is demanding that the government pay 80 percent of the wages of people who lose their jobs because of the lockdown — the same compensation it offered in the national wage subsidy program that it is winding down this month. So far, the government has offered to offset two-thirds of lost wages. Mr. Burnham has called on Mr. Johnson and the Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, to hold a vote in Parliament on the financial aid that the government should offer cities placed under the highest level of lockdown. But Mr. Johnson, who has kept control over the pandemic response tightly in Downing Street, rejected that. “Establishing clear national entitlements of the kind we had during the first lockdown,” Mr. Burnham said, “will create a sense of fairness, which in turn would help build public support for, and compliance with, any new restrictions.”']",Residents of Manchester and other northern English cities have never much cared for the heavy hand of Westminster. They are not liking it any better in the pandemic.
Bill Offering L.G.B.T. Protections in Italy Spurs Rallies on Both Sides,2020-10-17,By Emma Bubola,"['ROME — Protesters turned out in force on Saturday for rival demonstrations on a bill that would make anti-L.G.B.T. violence a hate crime carrying harsher penalties than under current law, coming out by the hundreds in Rome despite a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the country. Demonstrations were planned throughout the country ahead of a parliamentary vote planned for this coming week, with supporters framing the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights and protection from attack, and opponents depicting it as an overreaching step that would also suppress opinion and religious beliefs. “We have been through centuries of discrimination,” said Marlon Landolfo, 21, who recounted a vicious homophobic attack on him and another man in northern Italy last month. “Now it’s 2020 and we are still discussing a law that protects us for what we are.” The bill under debate would explicitly recognize anti-L.G.B.T. and anti-women hate crimes and hate speech by including those offenses under an existing law that makes discrimination, violence or incitement to violence based on someone’s race or religion a crime punishable by up to four years in prison. Current law does not have a specific designation for such offenses against L.G.B.T. people, and as a result, homophobic or transphobic assaults are tried on lesser charges than racially motivated or anti-Semitic ones. The bill, which appears to have the support of a parliamentary majority, makes discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity an aggravating circumstance, which could mean added time to sentences. Decades of efforts and multiple attempts to extend protections to L.G.B.T people have failed in Italy, making the country an outlier among Western European democracies such as Britain, France and Spain. Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016 but does not allow same-sex marriage. Within the European Union, it is joined by Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria in not responding to European Parliament appeals for member states to prosecute hate crimes and hate speech motivated by homophobia and transphobia. Supporters of the bill face resistance from traditional opponents such as conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church, but also from some less expected corners, such as one group of feminists. Proponents say a change would allow the authorities to keep statistics on homophobic and transphobic attacks, provide a deterrent and send a clear message that these are hate crimes. Mr. Landolfo, his ankle still sore after a beating last month in the city of Padua, said he felt disheartened by the debate around the new bill. He and another young man, Mattias Fascina, had held hands and exchanged a quick kiss during a date on a September night when a gang mocked them, then punched and kicked them while shouting homophobic slurs. Under Italian law, the pair cannot be considered victims of a hate crime. The attack on Mr. Landolfo is not an isolated case. Arcigay, Italy’s leading L.G.B.T. association, records more than 100 episodes of violence, hate and discrimination every year. In September, in the northern city of Novara, a man kicked his lesbian neighbor and broke her nose. In the city of Bergamo, residents of an apartment complex insulted and threatened two homosexual neighbors, prompting them to temporarily move out of their apartment. “These episodes rarely turn into official complaints,” said Francesca Rupalti, a lawyer with Rete Lenford, a network of lawyers for L.G.B.T. rights. “Without a specific law, it is hard to prove homophobic acts.” Alessandro Zan, a member of Parliament with the center-left Democratic Party who proposed the bill, said its ratification would denote a significant cultural shift in a society with deep patriarchal and conservative roots. “These people are particularly exposed to hate crimes,” he said. “This is why we particularly need to protect them.” Unlike the United States, where speech is largely protected by the First Amendment, Italy and many other European countries scarred by fascism and Nazism have stricter laws against preaching racial or ethnic superiority. They have also outlawed blatantly discriminatory associations or groups. “Laws need to balance freedom of expression and hatred,” Mr. Zan said. “This law says clearly that discriminating against L.G.B.T. people and inciting violence against them is not an opinion.” Some opponents of the bill say it will cross the line into censorship. They have presented hundreds of amendments — including one that mockingly asked to extend protection to bald or white-haired people — in order to slow down the legislative process. One objection is that the bill, which opponents have dubbed a “gag law,” could be used to suppress dissenting opinions about same-sex marriage or adoption by homosexual couples. A prominent opponent, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, said the bill “puts ideas on trial” and has insisted that Italy does not discriminate anyway. Supporters say the bill would not infringe on free speech or religious liberty. Groups or individuals, they say, will still be able to promote and discuss their values as long as they do not engage in violent behavior or incite violence and hatred. The nationalist and conservative political opposition has been joined by Italy’s Catholic bishops. That has unnerved advocates for the bill who had been encouraged by tolerant remarks from Pope Francis. The pope told a gay man in 2018 that God had made him that way, and in 2013 famously said “Who am I to judge?” when asked about a priest said to be gay — a dramatic change of tone in Vatican comments on homosexuality. But the Italian bishops conference, which is influential in domestic politics, has argued that the measure could criminalize expression of the church’s belief that marriage should be between a woman and a man, if it were interpreted as incitement to discrimination. The bishops said in a statement that Italian law already has tools available to punish violent and discriminatory behavior, and that adding more “incriminatory norms” would threaten liberty. Some opponents from the left have also joined the fight against the proposed law. Although many leading feminist groups in the Western world have expressed support for L.G.B.T. protections, a group of well-known Italian feminists has criticized the pending bill for embracing a broader definition of women by using the term “gender identity,” which would include transgender women. In an open letter published on a notable feminist website, the 13 signatories argued that the progress made against sexual discrimination against women in Italy would be undercut if the broader concept of gender identity is applied. Francesca Izzo, a former member of Parliament with the Democratic Party who signed the letter, said that while it was important to fight homophobia and transphobia, it was a separate issue from the overall rights of women. Proponents of the law reject that argument. Mr. Zan, the lawmaker, said that feminists and L.G.B.T. people were fighting the same battle. “Violence against L.G.B.T. people is just another consequence of sexism,” he said. “Anatomy is not a person’s destiny.”']",Supporters frame the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights. Opponents depict it as an overreaching step that would suppress opinion.
"New York shuts down a wedding amid fears it would draw 10,000 people.",2020-10-18,By Matthew Haag,"['A wedding with up 10,000 guests? In Brooklyn, near a coronavirus hot spot? No, New York state officials said. The officials have taken extraordinary steps to shut down the ultra-Orthodox wedding planned for Monday, with the state health commissioner personally intervening to have sheriff’s deputies deliver an order to the Hasidic synagogue where it would take place. The order, delivered on Friday, warned that the synagogue must follow health protocols, including limiting gatherings to fewer than 50 people. On Sunday, the synagogue, the Congregation Yetev Lev D’Satmar, accused state officials of “unwarranted attacks” on the wedding, at which a grandson of Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, the synagogue’s rabbi, is to be married. The congregation said that the ceremony and meal would have been restricted to “close family members,” and that members of the public would have been invited to participate only “for a short period of time.” The wedding will continue, the synagogue said, but will be limited to a smaller group of family members. “It’s sad that nobody verified our plans before attacking us,” Chaim Jacobowitz, the congregation’s secretary, said in a statement. The episode highlighted the brewing tensions between state and local officials the Hasidic community as state health officials try to control surging coronavirus cases in some neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens and in counties north of New York City. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said Sunday that a large wedding was too risky and could have resulted in a so-called superspreader event. State officials said that they determined the wedding, scheduled to take place in Williamsburg, could have had up to 10,000 people in attendance. “My suggestion: Have a small wedding this year,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference on Sunday. “Next year, have a big wedding. Invite me, and I’ll come.”']",
Migrant farmworkers under lockdown say restrictions severely limit their freedom.,2020-10-19,By Miriam Jordan,"['Each spring, a thousand or more Mexican tomato pickers descend on the Eastern Shore of Virginia to toil in the fields of Lipman Family Farms, enduring long hours stooped over to pluck the plump fruit. An adept worker will fill a 32-pound bucket every two and a half minutes, earning 65 cents for each one. This year, there is a new and even more difficult working condition: To keep the coronavirus from spreading and jeopardizing the harvest, Lipman has put its crews on lockdown. With few exceptions, they have been ordered to remain either in camps where they are housed, or the fields, where they toil. The restrictions have allowed Lipman’s tomato operation to run smoothly, with only a handful of coronavirus cases, at a time when many farms and food processing facilities across the country have wrestled to contain outbreaks. But they have caused some workers to complain that their work site has become like a prison. Gone are the weekly outings to Walmart to stock up on provisions; to El Ranchito, the Mexican convenience store, to buy shell-shaped concha pastries; and to the laundromat to wash heavily soiled garments. “You put up with a lot already. I never expected to lose my freedom,” said Martinez, 39, who is in his third year working in the tomato fields along the East Coast. (Many workers interviewed for this article asked to use only a first or last name for fear of losing their jobs.) He said workers spent months on end without interacting with anyone at all outside the farms, though Lipman eventually relented and organized a carefully controlled trip for groceries each week. Lipman’s battle with its workers underscores one of the signature conundrums of the pandemic. Locking down its employees — a drastic measure that would be intolerable to most American workers — appears to have kept both the employees and the community safe. But at what cost? The large tomato enterprise has been able to impose the restrictions on its workers because they are beholden to the company for their visa, housing and wages. Lipman would not disclose total coronavirus case numbers, but employees said they knew of no cases at the Virginia operation following about six infections that occurred before most of the seasonal workers arrived. Kent Shoemaker, Lipman’s chief executive, said the company was proud of its record protecting both its employees and the surrounding communities. “As of today, we do not have any confirmed Covid-19 cases on our farms or in our packing facilities,” Mr. Shoemaker said in mid-October.']",
"Romans Want to Get Rid of Wild Boars, but Killing Them? That’s Another Matter",2020-10-19,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['Wild boars are a menace in Rome, strewing garbage around the city, blocking traffic and causing numerous car accidents. Residents have been demanding action — but not this. Animal rights activists and many Romans are expressing outrage after the authorities killed a sow and her six piglets on a playground near the Vatican, only hours after families and children had been there, feeding the boars. They say the animals should have been safely captured and transported to the wild. “It was a mother with her little ones — just emotionally, this is terrible,” said Andrea Brutti, who is the chief official for wild fauna at Italy’s National Board for Animal Protection. Some people have a fondness for the animals, but wild boars are far from harmless. They can be aggressive and dangerous, and are a growing presence in Rome, drawn by the uncollected trash that plagues the city. From the city’s central streets to the outlying arteries that border parks and woods, boars have become a major driving hazard. The threat is not limited to Rome — earlier this month, two former professional soccer players died when their car hit some wild boars crossing a highway in northern Italy. Boars are a point of contention throughout the country. Hunters have argued that the perpetually hungry animals are nuisances that have bred out of control and need to be culled to save the country’s agriculture. Activists argue that hunters have worked to increase the number of wild boars, to enable more hunting. The fight has extended into politics, with representatives of the right-wing League party often siding with hunters. But pretty much everyone agrees they have no place in the cities. Images of wild boars tearing into the garbage bags piled high around the city have become common in recent years. Last month, a family of them was filmed peacefully walking through the streets near St. Peter’s Square. Rome’s boar troubles mirror the dilemmas faced by developed areas around the world, as they try to keep in check populations of deer, geese, bears, coyotes, sea gulls or other creatures without running afoul of animal lovers. In many places, humans have eliminated the animals’ natural predators or competitors, while inadvertently providing a food surplus for those that remain. The city, the region, residents and animal rights advocates have argued for years over what to do about Rome’s boar problem, without finding a solution. The advocates say parks on the outskirts of the city should be fenced to contain the animals, and that roads should be equipped with alarm systems, but no one wants to pay the bill. The porcine family at the center of the latest uproar had roamed the streets near the Vatican for days, troubling some residents and delighting others. They ended up in the playground — some say the police entrapped them — last Thursday, and children started feeding them anything handy. Then, late Friday night, the police made their move. While neighbors shouted “cowards” and expletives from their windows, officers shot the boars with tranquilizer darts, and then veterinarians gave them lethal injections. Videos and photos of the scene spread across Rome. A member of Parliament and founder of an association for animal rights accused the city of the killing. “It was a gratuitous barbarity,” Michela Vittoria Brambilla said in a video posted on social media. “Residents were standing around the park watching the massacre.” Rome’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, ordered an investigation. A city official who was involved, Daniele Diaco, said he was receiving death threats as a result of the incident. The city, run by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, and the government of the Lazio region, run by the Democratic Party, have blamed each other. City officials said that in this and other, similar cases, the city alerts Lazio to the problem, but does not decide what action to take.  But regional officials, who had trouble finding the cages needed to trap and transport the boars, said they made the decision to euthanize the animals in consultation with the city officials. Later that day, a national animal welfare group offered its services, saying it could capture the boars and move them to a nature preserve. The Lazio regional council member responsible for the environment says she agreed and called off the killing, asking a city official to pass the word to the police. The message never reached the officers at the playground. The boars were killed and loaded onto a truck for disposal. “In the end, animals like people are victims of bad politics,” Mr. Brutti said.']","The euthanizing of a boar and her six piglets on a playground near the Vatican has aroused fury in Rome, a city that has long complained about the often aggressive animals."
Pakistan Rescinds TikTok Ban,2020-10-19,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Just 10 days after introducing a ban on TikTok, the Pakistani authorities said on Monday that they were reversing the decision after receiving assurance from the Chinese-owned social media platform that it would moderate content according to local laws. “TikTok is being unlocked after assurance from management that they will block all accounts repeatedly involved in spreading obscenity and immorality,” the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, the national regulator, said in a statement. Pakistan banned the app on Oct. 9 after officials said they had received a slew of complaints about indecent content. The app was functioning again on Monday. TikTok, with its lip-syncing teenagers and meme-heavy videos, has faced problems in several countries for varying reasons. The Trump administration has attempted to block the app over privacy fears, India has prohibited the service as part of rising tensions between New Delhi and Beijing, and public decency concerns have led to occasional bans in places like Bangladesh and Indonesia. TikTok has 20 million users in Pakistan, but conservatives in the country say that the app has been overtaken by vulgar song-and-dance numbers and memes. Officials said that a big reason behind the ban was the sexualization of underage girls and that TikTok was given several warnings to regulate its content before the ban was imposed. But others said the Pakistani authorities’ move to lock the app was also intended to limit criticism of the government, which is struggling with a sagging economy and facing growing opposition. In recent months, the app has had a substantial increase in content that caricatured or mocked the policies of the governing party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Officials have denied any political undertones to the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, said in a statement on Monday that it welcomed the decision: “At TikTok, we’re committed to enforcing our community guidelines and complying with local laws in all markets in which we operate, as these are pillars of our work to promote a safe and positive community online.” The decision to allow TikTok to resume operations in Pakistan was widely welcomed by the app’s users, too, and finance analysts said it would increase investor confidence. “The expedited reversal of the ban also goes to show that ByteDance is very much invested in the Pakistan market,” said Saif Ali, a marketing executive.']",A decision outlawing the social media app was overturned after 10 days with assurances from the Chinese owners that content would be moderated according to local laws.
"2,000-Year-Old Cat Etching Found at Nazca Lines Site in Peru",2020-10-19,By Tiffany May,"['The image, stretching for 40 yards on a hillside in Peru, shows a creature with pointy ears, orb-like eyes and a long striped tail. It appears to be a cat lounging, as cats often do. Archaeologists stumbled across the faded etching while remodeling a section of a UNESCO heritage site known as the Nazca Lines, Peru’s Ministry of Culture announced last week. The catlike geoglyph — which experts say dates to 200 B.C. to 100 B.C. — is the latest discovery among the carvings of larger-than-life animals and plants previously found between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, in a desert plain about 250 miles southeast of the capital, Lima. “The discovery shows, once again, the rich and varied cultural legacy of this site,” the ministry said in a statement. The Nazca Lines were first discovered by a Peruvian aerial surveyor in 1927. Images of a hummingbird, a monkey and an orca were unearthed at the site. UNESCO has designated the Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa a World Heritage Site since 1994. The cat etching is believed to be older than any of the prehistoric geoglyphs previously unearthed at Nazca. “It’s quite striking that we’re still finding new figures, but we also know that there are more to be found,” Johny Isla, Peru’s chief archaeologist for the Nazca Lines, told Efe, a Spanish news agency. The designs were believed to have been created when ancient Peruvians scraped off a dark and rocky layer of earth, which contrasts with lighter-colored sand underneath. Researchers believe that the figures once served as travel markers. Drone photography has led to several discoveries in recent years, Mr. Isla said. In 2019, researchers from Japan, aided by satellite photography and three-dimensional imaging, unearthed more than 140 new geoglyphs at the site. Research and conservation work had continued at the site even during the coronavirus pandemic, when most tourist sites have been closed. Archaeologists and employees were working on the Mirador Natural, a lookout point in the protected site, when they began unearthing something intriguing. When they cleaned the mound, clear lines showing the sinuous body of a cat emerged. “The figure was barely visible and was about to disappear because it is situated on quite a steep slope that’s prone to the effects of natural erosion,” the culture ministry said in a statement. The authorities said that even a stray footprint could mar the fragile grounds, and have imposed strict rules against trespassing at the site. Before the pandemic shut down tours, visitors were permitted to view the lines and figures only from planes and lookout points. But disturbances at the Nazca lines have occurred, drawing widespread condemnation. In 2014, Greenpeace activists left shoe marks near a large hummingbird design when they placed a sign that promoted renewable energy, Peruvian officials said. “You walk there and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years,” Luis Jaime Castillo, a Peruvian official and archaeologist, told The Guardian at the time. “And the line that they have destroyed is the most visible and most recognized of all.” In 2018, a truck driver was arrested after intentionally driving his tractor-trailer across three lines of geoglyphs. Even as Peru works to preserve its ancient sites, officials reopened Machu Picchu this month for one lucky tourist after he became stranded during the pandemic and waited seven months to see the 16th-century Inca citadel.']",Archaeologists came across the faded feline outline while conducting maintenance work at the UNESCO heritage site.
"A Storied Female Warlord Surrenders, Taliban Say, Exposing Afghan Weakness",2020-10-18,"By Mujib Mashal, Najim Rahim and Fatima Faizi","['KABUL, Afghanistan — In a long conflict waged by men, she’s been a rare female warlord, defending her fief in northern Afghanistan against the Taliban, her own relatives and even against the American-backed central government she allied with. As she grew into her 70s, ailing and bedridden with bad knees, the warlord, Bibi Ayesha, took pride in having an undefeated record in decades of war. She is popularly known by a nom de guerre: Commander Kaftar, which means “pigeon” in Farsi, “because she moved and killed with the elegance of a bird,” as one profile put it. On Thursday, the Taliban declared the end of her high-flying days: Commander Kaftar, along with her men, had surrendered to them, they said in a statement. “The officials of our Invite and Guidance Commission welcomed them,” the statement said. Local officials in restive Baghlan Province, where she is based, and her relatives confirmed the commander’s surrender and said it was an act of survival. Her valley was so surrounded, with other neighboring militias already switching sides to the Taliban, that she had no choice. Mohammad Hanif Kohgadai, a member of Baghlan provincial council representing Commander Kaftar’s district, said she had reached a deal through a Taliban commander related to her family. “The Taliban spent the night at Commander Kaftar’s house, they ate there,” Mr. Kohgadai said in an interview on Friday. “Today, they left the house and took with them 13 weapons and other military gear.” One of Commander Kaftar’s sons played down the episode, saying it was more a truce than a surrender. “It is just a rumor. My mother is sick,” said Raz Mohammad, one of her three remaining sons. (Three others were killed in years of fighting.) “She hasn’t joined the Taliban. We don’t fight the Taliban anymore; we have weapons to protect ourselves from our enemies.” Commander Kaftar’s surrender brings little to the Taliban militarily but is another propaganda victory against the struggling Afghan government, suggesting that in a bloody, stalemated war some were switching sides to the insurgents. The Taliban have increasingly reached out to those disenchanted with the Afghan government as the country’s military struggles amid the continuing American withdrawal. For a group that kept women confined to their homes when they were in power in the 1990s, a Taliban alliance with a female commander could prove tricky. The Taliban have yet to provide any detailed positions in ongoing peace talks on the role of women in a future government. But what makes Commander Kaftar’s shift easier is that she commands hundreds of men in a deeply conservative and misogynistic society. The surrender exposes a larger vulnerability of the Afghan government: Its defenses are partly reliant on thousands of unreliable militias with track records of abuse and local feuding, and a history of switching sides. President Ashraf Ghani has sent mixed signals about the militias over the years. When Mr. Ghani came to office in late 2014, he tried aggressively to dismantle the militias. Encountering the president’s wrath, militia commanders simply refused to fight the Taliban, opening the way for the insurgents to march on Kunduz City. In recent years, as the Afghan Army and the police have been stretched thin against Taliban offensives, Mr. Ghani has accepted the militias as a reality. Over the summer, the Afghan president spoke publicly about “investing more” in some militias as a line of defense. Commander Kaftar’s experience speaks to the complicated reality upon which the American-bankrolled democracy has been built — on the legacy of a previous invasion and years of anarchy and warlord rule. Her reputation began to grow with the killing of Soviet commandos who had swarmed her valley during an invasion starting in 1979. She hasn’t put down arms since, raising a militia that protected her valley as her little kingdom. Even when the Taliban swept through most of Afghanistan in the 1990s, she fended them off. She has often recounted how she taunted the Taliban commander for her province with a lose-lose offer: If she arrested him, she would parade him around town on a donkey and people would laugh at him for being defeated by a woman. And if he arrested her? The town would scold the Taliban commander for arresting a woman. After the U.S. invasion in 2001, the new Afghan government moved to disarm militias like hers. She and many other militia commanders resisted. Asked about the government wanting to disarm her, she said, “If they come, you will see what I will do to the government.” Even in Kabul she was celebrated as an anti-Taliban hero and inspiration for women, with the country’s former human rights chief attending a celebration of her hosted by Afghanistan’s vice president. “This war won’t end in peace — only God, or this beautiful Kalashinkov can solve it,” she once said in an interview, the weapon on her lap. “The Taliban are not capable of change or reform.” But even as media reports list 20 of her family members lost in the war with the Taliban, much of her fight in recent years has involved spiraling family feuds. Some of those disputes, including a fight with one of her sisters, have dragged on over two decades with many dead on each side. In another prolonged feud, she chased a relative out of the valley after deaths on both sides, only for the man to return years later as a commander of the Taliban that she has now surrendered to. The news of Commander Kaftar’s fate raised questions of whether it was the result of a truce between two families, or as it was publicly portrayed: the surrender of a militia commander to a Taliban leader. In large parts of Afghanistan, with the lines of war increasingly blurred, the two are the same. “Commander Pigeon was an old decrepit warlord, a broken-down woman,” the writer Jennifer Percy wrote in a 2014 profile in The New Republic. “Lonely, she survived on attention, on her ability to inspire fear through the power of her own myth. In Afghanistan, the ability to create a mythology is powerful, maybe even more powerful than military prowess.”']","She was undefeated in decades of war, but her decision was an act of survival. A government that has come to depend on unreliable militias finds itself vulnerable."
‘We Have to Speak Out’: Thai Students Defy Protest Ban,2020-10-18,By Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — Thai authorities shut down parts of Bangkok’s commercial center and crippled public rail networks over the weekend in an effort to prevent young demonstrators from continuing their antigovernment protests. It didn’t work.  Tens of thousands of members of the pro-democracy movement, which has been galvanized by a political awakening among social media savvy students, gathered in Thailand’s capital and in about 20 provinces on Saturday and Sunday to call for fresh elections, a new Constitution and reforms to the monarchy’s lofty position in Thai society. “I wasn’t always politically active,” said Perakarn Tangsamritkul, 23, who participated in one of several rallies in Bangkok on Saturday. “You should have met me three months ago. Now I understand why we have to be here. We have to speak out.” Over the past few days, Thailand’s military-linked government, led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, a retired general who orchestrated an army coup in 2014, has intensified efforts to snuff out the monthslong protests. But the calls for change appear to have gotten only stronger, making once-taboo political sentiments suddenly commonplace. And in a country divided for decades between hostile factions — broadly, an urban elite and a rural base that has long felt ignored as Thailand’s wealth gap has grown — the current pro-democracy movement has transcended the traditional political rifts. A 30-year-old civil servant who attended a rally at Victory Monument in Bangkok on Sunday said that he was gratified that the young generation had the courage to come out. He declined to provide his name given his government job, but said that he and the student protesters were united in the belief that the country had to change. For years, Thais would elect populist leaders, only to see them removed by military coups or judicial maneuvers that were approved by the palace. The country’s political old guard argued that the elected prime ministers were corrupt and adept at milking the system, charming the masses with promises of cheap health care and crop subsidies. According to the country’s entrenched political elite, some of those elected leaders also challenged the authority of the constitutional monarch by positioning themselves as rivals in popularity to the king. Protecting the monarchy was a prime justification for the 2014 coup, after which democracy withered. Mr. Prayuth refused to hold elections for another five years. A military-drafted Constitution decreed that the Senate would be entirely appointed. Outspoken critics of the military and the monarchy have been jailed, killed or gone missing. Even when elections were held last year, international observers deemed them less than fair. An upstart party that promised to move the country beyond the old politics won a surprisingly large number of votes — and was later ordered to dissolve in what was seen by human-rights groups as a politically motivated ban. Mr. Prayuth remains the country’s prime minister and defense minister. The state of affairs in Thailand has recently compelled some members of the establishment to speak up. On Saturday, hundreds of doctors, some from hospitals known to be managed by royalists, signed a letter against the water cannons used to forcibly disperse protesters the day before. The water was laced with a chemical irritant, and the sight of students fleeing riot police shocked many Thais. Hours later, Dr. Jarosdao Rimphanitchayakit, a surgeon, was fired for having her name among the 386 doctors. “Mongkutwattana Hospital has a clear policy of not accepting those who are part of the enemy movement,” said Maj. Gen. Rienthong Nanna, the hospital director. The Thai authorities have built a formidable legal structure to try to criminalize the movement. On Thursday, the government issued an emergency decree in which public gatherings of more than four people were banned in the Thai capital, an order that has been totally ignored. With their emergency powers, the police can also declare any place in Bangkok off-limits to protesters. Each day, the authorities detain more protest leaders, a whack-a-mole approach that has spurred new organizers to come forward. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said that more than 80 protesters have been arrested over the past five days. On Sunday, the police warned that posting a selfie from the protests on social media could lead to two years in prison. So could checking in online from a protest site. “It is like you are taking your own evidence of disobeying the emergency decree,” said Maj. Gen. Yingyos Thepjumnong, a spokesman for the Royal Thai Police. But Thailand’s political rebellion will be posted on Instagram and Facebook.  Protesters have formed online alliances with pro-democracy forces in places like Hong Kong. Activists from as far away as Nigeria and Belarus have sent millions of well-wishes online. One Thai K-pop fan club raised about $25,000 for supplies through online donations. Over the weekend, the largely leaderless crowds in Bangkok took inspiration from their counterparts in Hong Kong, where protesters spent months honing their tactics for peacefully confronting a police force armed with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets: umbrellas, goggles and invocations to “be like water.” They also followed the strategy of waiting until the last minute to announce protest sites, to try to outwit the riot police. Amid an occasional drizzle over the weekend, the Thai protesters formed orderly lines to pass down helmets and raincoats to those closer to the front lines. With the telecommunications signal weakening, they took to yelling news and instructions down the protest columns instead. On Sunday, a government spokesman said that while Mr. Prayuth was committed to listening to problems from all sides, he was also alert to any protesters who might incite violence. Thailand has suffered numerous violent crackdowns on protesters in the past, most recently in 2010 when dozens were killed in Bangkok as demonstrators were forcibly cleared from the streets. Parliament has been warned to stand by for a special session on Monday. The legislature was otherwise not scheduled to meet until November. Far more incendiary than calling for Mr. Prayuth’s exit are the protesters’ demands that the king, one of the world’s richest monarchs, must hew to the Constitution rather than floating above it as a semidivine being. Thailand abolished absolute monarchy in 1932, but the crown retains an exalted status and is protected by strict laws criminalizing any disparagement. On Friday, two protesters were charged with committing “an act of violence against the queen’s liberty” after they had yelled in surprise at a passing royal motorcade in Bangkok two days earlier. If convicted, they could serve life in prison. King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, his queen and the heir apparent live mostly in Germany, even as the king has expanded his control over the crown’s finances and military units. The protesters have stressed that they are not looking to topple the king; they chanted “reform the monarchy” by the thousands on Sunday. The day before, protesters took turns posing in front of a spray-painted sign on a road that showed the Thai flag superimposed with the words “Republic of Thailand.” The country is officially a kingdom. At first, the demonstrators, despite their identities being obscured by face masks or helmets, posed quickly for selfies before darting away nervously. But soon they lingered, raising their arms in the three-fingered salute that has become a hallmark of the protests. One young man stomped on the word “king” written near the flag. Members of the crowd gasped. Then they started to clap.']","Armed with umbrellas, social media and global support, young Thais are taking on a government that has used arrests, legal intimidation and water cannons to try to stop them."
India Captures Chinese Soldier Along Disputed Mountain Border,2020-10-19,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — The Indian troops fed the captured Chinese soldier a meal. They gave him oxygen and some warm clothes. They treated him respectfully, both sides indicated, and the Indians said that they planned to release him soon. The Indian military revealed on Monday that its forces had captured a Chinese corporal who had strayed across the disputed, unmarked high-altitude border that zigzags between the two nations, the first time a soldier had been reported captured since hostilities exploded between India and China in June. The friendly treatment seemed to signal that maybe, finally, after rounds and rounds of talks, tensions were slightly easing between the Indian and Chinese troops positioned high up in the Himalayas. In June, a vicious brawl erupted in the same area, along the rocky edges of India’s Ladakh region, in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops were killed. Late on Monday, the Chinese military confirmed that one of its personnel had ended up in Indian hands. A soldier became lost on Sunday evening after agreeing to help a herder find a missing yak, Senior Col. Zhang Shuili, a spokesman for the People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theater Command, said in a statement on a Chinese military website. The Chinese forces asked for help from their Indian counterparts, who “agreed to give support and also promised to promptly return” the soldier, Colonel Zhang said. “We hope that the Indian side will abide by its promise and quickly transfer the individual who became lost back to the Chinese side.” Hu Xijin, editor of The Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party newspaper, said that Beijing and New Delhi were “working toward a proper resolution.” “This matter should not cause new tensions in the border area,” he wrote in a post on the social media site Weibo. “The smooth resolution of this matter is also a sign that the two countries have made progress in recent negotiations.” The Indian Army said in a statement on Monday that its troops had provided the food, clothing and other aid to the Chinese soldier to “protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions” and that he would be released “after completion of formalities.” Since June, Indian and Chinese officials have been meeting regularly. Both countries have nuclear weapons, and they seem to want a way out of the crisis, but both are also led by strong-willed nationalists unwilling to back down. The border area is considered strategically important. It snakes through icy mountain passes that rise higher than 15,000 feet and touches several contentious territories, such as Tibet and Kashmir. It has been a sore spot for decades. In 1962, the two nations went to war over the same area and China won, taking firm control of a high-altitude plateau, Aksai Chin, that India wants back. After the brawl in June, in which Chinese troops used spiked iron clubs to beat Indian soldiers to death, tens of thousands of reinforcements rushed in. Military analysts say that the troops remain dangerously close, in many places just a few hundred yards apart, and that they are backed up by fighter jets, tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers. Several soldiers were captured during the June fighting and in the smaller brawls that led up to it in April and May. A few shots were even fired in September, breaking India and China’s longstanding agreement not to use firearms during border confrontations. Since then, though, it appears that both sides have invested more in the effort to talk out their differences. Indian and Chinese military officials have held seven rounds of discussions, and Indian officials said in a recent statement that they had “a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement” with their Chinese counterparts. But some Indian analysts said they were still a little suspicious. “The winter’s going to be tough,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired general. “I know that the Indian Army has considerable experience in operating in Ladakh during the winter months,” he said. “The P.L.A. also seems to be building habitat for housing troops during the winter,” referring to China’s forces, known as the People’s Liberation Army. Mr. Hooda said that during night patrols, soldiers sometimes inadvertently strayed across the border, which he said was most likely what had happened in the case of the captured Chinese soldier.

‘It’s insane’: This is what happened when schools reopened in a virus-hit community.,2020-10-18,By Kate Taylor,"['In mid-September, parents of students at Corner Canyon High School, in an affluent suburb of Salt Lake City, received a text urging them to beg the school board to keep classrooms open. Three weeks into the school year, the number of coronavirus cases at the Corner Canyon was rising, and the district was considering shifting to online instruction. After parents flooded the board with messages, the school stayed open. Within a week, the number of cases had nearly quadrupled. A teacher was hospitalized and put on a ventilator. When the board finally decided on Sept. 18 to close the school temporarily, 77 students and staff members had tested positive. And Corner Canyon was not the only school in the district to have an outbreak. By Sept. 28, Canyons School District had temporarily closed three high schools and a middle school. The story of Canyons illustrates what can happen when schools open in communities that are failing to contain the virus. In the two weeks before the district opened for the fall, Salt Lake County had roughly 187 new cases per 100,000 people, a level at which some experts have advised against high schools opening in person; that level is two and a half times higher than the standard Washington State uses to recommend distance learning for all students. Since then, with schools and colleges open, things have only worsened. In the two weeks that ended Thursday, Salt Lake County had nearly 617 cases per 100,000 people. Over the past week, Utah had the sixth-highest rate of new cases per 100,000 people of any state. Canyons is also an example of how the nation’s 13,000 school districts are struggling to find workable policies in the absence of clear standards from the federal government and many state governments. “We’ve forced every school district to figure out how to respond to a pandemic on its own, and it’s insane,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

"In Election, Bolivia Confronts Legacy of Ousted Socialist Leader",2020-10-18,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — Adalid Zelada fully supported Evo Morales when Bolivia chose him as the country’s first Indigenous president in 2005. The way many saw it, large numbers of Bolivians were painfully poor, society was deeply unequal and power was overwhelmingly concentrated among the white elite. Mr. Morales, a socialist and former llama herder, spoke of equality, ending discrimination and recovering the nation’s resources from foreign hands. “They were very good ideas,” said Mr. Zelada, 47. “But over time, it all became an authoritarian strategy to co-opt power. And those good ideas became just words.” As Bolivians went to the polls on Sunday to choose a new president, the election was widely viewed as a referendum on the 14-year political project of Mr. Morales, a towering figure in Bolivian politics who lifted hundreds of thousands out of poverty but whose policies and rhetoric often divided the country. In recent years, even supporters began to abandon him amid allegations of misuse of funds, abuse of power and, more recently, a sexual relationship with a minor. He fled Bolivia last year after his attempt to win a fourth term ended in a contested election and deadly protests. Mr. Morales called it a coup. Others accused his government of trying to rig the vote. Voting in Bolivia is mandatory, and on Sunday lines began to form outside schools converted into precincts even before polling places opened at 8 a.m. Soon, patios filled with voters, who entered classrooms one by one to fill out paper ballots, then dropped their votes in cardboard boxes, to be counted by hand later that night. Many called the moment critical one, and said they had arrived despite fears of the coronavirus. “This is going to define our country’s destiny,” said Enrique Huanca, 58. Sunday was a redo of last year’s election, and came at a time of deep polarization, at a level notable even for a country accustomed to division and unrest. In the weeks leading up the election, the United Nations documented at least 41 acts of political violence. In the streets of La Paz, the administrative capital, there is little agreement about whether there was electoral fraud last year. And Mr. Morales’s party, the Movimiento al Socialismo, or MAS, is casting doubt on the voting system, warning supporters of almost certain “electoral fraud” and a process stacked against them. A recent poll by the nongovernmental organization Fundación Jubileo found that just 40 percent of Bolivians trust the country’s electoral body, despite major efforts to overhaul it since last year. It could take days for results to come in. And when the count is announced, large swaths of the country are likely to be angry, political observers say, and violence is a real possibility. The vote is largely a choice between Mr. Morales’ handpicked successor, his former economics minister, Luis Arce, and Carlos Mesa, a centrist former president. Mr. Arce’s appeal to voters is that he can continue the socialist movement his predecessor started — while being very different from Mr. Morales. In the back of his campaign car just before the election, he called Mr. Morales’s decision to run for a fourth term “an error,” insisted that he would run for only a single term and said he considered himself a transitional candidate. “I have no interest in power,” he said. “I want to move the country forward, leave it in the hands of young people, and I’ll go.” Mr. Morales, he added, would have no part in his government. “We see him as a historical figure.” Mr. Mesa is running as the anti-Morales candidate, promising a return to peace after years of political and social division. Mr. Morales’s wrongdoings, he added, had been papered over by journalists and left-wing politicians “who have a fascination with the fact that he was the first Indigenous president.” “We are the only political force in this country with the ability to begin reconciliation, heal the wounds and construct a space of unity,” he said. A third candidate, Luis Fernando Camacho, threatens to split the conservative vote, pushing Mr. Arce and Mr. Mesa to a potential runoff. In the streets of La Paz last week, much of the conversation was not about Mr. Arce, Mr. Mesa or Mr. Camacho — but about the legacy Mr. Morales leaves behind. During Mr. Morales’s time in office, he promised to lift many living on the margins, and in some places fulfilled that promise, building schools, hospitals and roads. The country’s poverty rate fell to 35 percent of the population from 60 percent, according to World Bank figures. But Mr. Zelada, the disillusioned Morales supporter, said he ultimately felt that the former president wasted his chance to truly transform the country. Mr. Morales ran Bolivia amid a commodities boom — with money pouring into the country — and his party controlled congress for all 14 years of his presidency. The president could have done so much more, Mr. Zelada said. He plans to vote for Mr. Mesa. In the city of El Alto, a MAS stronghold perched above the capital, there were plenty of people who said they were voting for Arce, and said they remained faithful to Mr. Morales. “He governed well,” said Luisa Álvarez, 40. But at one precinct, Miguelina Sanabria, 59, sat in a wooden chair on the second floor, explaining how she had gone from longtime MAS supporter to Mesa voter. She grew up in Chapare, the jungle region of Bolivia where Mr. Morales got his political start, and appreciated that he was from the countryside, that he had tried to help women like her. In his third term, though, she began to turn against him when, she said, he seemed unwilling to give up power. This year, she’s jobless and angry, and looking for something new. “He just kept going,” she said of Morales. “He didn’t leave space for younger leaders. He wanted to run everything.” She raised her voice. It seemed she wanted voters around her to hear. “I decided to switch to Mesa,” she went on. “I hope he doesn’t let me down, too.” Reporting was contributed by María Silvia Trigo from Tarija, Bolivia.']","Sunday’s election is seen as a referendum on Evo Morales, who lifted many out of poverty in his 14 years as president, but whose policies and tone divided the country."
"After Teacher’s Decapitation, France Unleashes a Broad Crackdown on ‘the Enemy Within’",2020-10-19,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — France on Monday unleashed a broad crackdown on Muslims accused of extremism, carrying out dozens of raids, vowing to shut down aid groups and threatening to expel foreigners as anger swept the country following the decapitation of a middle school teacher for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class. Many of those swept up in raids were already in police files for showing “signals” of potential radicalization, like preaching radicalized sermons or sharing hate messages on social networks, government officials said. More than 200 others — the bulk already in prison — were threatened with a rare mass expulsion. But other groups targeted in the raids included Muslim associations previously given government subsidies for their work promoting better civic relations, and only 15 of the people arrested had any connection to the gruesome attack on Friday. The scope of the response was a measure of how the killing of Samuel Paty, a teacher in a suburb north of Paris, had reopened old wounds in France. The nation remains traumatized by terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists that killed scores in 2015, starting with the editorial offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine — whose cartoons the teacher had shown. As much as the Charlie Hebdo killings, the beheading of Mr. Paty has struck deep inside the French psyche as an assault on a principal pillar of the French republic — the secular public school system — as well as the nation’s devotion to freedom of speech. Thousands of people took to the streets in cities around France over the weekend to demonstrate their horror at the killing on Friday. And politicians, especially on the right, jostled to sound the alarm against “the enemy within,” as the hard-line interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, put it in a radio interview, referring to so-called radicalized Muslims. Some voices were raised against the breadth of the government’s raids, but in general the tone was set by President Emmanuel Macron’s likely principal challenger in 2022, the far right leader Marine Le Pen, whose party has targeted Muslims and immigrants for nearly 50 years. “This situation calls for a strategy of reconquest,” Ms. Le Pen said Monday. “Islamism is a bellicose ideology whose means of conquest is terrorism.” Even before the attack on Mr. Paty, Mr. Macron, looking to consolidate a right-leaning electorate that is his only solid base heading into the 2022 election, had embarked on a campaign against what he called “Islamist separatism” in a speech earlier this month. The speech reinforced the idea, current on France’s right, that there is a large and hostile Muslim contingent waiting in the wings — the country’s suburbs — to tear down French values. Mr. Macron vowed to end home-schooling as well as the practice of bringing in foreign imams. On Monday, the police began their work at 6 in the morning, going after “numerous” Muslims in multiple raids, Mr. Darmanin said. “Important police operations have been carried out starting this morning, targeting radicalized individuals,” Mr. Macron’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said in a speech Monday. “Other actions will follow,” Mr. Castex promised, against “networks and individuals who are attacking our basic values and the Republican ideal.” Some 51 Muslim aid organizations will also be targeted by the police this week, the interior minister said, some of which would be dissolved at Mr. Macron’s request. Mr. Darmanin called the most prominent of them, Collective Against Islamophobia, the C.C.I.F., which compiles a register of anti-Muslim acts, “an enemy of the republic.” Its former president, Marwan Muhammad, one of the most prominent of France’s Muslim activists, said the C.C.I.F. “didn’t have the slightest involvement” in the killing of Mr. Paty. Already, 15 people have been arrested, including family members of the suspect, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee named Abdullakh Anzorov, who was shot dead by the police Friday night after the killing. Also in custody is the father of a student at the school who had denounced Mr. Paty online for showing the caricatures and had demanded his dismissal. The video circulated widely on social media. The interior minister announced that it would expel 231 foreign citizens identified for their radicalism, including 180 who were already in prison. Those not imprisoned would soon be arrested, officials said. At times, the French government has expelled foreign Muslims it accuses of being radicalized. But a mass expulsion like the one currently envisioned is unusual. By day’s end it was not clear how many arrests had resulted from the police raids. Some of the country’s prominent Muslim preachers defended the government’s actions. “When the war has already been declared, what you need is a wartime government,” said Hassen Chalghoumi, president of the French Imams’ Congress. But a few Muslim scholars raised questions — not just about the raids, but also about Mr. Paty’s use of the Muhammad caricatures in class. On Monday’s raids, some said politics appeared to be winning out over good sense. “I’m afraid that there has been a rush into a certain number of decisions,” said Rachid Benzine, a political scientist. “It’s, ‘We’re going to do these raids’ — and then they have nothing to do with the actual investigation. It seems like these are punitive expeditions, kind of score-settling.” “And of course there’s a risk that the courts will eventually reject all of this,” Mr. Benzine added. Mr. Macron will deliver a solemn eulogy to Mr. Paty on Wednesday at the Sorbonne. He has already been hailed as a martyr of the French Republic. The emotion of thousands who turned out for him across France was real. A huge gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris recalled the ones held after the attacks of 2015. But a few wondered about what had transpired in Mr. Paty’s class. “I feel like it’s very hard to use these cartoons for strictly educational purposes,” said Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, EHESS, in Paris. “Secularists think that it is their right, because of the law that allows blasphemy and any form of mockery of religion. But on the other hand, there is the feeling that in doing so, it is the Muslims who are despised, not the prophet,” he said. “By using cartoons to teach freedom of expression, we do not understand that we offend people,” Mr. Khosrokhavar said. “There are a thousand ways to express freedom of expression, so why choose this one?” Françoise Lorcerie, an education expert at the National Center for Scientific Research, said she had never heard of using the caricatures of the prophet in a classroom setting for students of that age. And she was critical of Mr. Paty’s invitation to Muslim students that they leave the class to avoid being offended. “Obviously these caricatures are wounding for Muslims,” said Ms. Lorcerie. “I’m not so sure about presenting these caricatures, without some sort of justification,” she said.  From the standpoint of the absolute value of secularism, “it doesn’t conform to his obligation to be neutral,” Ms. Lorcerie said. “There should be a reflection on all of this.” Constant Meheut and Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']","With dozens of raids against Muslim individuals and groups accused of radicalism, the fury of the response had France’s right wing speaking in terms of warfare."
"Europe’s museums are open, but the public isn’t coming.",2020-10-19,By Nina Siegal,"['As cultural institutions reopen across the United States, with new coronavirus protocols in place, many have been looking to Europe, where many museums have been open since May, for a preview of how the public might respond to the invitation to return. So far, there’s little reason to be optimistic. Almost all European museums are suffering from visitor losses, but their ability to cope depends almost entirely on how they are funded. Institutions supported by government funding are able to weather the storm with a little belt-tightening, while those that depend on ticket sales are facing tougher choices. Many are laying off employees and restructuring their business models. Visitor information from across Europe tells a fairly consistent story: Museums that have reopened have about a third of the visitors they had this time last year. The Louvre in Paris reports about 4,500 to 5,000 visitors a day, compared with about 15,000 a year ago. The State Museums of Berlin, a group of 18 museums in the German capital, reports about 30 percent of its usual attendance. Others are faring worse. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is down to about 400 visitors a day, when it used to welcome 6,500. “It’s really very, very quiet in the museum,” said its director, Emilie Gordenker. Travel restrictions and border closings have dramatically reduced the numbers of international tourists in European capitals. Over the summer, institutions in the Netherlands reported a boost in tourism from neighboring Belgium and Germany. That waned again when the school year started in September, and a surge of new coronavirus cases in the Netherlands led to “code red” alerts in several Dutch cities, including Amsterdam. European governments support many national cultural institutions, but there is a broad range of business models across the continent, from privately established museums that receive virtually no government money to those that are wholly subsidized by taxpayers. In recent years, however, governments in many countries, including the Netherlands, have been cutting support of museums, as politicians have encouraged the “American model” of funding, with more reliance on earned income.']",
At Front Lines of a Brutal War: Death and Despair in Nagorno-Karabakh,2020-10-18,By Anton Troianovski and Sergey Ponomarev,"['STEPANAKERT, Nagorno-Karabakh — On the front line, the stench is overwhelming. The remains of fighters have been lying there for weeks. In the trenches, there is fear. The Armenians are defenseless against the Azerbaijani drones that hover overhead and kill at will. At the military graveyard, bulldozers have scraped away a hillside. It is already lined with two rows of new graves, along with soon-to-be-filled, freshly dug, rectangular holes. The three-week-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over a disputed territory in the Caucasus Mountains, where Europe meets Asia, has settled into a brutal war of attrition, soldiers and civilians said in interviews here on the ground in recent days. Azerbaijan is sacrificing columns of fighters, Armenians say, to eke out small territorial gains in the treacherous terrain of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that is part of Azerbaijan under international law. Civilians who have stayed behind live in their damp and unheated basements, converted in recent weeks with makeshift kitchens, and where some sleep on flattened cardboard boxes. The shelling and missile barrages into the towns in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan have killed dozens of civilians and hundreds of soldiers and have filled the nights with terrifying flashes and booms. In the city of Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh, which I visited over four days last week with the photographer Sergey Ponomarev, artillery fire could often be heard in the distance. Late Friday the city itself came under attack. Air raid sirens and bangs and thuds sounded throughout the night, as hotel guests rushed repeatedly for the basement. At least one of the shells landed by the city center, illuminating my hotel window with a bolt of yellow light. Manushak Titanyan, an architect in Nagorno-Karabakh, has already lost one of her buildings to the violence: the House of Culture in the hilltop town of Shusha, its roof gone, a piece of it stuck in a tree across the street, the plush red seats coated in dust, the stage curtain tangled amid the rubble. Now she fears for her three sons, the youngest 18, who are at the front lines. She has kept herself busy by sewing military uniforms in an emergency workshop that the authorities set up in a factory in Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. When the building shook on a recent afternoon with the rumble of a nearby explosion, she barely skipped a beat and kept on sewing. “War is probably the most terrible thing in the world,” Ms. Titanyan said. “All the most horrible things that man ever created rear their heads in their most horrible manifestation.” For the region’s populace, the war is a continuation of on-off violent strife over both territory and history, with roots going back more than a century. Armenians and Azerbaijanis lived side by side in the Soviet days, until conflict over the disputed mountain territory called Nagorno-Karabakh exploded in the late 1980s into riots, expulsions and a yearslong war. Nagorno-Karabakh has been effectively independent since Armenia won the war in 1994, after the deaths of some 20,000 and the displacement of about a million people, mostly Azerbaijanis. Azerbaijan launched its offensive on Sept. 27 and began making small territorial gains, backed by intense artillery fire and precision drone strikes. Armenia’s limited air defenses have failed to stop the drones, but its troops, bolstered by volunteers and conscripts, have slowed the Azerbaijani advance. In some parts of the front, the Armenians have dug new trenches, and killed large numbers of Azerbaijani soldiers attempting to advance on foot, according to Armenian accounts. Azerbaijan, an oil and gas hub on the Caspian Sea, has deployed superior firepower, using advanced drones and artillery systems it buys from Israel, Turkey and Russia. But three weeks into the conflict, Azerbaijan has failed to convert that advantage into broad territorial gains, indicating that a long and punishing war looms. It could morph into a wider crisis, pitting Azerbaijan’s main partner, Turkey, a NATO ally, against Russia, which has a mutual defense alliance with Armenia. On Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan announced they had negotiated a truce, mediated by France, to allow bodies to be collected and prisoners to be exchanged. But as with a Russian-brokered cease-fire reached a week earlier, the fighting has continued, with each side accusing the other on Sunday of violating the truce. “Their war effort against the Armenians is principally an attrition fight,” Michael Kofman, a military analyst at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis organization in Arlington, Va., said of Azerbaijan’s campaign. “It’s not really well organized with a clear theory of victory.” Outgunned, Armenia has thrown conscripts and volunteers into the battle. Some of the latter are veterans of the 1990s war, like Artur Aleksanyan, a retired special forces colonel who said he was in the hospital recovering from surgery when the current conflict began. He said he now leads a volunteer unit in the trenches to the north, battling to halt the Azerbaijani advance. It has been 15 years since he last wielded a weapon, Mr. Aleksanyan said Saturday in an interview in Stepanakert, where he was picking up a bag full of radio equipment before driving back to the front. He lifted his uniform to show the bandages around his belly which he has to change eight times a day and rapped his knuckles against his artificial kneecap, a reminder of his last war. But this conflict is nothing like the 1990s, Mr. Aleksanyan said. Then, the Kalashnikov rifle was the principal weapon. This time, there are few exchanges of small-arms fire. Of his unit’s 17 days at the front, he said, 15 days were spent in the trenches, taking cover from artillery barrages that came as frequently as every 20 minutes. There they are surrounded by craters where Azerbaijan has been systematically destroying Armenian tanks and other equipment, using modern “suicide drones” that loiter over a battlefield before diving down to an opportune target. “They’re so fast that we can’t manage to hunt them down,” Mr. Aleksanyan said. “I won’t say that we are not afraid. We are all afraid.” Mr. Aleksanyan and other Armenian fighters said that despite Azerbaijan’s fearsome firepower, its foot soldiers proved easy targets when they tried to advance. Their bodies had not been collected, Mr. Aleksanyan said, and filled the battlefield with a putrid stench. “You knock down one guy, and they don’t run away,” said a soldier back from the front, Tigran Saakyan, dressed in a brown-and-tan knit sweater under his military jacket. “You knock down a second guy, you knock down a third guy, and they keep coming anyway — coming like robots.” At a military base in Stepanakert, Mr. Saakyan and his comrades, some of them in their 50s, were waiting to be blessed by military clergy. Narek Petrosyan, a deacon in the Armenian Apostolic Church, said that when soldiers’ relatives call him asking for word from the front, he tries to give them hope, even if he knows that their loved ones have died. A separate group of clergy is charged with delivering that news. “We tell them that this is a holy war, and we are prepared to sacrifice our lives for each other,” he said. More than 700 Armenian soldiers have already been killed, along with scores of civilians on both sides. Azerbaijan has not been disclosing its military death toll. But the government said Saturday that 14 civilians were killed in Ganja, Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, in an overnight missile attack by Armenia. Officials say that more than half the people of Nagorno-Karabakh have fled their homes, though the martial law currently in effect bars men of military age from leaving the territory. Those who stayed behind include women who want to be close to their husbands, sons and fathers sent to the front lines. The coronavirus is far down the list of people’s worries, even though international aid organizations warn that cramped bomb shelters are spreading infection. Alyona Shakhramanyan, 33, and her neighbors from the fifth floor of an apartment building in Shusha, the hilltop town, moved three weeks ago into a section of their dirt-floor basement. They fashioned a door out of a sheet of corrugated plastic and taped cardboard over the openings in the concrete walls. One of the women is sick — a cold, they say, that she caught because of the drafty air. Ms. Shakhramanyan’s brother, who, like her husband, is at the front, has not been answering his phone. When she went outside to do laundry the previous day, she was frightened by the buzz of a drone. Rocket artillery hit the nearby Holy Savior Cathedral twice earlier this month, and the paving stones outside it were still stained with the blood of a Russian journalist critically injured in the second strike. “No one helps us here,” Ms. Shakhramanyan said. “We are on our own.” At the military cemetery in Stepanakert, the resting place of fighters who died in the 1990s, the authorities removed a retaining wall and dug into a hillside to make way for the new casualties. Amid the artificial-flower wreaths and simple grave sites on the freshly graded, rocky dirt, a man whose brother was gone spread his arms in grief. “These are fresh — our guys,” he cried, his voice trailing off. “What is there to say?”']",Times journalists find civilians huddling in basements as a three-week-old conflict over the disputed Caucasus territory hints of a long and punishing fight.
"Using a Law It Hates, Far Right in Spain Takes Aim at Franco’s Rivals",2020-10-18,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Leftist politicians in Spain have worked slowly but steadily over the years to remove symbols commemorating the former dictator Gen. Francisco Franco from public spaces across the country. Now, despite denouncing those efforts, their political opponents are trying to use the same law to persuade the authorities in Madrid to erase memorials to Franco’s rivals. This past week, city employees removed a plaque from the home of Francisco Largo Caballero, a Socialist who became prime minister of the Republican government in 1936, a few months after Franco and other generals started a military coup that plunged Spain into a civil war. Largo Caballero fled to France when Franco claimed victory in 1939. He was later arrested during the Nazi occupation and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He died in exile in Paris in 1946. The plaque was taken down on Thursday — the 151st anniversary of his birth. Juan E. Pflüger, spokesman for Vox, the far-right party behind the removal of the plaque, said the action was a warning to the leftist coalition leading the national government that the legislation, called the “law of historical memory,” should be abolished. “We want to remove the law and leave history in peace,” Mr. Pflüger said. The “law of historical memory” was enacted in 2007 with the aim of condemning the Franco regime and forbidding the exaltation of leaders or symbols related to the military coup and the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. The Spanish government used the same law last year to exhume Franco’s remains from a basilica that he built outside Madrid. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez responded on Twitter that the warnings from Vox were “unacceptable.” He added: “Let us continue building a Spain worthy of those who fought so we could be what we are now: free.” Spain has long been bitterly divided about whether to stir the bones of its past, but the dispute has intensified since 2018, when Mr. Sánchez took office with a promise to revive the historical memory law that had been approved by a previous Socialist government and then ignored by a conservative administration. One of the measure’s main goals is to help finance the opening of more than 2,000 mass graves across Spain. Vox is pressing for the removal or alteration of monuments dedicated to Largo Caballero and another Socialist politician of the 1930s, Indalecio Prieto, including a boulevard named after Prieto on the outskirts of Madrid. In a recent speech in the Madrid assembly, Javier Ortega Smith, a Vox lawmaker, said that the efforts were “not revisionism, but putting an end to a historical lie.” He called the two politicians “sinister characters in our history that should not form part of the names of the streets and squares.” Vox argues that, far from deserving exaltation as defenders of democracy, both Socialists helped spark revolutionary unrest before the coup took place, and then joined a Republican government that allowed the summary executions of Fascist opponents once the war got underway. More than 200 historians, from Spain and abroad, have signed a report forcefully rejecting Vox’s account of the roles of Largo Caballero and Prieto in the 1930s. Paul Preston, a British historian who signed the report and is a leading expert on the Spanish Civil War, said in an email that it was “malicious and unfair” to equate leftist politicians like Largo Caballero and Prieto with some of Franco’s generals, whom he described as “mass murderers.” Ramón Silva, a Socialist politician, said the city politics of Madrid had been “contaminated” by the emergence of Vox, now the third-largest party in Spain. He noted that the plaque at Largo Caballero’s birthplace was erected in 1981, shortly after Spain’s return to democracy, with the support of politicians from all parties. Madrid’s city politics shifted last year, after elections that led to José Luis Martínez-Almeida, a politician from the conservative Popular Party, taking over as mayor from Manuela Carmena, a leftist politician. Mr. Martínez-Almeida is running Madrid in coalition with Vox and Ciudadanos, a center-right party. Since taking office, Mr. Martínez-Almeida’s administration has removed plaques from a Madrid cemetery memorial naming over 2,900 people killed under Franco’s orders. The city government argued that the memorial should honor victims without identifying them or saying which side they supported in the civil war. Opposition politicians in Madrid said they planned to challenge the removal of the Largo Caballero plaque in court. Teresa Amor, a spokeswoman for the Socialists in Madrid, said the dispute showed that the country still needed to come to terms with its history. “Spain has not healed the wounds of our past and also certainly needs to do a lot more homework about its Fascist dictatorship,” she said. “We still have plenty of people who don’t understand that winning a war is not the same as gaining legitimacy.”']","Vox, an ultranationalist party in Madrid, is working to remove memorials to Socialist figures of the 1930s, calling the effort a warning that a “law of historical memory” should be abolished."
High-Level U.S. Mission to Syria Sought Release of American Prisoners,2020-10-19,By Richard Pérez-Peña,"['High-level United States officials traveled recently to Syria for rare talks with the Assad government in an attempt to secure the release of American citizens held prisoner there, a high priority for the Trump administration, but there has been little apparent progress so far, officials said. The secret U.S. mission to Damascus in August focused on Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was seized while reporting on the Syrian civil war in 2012, and Majd Kamalmaz, a psychotherapist who was taken in 2017. The trip was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by two U.S. officials with knowledge of American operations in the Middle East, including a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The senior official cautioned that the attempt was still in its early stages, and that the U.S. government did not have any recent proof that Mr. Tice, 39, was still alive. The Syrian government has not publicly acknowledged holding either him or Mr. Kamalmaz, 62, who is diabetic and requires regular medication, according to his family and the U.S. government. Previous contacts by the United States about prisoners held by President Bashar al-Assad’s government have fizzled out, but his regime — which would like to see economic sanctions lifted and American troops withdrawn from Syria — has much to gain, potentially, from improved relations with Washington. The Trump administration has secured the release of people held in several other countries in the Middle East, a goal of particular interest to the president. In August, Kashyap Patel, the senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council, and Roger D. Carstens, the State Department’s special envoy for hostage affairs, went to Damascus to meet with Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria’s National Security Bureau intelligence service, U.S. officials said. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been minimal since the United States closed its embassy in Damascus in 2012 and ordered the closure of the Syrian embassy in Washington in 2014. The United States has long labeled Syria, considered a pariah state by much of the world, as a sponsor of terrorism, and has imposed sanctions on the country and its officials for human rights violations before and during the war that began in 2011. But in 2017, Mike Pompeo, then the C.I.A. director, called Mr. Mamlouk to open back-channel communications on Mr. Tice. Washington then sent an intermediary to see Mr. Mamlouk, the officials said. They met for hours and the intermediary delivered an unsigned letter from the U.S. government. But the effort was put on hold the next year, when the Syrian government launched a chemical attack on a rebel-held area, and the United States responded with missile strikes on Syrian targets. Weeks later, French authorities issued international arrest warrants for Mr. Mamlouk and other officials, in connection with torture, killings and war crimes. In August 2018, the C.I.A. sent a top agency official with expertise in the Middle East to meet Mr. Mamlouk in Damascus, where the official raised the case of Mr. Tice. A year ago, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of most of the American troops in Syria, in effect ceding back to Mr. Assad territory that had been captured from the Islamic State. Critics questioned why the administration had not demanded anything from Syria in return, like the release of prisoners. Mr. Tice, a Marine Corps veteran, was attending law school at Georgetown University when he decided to cover the war in Syria, where he wrote articles for several news organizations. His family has been outspoken about maintaining interest in his case and seeking his release, and said as recently as 2018 they were confident he was still alive. “For years we have pushed for engagement between the U.S. and Syrian governments to help bring our son safely home, so we hope recent reports are accurate,” his parents, Marc and Debra Tice, said in a statement released on Monday. “We are deeply grateful to everyone working for Austin’s safe return, and his continued absence shows there is more to be done.” Mr. Kamalmaz, who was born in Syria and grew up in the United States, had established a mental health clinic in Lebanon for refugees from the Syrian war. He went to Syria to visit family members and was taken the day after he arrived. Reporting was contributed by Adam Goldman and Edward Wong.']","Though the two countries barely talk, American officials met in Damascus with a Syrian intelligence chief to discuss two U.S. citizens held in Syria, Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz."
Festival Cancels Abu Dhabi Event After Allegations of Sexual Assault,2020-10-19,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — The Hay Festival, an annual staple of Britain’s literary calendar, announced on Monday that an offshoot event to promote freedom of speech and women’s empowerment would no longer be held in Abu Dhabi after one of its employees accused the United Arab Emirates’ minister of tolerance of sexual assault. In an article published by The Sunday Times of London over the weekend, the employee, Caitlin McNamara, 32, said that the minister, Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak al-Nahyan, who is also a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, assaulted her in February. In a statement issued later on Sunday, the festival said it would not hold the Abu Dhabi event as long as Sheikh al-Nahyan remained in the position. Caroline Michel, chair of the Hay Festival board, called the alleged attack “an appalling violation and a hideous abuse of trust and position.” “Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak al-Nahyan made a mockery of his ministerial responsibilities and tragically undermined his government’s attempt to work with Hay Festival to promote free speech and female empowerment,” she said in the statement. Sheikh al-Nahyan has denied the accusations, in a statement issued through his lawyers at the Schillings law firm in London. “Our client is surprised and saddened by this allegation, which arrives eight months after the alleged incident and via a national newspaper,” the law firm said. “The account is denied.” The event, a collaboration between the U.A.E. Ministry of Tolerance and the Hay Festival, brought together internationally acclaimed authors and thinkers in Abu Dhabi over four days in February. The festival organizers have defended their decision to go ahead with the 2020 event, even though the festival’s leadership was aware of Ms. McNamara’s allegations before hand. Ms. McNamara, who was hired by the Hay Festival to organize its first event in the U.A.E., spent six months working from the Ministry of Tolerance, which was created as “a bridge of communication between peoples of different cultures in a respectful environment that rejects extremism and emphasis on the acceptance of the other,” according to a government website. She said that Sheikh al-Nahyan invited her to a private dinner at an exclusive resort on Feb. 14, days before the festival, where he attacked her. She reported the events to the British Embassy in Abu Dhabi shortly after the alleged assault, according to The Sunday Times, and she has since been interviewed by Scotland Yard in Britain. The newspaper reported that Ms. McNamara was waiting to hear whether legal action can be taken against Sheikh al-Nahyan in Britain. She told the news outlet she had gone public with the story because she wanted to see him held accountable and because of the “massive mental and physical toll” the attack had taken on her. “I feel I have nothing to lose,” she said. “ I want to do this because I want to highlight the effect of powerful men like him doing things like that and thinking they can get away with it. It seemed clear from the set up I was not the first or last.” Attempts to reach Ms. McNamara were not immediately successful. The festival has grown from its roots as a literary gathering in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, to hosting several international gatherings. The event in February was its first in Abu Dhabi. But even before the sexual assault accusations, it had drawn controversy. Dozens of rights groups and prominent writers issued an open letter to festival organizers before it started, denouncing the United Arab Emirates’ rights record and calling for freedom of speech to be upheld. The event, billed as a platform for freedom of expression, seemed directly at odds with the country’s arbitrary detention of government critics and jailing of those who voice dissent, the critics said, The letter called the festival an opportunity for the country “to back up its promise of tolerance with actions that include the courageous contributors to freedom of expression who live in the country.” The United Arab Emirates has long been criticized for its suppression of political dissent, and limited protections for women under the leadership of the de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. “Despite declaring 2019 the ‘Year of Tolerance,’ United Arab Emirates rulers showed no tolerance for any manner of peaceful dissent,” the international monitoring group Human Rights Watch wrote in its annual world report assessing the rights situation in countries around the world.']",An employee of the Hay Festival in Abu Dhabi said she was accosted by the tolerance minister of the U.A.E. earlier this year.
"‘If There Were No Hashish Here, You Wouldn’t See a Single House’",2020-10-19,By Ben Hubbard,"['YAMOUNEH, Lebanon — In a Lebanese farming village of rocky soil and stone villas, cannabis grows everywhere. It fills the fields that surround the village and lines nearby roads where the army operates checkpoints. It sprouts in the weedy patches between homes and is mixed with other colorful blooms in flower beds. There is a cannabis crop near the mosque, and down the road from a giant yellow flag for Hezbollah, the militant group and political party whose leaders forbid its use on religious grounds. Jamal Chraif, the mukhtar, or village chief, of Yamouneh, praised cannabis as “a blessed shrub” for what he called its many beneficial properties and the ease of its cultivation. “There is something sacred about it,” he said. “God makes it grow.” But for the first time since he began growing cannabis two decades ago, Mr. Chraif planted none this year because a chain of events have erased most of the profits that used to come with the village’s main product: the hashish extracted from the plant. Instead, he is focusing on apples. He blames the woes afflicting the village, and Lebanon in general, on cosmic forces, including aliens, the Antichrist and the Bermuda Triangle — an explanation that could have been inspired by the drug itself. The reality is more terrestrial. The Lebanese pound has lost 80 percent of its value against the United States dollar since last fall, and farmers have taken the hit. The costs of imported fuel and fertilizer needed to grow the crop have soared, while the Lebanese pounds that growers earn by selling their hash are worth less and less. Lebanon’s financial crisis has also undermined the drug’s domestic market, and the war in Syria has snarled smuggling routes, making it harder for middlemen to reach foreign markets. This has forced painful choices in Yamouneh, a picturesque hamlet in a neglected pocket of Lebanon where drugs, poverty, religion and stunning natural beauty converge in unexpected ways. For as long as anyone alive can remember, the yearly cycle in Yamouneh has been driven by the planting, weeding and harvesting of cannabis. The hashish extracted from the plant and sold to smugglers who spirit it out of the country has done more than any other crop to help the village residents edge out of abject poverty. It has provided reliable income not offered by their legal, more fickle crops, like apples and potatoes, and funded home expansions, truck purchases and children’s educations. Now, the drug earns so little that some growers in Yamouneh doubt it is still worth producing. “It’s over,” Mr. Chraif said. “Now, growing hashish is a hobby.” The production here and in other communities made Lebanon the world’s third largest hashish supplier, after Morocco and Afghanistan, according to the United Nations. Although hashish, a cannabis concentrate with high levels of THC, is illegal to produce, possess and sell in Lebanon, the government earlier this year passed a law legalizing some cannabis cultivation for medicinal purposes. The law has yet to be implemented, and the cannabis grown in Yamouneh remains illegal because of its high THC content. Now Lebanon’s economic crisis threatens to do what years of army raids and government efforts to combat the drug never did: reduce hashish production. While fondly recalling the days when a kilogram of hashish easily fetched between $500 and $800 — and the few years when the price shot above $1,000 — the farmers fear the earnings for this year’s product could fall to around $100 per kilo, or about $45 a pound. “If the situation stays like this, we won’t plant,” one longtime grower said, speaking on condition of anonymity like others to avoid legal jeopardy. “Hope has been cut off.” But the full effects of hashish’s declining appeal as a cash crop are yet to be seen in the village. Even as some farmers are abandoning it, others are still clinging on. During a recent visit, scores of Syrian refugees swung scythes to fell waist-high cannabis plants outside town, then piled the cut stalks into large bales. Most were minors, some as young as 9, who said they welcomed the work since fears of the coronavirus had shut their schools. They earned about $2.50 for a long day in the sun. The landowner looked on, occasionally raising a shotgun from his shoulder to fire at birds overhead. He had grown up with hashish and said this was the worst year he had ever seen. The costs for imported supplies — fuel, fertilizer and plastic sheeting to bale the harvest — ate into his profits, but tradition kept him growing. “We were born into this,” he said. “If there were no hashish here, you wouldn’t see a single house in the village.” The 5,000 or so citizens of Yamouneh, at the base of a mountain in the Bekaa Valley, are Shiite Muslims. Nearly all share the same last name, Chraif. About 1,200 Syrians have settled in the area to look for work and escape the war across the border. Talal Chraif, the mayor and elected head of the village council — and a rare resident who says he has never grown cannabis — attributed its prominence to chronic unemployment and the plant’s suitability for the local environment. “No sickness afflicts it. The bugs don’t attack it. The lack of water doesn’t affect it,” Mr. Chraif said. “There is a guarantee with the crop, and that is why the farmers went in that direction.” He recalled the old days when the Lebanese government, with funding from the United States, tried to snuff out cannabis, dispatching soldiers to torch fields and sparking clashes with armed growers. But those efforts yielded to official neglect about a decade ago. “It reached a state where they realized, because of the poverty, ‘Let’s leave those people alone and act like we don’t see them,’” Mr. Chraif said. Efforts to replace cannabis with sunflowers and saffron never took off. Two years ago, as Lebanon’s finances slid toward the abyss, McKinsey, the consulting giant, generated a national buzz by suggesting that legal cannabis cultivation could earn the country big profits. “The quality we have is one of the best in the world,” Raed Khoury, the economy minister at the time, said, suggesting it could spawn a $1 billion industry. Lebanon did legalize cannabis in February of this year, the first Arab country to do so. But the government has made no progress since on implementing the law. And since hashish is still illegal, and the government would be able to tax legal strains of cannabis, Yamouneh’s farmers, long used to operating outside the law, opposed legalization. The many two- and three-story villas and pricey SUVs out front bear testament to the cash that hashish has brought to the village, but residents say the big money has always gone to the smugglers. As he was receiving struggling farmers outside his home, the mayor said he expected hashish production to drop by as much as half this year as growers struggle to make ends meet. “They are asking, ‘Why should I grow it if I am going to lose?’” he said. “They smoke it themselves to forget their worries.” Hwaida Saad and Kareem Chehayeb contributed reporting.']","A village in Lebanon, where cannabis grows everywhere, has long counted on hashish for income.

"After Fleeing Poland, an Antiracism Activist Finds Refuge in Norway",2020-10-18,"By Elian Peltier, Monika Pronczuk and Henrik Pryser Libell","['The antiracism activist fled on New Year’s Eve in 2018 with his wife and toddler, seeking refuge in Norway, which has long welcomed political refugees from desperate corners of the world. But the activist, Rafal Gawel, wasn’t escaping a war-torn country. He was fleeing Poland, a member of the democratic and peaceful European Union. Although his initial request for asylum in Norway was rejected, last month an appeals board there granted his request. It was a dramatic chain of events that underscored concerns elsewhere in Europe that Poland’s democracy — once regarded as a great success story of the post-Soviet era — has regressed under the right-wing coalition that has ruled the country for the past five years. While Mr. Gawel’s case is complicated, the asylum decision reflected worries about political influence in the Polish judicial system. Norway’s immigration service said it had granted him asylum on the grounds that he faced political persecution in Poland, a rare instance of a country in Europe offering such protection to a citizen of the European Union. Norway is not a member of the bloc, but maintains close relations with it. A controversial and well-known artist and human rights activist in Poland, Mr. Gawel, 47, is a complicated figure at the center of an international tussle over democratic rights. He has had legal troubles in Poland, fleeing the country just before being sentenced to prison for two years for fraud and misappropriation of funds. He says, without providing evidence, that the charges against him were an effort by Poland’s government to rein him in and that the trial was rigged. The Polish government has noted that the fraud charges were brought against him under a previous, more centrist administration in 2013. And a nonprofit group in Poland funded by the financier George Soros has accused Mr. Gawel of mismanaging funds that it allocated to his organization, the Center for Monitoring Racist and Xenophobic Behavior. Those charges were used in the court case against him. Mr. Gawel said that Poland’s government had targeted him over his work documenting a growing number of hate crimes in the country, and that it had ordered far-right militants to physically harm him. “The decision to grant me asylum saved my life,” he said in an interview. The Norwegian appeals board that reviewed and approved Mr. Gawel’s asylum application concluded that the purpose of the court case was to curtail his activities, and that he might be in danger if he returned to Poland. It found that Mr. Gawel risked “political persecution from government officials, under the cover and appearance of a criminal case where the purpose has been to limit his freedom of speech and activity by imprisoning him, and possibly also discrediting him.” The conclusion, which was not made public by Norway, was read out to The New York Times by Lukasz Niedzielski, Mr. Gawel’s lawyer. Gunnar Ekelove-Slydal, the acting secretary general at the Oslo-based Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization, said Norway’s decision was a clear sign of mounting concerns in Europe over democratic backsliding in Poland. “The trust toward the Polish judiciary among European states is falling apart,” he said. But Poland’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Pawel Jablonski, said in an interview that Mr. Gawel’s conviction was based on criminal charges. “He was convicted by two courts,” the minister said. “We suspect that they might have been manipulated by his words,” he added, referring to Norway’s immigration services. Poland has in recent years been at loggerheads with its partners in Europe over concerns that its democracy is being undermined by the right-wing coalition led by the Law and Justice Party that took power in 2015. The government has actively worked to limit freedom of speech and L.G.B.T.Q. rights — and has also weakened judicial independence, assuming greater controls over the prosecutor’s office and judges. “The ruling Law and Justice government has used the past five years to put the judiciary under its control, raising serious concerns about the independence of courts, judges and prosecutors,” said Lydia Gall, a senior researcher on Eastern Europe at Human Rights Watch. The European Union has imposed modest sanctions on Poland, and several of the bloc’s members have also taken individual actions in response. This year, Germany and the Netherlands refused to extradite Polish citizens who were under European arrest warrants to Poland over fears that they would not receive fair trials. Human rights experts said that Mr. Gawel’s case was significant given how rarely E.U. citizens are granted asylum in other European countries. Of the tens of thousands of people to be granted asylum by Norway in the past decade, only 18 have been E.U. citizens, according to the country’s immigration statistics. One Pole was given asylum last year, according to official statistics, but the human rights experts said they were not aware of that case. Norway usually does not provide details about specific asylum cases. Jakub Godzimirski, an expert on Polish-Norwegian relations at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said that some Poles applied for asylum after the end of Communist rule in Poland in the early 1990s, but that most were refused. “The threshold to get asylum from a European Union country in Norway is quite high,” he said. In the interview, Mr. Gawel said he had left Poland by car even though his passport had been confiscated, and that the consular staff of a European country that he declined to identify had helped him and his family reach Norway. Mr. Gawel said that he and his wife, Karolina Krupa, got married just days before fleeing. “We picked up the marriage certificate in the morning, just before leaving, and then got our car checked by wiretap and GPS experts,” he said. “We felt like refugees, and we were refugees.” Norway initially rejected his asylum request, but he appealed the decision and was granted refugee status on Sept. 30. In the interview, Mr. Gawel denied any wrongdoing and said he had presented the Norwegian immigration authorities with documents proving his innocence. “I was targeted because my organization exposed ties between local authorities, government figures and far-right groups,” he said, adding that his group had lodged over 400 complaints about hate crimes committed in Poland this year. Mr. Gawel had also been at odds with a nonprofit group operating in Poland. Ewa Kulik-Bielinska, the head of the Stefan Batory Foundation, an independent foundation established by Mr. Soros, said Mr. Gawel had misused the equivalent of $20,000 of subsidies that it awarded him. Mr. Gawel attributed the incident to a difference with the foundation over the correct procedures for handling money. The judge who sentenced him in 2019 said in her ruling that Mr. Gawel had used loans and donations for his own aims. “Disposing of public money requires transparency and honesty,” said the judge, Alina Kaminska, according to Polish news reports. Mr. Gawel declined to show the documents granting him asylum when asked by The Times. The Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board confirmed that he had been granted asylum, but declined to comment on the specifics. Mr. Niedzielski, his lawyer, said he hoped Norway’s decision would be “a game changer” in how European countries deal with Poland, although experts said it was unlikely to push the Polish government to change course. But, said Mr. Ekelove-Slydal, from the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, “if such decisions are followed by concrete consequences, on economic cooperation or investments, then it could trigger new reflections on the courts in Poland.” “Trust in Poland’s judiciary has been undermined,” he said, “which means that a fundamental pillar of European cooperation is threatened.” Elian Peltier reported from London, Monika Pronczuk from Brussels, and Henrik Pryser Libell from Oslo, Norway.

"Pandemic weariness is making it harder to stem outbreaks, health officials say.",2020-10-18,"By Julie Bosman, Sarah Mervosh and Marc Santora","['In parts of the world where the coronavirus is resurging, the outbreaks and a rising sense of apathy are colliding, making for a dangerous combination. Health officials say growing impatience is a new challenge as they try to slow the latest outbreaks, and it threatens to exacerbate what they fear is turning into a devastating autumn. “People are done putting hearts on their windows and teddy bears out for scavenger hunts,” said Katie Rosenberg, the mayor of Wausau, Wis., a city of 38,000 where a hospital has opened an extra unit to treat Covid-19 patients. “They have had enough.” The issue is particularly stark in the United States, which has more known cases and deaths than any other country. But a similar phenomenon is sending off alarms across Europe, where researchers from the World Health Organization estimate that about half of the population is experiencing “pandemic fatigue.” In some parts of the world, behavior has changed and containment efforts have been tough and effective. Infections have stayed relatively low for months in places such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and China, where the virus first spread. After a dozen cases were detected in the Chinese city of Qingdao, the authorities sought this past week to test all of its 9.5 million residents. Siddharth Sridhar, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, said, “We have very little backlash here against these types of measures.” “If anything,” he added, “there’s a lot of pushback against governments for not doing enough to contain the virus.” The response in the United States and much of Europe has been far different. People who once would not leave their homes are now considering dining indoors for the first time. Beth Martin, who is working as a contact tracer in Marathon County, Wis., said she had interviewed a family that became sick through what is now a common situation — at a birthday party for a relative in early October. “Another case said to me, ‘You know what, it’s my adult son’s fault,’” Ms. Martin recalled. “‘He decided to go to a wedding and now we’re all sick.’” Dr. Michael Landrum, who treats coronavirus patients in Green Bay, Wis., said that mask use was more widespread than in the spring and that treatment of the virus was more sophisticated. Back then, it was not as hard to figure out where sick patients had contracted the virus. There were outbreaks at meatpacking plants in town, and many cases were tied to them. Now it is more complicated. “The scary scenario is the number of patients who really just don’t know where they got it,” Dr. Landrum said. “That suggests to me that it’s out there spreading very easily.”']",
Murderer Who Wielded Narwhal Tusk to Stop Terrorist Gets Royal Pardon,2020-10-19,By Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has approved a rare royal pardon for an inmate convicted of murder who used a narwhal tusk to help stop a terrorist attack in which two people were killed before the assailant was killed by the police on London Bridge. The decision to pardon the murderer, Steven Gallant, was in recognition of “his exceptionally brave actions,” which “helped save people’s lives despite the tremendous risk to his own,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said in a statement on Monday. If a parole board approves, Mr. Gallant’s minimum 17-year sentence would be reduced by 10 months. The attack in November 2019 began at a prisoner rehabilitation conference when a former inmate in attendance stabbed and killed two young rehabilitation advocates, Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, and fled before eventually being subdued on London Bridge. Three others were also injured before the assailant, Usman Khan, 28, was fatally shot by police. Mr. Khan had served eight years for a terrorism-related offense but had been released in December 2018. Mr. Gallant, who was imprisoned in 2005, was among a crowd of people who banded together to take the assailant down with an unconventional weapon: the narwhal tusk, which had been a wall decoration at Fishmongers’ Hall, the historic building that hosted the conference. He was in the hall for the day on a prison day-release program when he heard noises and saw injured people. He found Mr. Khan holding two large knives and wearing a fake bomb around his waist. “He was a clear danger to all, so I didn’t hesitate,” Mr. Gallant said, in a statement in January. He used a chair and the tusk, passed to him by a civil servant, to confront the attacker, chasing him onto London Bridge and helping restrain him before police arrived. Male narwhals, a species of whale, have a single straight tusk that can grow up to nine feet long; this one was about five feet. The pardon was welcome news, his lawyer, Neil Hudgell, said, adding that Mr. Gallant hoped to be a “positive example” to others after turning around his life in prison. “He is passionate about using his knowledge and experiences to help others steer away from crime,” he said. Mr. Gallant will be eligible for parole next June, though a parole board will have the final say on whether he can be released early. He was convicted along with another man in 2005 of murdering Barrie Jackson, a firefighter in the coastal city of Hull. Mr. Jackson’s son said he had “mixed emotions about his release,” reported The Daily Mirror. “But what happened at London Bridge goes to show the reality that people can change.” Mr. Gallant has apologized to Mr. Jackson’s family and said he accepted his punishment. “Nobody has the right to take another’s life,” he said in the January statement, adding he had vowed to better himself and “never to turn to violence again.” The father of one of the two victims of the terrorist attack, David Merritt, told The Daily Mirror that the pardon was “fully” deserved. He had turned his life around in prison, Mr. Merritt said, and was close to his son. Mr. Gallant has called Jack Merritt a role model and a friend. The queen can exercise a “royal prerogative of mercy,” which reduces the penalty for a criminal offense, but rarely does so. Pardons for early release are generally recommended by officials in exceptional situations, such as if a prisoner risks his safety to prevent death or serious injury to another. Though the queen signs off on the royal pardon, the decision is ultimately in the hands of the government — in this case the Ministry of Justice — said Dickie Arbiter, a former Buckingham Palace spokesman. “By the time it gets to her, it’s a done deal,” he said. “She just rubber-stamps it.” Though he was not privy to the decision-making, Mr. Arbiter said that Mr. Gallant had risked his own life while out of prison for the day to protect others, which was likely to have helped his case. “He could have just walked away and ignored it, but he didn’t.” Pardons for those convicted of murder are highly unusual. Before Mr. Gallant, the last significant pardon for murder was given to Sean O’Callaghan, a paramilitary member of the Irish Republican Army who was freed in 1996.']",Queen Elizabeth II approved a rare form of clemency for an inmate who used a whale tusk to help end a deadly terrorist attack near London Bridge last year.
"For Young Rohingya Brides, Marriage Means a Perilous, Deadly Crossing",2020-10-17,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — Haresa counted the days by the moon, waxing and waning over the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Her days on the trawler, crammed into a space so tight that she could not even stretch her legs, bled into weeks, the weeks into months. “People struggled like they were fish flopping around,” Ms. Haresa, 18, said of the other refugees on the boat. “Then they stopped moving.” Dozens of bodies were thrown overboard, some beaten and some starved, survivors said. Ms. Haresa’s aunt died, then her brother.  Six full moons after she boarded the fishing boat in Bangladesh with hopes that human traffickers would ferry her to Malaysia for an arranged marriage, Ms. Haresa, who goes by one name, and almost 300 other Rohingya refugees found sanctuary in Indonesia last month. Her sister, 21, died two days after the boat landed. Banished from their homes in Myanmar and crammed into refugee settlements in neighboring Bangladesh, thousands of Rohingya have taken the perilous boat crossing to Malaysia, where many from the persecuted minority group toil as undocumented workers. Hundreds have died along the way.  Most of those now undertaking the trip, like Ms. Haresa, are girls and young women from refugee camps in Bangladesh whose parents have promised them in marriage to Rohingya men in Malaysia. Two-thirds of those who landed in Indonesia last month with Ms. Haresa were female. Amira Bibi and her family escaped their native Rakhine State, in Myanmar’s far west, as the military torched hundreds of Rohingya villages three years ago. The fourth of nine siblings, she said she knew her place in life.  “My parents are getting old and my brothers are with their own families,” she said. “How long are my parents going to bear the burden of me?” Through the matchmaking of a cousin in Malaysia who works as a grass-cutter, Ms. Bibi’s parents found a fiancé for her. She asked for details about the man but none were provided, apart from his name, she said. After surviving more than six months at sea in a failed attempt to reach him, Ms. Bibi spoke from Indonesia with her fiancé a country away. The phone call lasted two minutes. “He sounded young,” she said. That is the extent of what she knows about him. Ms. Bibi initially told staff from the United Nations refugee agency that she was 15 years old, but later amended her age to 18. Child marriage is common among the Rohingya, especially in rural populations. Mostly stateless, the Muslim minority has been subjected to an apartheidlike existence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Over the past few years, waves of pogroms have pushed the Rohingya across the border to Bangladesh, where human traffickers prey on the young and desperate in the refugee camps, along with their families. The flow of people has surged since 2017, when more than three-quarters of a million Rohingya fled an ethnic cleansing campaign in Myanmar. With the coronavirus pandemic tightening borders, the journey by sea has gotten even more difficult. For months this year, boats laden with hundreds of Rohingya migrants drifted at sea, unable to find a safe haven. The authorities in Thailand and Malaysia repeatedly pushed them away. Fishermen in Aceh, on the tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, are among the few who have welcomed the Rohingya. A battered trawler with around 100 refugees landed in June, followed by the larger boat on Sept. 7. “The question is how Southeast Asia as a region responds to this humanitarian crisis on its doorstep,” said Indrika Ratwatte, the director for Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations refugee agency. The Bangladeshi government, struggling with its own vulnerable population amid the pandemic, has threatened to relocate thousands of Rohingya from the camps to a cyclone-prone islet in the Bay of Bengal. The silty island was uninhabited until the Bangladeshi Navy forced about 300 Rohingya — many of them women and children — to shelter there this summer, when their attempt to sail to Malaysia ended after months at sea. Earlier this month, several Rohingya died in clashes between different gangs in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, which is considered the largest settlement of refugees in the world. Some women say they venture out as little as possible to use public latrines for fear of sexual violence. Shamsun Nahar, 17, said she was desperate to leave the camps, even though she had heard the stories of how dangerous the crossing could be. Her father, a cleric, found her a match, a man from the same village in Rakhine who is working as a carpenter in Malaysia. “I talked to him on a video call, and I liked him from every angle,” Ms. Nahar said of their brief courtship by phone. “He was not too big, not too small. He looked good.” Her fiancé was to pay $4,500 for her passage, Ms. Nahar said. The spot she occupied for months on the boat was near the engine, so noisy that she could not hear others’ voices.  The smugglers and brokers, both Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, beat them with plastic pipes, she said. Food was served on a plastic sheet smeared with remnants from the previous weeks, shrouding every meal with a putrid smell. “I am safe now, but I am separated from my family and my fiancé,” Ms. Nahar said after arriving in Indonesia last month. “What will happen next? I do not know.” Although previous waves of Rohingya who landed in Indonesia have mostly made their way to Malaysia, only a few from this year’s crossings have been able to unite with their families or future husbands. When Naemot Shah married his wife, Majuma Bibi, he was 14 and she was 12. The roofs of their childhood houses in Rakhine touched, he said, as close as could be. In 2014, Mr. Shah paid human smugglers to take him from Rakhine to Malaysia, a 28-day journey that nearly killed him, he said. His daughter was only six months old when he left. Three years later, his family fled to Bangladesh after the Myanmar military’s campaign of killings, rapes and forced displacement against the Rohingya. From a refugee camp in Bangladesh, Mr. Shah’s wife pleaded with him to pay for her and their daughter to join him in Malaysia. Knowing how risky the trip was, he refused. But his wife, whom Mr. Shah described as “very clever,” quietly saved the money that he sent her from his job as a construction worker. In late March, she and her daughter boarded a fishing trawler bound, they hoped, for where her husband lived. “I was very upset that they went without my permission,” Mr. Shah said. As news of mass drownings reached him, he assumed his family had died at sea. But in June, Mr. Shah, 24, heard that a boat had landed in Indonesia. Scanning the crowds on a video, he recognized his wife and daughter. “I never felt such happiness as the day I found out they were alive,” Mr. Shah said. Other Rohingya in Malaysia have taken second or third wives, he said. But he will not. Instead, he traveled to Indonesia to reunite with his wife and daughter. “I will stick to one wife,” Mr. Shah said. “She traveled all this way, suffered this difficult time, for me.”']","Girls and young women from refugee camps in Bangladesh, promised to men they have never met, are undertaking the dangerous journey to Malaysia to join them."
A top Palestinian official is in critical condition.,2020-10-18,By Adam Rasgon,"['Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, was in critical condition on Monday after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. Mr. Erekat, 65, was placed in a medically induced coma and put on a ventilator, according to the Israeli hospital where he was being treated. The Hadassah-Ein Kerem hospital also said that treating Mr. Erekat was an “enormous challenge” as he is the recipient of a lung transplant and is immunocompromised. He is also fighting a bacterial infection in addition to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Mr. Erekat, who is the secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Executive Committee, tested positive for the virus earlier this month. His wife, Neamh Erekat, is also infected, but her condition is improving, Palestinian officials said. Mr. Erekat, who has long supported nonviolence and the two-state solution, has been intimately involved in Palestinian politics and Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for decades. He was a central member of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991 and has served as a close aide to Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Erekat has also been one of the loudest Palestinian voices rejecting the Trump administration’s policies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ']",
Latest Clash Between China and Taiwan: A Fistfight in Fiji,2020-10-19,By Javier C. Hernández,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — It was supposed to be a quiet diplomatic event at a stylish beachside hotel in Fiji. Instead, a reception hosted this month by Taiwan officials in Suva, the capital of Fiji, gave way to a fistfight between officials representing China and Taiwan, in the latest example of rising tensions between the two governments. Officials in Taipei and Beijing on Monday offered competing accounts of the altercation after reports about the clash spread widely on social media. They accused each other of initiating the feud and causing injuries. Taiwan said the Chinese government was trying to surveil its staff and guests. Beijing said its officials were carrying out normal duties, and complained that a cake at the event was decorated to look like Taiwan’s flag. At the heart of the issue is a longstanding dispute over the status of Taiwan, a self-governing island of 24 million people that China claims as its territory. Fears of a military conflict have grown as Beijing has increased the frequency of live-fire drills and adopted a more bellicose tone. China has led a concerted effort in recent years to undercut Taiwan’s influence on the global stage, including in the Pacific. As part of that campaign, Beijing has poached several allies of Taiwan in the region, despite objections from the United States and other governments. Those tensions spilled over at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva on Oct. 8, when Taiwan hosted a reception to celebrate its national day before an audience of Fijian officials, scholars and nonprofit workers. (Fiji does not have official relations with Taipei.) According to Taiwan’s foreign ministry, a pair of Chinese diplomats showed up at the reception uninvited and sought to photograph guests. Beijing has deployed such tactics — turning up at events, taking photographs of people — in recent years to intimidate its rivals and those who support them. When Taiwanese officials tried to block the Chinese diplomats, the visitors turned violent, according to the ministry. They beat a Taiwanese official so severely that the official was hospitalized, the ministry said. Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Monday called the actions of the Chinese officials a provocation and said it would work to strengthen security for government workers overseas. In a statement, the ministry said it “strongly condemns the serious violation of the rule of law and civilized norms by the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Fiji.” The Chinese government disputed that account, saying Taiwan officials had acted “provocatively” and injured one of its diplomats during the scuffle. The Chinese embassy did not explain why its diplomats were at the reception, saying in a statement only that they were “carrying out their official duties” in a public area. Beijing made clear that it saw the reception as a political threat. While Fiji, an archipelago in the South Pacific, is a longtime ally of Beijing, Taiwan maintains a trade office in Suva and has sought to raise its profile by investing in education and agriculture. “There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an integral part of China,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Monday. He called the image on the cake at the event a “fake national flag.” “Taiwan’s move is intended to create ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’ internationally,” he said. In a statement on Tuesday, the police in Fiji said they would drop an investigation into the dispute because it was “being handled at the diplomatic level as agreed to by all parties involved.” The statement referred only to a complaint by officials from the Chinese Embassy; it did not mention Taiwan’s grievances. The incident resurfaced concerns about China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has stepped up efforts to defend the country’s reputation abroad during the coronavirus pandemic, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has badly damaged China’s image. Chinese emissaries have increasingly practiced what is known as “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, named for two ultrapatriotic Chinese films. But their strident defenses of Chinese policies and attacks on rivals have sometimes backfired, weakening China’s efforts to counter American influence and expand its military and economic power. Wang Ting-yu, a legislator in Taiwan who specializes in foreign affairs, said the dispute in Fiji showed the excesses of China’s assertive approach. “China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy is a mad dog that bites arbitrarily,” Mr. Wang said in an interview. “The biggest problem in China now is that under Xi Jinping’s rule, their diplomats have turned to seeking private revenge. They have disregarded their country’s diplomatic interests to follow the internal orders of the leaders.” In mainland China, the incident stoked an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and criticism of Taiwan. By Monday evening, the scuffle in Fiji was one of the most popular topics on Weibo, a microblogging site. Chinese analysts defended the country’s approach, saying an increasingly hostile international environment meant that Beijing had to act forcefully. “China is now faced with a pack of wolves, including the Taiwan authorities constantly creating all kinds of troubles in the international community,” Song Zhongping, an independent military analyst based in Hong Kong, said in an interview. In recent months, Beijing has increased military activities in the strait that separates the mainland from Taiwan and promoted propaganda to signal that China will go to war if necessary to assert control of Taiwan. Taiwan has sought closer ties with the United States, welcoming Trump administration officials in recent months for high-level visits to the island, angering Beijing. Beijing has intensified its efforts to block symbols of Taiwan’s soft power and de facto independence, denouncing the island’s flag, or events like the national day celebration as illegitimate. “Talk about squeezing Taiwan’s international space,” Margaret Lewis, a law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey who studies China and Taiwan, said in an interview. “It’s sad to see even a celebratory reception at a hotel in Fiji is declared a space by the Chinese government that cannot have freedom of assembly.” Amy Chang Chien and Albee Zhang contributed research.']","Two mainland diplomats attended an event, uninvited, and took offense at symbols of Taiwan — including a flag on a cake.

"Jacinda Ardern, Hero to Liberals Abroad, Is Validated at Home",2020-10-17,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Her face has graced magazine covers all over the world. Her leadership style has been studied by Harvard scholars. Her science-and-solidarity approach to the coronavirus has drawn legions of fans in other countries who write to say, “I wish you were here.” The global left (along with a chunk of the center) has fallen hard for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, giving her a prodigious presence for a leader who manages a smaller population than many mayors do. Now her country’s voters have come around as well. On Saturday, Ms. Ardern, 40, was well on her way to a second term. With most of the votes counted, her Labour Party was projected to win a clear majority in Parliament, with around 64 of 120 seats and 49 percent of the vote — its strongest showing by far since New Zealand overhauled its electoral system in the mid-1990s. Riding a wave of support for her “go hard, go early” response to the coronavirus, which has effectively been stamped out in the country, Ms. Ardern has now cemented her position as New Zealand’s most popular prime minister in generations, if not ever. “We will govern as we campaigned — positively,” Ms. Ardern said in her acceptance speech in Auckland Saturday night, adding: “We will build back better from the Covid crisis. This is our opportunity.” The sizable win reflects a rapid rise to political stardom. Three years ago, Ms. Ardern was a last-minute choice to lead the Labour Party, and in her first term she often struggled to fulfill her progressive promises like making housing more affordable, eliminating child poverty and attacking climate change. But after managing the responses to the Christchurch terrorist attacks, the White Island volcano eruption and a pandemic — not to mention the birth of her first child — she has become a global standard-bearer for a progressive politics that defines itself as compassionate and competent in crisis. “The anti-Trump?” That’s what Vogue called her. “Saint Jacinda?” That one comes from the usually staid Financial Times, while a New York Times editorial last year carried the headline “America Deserves a Leader as Good as Jacinda Ardern.” In New Zealand — a small-c conservative or small-c center kind of country where the love for Ms. Ardern had generally lagged behind her profile abroad — she now has a mandate more in line with her international adoration. If Labour gains at least 50 percent of the vote, it will be the first time since 1951 that a party has won an outright majority in New Zealand. What’s unknown is whether that will help deliver the major policy successes that have eluded her. “She has significant political capital,” said Jennifer Curtin, the director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland. “She’s going to have to fulfill her promises with more substance.” Ms. Ardern has said little about her legislative plans. She won primarily with a pandemic-fueled surge in support, as New Zealand recently declared community transmission of the coronavirus eliminated for a second time. The remote Pacific Island nation of five million people, which has tallied only 25 coronavirus deaths, now looks and feels mostly normal: A recent rugby match between Australia and New Zealand in Wellington, the capital, drew 30,000 fans. Given such progress when other countries are seeing coronavirus cases increase, Ms. Ardern sailed through her campaign with the slogan “Let’s keep moving.” Her opponent, Judith Collins, a lawyer and member of the center-right National Party, tried to dent her credibility by arguing that the virus had re-emerged in August on Ms. Ardern’s watch because of some kind of breach in protocol at the border or at a quarantine facility. At a handful of debates, Ms. Collins sought to portray Ms. Ardern as untrustworthy, more shine than steady leader. In the final days of the race, she labeled the prime minister a liar. “She told us on June 23 everybody was being tested. What a lie,” Ms. Collins said at a campaign event this week. “When she said she went hard and fast, she went slow and pathetic. And she lied to us about what was happening.” Polls showed that Ms. Collins never gained much traction with lines of attack like these. But even as Ms. Ardern glided to another term, her next government will confront an unfamiliar set of challenges. New Zealanders have historically liked their politics down the middle. Coalition governments are the norm, and Ms. Ardern’s first term was marked by a partnership with the populist, center-right New Zealand First Party, which was projected to win no seats this time around.  Now Labour will be able to govern on its own with the support of the Greens (they were projected to win around 10 seats) and the Maori Party (one seat), giving her more leeway to move left. The core decision that Ms. Ardern faces is how far to push, with which proposals, at a time when the economy is still threatened by the pandemic. In a parliamentary democracy like New Zealand’s, legislation can move quickly, which means the success or failure of new policies will fall squarely on her shoulders. “If you can’t blame the minor party for putting the hand brake on, then you better make sure you deliver,” said Richard Shaw, a politics professor at Massey University in Palmerston North. One option would be to abandon her usual preference for consensus and reach as far and fast as possible. The more likely choice, observers say, is that she will recognize that she won in part with center-right voters, and will linger in the center as she angles for a third or fourth term — a Labour dynasty. At her core, Professor Curtin said, “she’s a reformist rather than a radical.” Morgan Godfery, a writer and commentator who specializes in political issues affecting the Indigenous Maori people, said Ms. Ardern reflected the political environment from which she arose. “The Labour Party is something of a contradiction at the moment, because they are more popular than at any point since the 1940s, but they are more cautious,” he said. “They don’t seem quite sure on how they’re going to use that popularity. There’s very little new thinking on housing, tax, Maori issues.” During the campaign, Ms. Ardern ruled out a wealth tax favored by the Greens, which would require individuals with wealth of more than 1 million New Zealand dollars, or about $665,000, to pay 1 percent above that threshold as tax. Those whose wealth exceeds 2 million dollars would pay 2 percent. Asked for one new idea to stimulate the post-pandemic economy during the second debate in late September, she provided a conventional response. “Invest in our people,” she said. “Make apprenticeships free. Make vocational training free. Get them into vocational jobs that grow the economy.” Professor Curtin said that in many ways Ms. Ardern’s response to the pandemic’s economic impact — emphasizing infrastructure, small businesses and exporters — reflected traditional thinking that overlooked industries, such as health care and child care, that could do more for the economy and encourage greater equality. “She’s said she’s a feminist,” Professor Curtin said, “but she’s been careful and perhaps a little too slow in addressing the material well-being of many women in New Zealand, particularly poorer women or older women.” Oliver Hartwich, executive director of the New Zealand Initiative, a center-right think tank, said Ms. Ardern had been a more effective communicator than policy strategist. “When it comes to P.R., when it comes to her daily press conference in the Covid crisis — taking the people along and explaining what she wants to do and what she wants to achieve, there’s no one who comes even close to what Jacinda does. She’s phenomenal and a genuine talent,” Mr. Hartwich said. “Where she’s not good,” he added, “is on the details of policy, on the details of strategy, of execution, of implementation, of evaluations, of all the normal things that come along with government.” For many voters this week, though, Ms. Ardern’s clear skills in managing crises were more than enough. Steph Cole, 58, a motel owner in Hamilton, said she usually cast her ballot for the National Party. She voted Labour for the first time, she said, after seeing how Ms. Ardern handled the Christchurch attacks and the pandemic, unifying the country in times of life and death. “I just think Jacinda Ardern epitomizes everything a good leader should be,” Ms. Cole said.

"In Shift for Church, Pope Francis Voices Support for Same-Sex Civil Unions",2020-10-21,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pope Francis expressed support for same-sex civil unions in remarks revealed in a documentary film that premiered on Wednesday, a significant break from his predecessors that staked out new ground for the church in its recognition of gay people. The remarks, coming from the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, had the potential to shift debates about the legal status of same-sex couples in nations around the globe and unsettle bishops worried that the unions threaten what the church considers traditional marriage — between one man and one woman. “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,” Francis said in the documentary, “Francesco,” which debuted at the Rome Film Festival, reiterating his view that gay people are children of God. “I stood up for that.” Many gay Catholics and their allies outside the church welcomed the pope’s remarks, though Francis’ opposition to gay marriage within the church remained absolute. His conservative critics within the church hierarchy, and especially in the conservative wing of the church in the United States, who have for years accused him of diluting church doctrine, saw the remarks as a reversal of church teaching. “The pope’s statement clearly contradicts what has been the longstanding teaching of the church about same-sex unions,” said Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., adding that the remarks needed to be clarified. There was little doubt that Francis, recorded on camera, made the statements during his pontificate. But there was confusion on Wednesday about when he had said them and to whom. The Vatican dismissed them as old news.  Francis has a tendency for making off-the-cuff public remarks, a trait that maddens both supporters and critics alike. The comments shown in the film are likely to generate exactly the sort of discussion the pope has repeatedly sought to foster on issues once considered forbidden in the church’s culture wars. Francis had already drastically shifted the tone of the church on questions related to homosexuality, but he has done little on policy and not changed teaching for a church that sees its future growth in the Southern Hemisphere, where the clerical hierarchy is generally less tolerant of homosexuality. The remark “in no way affects doctrine,” the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest and close ally of Francis, told the television channel of the Italian bishops conference on Wednesday evening. The remarks in the documentary were in keeping with Francis’ general support for gay people, but were perhaps his most specific and prominent on the issue of civil unions, which even traditionally Catholic nations like Italy, Ireland and Argentina have permitted in recent years. The director of the documentary, Evgeny Afineevsky, told The New York Times that Francis had made the remarks directly to him for the film. He did not reply to a question about when the remarks were made by the pope. The Vatican and allies of Francis publicly cast doubt on the notion that the pope said the remarks to Mr. Afineevsky, asserting that the pontiff instead had made them to a Mexican journalist, Valentina Alazraki, in an interview in the Vatican in May 2019. Earlier on Wednesday, Ms. Alazraki had told The Times that she did not recall the pope making the comments to her. In 2010, as Argentina was on the verge of approving gay marriage, Francis, then cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires, supported the idea of civil unions for gay couples. As pope in 2014, he told the Corriere della Sera, Italy’s largest newspaper, that nations legalizing civil unions did so mostly to give same-sex partners legal rights and health care benefits and that he couldn’t express a blanket position. “You have to see the different cases and evaluate them in their variety,” he said then. But Francis’ remarks in the documentary, explicitly supporting civil unions as pope and on camera, had the potential for much greater impact on the debate over the recognition of gay couples by the church. “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family,” Francis says at another point in the documentary. “They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it.” Church teaching does not consider being gay a sin, but it does consider homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered” and by extension holds that a homosexual orientation is “objectively disordered.” Church doctrine also explicitly states that marriage is between a man and a woman, a teaching Francis unwaveringly supports. Francis’ predecessors had also expressed their opposition, though, to civil unions. In 2003, under the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, the church’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, its doctrinal watchdog then led by the future Pope Benedict XVI, issued “Considerations regarding proposals to give legal recognition to unions between homosexual persons.” The document read, “The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.” Those views were not incorporated into church teaching, but bishops and some bishops conferences, which can be politically influential in certain countries, often opposed civil unions as a threat to the church’s view of traditional marriage. Advocates within the church for civil unions seized on the pope’s remarks in the documentary as a major blow to those efforts and as a breakthrough in the church’s long-painful relationship with gay people. “This is a major step forward in the church’s relationship with L.G.B.T.Q. people,” said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest who has written a book on how to make gay Catholics feel more welcome in the Church, and who has met with the pope and served as a consultor for the Vatican’s Secretariat for Communications. “It’s going to be harder for bishops to say that same-sex civil unions are a threat against marriage,” he said. “This is unmistakable support.” Some of the pope’s most consistent critics inside the Catholic hierarchy agreed that the pope seemed to support civil unions, and they were vexed by it. “The church cannot support the acceptance of objectively immoral relationships,” said Bishop Tobin of Providence. But the pope’s remarks do not mean he has altered church teaching on the subject, and Francis has a track record of making encouraging remarks for gay people. Starting in 2013, on a papal flight back from Brazil, his openness to gay people stunned the faithful inside the church, and secular fans outside of it, who were more accustomed to doctrinaire scoldings about homosexuality and gay marriage. “Who am I to judge,” Francis famously answered when asked about a supposedly gay priest on that flight. In his landmark 2016 document on the theme of family — titled “Amoris Laetitia,” or “The Joy of Love” — Francis rejected same-sex marriage, yet called on priests to be welcoming to people in nontraditional relationships, such as gay people, single parents and unmarried straight couples who live together. He also once told Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean sexual abuse survivor and gay person whom he befriended, and who is featured in the documentary, that “God made you this way and loves you this way, and the pope loves you this way.” But under Francis, the church also rejected what it cast as the notion that individuals can choose their gender, and he also told the leaders of seminaries that it was better not to admit gay candidates. “If you have the slightest doubt, it’s better to refuse them,” he once said. “Better that they live the ministry or their consecrated life than that they live a double life.” Critics pointed out that his church’s rules forced gay priests into a double life. But those who support the church being more welcoming of gay couples were pleased by the pope’s remarks in the film. “A pope sets the tone for the church and what he is doing is signaling to bishops and church leaders that a welcome for gay and lesbian couples has to go forward,” said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of L.G.B.T. Catholics. He noted that in the United States, the Supreme Court was poised to weigh whether Philadelphia may exclude a Catholic agency that does not work with same-sex couples from the city’s foster-care system. In Germany’s more liberal Catholic hierarchy, bishops had built momentum in their push to bless same-sex unions. Those deliberations and others, he hoped, would be influenced by the pope’s remarks. “They will ripple through the church and legislatures and courts and the personal and spiritual lives of Catholics who have been waiting for years and decades for an affirming word from their church leader,” Mr. DeBernardo said. “The significance is immense.” Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting from Washington, and Ruth Graham from Warner, N.H.']","The comments, shown in a new documentary, are the strongest yet from a pontificate that has taken a more tolerant and inclusive tone."
‘We Cannot Kill That Little Chihuahua’: Actor’s Puppy Crusade Shines Light on Global Trade,2020-10-21,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['Jean-Claude Van Damme has cracked the skulls and bones of bad guys, escaped from prison to find his dying brother and rescued a woman from a gang of thugs onscreen. And this week, the action movie star helped save a puppy in real life. Mr. Van Damme barreled into an international kerfuffle over a Chihuahua named Raya, who was in danger of being euthanized because, Norwegian officials said, she had entered the country on a fake Pet Passport. Mr. Van Damme’s puppy crusade became a hit on social media. Apparently, amid a coronavirus pandemic that is roaring back just as many countries were tentatively emerging from various levels of lockdown, it was the feel-good, tough-guy-has-a-tender-side tale that many people craved. Animal rights activists said that Raya’s plight most likely exposed a ring of East European breeders trafficking dogs to Western Europe. Dog breeding in Eastern Europe is cheaper and far less regulated, and animals like Raya can be claimed as purebred and vaccinated without real documentation of their origins. They are then often sold online at inflated prices. The 3-month-old puppy’s ordeal began in September, when she was purchased by a Norwegian man from Bulgarians who transported her to Oslo, Norway’s capital. The new owner took her to an Oslo veterinarian, who became suspicious about Raya’s documentation because of the date of her rabies vaccination. According to the date on the passport, she had been vaccinated at 2 months old, but a dog must be at least 3 months old before it can be vaccinated. The vet promptly informed the authorities. Within a week, Raya was apprehended by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and placed in quarantine. After concluding that she had, indeed, been brought into the country on a fake passport, they informed her owner, Alexey Iversen, that the puppy, which they described as an undocumented arrival, would be put to death. “There were several issues with the documents, and I also understand that this is also my fault, as I have not checked the dog’s documents properly,” Mr. Iversen wrote online. But he added that “the dog is innocent, and I think the punishment does not correspond to the crime.” After battling unsuccessfully with the authorities to free Raya, Mr. Iversen contacted a lawyer, who managed to delay the euthanasia date to October, he said. Mr. Iversen also started a petition online to save the dog’s life. Somehow, the Belgian-born Mr. Van Damme — known as “The Muscles From Brussels” for films like “Missing in Action,” “Kickboxer” and “Hard Target” — became aware of Raya’s story, and he stepped in. In a Facebook live video posted on Sunday, a bespectacled Mr. Van Damme implored his more than 27 million followers — and others on Instagram and Twitter — to sign the petition to save the Chihuahua. “We cannot kill that little Chihuahua. It’s bad luck for the future, it’s bad luck for Covid, it’s bad luck for all that stuff,” Mr. Van Damme said in the video, while clutching his own Chihuahua by its tiny barrel chest. Mr. Van Damme really, really loves dogs. He has donated tens of thousands of dollars to animal rights organizations, rescued dozens of strays from around the world, once scrapped a tour to be with one of them (named Scarface) when it was sick, and has said that feeling a dog’s beating heart beside him helps him fall asleep at night. Nearly 200,000 people reacted to the actor’s Facebook video, in which Mr. Van Damme offered to pay any fees associated with saving Raya’s life. Shortly afterward, the authorities told Mr. Iversen that the dog would be returned to Bulgaria. But it is unclear whether she and Mr. Iversen will eventually be reunited. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority could not immediately be reached for comment. Yavor Gechev, the representative for the Bulgarian office of Four Paws, an international animal welfare group that became involved in Raya’s case, said that hers was not a unique situation. “It seems that this, indeed, is a very lucrative business,” he said, adding, “This is a serious issue for the European Union.” Mr. Gechev said that the Bulgarians who had sold Raya claimed she had been bred in Varna, a port city in Bulgaria infamous for its unregulated breeding industry. He said a veterinarian there, who has since been accused of wide-scale forgery of dog passports, provided Raya’s documents. In Norway, the puppy was probably sold to Mr. Iversen for up to 10 times her original price, Mr. Gechev said. Animals bred and sold in Western Europe can bring in more than 1,000 euros (about $1,180) each, which fuels the trade in illegal documents, he said. “I believe we are talking here about thousands of dogs being exported on an annual basis,” he added. All animals in the European Union need documentation to cross borders. In 2018, a cow named Penka was sentenced to death after it wandered from Bulgaria into Serbia. Like Raya, she ultimately survived thanks to another celebrity, Paul McCartney, who promoted a petition on Twitter to save her. Mr. Iversen, who would communicate only through Facebook, described Raya as “a very sweet, active and kind dog” who was terrified of being alone, and who liked to sleep in his bed and be carried in a bag. “My family and I are dreaming about getting our family member, Raya, back,” he wrote.  He thanked Mr. Van Damme not only for saving his dog’s life, but also for restoring “many people’s hopes in humanity and kindness.” Mr. Van Damme could not be reached for comment. In the past, he has melded his love of animals with his onscreen fame. In April, he released a short YouTube film made with his family, in which he rescues canines using a series of karate tricks. “Even my first ancestors, like Jean-Claude ‘Bam Wam’ Van Damme the Fifth, help the path of the dogs of the world,” he says tongue-in-cheek in the clip, as the camera pans over a painting of Mr. Van Damme in a Renaissance-era ruff, with dogs at his feet. “I’m trying to do the same.”']",The action star Jean-Claude Van Damme intervened to save a Bulgarian dog from euthanasia after Norway said it had been imported on a fake passport.
"As Britain edges toward lockdowns, long-held grievances flare up.",2020-10-20,By Mark Landler,"['Britain’s desperate attempt to curb a second wave of the coronavirus has exposed multiple fractures in its politics and society, but perhaps none as jagged as that between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the mayor of Greater Manchester, the country’s second-largest urban area. For days, the mayor, Andy Burnham, has been engaged in a war of words with Mr. Johnson and his ministers over the government’s plan to elevate hard-hit Manchester to the highest level of restrictions. That would shut down pubs, bars and gyms, and forbid all socializing by people from different households. Mr. Burnham says that the restrictions would devastate the city’s economy, and that the central government has not offered adequate financial aid to the people who would lose their jobs during the lockdown. He has been a nearly ubiquitous presence on television, waging a fierce rebellion on behalf of his 2.8 million constituents. “People can’t just be pressurized into it,” Mr. Burnham said of the new restrictions, to Sky News on Monday. “I’m not going to be pressurized into it. And I’m not just going to kind of roll over at the sight of a check.” Mr. Burnham’s resistance is rooted in the long-held grievances of people in the old industrial cities of the north of England toward the politically dominant government sitting in London. But the standoff between Manchester and London also reflects mounting frustration with Mr. Johnson’s erratic, often opaque handling of the pandemic, as well as a dash of ambition and old-fashioned political maneuvering. Mr. Burnham, a 50-year-old native of Liverpool, is a Labour Party stalwart who twice ran unsuccessfully for party leader. Having served as health secretary under Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he traded in his seat in the opposition in 2016 to run for mayor of Greater Manchester, a newly created post.']",
Nigerian Forces Fire on Protesters,2020-10-20,By Shola Lawal,"['LAGOS, Nigeria — Nigerian security forces opened fire Tuesday night at a demonstration in Lagos against police brutality, hitting several people according to witnesses, in a major escalation of the unrest that has gripped the country for two weeks. The extent of the casualties was unclear, but some witnesses reported seeing people who were killed. Videos posted to social media crackled with apparent gunfire and showed people who were wounded and uniformed forces shooting into the air. A police officer who witnessed the episode and spoke on condition of anonymity said that 11 people had been killed. But that report could not be immediately corroborated.  The shooting came toward the end of a day of mounting violence in multiple cities, with the national police deploying riot squads in the capital, Abuja, in Lagos and elsewhere. The unrest spread even after President Muhammadu Buhari attempted to respond to the protesters’ demands by announcing last week that he would disband a special unit of police officers accused of brutalizing people. Adding to the sense of spiraling chaos, officials said about 2,000 inmates had escaped on Monday in a prison break in Benin City, in southern Edo state. After news reports early Tuesday that police had killed two or more people in Lagos, the country’s largest city and economic hub, a crowd set a police station there ablaze. Despite the violence and a curfew declared by the governor of Lagos State, protesters refused to disband, blocking roads and demanding that police officers accused of wanton violence be put on trial. Uniformed forces were deployed to the Lekki Toll Gate area, an upscale suburb of Lagos, where the biggest ongoing protests have been held, largely peacefully, since October 7. Beginning at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday, some of them began firing — shortly after the streetlights unexpectedly went out and security cameras were removed from the scene, witnesses said. A protester streaming the scene live on Instagram, Obianuju Catherine Udeh, a disc jockey who goes by DJ Switch, said she counted seven casualties around her. Sporadic gunfire went on for about an hour. “We’ve already told them we’re not going anywhere,” she said. In front of her, a body lay motionless, and nearby protesters crowded around a man with what appeared to be a gunshot wound in his leg. Demonstrators said they were corralled into one area by fires, with no safe way out. “The whole place is blocked, there are soldiers everywhere and they came in guns blazing,” DJ Switch said, before her livestream suddenly ended. “Are they going to shoot all of us? The only weapon we have is the Nigerian flag.” The governor of Lagos State, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, said that people bent on creating chaos had hijacked the mostly peaceful protests against police brutality — a claim supported by witness accounts of the demonstrations. “Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our state,” the governor said in a statement. After the police station was burned, the governor declared a 4 p.m. curfew, giving people about four hours to get home in an immense metropolitan area with some 14 million people and some of the world’s worst traffic jams. Many people had little hope of complying with the curfew; many others did not try. Protesters in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, have been demanding that the government disband a rogue police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, commonly known as SARS, and that they say particularly robs, tortures and even kills well-dressed young people who the officers think might have money. The crowds have also called for punishment of officers who commit brutality. Last week, President Buhari agreed to dismantle SARS and carry out other police reforms, vowing to “ensure that all those responsible for misconduct are brought to justice.” But the demonstrations have not abated. People note that the government has promised before to do away with SARS, yet it still exists, and they argue that a newly created police unit will just be the same menace in new uniforms. On Monday, Lagos inaugurated a panel of inquiry to investigate allegations of abuse, but proceedings have not begun. Three other states have also made the same move. In the massive prison break, a spokesman for the interior ministry in charge of correctional facilities, Mohammed Manga, said armed crowds had attacked two correctional facilities in Benin City and overpowered guards on duty. He said 1,993 inmates were missing; it was not clear how many inmates were held before the attack. “Most of the inmates held at the centers are convicted criminals serving terms for various criminal offenses, awaiting execution or standing trial for violent crimes,” Mr. Manga said.']","The toll was unclear, but witnesses said several people were shot during  demonstrations against police brutality in Lagos.

"To avoid quarantining students, a school district tries moving them around every 15 minutes.",2020-10-20,By Lucy Tompkins,"['To reduce the number of students sent home to quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus, the Billings Public Schools, the largest school district in Montana, came up with an idea that has public health experts shaking their heads: Reshuffling students in the classroom four times an hour. The strategy is based on the definition of a “close contact” requiring quarantine — being within six feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or more. If the students are moved around within that time, the thinking goes, no one will have had “close contact” and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive. Greg Upham, the superintendent of the 16,500-student school district, said in an interview that contact tracing had become a huge burden for the district, and administrators were looking for a way to ease the burden when they came up with the movement idea. It was not intended to “game the system,” he said, but rather to encourage the staff to be cognizant of the 15-minute window. In an email to administrators last week, Mr. Upham encouraged staff members to “whenever possible, disrupt the 15-minute timeline through movement, distancing, and masking.” Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student. It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said. “That is not an evidence-based practice or sound scientific policy,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been supportive of reopening schools for in-person instruction. The 15-minute, six-foot definition is a guideline for identifying who might be at greater risk of infection, not a hard-and-fast rule about when it can or cannot happen, Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that a person can certainly become infected in less time or from farther away, especially indoors. Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s school of public health, said the 15-minute definition was meant to help contact tracers “effectively and efficiently identify people with the highest risk and target intervention to them.” Kelly Hornby, principal of Billings West High School, wrote in an email to his staff last week that moving students around every few minutes and then returning them to their original desks would help dissipate airborne droplets containing the coronavirus, to the point “where the risk of being contaminated is greatly reduced.” Dr. Fortune disagreed with that idea. “The particles that transmit Covid, they hang out in the air, and they spread through the air, and the aerosols can hang out for a very long time,” she said. “So stirring that air up or moving around from your spot doesn’t really limit your exposure or risk.”']",
"With Covid-19 under control, China’s economy surges ahead.",2020-10-19,By Keith Bradsher,"['As most of the world still struggles with the pandemic, China is showing once again that a fast economic rebound is possible when the virus is brought under control. The Chinese economy surged 4.9 percent in the July-to-September quarter compared with the same months last year, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday. That brings China almost back up to the roughly 6 percent pace of growth that it was reporting before the pandemic. Many of the world’s major economies have climbed quickly out of the depths of a contraction last spring, when shutdowns caused output to fall steeply. But China is the first to report growth that significantly surpasses where it was at this time last year. The vigorous expansion of the Chinese economy means that it is set to dominate global growth — accounting for at least 30 percent of the world’s economic growth this year and in the years to come, Justin Lin Yifu, a cabinet adviser and honorary dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said at a recent government news conference in Beijing. Chinese companies are making up a greater share of the world’s exports, manufacturing consumer electronics, personal protection equipment and other goods in high demand during the pandemic. At the same time, China is now buying more iron ore from Brazil, more corn and pork from the United States, and more palm oil from Malaysia. That has partly softened the impact of the pandemic on some industries.']",
"Emiratis Land in Israel, Firming New Ties and Angering Palestinians",2020-10-20,By David M. Halbfinger and Adam Rasgon,"['JERUSALEM — Diplomats from the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday made their first official trip to Israel since the countries normalized relations in August, and the two sides signed pacts deepening their ties, including allowing their citizens to travel from one country to the other without visas — Israel’s first such waiver with an Arab state. Confined to the Ben-Gurion Airport tarmac as a coronavirus-related precaution, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Obaid Hamaid Al Tayer, the U.A.E.’s minister of state for financial affairs — along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin of the United States, which brokered the new diplomatic relationship — marked the milestone under a temporary canopy, with an Etihad Boeing 787 Dreamliner providing the backdrop. “Today we are making history,” Mr. Netanyahu said, assuring his guests that “the enthusiasm for this peace agreement among our peoples is enormous, it’s real, it’s broad, it’s deep.” “These ties create a tremendous foundation for economic growth, opportunity, innovation and prosperity,” Mr. Mnuchin added. But some aspects of the bilateral pacts announced Tuesday further antagonized the Palestinians, who were enraged by the Emiratis’ decision to bring their below-the-radar cooperation with Israel into the open with formal diplomatic relations. The Palestinians had long counted on Arab solidarity to deny Israel such normalization until they had achieved statehood. Tuesday’s visa-waiver agreement, in particular, frustrated Palestinians who pointed out that Israel would now let Emiratis visit Israel and Jerusalem with ease, while still forcing residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to submit to an often insurmountable permitting process, including extensive security checks, before gaining access to Muslim holy sites like the Aqsa mosque compound. “I need a permit issued by the Israeli military to visit Jerusalem,” Salem Barahmeh, who leads the Palestinian Institute for Public Diplomacy, wrote on Twitter. “The city I was born in. But now an Emirati can go visa-free because two warmongering, human rights abusing regimes made a deal together for weapons. Does this sound just to you?” Israel has visa waivers with many European and South American countries. But Israeli tourists must have visas even to visit the nation’s closest ally, the United States.  The Emirati delegation also formally asked on Tuesday to establish an embassy in Tel Aviv. Israel is expected to do the same in Abu Dhabi. Another bilateral agreement signed on Tuesday paves the way for direct flights between Tel Aviv and the Emirates, which would promote commercial ties between two of the region’s wealthiest countries and open a vital new hub for Israelis traveling to the Far East. Other pacts were described as providing protections for investors and promoting scientific and technological cooperation. Trump administration officials also announced that the governments of the United States, the U.A.E. and Israel will create a $3 billion investment fund, to be called the Abraham Fund, that would seek to promote private investment in Israel, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa. One of its first planned projects is the revival of an oil pipeline across Israel from Eilat, on the Red Sea, to Ashkelon, on the Mediterranean, to carry Emirati oil bound for European customers. It would allow the oil to bypass the Suez Canal, lowering energy prices and speeding shipments, said Adam Boehler, chief executive of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, a government agency. The “Med-Red” pipeline was built decades ago to move Iranian oil, Mr. Boehler said, before the Islamic revolution of 1979 turned Israel and Iran from allies into bitter enemies. The other initial project would be to “modernize the checkpoints” for the roughly 2.7 million Palestinians living under Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, Mr. Boehler said. Israel has already upgraded a number of key crossings with biometric scanners and other technology, cutting the time it takes to transit those bottlenecks from hours to minutes. In an interview, Mr. Boehler said that Mr. Netanyahu had pressed him about the idea over lunch recently and had made checkpoint improvements “No. 1 on his list” of recommendations for the new fund. But that announcement drew harsh denunciations from Palestinian officials who said it meant that Emirati and American money would be used to reinforce Israel’s military rule. The news appeared to heighten Palestinians’ feelings of betrayal by the U.A.E. “It is a stamp of approval for the Israeli occupation’s continuation,” said Ahmad Majdalani, the Palestinian Authority’s minister of social development. “It’s a gift that will encourage Israel to continue its unjust actions.” Emiratis have insisted that their normalization of relations with Israel would ultimately prove helpful to the Palestinian cause. But Mr. Majdalani pointedly said that Emirati-funded checkpoint upgrades would not bring peace any closer. “We are not fooled by what they are doing,” he said. Mr. Boehler defended spending to improve checkpoints, where on a normal day tens or even hundreds of thousands of Palestinians cross into Israeli territory for work or medical appointments. “If you represent the Palestinian people and we can save 200,000 or 400,000 hours, every single day, that’s a huge economic cost,” he said. “That makes a big difference. And it makes a big difference to people in the West Bank.” Mr. Boehler said that the fund would also “look at investments that benefit directly the resilience of people in the West Bank.” In a statement, the Emirati minister of state, Ahmed Al Sayegh, said the fund was intended to “put the well-being of people first, regardless of their creed or identity.”']","In the first official U.A.E. visit to Israel since the countries normalized relations, they agreed to ease travel and upgrade West Bank checkpoints.

Landslide in Vietnam Kills at Least 20 Military Personnel,2020-10-19,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['A landslide in Vietnam on Sunday killed at least 20 military personnel and left two missing, the local news media reported, following weeks of torrential rains and flooding that have devastated parts of the country and killed dozens of people. The mudslide began in the early hours of Sunday morning and leveled the soldiers’ barracks in Huong Phung Commune, in the central coastal province of Quang Tri. “There have been four to five landslides, exploding like bombs, and it feels like the whole mountain is about to collapse,” Ha Ngoc Duong, the vice chairman of the commune, told VnExpress, an online state-run news outlet. Mr. Duong added that the mudslides were likely to continue, hindering search-and-rescue efforts. The deaths could be the country’s largest military loss in peacetime, officials said, and came just days after another landslide killed 13 people, most of whom were also members of the military, in neighboring Thua Thien Hue. “We’ve never lost so many military members, including two generals and high-ranking officials, in natural disasters,” the government said in a statement. Pham Tan An, a survivor of the Sunday mudslide, told VnExpress he felt “completely powerless” after seeing his colleagues buried beneath the rubble. “For us who were lucky enough to survive, it’s really heartbreaking to know our 22 teammates didn’t make it. Now, when closing my eyes, all I can think of is us enjoying a meal together,” he told the news outlet. Rapid development and deforestation have exacerbated the damage caused by seasonal flooding. Floods in 2018 killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. “Vietnam has the perfect storm,” Adam Switzer, a sedimentologist at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said of Vietnam’s susceptibility to flooding and landslides. “It has seas, rainfall, it has very heavily vegetated steep slopes, and it has seismic activity.” Extreme downpours have pummeled Vietnam since early October, causing some of the worst flooding in years. More severe rain is expected this week. In Quang Tri Province alone, close to 50 people are dead or missing. More than 12,000 residents have been evacuated because of the floods, which have inundated nearly 45,000 homes, the state news media reported. Seventy schools have also been submerged beneath the floodwaters in areas along the Thach Han River in Quang Tri, according to the government newspaper VGP News. So far, the floods have cost Vietnam around $520,000, Vo Van Hung, the chairman of the Quang Tri People’s Committee, told the paper. “We need to understand why this happened,” said Mr. Switzer, the sedimentologist, who warned that effects of climate change could cause similarly devastating floods in the future, “so that when the next landslide happens, we are better prepared.” Chau Doan contributed reporting.']","Search-and-rescue efforts were underway after a landslide in the central province of Quang Tri, resulting in what may be the country’s greatest military loss in peacetime."
Evo Morales Is Out. His Socialist Project Lives On.,2020-10-19,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — In a presidential election that was widely viewed as a referendum on the legacy of Evo Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, voters appear to have spoken clearly: They want his socialist project to go on. On Monday, exit polls in Bolivia showed Mr. Morales’s handpicked candidate, Luis Arce, with such a wide lead that his main opponent, Carlos Mesa, conceded the election, and Mr. Arce’s supporters began celebrating in the streets — despite the fact that official results may not be available for days. “It is up to us, those who believe in democracy, those who said we would accept the result, favorable or not, to recognize that there is a victor in this election,” said Mr. Mesa. “We accept this result.” One pollster, Ciesmori, said around midnight on Sunday that Mr. Arce had 52.4 percent of votes, and that Mr. Mesa trailed with 31.5 percent. Outside Mr. Arce’s campaign headquarters, more than a hundred people gathered in celebration on Monday, chanting “the pollera will be respected!” — a reference to the traditional skirt that has become the symbol of his party’s Indigenous base.  Mr. Arce is the chosen successor of Mr. Morales, a transformative figure in a nation where power was traditionally concentrated in the hands of a wealthy, white elite. During his 14 years in office, Mr. Morales slashed poverty, built roads and schools, and nationalized the oil and gas industry. But he fled the country last year after his run for a fourth term ended in accusations that he had committed election fraud, deadly protests and a call by the military for him to step down. He called his ouster a coup. He sat out this year’s vote in neighboring Argentina. In the interim, the country has been run by a temporary president, a conservative named Jeanine Añez, who has persecuted the former president’s supporters, rolled back many of his policies and stifled dissent. Mr. Morales has remained a contentious figure in Bolivia, both adored for his role in aiding the poor and criticized for holding on to power for too long. On Election Day, voters frequently voiced frustration with Mr. Morales, but said that they still believed in his party, the Movimiento al Socialismo, or MAS, saying it was the only political movement that would stand by families who had lived on the margins for so many generations. Some said they feared that Mr. Mesa, despite his conciliatory tone and attempt to build a wide coalition, would follow in Ms. Añez’s steps. Mr. Mesa, a former journalist and historian, was president from 2003 to 2005, but resigned amid protests that included calls for the country to nationalize gas resources. He had taken the reins after serving as vice president to another leader, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, known as “Goni,” and some voters continue to associate Mr. Mesa with his predecessor’s policies of privatization. “We can’t go back to the time when we are suffering and others are winning,” said Luisa Alvarez, 40, a voter in the MAS stronghold of El Alto. In El Alto and the adjacent city of La Paz, the administrative capital, versions of “Mesa = Añez” and “Mesa = Goni” are frequent graffiti sightings. Speaking from his campaign office on Monday, Mr. Mesa said that based on the exit polls, he was admitting that his opponent had won and that his party would be “head of the democratic opposition for 2020-2025.” Mr. Arce’s party declined to claim victory, instead saying they were waiting for an official count. At MAS campaign headquarters, party spokeswoman Marianela Paco said they were waiting for the electoral body to announce results, because they didn’t want to “spoil the happiness” by calling the vote without a sanctioned tally. But she called the 20-point exit poll lead an “overwhelming” result, and said that party’s goal now was to “reconstruct the ruins” left behind by Ms. Añez. Mr. Arce has positioned himself as a transition candidate, vowing to carry on Mr. Morales’s legacy, while training younger leaders from his party to take the reins. “We are MAS 2.0,” he said in an interview shortly before the election. He added that Mr. Morales would have no role in his government. A former economics minister for Mr. Morales, Mr. Arce inherits a country that is deeply divided and facing an economic crisis. Wounds from last year’s protests are still raw. The coronavirus has battered the economy. And Mr. Arce will not have a key tool that helped Mr. Morales — a commodities boom that sent money flowing in. On Election Day, in the small city of Achocalla, Victor Apaza, 40, stood with his elderly mother on his arm. She wore a pink sweater and a traditional skirt. Both had just voted. Mr. Apaza, who lost his job in a metal factory amid the pandemic, said that he was voting for Mr. Arce because he believed the candidate was the only one who could rescue Bolivia from its social crisis —\xa0“we want a reconciliation,” he said — while also implementing just economic policies for men like him. The metal factory had just offered him his job back — at a reduced salary. But he also issued a warning. If Mr. Arce “doesn’t bring us solutions,” he said, “we’ll go to the street. There’s no other option.”']","Exit polls in Bolivia’s presidential election show a clear victory for Luis Arce, Evo Morales’s chosen successor, who vowed to carry on his vision.

"1,300 Prisoners Escape From Congo Jail After an Attack Claimed by ISIS",2020-10-20,By Mike Ives and Isabella Kwai,"['At least 1,300 prisoners escaped from a jail in the Democratic Republic of Congo early on Tuesday, the United Nations said, after an armed assault for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility. A local official attributed the operation to an Islamist rebel group. But Amaq, the Islamic State’s official news outlet, said that ISIS fighters had attacked a Congolese prison, citing a military source. The assault in Beni, in the country’s northeast, targeted the Kangbayi central prison and the military camp defending it, the city’s mayor, Modeste Bakwanamaha, told news agencies on Tuesday morning. The mayor said that just 100 of the prison’s inmates, who had numbered more than 1,400, remained, though 20 others later returned. “Unfortunately, the attackers, who came in large numbers, managed to break the door with electrical equipment,” the mayor said to Reuters. An estimated 1,335 prisoners escaped, and one inmate died in the confrontation, said Mathias Gillmann, a spokesman for a United Nations peacekeeping group in Congo, though local journalists, citing the police, reported that two inmates were fatally shot during the raid. According to the United Nations, the prison held 1,456 inmates. Mr. Gillmann said that a patrol was sent to the scene as soon as the U.N. group was alerted and that the group’s presence in the Beni area had been reinforced. Mr. Bakwanamaha said that the attack was the work of the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel group from neighboring Uganda that has been active in eastern Congo for decades but has been linked to an Islamic State financial network in recent years. About 20 of the escaped prisoners later returned and said they had been abducted by the Allied Democratic Forces, Mr. Bakwanamaha told The Associated Press, adding that they “did not want to live as enemies in the bush.” Officials in Congo could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday morning, and there was no comment from the official Twitter page of President Félix Tshisekedi’s office. Mr. Tshisekedi took office last year after claiming victory in a presidential election that was widely considered to be illegitimate. Mr. Bakwanamaha has asked the public to help capture the escapees by reporting suspicious people. The escape has angered local residents, who said it could lead to further violence. “It is a danger to the community of Beni,” one resident, Sadi Amundala, told The A.P. “We would like our government to improve the conditions of life in prisons and also strengthen the police and military presence to prevent future escapes.” Congo is a vast country where the central government has limited reach, and Beni lies in an area that has long been troubled by violence. The attack on Tuesday appears to mirror one from 2017, in which armed men stormed the Kangbayi prison and freed over 900 inmates. Local news reports at the time said that perpetrators of the attack had claimed to be Ugandan members of the Allied Democratic Forces. Last year, the Islamic State’s news agency claimed what it said was the group’s first attack in Congo, saying its soldiers had assaulted a military barracks in the Beni area, killing eight people. Congolese officials confirmed an attack in the area, but said that the assailants were from the Allied Democratic Forces. A 2018 report by the Congo Research Group at New York University said the A.D.F. had received money from a financier linked to the Islamic State and that the group was “making a tentative attempt to align itself with other jihadist groups.” The Allied Democratic Forces have been accused of killing hundreds of people. In 2016, a military court in Beni began conducting trials of the group’s fighters and their allies. Lucha, a human rights group in Congo, said in a statement on Tuesday that the prison break had freed several high-profile criminals who had participated in previous armed attacks. It urged the local authorities to take swift action. “They’ve got to take serious measures to recapture the fugitives,” the group’s statement said. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.']",Local officials blamed an Islamist militant group for the assault on the prison and a nearby military camp in the northeastern part of the country.
The C.D.C. updates its definition of ‘close contact’ in relation to infection risk.,2020-10-21,By Gina Kolata,"['The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its definition of what it means to be in close contact with an infected person and therefore at risk of contracting the coronavirus. The agency made the update in its published guidance for coronavirus contact tracing on Wednesday. The new guideline says close contact means being within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. The previous guideline said a person was at risk after 15 minutes of exposure within 6 feet of an infected person. One school district in Montana interpreted that to mean that if students moved every 15 minutes, the risk of infection was mitigated. The change could mean that when contact tracers speak to people who were close to an infected person, they could consider more of them at risk of also becoming infected. In the guidance, the agency notes that it does not have much data on what actually constitutes “close contact.” But it added that a total of 15 minutes of exposure to an infected person “can be used as an operational definition for contact investigation.” The C.D.C. added that the closer the contact, the greater the risk. Risk also increases over more time in contact with someone infected and from contact with an infected person who has symptoms. Someone who is coughing, singing or shouting is more likely to spread the virus, the C.D.C. said.']",
"As Britain Edges Toward Lockdowns, Long-Held Grievances Flare Up",2020-10-19,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain’s desperate attempt to curb a second wave of the coronavirus has exposed multiple fractures in its politics and society, but perhaps none as jagged as that between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the mayor of Greater Manchester, the country’s second-largest urban area. For days, the mayor, Andy Burnham, has been engaged in a war of words with Mr. Johnson and his ministers over the government’s plan to elevate hard-hit Manchester to the highest level of restrictions. That would shut down pubs, bars and gyms and forbid all socializing by people from different households. Mr. Burnham says that the restrictions would devastate the city’s economy, and that the central government has not offered adequate financial aid to the people who would lose their jobs during the lockdown. He has been a nearly ubiquitous presence on television, waging a fierce rebellion on behalf of his 2.8 million constituents. “People can’t just be pressurized into it,” Mr. Burnham said of the new restrictions, to Sky News on Monday. “I’m not going to be pressurized into it. And I’m not just going to kind of roll over at the sight of a check.” Mr. Burnham’s resistance is rooted in the long-held grievances of people in the old industrial cities of the north of England toward the politically dominant government sitting in London. While it has delegated some powers to regional authorities in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Westminster government retains highly centralized control over England and its major urban centers. But the standoff between Manchester and London also reflects mounting frustration with Mr. Johnson’s erratic, often opaque handling of the pandemic, as well as a dash of ambition and old-fashioned political maneuvering. Mr. Burnham, a 50-year-old native of Liverpool, is a Labour Party stalwart who twice ran unsuccessfully for party leader. Having served as health secretary under Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he traded in his seat in the opposition in 2016 to run for mayor of Greater Manchester, a newly created post. He is responsible for a far-flung metropolitan region, though he has less power than big-city mayors in the United States. “With his limited powers, Andy Burnham is taking advantage of his legitimacy,” said Tony Travers, an expert in urban affairs at the London School of Economics. “He has clearly sensed that the central government is weak.” Mr. Burnham’s clash with London carries echoes of the ill will between President Trump and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. As with them, much of the dispute comes down to complaints over a lack of financial support. But Mr. de Blasio has considerably more power than Mr. Burnham, who has little control over budgetary matters and must obtain the consent of council leaders for many decisions. What Mr. Burnham does have is an antenna for national politics — and for the fact that Mr. Johnson won a landslide victory in the election last year by promising to close the economic gap between England’s more prosperous south and the struggling regions of the Midlands and the north. That message lured many traditional Labour voters to the Conservative Party, shattering Labour’s vaunted “red wall.” Mr. Johnson, analysts said, could easily alienate those voters if he foists an economically ruinous lockdown on them. “There is a sense,” Mr. Travers said, “that people in Greater Manchester are having things done to them by a distant government.” Mr. Burnham has complained of being cut out of the deliberations over when to impose the heightened restrictions, saying he often learns of decisions from press reports attributed to unnamed Downing Street officials. And he says the government does not share the epidemiological data that is driving its decisions, which makes it impossible to judge whether a lockdown is necessary in one place but not another. There is no debate that Manchester was hit hard by the resurgence of the virus at the end of the summer, in part because of its large student population. Its current rate of infection is 432 cases per 100,000 people, well above the national average. But its rate of cases has declined from a peak of 583 per 100,000 in the seven days before Oct. 3. Government officials said that infections were continuing to rise there among vulnerable older people, and that based on current projections, intensive care units at hospitals in Greater Manchester would reach capacity by Nov. 8. The supply of hospital beds, officials said, is a more relevant barometer than cases. Mr. Johnson’s aides are frustrated by Mr. Burnham’s resistance, which some view as cynical posturing. On Sunday, Michael Gove, a senior cabinet minister who holds the title of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, urged the mayor and his allies to “put aside for a moment some of the political positioning they’ve indulged in.” But while the government has the power to impose health requirements on any city in England, Mr. Johnson has been reluctant to do it over the objections of the mayors. Public adherence to the rules depends in no small part on how faithfully the local authorities enforce them. As the talks between Manchester and London dragged on Monday, the government began separate negotiations with officials in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire about elevating those regions to so-called Tier 3 status. Wales, which controls its own health policy under the terms of the United Kingdom’s limited self-government, plans to impose a temporary lockdown on the entire region. All told, Britain reported 18,804 new cases on Monday, and 80 deaths. Before elevating Liverpool to the highest-risk category, Mr. Johnson struck an agreement with Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city region. The prime minister hailed that deal as an example of bipartisan cooperation, and clearly hoped it would be a template for other cities. Mr. Burnham, however, is demanding that the government pay 80 percent of the wages of people who lose their jobs because of the lockdown — the same compensation it offered in the national wage subsidy program that it is winding down this month. So far, the government has offered to offset two-thirds of lost wages. Mr. Burnham has called on Mr. Johnson and the Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, to hold a vote in Parliament on the financial aid that the government should offer cities placed under the highest level of lockdown. But Mr. Johnson, who has kept control over the pandemic response tightly in Downing Street, rejected that. “Establishing clear national entitlements of the kind we had during the first lockdown,” Mr. Burnham said, “will create a sense of fairness, which in turn would help build public support for, and compliance with, any new restrictions.”']",Residents of Manchester and other northern English cities have never much cared for the heavy hand of Westminster. They are not liking it any better in the pandemic.
Demand for Pakistan Visas Sets Off Deadly Stampede in Afghanistan,2020-10-21,By Zabihullah Ghazi and Fahim Abed,"['JALALABAD, Afghanistan — A stampede in a crowded stadium in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday left at least 12 women dead, officials said. The women were among thousands of people hoping to get visas to enter Pakistan for medical treatment. Many people in Afghanistan, a war-ravaged country with minimal health care facilities, cross the border into Pakistan for treatment. But since the spring, Pakistan had drastically reduced the number of visas that it issued to Afghans, hoping to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. Pakistan recently announced that it would resume issuing visas at a more normal rate. But there was so much pent-up demand that thousands of people gathered before dawn at the soccer stadium, in the city of Jalalabad, waiting for tokens to be given out that would enable them to apply for visas. Just 1,000 visas were to be processed that day. About 10,000 people were in the stadium when the stampede occurred, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province, which includes Jalalabad. The stampede began as the tokens were being distributed to the crowd, Mr. Khogyani said. “There were several thousand women,” he said. “All of those killed were ill women who were trying to get a visa and go for their treatment to Pakistan.” Pakistan, despite its tense relations with the Afghan government over its tacit support for the Taliban, is a key destination for Afghans. About three million Afghan refugees live there, and until the pandemic struck, there was a constant flow of Afghans across the border, seeking work or medical care. The Pakistani Consulate in Jalalabad, which distributes visas for residents of seven eastern and southeastern provinces, recently reopened after being closed for nearly eight months because of Pakistan’s coronavirus travel restrictions. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan, had recently announced a new visa regime that would ease the process for issuing long-term, multiple-entry visas for Afghans. “The charges of corruption and mishandling of applicants in recent years had tarnished the image of Pakistan and caused hardship to visa applicants,” Mr. Sadiq said in announcing the new visa policy. The provincial authorities in Nangarhar announced the new procedure for distributing tokens to visa applicants, which was meant to discourage crowding in light of the heavy demand. Under the rules, the first 1,000 people would get tokens and the rest would have to try their luck the next day, Mr. Khogyani said. “The stampede broke out in the women’s section,” said an eyewitness, Abdullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name. “Then police arrived and the situation got worse. I escaped from the stadium. When I came back, several women were lying on the ground and they were dead.” In July, clashes along the Afghan-Pakistani border left 15 civilians dead in Kandahar Province, as the Pakistani Army fired heavy artillery into civilian areas. Protesters on both sides of the border had demanded the reopening of a border crossing that Pakistan had closed because of the pandemic. The stampede came on another bloody day of violence across Afghanistan, as the Taliban waged attacks despite continuing peace talks in Qatar between the militants and government negotiators. The bloodiest attack took place in the northern province of Takhar, where a police special forces unit was ambushed by the Taliban, officials said. More than 42 police officers were killed, according to Wafiullah Rahmani, head of the provincial council, who spoke from a hospital where bodies were arriving. Mr. Rahmani said the head of the special forces unit, a provincial deputy police chief, was among the dead. “The hospital is so busy, and many people are looking for their loved ones,” he said. “The casualties may increase, as many police officers are still missing.” Other security officials put the toll even higher. “I have counted 50 dead bodies and I have got tired of counting,” said Karimullah Bek, a pro-government militia commander in the area. In what appeared to be a retaliatory strike by Afghan forces gone wrong, the Afghan air force struck a mosque in a nearby area, killing at least 12 children, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Takhar said. “It was a mistake,” the spokesman, Ahmad Jawad Hijri, said. “All of the victims were under 16 years old, and they were studying in the mosque.” Zabihullah Ghazi reported from Jalalabad, and Fahim Abed from Kabul, Afghanistan. Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Kabul.']","At least 12 people died as thousands crowded a soccer stadium.

Migrant farmworkers under lockdown say restrictions severely limit their freedom.,2020-10-19,By Miriam Jordan,"['Each spring, a thousand or more Mexican tomato pickers descend on the Eastern Shore of Virginia to toil in the fields of Lipman Family Farms, enduring long hours stooped over to pluck the plump fruit. An adept worker will fill a 32-pound bucket every two and a half minutes, earning 65 cents for each one. This year, there is a new and even more difficult working condition: To keep the coronavirus from spreading and jeopardizing the harvest, Lipman has put its crews on lockdown. With few exceptions, they have been ordered to remain either in camps where they are housed, or the fields, where they toil. The restrictions have allowed Lipman’s tomato operation to run smoothly, with only a handful of coronavirus cases, at a time when many farms and food processing facilities across the country have wrestled to contain outbreaks. But they have caused some workers to complain that their work site has become like a prison. Gone are the weekly outings to Walmart to stock up on provisions; to El Ranchito, the Mexican convenience store, to buy shell-shaped concha pastries; and to the laundromat to wash heavily soiled garments. “You put up with a lot already. I never expected to lose my freedom,” said Martinez, 39, who is in his third year working in the tomato fields along the East Coast. (Many workers interviewed for this article asked to use only a first or last name for fear of losing their jobs.) He said workers spent months on end without interacting with anyone at all outside the farms, though Lipman eventually relented and organized a carefully controlled trip for groceries each week. Lipman’s battle with its workers underscores one of the signature conundrums of the pandemic. Locking down its employees — a drastic measure that would be intolerable to most American workers — appears to have kept both the employees and the community safe. But at what cost? The large tomato enterprise has been able to impose the restrictions on its workers because they are beholden to the company for their visa, housing and wages. Lipman would not disclose total coronavirus case numbers, but employees said they knew of no cases at the Virginia operation following about six infections that occurred before most of the seasonal workers arrived. Kent Shoemaker, Lipman’s chief executive, said the company was proud of its record protecting both its employees and the surrounding communities. “As of today, we do not have any confirmed Covid-19 cases on our farms or in our packing facilities,” Mr. Shoemaker said in mid-October.']",
South Korea Tries to Quell Anxiety Over Flu Shots After 13 Unexplained Deaths,2020-10-21,By Choe Sang-Hun and Sui-Lee Wee,"['\u200bSEOUL\u200b, South Korea — The South Korean authorities are investigating the mysterious deaths of 13 people after they had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. And though officials said there was no link between the deaths and the vaccinations, there was worry that the cases could cause panic at a critical time for vaccination efforts. The deaths happened over the past week, including five reported on Wednesday and four others overnight Thursday. Officials said that two of the deaths might have resulted from anaphylactic shock, a serious allergic reaction, but gave no further details. The deaths are under investigation, but officials were quick to rule out the vaccines themselves — which they said were all from local drugmakers and not from lots for export — as the main cause. Given the scope of South Korea’s flu vaccination program, and the small number of other problems reported so far, some experts said that coincidence is more likely to be involved. Instead, officials vowed to step up a government flu-vaccination campaign to prevent the country’s health care system from being overloaded with flu patients amid the coronavirus pandemic — both viruses have similar symptoms of early infection, like fever and cough. “We have not found a direct connection between these deaths and vaccines, or a relationship between the deaths and adverse effects reported after flu shots,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. “We don’t think that the situation calls for the suspending of the inoculation program.” Ms. Jung convened a special news conference on Wednesday after the rapid series of deaths, starting with a teenager who died on Friday, grabbed headlines in South Korea. But with autopsies likely to take days, public anxiety is running high in a country where anti-vaccine sentiment has flared before. South Korea, and many other countries, have seen annual flu inoculation programs as critical to efforts to also deal with the coronavirus, especially for children, the elderly, pregnant women and medical personnel. Officials unveiled plans to procure 20 percent more flu vaccines for this winter than last year to inoculate up to 30 million people, more than half the country’s population. But the campaign made headlines last month when it was discovered that some vaccines supplied by a local company, which needed to be refrigerated at all times, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported. \u200b A recall was ordered and officials said about 2,300 people had received doses from the faulty batch, which was meant mainly for young children and teenagers. Still, officials said that alone should not have rendered the vaccines dangerous. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the concern about lack of temperature control is that it can render the vaccines ineffective, rather than toxic. Then, earlier this month, 615,000 doses of a flu vaccine\u200b shipped by another company were also recalled after some of them were found to contain white particles, which the government described as being a harmless protein. Almost 18,000 people had received doses before they were recalled. No serious harm had been reported from either of those lots, though dozens of people who received those doses reported fevers or other minor complaints — which are common reactions to flu shots, officials said. None of nine people who died had received vaccines from those that had been recalled, they added. After suspending the vaccination program for teenagers for three weeks, it resumed on Oct. 13. Three days later, a 17-year-old boy in Incheon, just west of Seoul, died after receiving his shot. On Tuesday, a 77-year-old woman was found dead at her home in Gochang, south of Seoul, after being vaccinated a day earlier. On the same day, an 82-year-old man who had also been inoculated died in the central city of Daejeon. Four of the five people who died on Wednesday ranged in age from 53 to 89. Information about the two other people who died, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday, has not been released. Nine of those who died, all of whom had received flu shots in the past, received vaccines supplied by several different local drugmakers, officials said. “Since most people who got flu shots with the same vaccines reported no major problems, we concluded that those vaccines do not contain toxic materials,” said Kim Joong-gon, \u200ba professor of medicine at Seoul National University who led a team of investigators. “We\u200b concluded that we can exclude \u200bthe vaccine \u200bas a problem.”\u200b In general, flu vaccines have a good safety record. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the body of scientific evidence over decades “overwhelmingly” supports their safety. Specifically in South Korea, officials said that since 2009, 25 people in South Korea had died after receiving flu vaccinations, but that only one of the deaths was tied to the process. Nearly 13 million South Koreans have received flu shots so far this year, 8.3 million of them for free as part of the government program. There have been complaints about minor reactions to shots, but those are normal every flu season. And Ms. Jung said Wednesday that some of the complaints were likely to have been influenced by media coverage of the recalls. The anxiety over flu shots could also undermine public trust in an eventual coronavirus vaccine, which is already faltering as countries race to get their candidates approved. In a survey this month of 2,500 people in Gyeonggi-do, a populous province surrounding the South Korean capital of Seoul, 62 percent of respondents said they would not get vaccinated against the coronavirus until after the vaccine was proved to be completely safe. Many scientists have expressed concern about the speed with which coronavirus vaccines are being developed. But getting a vaccine approved is only one hurdle. Managing public perception is another, especially if there are concerns about the vaccine being mishandled during transportation and storage. Most vaccines have to be kept at low temperatures from the time they are manufactured to the time they are administered to prevent them from spoiling — what the industry calls a “cold chain.” The flu vaccine, for example, needs to stay refrigerated, at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. That could complicate the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. A number of the leading candidates under development would need to be kept at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius (minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit). In the United States, transportation and warehouse companies are scrambling to build “freezer farms.” Airlines are fitting their planes with freezers, and glass vial makers are inventing methods to make vials that do not crack from very cold temperatures. Courier services like UPS and FedEx are making dry ice. But cold facilities are lacking in other parts of the world, including Central America, rural India and Southeast Asia, which experts say could hinder mass immunization. Typically, multiple reports of adverse reactions from vaccines are investigated by a country’s drug regulator in an attempt to determine the frequency of such events and whether there are causal links. While these investigations are underway, countries can choose to continue the vaccination program if the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks. Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Sui-Lee Wee from Singapore.']","Health officials say there is no link between the deaths and the flu vaccines.

"No, mouthwash will not save you from the coronavirus, despite that study going around.",2020-10-21,By Katherine J. Wu,"['A rash of provocative headlines this week flooded social media platforms with a tantalizing idea: that mouthwash can “inactivate” coronaviruses and help curb their spread. The idea came from a new study that found that a coronavirus that causes common colds — not the one that causes Covid-19 — could be killed in a laboratory by dousing virus-infected cells with mouthwash. The study’s authors concluded that the products they tested “may provide an additional level of protection against” the new coronavirus. But outside experts warned against overinterpreting the study’s results, which might not have practical relevance to the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Not only did the study not investigate this deadly new virus, but it also did not test whether mouthwash affects how viruses spread from person to person. “I don’t have a problem with using Listerine,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “But it’s not an antiviral.” The study, which was published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked only at a coronavirus called 229E, which causes common colds — not the new coronavirus. The researchers flooded 229E coronaviruses grown in human liver cells in the lab with several types of mouthwash and nasal rinses for 30 seconds, one minute or two minutes — longer than the typical swig or spritz into a nose or mouth. Around 90 to 99 percent of the viruses could no longer infect cells after this exposure, the study found. But because the study didn’t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world, other experts said. The human mouth, full of nooks and crannies and a slurry of chemicals secreted by a diverse cadre of cells, is far more complicated than the inside of a laboratory dish. Researchers warn people not to misuse mouthwash or nasal rinses or ingest large quantities of the liquids, because they can be dangerous.']",
Modi Warns India to Keep Its Guard Up as Hindu Festival Season Nears,2020-10-20,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — In a televised address Tuesday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India urged his countrymen to tighten up their vigilance against the coronavirus as the Hindu festival season approaches. “Recently, we saw many photos and videos which clearly proved that people have lowered their guard,” he said. “This isn’t right.” In the next few weeks, more than a billion Indians will celebrate several major Hindu holidays, including Dussehra and Diwali, and the authorities are worried about people packing together. India is rapidly catching up to the United States in terms of reported infections, having almost 7.6 million known cases, compared with 8.2 million in the United States. India had been outpacing the United States in new daily infections, reaching nearly 100,000 in mid-September, but in recent days the number of new daily infections has come down. As of Monday, the seven-day average for new daily cases in India was approximately 61,000, according to a New York Times database, just slightly higher than the average over the same time in the United States. Some experts say that the decline in India suggests that the virus, after proliferating across rural areas, may finally be reaching a plateau. Others cautioned that the decrease could also be explained by a shift in testing methods. Several experts say that India is increasingly using cheaper rapid antigen tests. These tests deliver fast results but have a higher chance of missing positive cases than the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests that were more prevalent here a few months ago and are considered the gold standard of testing. Dr. Anant Bhan, a health researcher at Yenepoya University in southern India, said that the downward trend was encouraging but that it required “more in-depth examination.” “A large number of tests which are being currently used are rapid antigen tests with high false negative rates,” Dr. Bhan said. During the festival season, he said, “any laxity could mean the possibility of a spike in cases which could strain India’s health system.” Mr. Modi said that the precautions taken by Indians since the pandemic started had left the country in a “stable situation.” “We must not let it deteriorate,” he warned. Mr. Modi himself has been holed up in the prime minister’s compound on a leafy road in New Delhi, and each time he appears on television, his white beard seems to have grown an inch or two longer. He emphasized that India’s death rate remains much lower than that in the United States and other Western countries.

"To Test Virus Vaccines, U.K. Study Will Intentionally Infect Volunteers",2020-10-20,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Scientists at Imperial College London plan to deliberately infect volunteers with the coronavirus early next year, launching the world’s first effort to study how vaccinated people respond to being intentionally exposed to the virus and opening up a new, uncertain path to identifying an effective vaccine. The hotly contested strategy, known as a human challenge trial, could potentially shave crucial time in the race to winnow a number of vaccine candidates. Rather than conducting the sort of trials now underway around the world, in which scientists wait for vaccinated people to encounter the virus in their homes and communities, researchers would purposely infect them in a hospital isolation unit. Scientists have used this method for decades to test vaccines for typhoid, cholera and other diseases, even asking volunteers in the case of malaria to expose their arms to boxes full of mosquitoes to be bitten and infected. But whereas the infected could be cured of those diseases, Covid-19 has few widely used treatments and no known cure, putting the scientists in charge of Britain’s study in largely uncharted ethical territory. Starting with tiny doses, the scientists will first administer the virus to small groups of volunteers who have not been vaccinated at all, in order to determine the lowest dose of the virus that will reliably infect them. That process, scheduled to begin in January at a hospital in north London, will be followed by tests in which volunteers are given a vaccine and then intentionally exposed to this carefully calibrated dose of the virus. The study will be led by scientists with Imperial College London and hVivo, a company specializing in human challenge trials. It still requires approval from Britain’s drug regulation agency, but the government said on Tuesday that it would allot 34 million pounds, or $44 million, in public funding. The first round of volunteers, up to 90 healthy adults aged 18 to 30, will have the virus dripped into their noses without having been vaccinated. If not enough participants become infected, the scientists will try to expose these early-stage volunteers to a higher dose, repeating the process until they have identified the necessary exposure level of the virus. Only once the scientists decide on a dose, which they intend to do by late spring, will they begin the process of comparing vaccine candidates by immunizing the next group of volunteers and then exposing them to the virus. Some vaccine candidates now undergoing trials may already have received approval by then, but researchers hope a challenge trial will add direct evidence of efficacy and help them compare the performance of different vaccines. “Deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen is never undertaken lightly,” said Professor Peter Openshaw, an immunologist and co-investigator on the study. “However, such studies are enormously informative about a disease, even one so well studied as Covid-19.” Many important questions about the study remain unanswered. The British government’s vaccine task force, which will select the first vaccine candidates to include in the human challenge trial, has not yet announced its plans. The idea of human challenge trials has already been met with a lukewarm reception by several leading vaccine makers, including Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, leaving analysts uncertain as to which companies’ vaccines will end up being included. And it is not yet clear how regulators in Europe or the United States will evaluate results from human challenge trials, or whether such studies will accelerate the vaccine approval process. For proponents of the strategy, saving lives by potentially speeding the development of a vaccine and advancing the understanding of the virus is a moral imperative. Those scientists and bioethicists say that the risk of the coronavirus seriously sickening or killing young, healthy volunteers — the sort of people who would be infected — is low enough as to be outweighed by the possibility of saving tens of thousands of lives. “I’m surprised they haven’t been used earlier,” Professor Julian Savulescu, the director of the Oxford Uehiro Center for Practical Ethics, said of human challenge trials on coronavirus vaccines. “Every day that you delay developing a vaccine and effective treatment, another 5,000 people die. It’d be useful for screening out less effective vaccines and for understanding the immune response.” Skeptics have urged scientists to wait, or to forgo the approach entirely. There have been unexpected and unexplained cases of severe illness in young patients, and the long-term consequences of an infection are unknown, with the pandemic having started only months ago. It is also difficult to extrapolate widely from a human challenge trial. It is unclear, for example, whether studies in healthy young adults could reliably predict the efficacy of a vaccine in older adults or people with pre-existing conditions. Scientists have also warned about the challenges of mimicking real-world transmission in a laboratory. That could make it difficult for the researchers to know whether a vaccine that may protect volunteers from deliberate exposure in a hospital would do the same for people encountering the virus at work or at home. “Is it breathed out, sneezed out, do you sniff it all in one fell chunk of virus coming at you?” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. “No one really knows. It’s so hard to model. Squirting a bolus of virus into the nose is an imperfect model of natural transmission.” The debate has split an advisory panel to the World Health Organization, which published guidelines about the safest way to conduct challenge trials in June. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health said that it was not planning to support such trials and that randomized clinical trials were sufficient. But Britain took a different view. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing a barrage of criticism for his handling of a pandemic that has left Britain with the highest death toll in Europe, has tried to cast the country as being at the forefront of scientific progress on the coronavirus. Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed one of the leading vaccine candidates, as well as one of the most promising treatments, the steroid called dexamethasone. Some scientists questioned whether the fierce competition to be the first to develop an effective vaccine had unduly influenced plans for a human challenge trial. “There’s unquestionably vaccine nationalism involved,” Prof. Moore said. “It’s a race for money and glory. That’s the reality of it.” The scientists overseeing the trial said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir to treat volunteers as soon as they began detecting viral infection, even before the onset of symptoms. But that drug has been found to have only modest benefit. And some analysts said the treatment, while necessary, would limit researchers’ ability to determine whether the vaccine candidates being evaluated reduced the severity of illness. The volunteers in London will be paid roughly Britain’s minimum wage, which is about £9, or $11, per hour, for their time in taking part in the trial and their two to three weeks in mandatory quarantine. The researchers said they were wary of offering additional incentives that could cloud the judgment of volunteers.  Thousands of people in Britain have already expressed interest in taking part in challenge trials for the coronavirus through an American group, 1Day Sooner, that advocates for such studies. But with the virus now surging again across Europe and parts of the United States, some scientists have argued there is no shortage of people enrolled in ordinary vaccine trials being exposed to the virus under natural conditions. “This is not a rare disease,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel. “You can probably find a hot spot to do a vaccine trial.”']","The hotly contested strategy of deliberate exposure, known as a human challenge trial, could speed up the process of identifying effective coronavirus vaccines."
Stocks rise in the U.S. ahead of Tuesday’s deadline that Pelosi set for stimulus talks.,2020-10-20,By Emily Cochrane and Luke Broadwater,"['U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, the day Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California set as a deadline for a compromise stimulus deal that could be considered before the election. The S&P 500 was up nearly half a percent in early trading, after falling 1.6 percent on Monday.  On Monday, Ms. Pelosi instructed key Democratic lawmakers to work with top Republicans to try to resolve critical differences holding up a broad agreement with the Trump administration. The directive came after she and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, held their latest talks, speaking for nearly an hour by phone. A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said there would be more clarity on the details by the end of Tuesday.  The odds of a last-minute deal remain long, with Democrats and the Trump administration still haggling over funding levels and policy issues. Even if they could agree, Senate Republicans have all but ruled out embracing a plan anywhere near as large as the more than $2 trillion package under discussion. If such a deal were struck, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the chamber would consider it, but he also made a point of scheduling two separate votes in the coming days on narrower bills of the kind senators in his party are more willing to accept. One would revive a lapsed federal loan program for small businesses and the other would provide $500 billion for schools, testing and expired unemployment benefits. President Trump has insisted in recent days that he wants to spend more than the $2.4 trillion Ms. Pelosi has put forward in negotiations, and claimed he could easily cajole enough Senate Republicans into supporting an agreement of that size — a notion that many of them have told his top deputies would never happen. Still, Ms. Pelosi insisted she was optimistic a bargain could be reached and said she was intent on reaching one before a new Democratic administration began in January. “I don’t want to carry over the droppings of this grotesque elephant into the next presidency,” Ms. Pelosi told her members. “We’ve got to get something big, and we’ve got to get it done soon and we’ve got to get it done right.”']",
Thailand’s Leader Offers End to Crackdown on Pro-Democracy Protesters,2020-10-21,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — In a conciliatory speech Wednesday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand acknowledged that the country cannot become “a better society through the use of water cannon” and said he intended to withdraw an emergency decree cracking down on pro-democracy protests. As thousands of demonstrators marched on Government House, home of the prime minister’s office, he urged all sides to resolve their differences through the parliamentary process and said he would to seek to call Parliament into session next week. “I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,” he said in a televised evening address. “I am currently preparing to lift the state of severe emergency in Bangkok and will do so promptly if there are no violent incidents.” Protesters appeared to be unmoved by the prime minister’s words and, hours later outside Government House, a delegation hand-delivered a resignation letter to a police commander for Mr. Prayuth to sign. On Thursday morning, after an evening of relatively peaceful protests, Mr. Prayuth did, indeed, withdraw the emergency decree he issued last week. It had banned gatherings of more than four people — an order ignored by the protesters — and news or online content that “could create fear or intentionally distort information.” Over the past 90 years, Thailand’s elected government has repeatedly been supplanted by military regimes — and in the case of the current administration, a ruling junta extended its power through a curtailed democratic process. In recent months, a movement for democracy has been building, inspired in part by outspoken student leaders willing to risk prison by criticizing the government and the monarchy. While withdrawing the emergency decree was a first step in easing tensions, it is unlikely that the proposal for parliamentary intervention will satisfy protesters who demand the resignation of Mr. Prayuth, a retired general who has led Thailand’s government since he took power in a 2014 coup. The protesters are also calling for an overhaul of the 2017 Constitution that Mr. Prayuth pushed through, diluting the power of the electorate by creating an appointed Senate. And, boldest of all, the protesters are seeking to bring the monarchy under the Constitution. Thailand is headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, one of the world’s richest men, who spends most of his time in Europe. Criticism of the monarchy is extremely rare in Thailand, and comments deemed to be insulting to the king or his family are punishable by as much as 15 years in prison under the country’s harsh lèse-majesté law. Over the past week, many thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Bangkok and other cities, issuing three demands summed up by the slogan: “Resign, Rewrite, Reform.” On Friday, when thousands of protesters gathered in the commercial Pathumwan district of Bangkok, the police dispersed the crowd with powerful water cannons that drenched demonstrators with a liquid containing a chemical irritant and blue dye. That move, which the prime minister now seems to acknowledge was excessive, served only to bring out even bigger crowds over the weekend. Protest leaders shifted tactics, starting to call demonstrations on short notice in multiple locations, giving the police less chance to mobilize in force. After taking a day off on Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered Wednesday at Victory Monument, the site of earlier protests, and marched about two miles toward Government House, which is heavily barricaded and guarded by the police. The protesters broke through a barricade several blocks from Government House as the police retreated, allowing the crowd to swarm the gap and move in close to the seat of government. Helmeted police officers holding shields lined up shoulder-to-shoulder behind razor-wire barricades to keep back demonstrators, many of whom wore helmets themselves. Some also carried umbrellas, which have proven effective against tear gas canisters, although they did not need them Wednesday. Demonstrators, many of them sitting in the street, chanted, “Reform the monarchy,” and “Who owns the country? The people.” The police kept water cannons nearby, despite the prime minister’s expression of regret over their earlier use. In his speech, Mr. Prayuth, 66, sought to cast himself as a leader who must try to unite the country and resolve disagreements among its people. “We must now step back from the edge of the slippery slope that can easily slide to chaos, where all sides lose control of the situation,” Mr. Prayuth said, “where emotions take over our better judgment, violence begets more violence, and, as history has shown us all too many times, we can end in a situation where the entire country suffers.” Mr. Prayuth repeatedly called on the protesters to rely on Parliament to resolve the crisis. But in doing so, he highlighted an institution that has lost credibility with much of the public. In February, the Constitutional Court dissolved a popular new political party, the Future Forward Party, and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years. The party had placed third in parliamentary elections last year, winning 81 seats. Some former Future Forward leaders have been helping the young leaders of the protest movement, in some cases bailing them out of jail after they have been arrested. “The protesters have made their voices and views heard,” Mr. Prayuth said. “It is now time for them to let their views be reconciled with the views of other segments of Thai society through their representatives in Parliament.” In announcing that he would withdraw the emergency decree if there was no further violence, Mr. Prayuth had requested that the demonstrators also make concessions. “I ask the protesters to reciprocate with sincerity, to turn down the volume on hateful and divisive talk, and to let us, together, disperse this terrible dark cloud before it moves over our country,"" he said. “Let us respect the law and parliamentary democracy, and let our views be presented through our representatives in Parliament.” Outside Government House, the protesters seemed unmoved. A young man called out to the crowd over a megaphone, “Are we backing down?” “No!” the crowd shouted. “Keep fighting?” he called out. And the crowd answered, “Fight!” Adam Dean contributed reporting.']","Prayuth Chan-ocha, who withdrew an emergency decree on Thursday, has called for mediation by a weakened Parliament.

"Romans Want to Get Rid of Wild Boars, but Killing Them? That’s Another Matter",2020-10-19,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['Wild boars are a menace in Rome, strewing garbage around the city, blocking traffic and causing numerous car accidents. Residents have been demanding action — but not this. Animal rights activists and many Romans are expressing outrage after the authorities killed a sow and her six piglets on a playground near the Vatican, only hours after families and children had been there, feeding the boars. They say the animals should have been safely captured and transported to the wild. “It was a mother with her little ones — just emotionally, this is terrible,” said Andrea Brutti, who is the chief official for wild fauna at Italy’s National Board for Animal Protection. Some people have a fondness for the animals, but wild boars are far from harmless. They can be aggressive and dangerous, and are a growing presence in Rome, drawn by the uncollected trash that plagues the city. From the city’s central streets to the outlying arteries that border parks and woods, boars have become a major driving hazard. The threat is not limited to Rome — earlier this month, two former professional soccer players died when their car hit some wild boars crossing a highway in northern Italy. Boars are a point of contention throughout the country. Hunters have argued that the perpetually hungry animals are nuisances that have bred out of control and need to be culled to save the country’s agriculture. Activists argue that hunters have worked to increase the number of wild boars, to enable more hunting. The fight has extended into politics, with representatives of the right-wing League party often siding with hunters. But pretty much everyone agrees they have no place in the cities. Images of wild boars tearing into the garbage bags piled high around the city have become common in recent years. Last month, a family of them was filmed peacefully walking through the streets near St. Peter’s Square. Rome’s boar troubles mirror the dilemmas faced by developed areas around the world, as they try to keep in check populations of deer, geese, bears, coyotes, sea gulls or other creatures without running afoul of animal lovers. In many places, humans have eliminated the animals’ natural predators or competitors, while inadvertently providing a food surplus for those that remain. The city, the region, residents and animal rights advocates have argued for years over what to do about Rome’s boar problem, without finding a solution. The advocates say parks on the outskirts of the city should be fenced to contain the animals, and that roads should be equipped with alarm systems, but no one wants to pay the bill. The porcine family at the center of the latest uproar had roamed the streets near the Vatican for days, troubling some residents and delighting others. They ended up in the playground — some say the police entrapped them — last Thursday, and children started feeding them anything handy. Then, late Friday night, the police made their move. While neighbors shouted “cowards” and expletives from their windows, officers shot the boars with tranquilizer darts, and then veterinarians gave them lethal injections. Videos and photos of the scene spread across Rome. A member of Parliament and founder of an association for animal rights accused the city of the killing. “It was a gratuitous barbarity,” Michela Vittoria Brambilla said in a video posted on social media. “Residents were standing around the park watching the massacre.” Rome’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, ordered an investigation. A city official who was involved, Daniele Diaco, said he was receiving death threats as a result of the incident. The city, run by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, and the government of the Lazio region, run by the Democratic Party, have blamed each other. City officials said that in this and other, similar cases, the city alerts Lazio to the problem, but does not decide what action to take.  But regional officials, who had trouble finding the cages needed to trap and transport the boars, said they made the decision to euthanize the animals in consultation with the city officials. Later that day, a national animal welfare group offered its services, saying it could capture the boars and move them to a nature preserve. The Lazio regional council member responsible for the environment says she agreed and called off the killing, asking a city official to pass the word to the police. The message never reached the officers at the playground. The boars were killed and loaded onto a truck for disposal. “In the end, animals like people are victims of bad politics,” Mr. Brutti said.']","The euthanizing of a boar and her six piglets on a playground near the Vatican has aroused fury in Rome, a city that has long complained about the often aggressive animals."
Pakistan Rescinds TikTok Ban,2020-10-19,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Just 10 days after introducing a ban on TikTok, the Pakistani authorities said on Monday that they were reversing the decision after receiving assurance from the Chinese-owned social media platform that it would moderate content according to local laws. “TikTok is being unlocked after assurance from management that they will block all accounts repeatedly involved in spreading obscenity and immorality,” the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, the national regulator, said in a statement. Pakistan banned the app on Oct. 9 after officials said they had received a slew of complaints about indecent content. The app was functioning again on Monday. TikTok, with its lip-syncing teenagers and meme-heavy videos, has faced problems in several countries for varying reasons. The Trump administration has attempted to block the app over privacy fears, India has prohibited the service as part of rising tensions between New Delhi and Beijing, and public decency concerns have led to occasional bans in places like Bangladesh and Indonesia. TikTok has 20 million users in Pakistan, but conservatives in the country say that the app has been overtaken by vulgar song-and-dance numbers and memes. Officials said that a big reason behind the ban was the sexualization of underage girls and that TikTok was given several warnings to regulate its content before the ban was imposed. But others said the Pakistani authorities’ move to lock the app was also intended to limit criticism of the government, which is struggling with a sagging economy and facing growing opposition. In recent months, the app has had a substantial increase in content that caricatured or mocked the policies of the governing party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Officials have denied any political undertones to the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, said in a statement on Monday that it welcomed the decision: “At TikTok, we’re committed to enforcing our community guidelines and complying with local laws in all markets in which we operate, as these are pillars of our work to promote a safe and positive community online.” The decision to allow TikTok to resume operations in Pakistan was widely welcomed by the app’s users, too, and finance analysts said it would increase investor confidence. “The expedited reversal of the ban also goes to show that ByteDance is very much invested in the Pakistan market,” said Saif Ali, a marketing executive.']",A decision outlawing the social media app was overturned after 10 days with assurances from the Chinese owners that content would be moderated according to local laws.
"2,000-Year-Old Cat Etching Found at Nazca Lines Site in Peru",2020-10-19,By Tiffany May,"['The image, stretching for 40 yards on a hillside in Peru, shows a creature with pointy ears, orb-like eyes and a long striped tail. It appears to be a cat lounging, as cats often do. Archaeologists stumbled across the faded etching while remodeling a section of a UNESCO heritage site known as the Nazca Lines, Peru’s Ministry of Culture announced last week. The catlike geoglyph — which experts say dates to 200 B.C. to 100 B.C. — is the latest discovery among the carvings of larger-than-life animals and plants previously found between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, in a desert plain about 250 miles southeast of the capital, Lima. “The discovery shows, once again, the rich and varied cultural legacy of this site,” the ministry said in a statement. The Nazca Lines were first discovered by a Peruvian aerial surveyor in 1927. Images of a hummingbird, a monkey and an orca were unearthed at the site. UNESCO has designated the Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa a World Heritage Site since 1994. The cat etching is believed to be older than any of the prehistoric geoglyphs previously unearthed at Nazca. “It’s quite striking that we’re still finding new figures, but we also know that there are more to be found,” Johny Isla, Peru’s chief archaeologist for the Nazca Lines, told Efe, a Spanish news agency. The designs were believed to have been created when ancient Peruvians scraped off a dark and rocky layer of earth, which contrasts with lighter-colored sand underneath. Researchers believe that the figures once served as travel markers. Drone photography has led to several discoveries in recent years, Mr. Isla said. In 2019, researchers from Japan, aided by satellite photography and three-dimensional imaging, unearthed more than 140 new geoglyphs at the site. Research and conservation work had continued at the site even during the coronavirus pandemic, when most tourist sites have been closed. Archaeologists and employees were working on the Mirador Natural, a lookout point in the protected site, when they began unearthing something intriguing. When they cleaned the mound, clear lines showing the sinuous body of a cat emerged. “The figure was barely visible and was about to disappear because it is situated on quite a steep slope that’s prone to the effects of natural erosion,” the culture ministry said in a statement. The authorities said that even a stray footprint could mar the fragile grounds, and have imposed strict rules against trespassing at the site. Before the pandemic shut down tours, visitors were permitted to view the lines and figures only from planes and lookout points. But disturbances at the Nazca lines have occurred, drawing widespread condemnation. In 2014, Greenpeace activists left shoe marks near a large hummingbird design when they placed a sign that promoted renewable energy, Peruvian officials said. “You walk there and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years,” Luis Jaime Castillo, a Peruvian official and archaeologist, told The Guardian at the time. “And the line that they have destroyed is the most visible and most recognized of all.” In 2018, a truck driver was arrested after intentionally driving his tractor-trailer across three lines of geoglyphs. Even as Peru works to preserve its ancient sites, officials reopened Machu Picchu this month for one lucky tourist after he became stranded during the pandemic and waited seven months to see the 16th-century Inca citadel.']",Archaeologists came across the faded feline outline while conducting maintenance work at the UNESCO heritage site.
India Captures Chinese Soldier Along Disputed Mountain Border,2020-10-19,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — The Indian troops fed the captured Chinese soldier a meal. They gave him oxygen and some warm clothes. They treated him respectfully, both sides indicated, and the Indians said that they planned to release him soon. The Indian military revealed on Monday that its forces had captured a Chinese corporal who had strayed across the disputed, unmarked high-altitude border that zigzags between the two nations, the first time a soldier had been reported captured since hostilities exploded between India and China in June. The friendly treatment seemed to signal that maybe, finally, after rounds and rounds of talks, tensions were slightly easing between the Indian and Chinese troops positioned high up in the Himalayas. In June, a vicious brawl erupted in the same area, along the rocky edges of India’s Ladakh region, in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops were killed. Late on Monday, the Chinese military confirmed that one of its personnel had ended up in Indian hands. A soldier became lost on Sunday evening after agreeing to help a herder find a missing yak, Senior Col. Zhang Shuili, a spokesman for the People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theater Command, said in a statement on a Chinese military website. The Chinese forces asked for help from their Indian counterparts, who “agreed to give support and also promised to promptly return” the soldier, Colonel Zhang said. “We hope that the Indian side will abide by its promise and quickly transfer the individual who became lost back to the Chinese side.” Hu Xijin, editor of The Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party newspaper, said that Beijing and New Delhi were “working toward a proper resolution.” “This matter should not cause new tensions in the border area,” he wrote in a post on the social media site Weibo. “The smooth resolution of this matter is also a sign that the two countries have made progress in recent negotiations.” The Indian Army said in a statement on Monday that its troops had provided the food, clothing and other aid to the Chinese soldier to “protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions” and that he would be released “after completion of formalities.” Since June, Indian and Chinese officials have been meeting regularly. Both countries have nuclear weapons, and they seem to want a way out of the crisis, but both are also led by strong-willed nationalists unwilling to back down. The border area is considered strategically important. It snakes through icy mountain passes that rise higher than 15,000 feet and touches several contentious territories, such as Tibet and Kashmir. It has been a sore spot for decades. In 1962, the two nations went to war over the same area and China won, taking firm control of a high-altitude plateau, Aksai Chin, that India wants back. After the brawl in June, in which Chinese troops used spiked iron clubs to beat Indian soldiers to death, tens of thousands of reinforcements rushed in. Military analysts say that the troops remain dangerously close, in many places just a few hundred yards apart, and that they are backed up by fighter jets, tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers. Several soldiers were captured during the June fighting and in the smaller brawls that led up to it in April and May. A few shots were even fired in September, breaking India and China’s longstanding agreement not to use firearms during border confrontations. Since then, though, it appears that both sides have invested more in the effort to talk out their differences. Indian and Chinese military officials have held seven rounds of discussions, and Indian officials said in a recent statement that they had “a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement” with their Chinese counterparts. But some Indian analysts said they were still a little suspicious. “The winter’s going to be tough,” said D.S. Hooda, a retired general. “I know that the Indian Army has considerable experience in operating in Ladakh during the winter months,” he said. “The P.L.A. also seems to be building habitat for housing troops during the winter,” referring to China’s forces, known as the People’s Liberation Army. Mr. Hooda said that during night patrols, soldiers sometimes inadvertently strayed across the border, which he said was most likely what had happened in the case of the captured Chinese soldier.

"In Azerbaijan, Pain and Loss Drive War Fever",2020-10-21,By Carlotta Gall and Ivor Prickett,"['BAKU, Azerbaijan — As dusk fell, the sound of wailing carried on the soft evening breeze. Women filled the courtyard of a small house, keening over a coffin draped in the national flag. Men clustered in hushed groups in the narrow alley outside. The working-class neighborhood of Ahmedli, in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, was mourning its first martyred son since war broke out anew between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the southern Caucasus three weeks ago. Eldar Aliyev, 26, a manager in one of Azerbaijan’s biggest finance companies and a volunteer soldier, had spent barely two weeks at the front before returning home in a coffin. Azerbaijan has not released numbers of military casualties, but funerals are underway, bringing the war home to its people. As well as Mr. Aliyev, a colonel of the army was also buried in Baku on Sunday. “If the nation calls, he has to go,” said Mr. Aliyev’s father, Suleyman Eldar Aliyev, standing against a wall and leaning on a crutch. His face deeply lined, he had few words. “Long live the nation,” he said. Azerbaijan is in full war mode as it engages in the heaviest fighting since the original conflict with Armenia in the early 1990s over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian district inside Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan suffered a bitter defeat then, losing about 13 percent of its territory, with as many as 26,000 dead and around 800,000 displaced. That’s where matters stood for 26 years of a frozen truce, interrupted periodically by spasms of violence that were quickly tamped down by outside powers. But Azerbaijan, an oil-and-gas-rich former Soviet republic, has been quietly rearming for years. When clashes broke out three weeks ago, the country plunged into an all-out war to reclaim the lands it lost. Around the capital of Baku, signs of war fever are not hard to spot. The country’s bright three-colored flag hangs from every public building, while giant screens along the main streets downtown play horrifying video footage of precision drone strikes on Armenian soldiers. Every few days, President Ilham Aliyev, who has ruled the country since inheriting the office from his father in 2003, speaks to the nation and announces the names of villages and towns that have been newly “liberated.” Anar Mamedov, 36, a cousin of the volunteer soldier who was buried in Baku on Sunday, said, “The Azerbaijani Army has shown its power.” “This will continue until we liberate the last piece of our land, and at the end I would like to note that everyone will finally understand Azerbaijan,” added Mr. Mamedov, himself a war veteran who lost an arm. “We were all waiting for this,” he said. “We were waiting for Ilham Aliyev to give the order.” Azerbaijan is a tightly controlled society where dissent is quickly quashed. Criticism of the war, where it exists, is muted. Yet the general mood is overwhelmingly supportive. In numerous interviews, Azerbaijanis expressed their frustration that peace efforts led by France, Russia and the United States have never brought a resolution, despite repeated United Nations resolutions in Azerbaijan’s favor. “This is not Aliyev’s war,” said Zaur Shiriyev, the South Caucasus analyst for the International Crisis Group, in reference to the president. “It is all of the people’s war.” Mr. Shiriyev said that many Armenians, and Western officials working in the region, had never fully understood how important the losses of both life and territory were to Azerbaijanis. An award-winning investigative journalist, Khadija Ismayilova, who was jailed by the Aliyev government for her work in 2015, said that she and other activists were keeping a moratorium on dissent while the war raged. “You keep it down because soldiers are dying there,” she said. But she said she could feel popular anger building in recent months as the Armenian side adopted an increasingly aggressive stance. “I am usually cool about politics,” she said, “but I was angry.” In a dilapidated, half-built school building in a northern suburb of Baku, more than 1,000 refugees still live in cramped, unsanitary conditions where they first found refuge from the war decades ago. Their rooms are divided by flimsy plywood walls and residents cook and hang washing along a narrow underground corridor. “Everyone lost hope with the peace discussions,” said Ulriya Suleymanova, 34, who lives with an extended family of eight in a damp set of rooms that smelled of the sewers below. “Our president offered peace for years, but nothing changed.” But now she has reason to celebrate. Both her family and that of her husband are refugees from Jabrail, a district near the Iranian border. She pulled out her cellphone and played a video of Azerbaijani soldiers celebrating a day earlier as they raised the national flag at a bridge near her village. “From 1993, we were called refugees, but now our lands have been liberated, we are no longer refugees,” she said. “We have proof. We saw the bridge and the flags in Jabrail. Of course we are very happy when we see these things. I was 7 when we left.” For Ms. Suleymanova, there is no doubt they will return home. In Baku, she works cleaning houses and her husband sells security cameras. But work has dried up with the coronavirus, and they are struggling, she said. “My grandfather had lands, we had fruit and vegetable farms,” she noted wistfully. “It was not like now, this poor life.” Many of the Azerbaijani refugees come from agricultural villages and towns in seven districts, including Jabrail, that surround Nagorno-Karabakh, which was populated mainly by ethnic Armenians and was always the focus of the dispute between the two countries. The districts now lie largely abandoned except for military defenses. The withdrawal of occupying Armenian troops and the return of the Azerbaijani refugees have long been considered first steps in any negotiated settlement. The Azerbaijani Army has sought to push back the Armenian troops by force, focusing on three of the southernmost districts, Fizuli, Jabrail and Zengilan, that border Iran. On Tuesday, the president, Mr. Aliyev, announced that troops had secured Zengilan, the third district, though an Armenian government spokesman said that heavy fighting was continuing. The declared capture of some of their home districts has fired the refugees with excitement but also brought painful emotions flooding back. “We were crying and smiling at the same time,” said Ulker Allahverdiyev, 78, a refugee at the derelict school building who lost her husband and a son in the war. A widow with five children, she worked as a cleaner in a school, but lost two more daughters in the years as a refugee. “I was working day and night,” she said. “I was scared of my own shadow.” A teenager lay asleep under covers on the sofa beside her. “Her uncle and her neighbor went to the war and we cannot reach them and we are worried about them, so we are taking care of her,” she said. Her memories from the earlier conflict were crowding in. “It makes it harder,” she said. “Our children become martyrs and I am very worried. All of them are my children.” But she said she supported the war. “Of course, I want to see peace. I don’t want people to die, but of course it is worth it.” Along an underground passage, another refugee, eager to talk, opened the door to a cramped single room where his wife and two sons have lived for two decades. Ceyhun Seymur Khudiyev is from the city of Agdam, a ghost town today, that remains under Armenian control. But he was fired with confidence. “I believe that we are going to get our lands back,” he said. “Justice is taking its place.” Even refugees who have been able to build businesses and buy property have started plans to return to their homes, said Eldar Hamzali, 26, whose family comes from Fizuli. He pulled up a page from Google maps to show his family house and land. Although the government has said it has secured much of Fizuli, the village where Mr. Hamzali’s family comes from is apparently not yet under Azerbaijani control. Nonetheless, he said his uncles had already decided where each would rebuild their homes. Mr. Hamzali has even been asked to calculate the costs of transporting the remains of relatives who died in exile for reburial in the village, he added. “The feeling that you are temporarily here never left us,” he said of his life growing up in Baku. “I think I could find some peace of mind. Here I’m a guest, but there it’s my village. I think I would feel much more secure.”']","As the country’s soldiers advance in the conflict with Armenia, every “liberated” territory is celebrated and tens of thousands of refugees plan their return to lost lands."
"After Teacher’s Decapitation, France Unleashes a Broad Crackdown on ‘the Enemy Within’",2020-10-19,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — France on Monday unleashed a broad crackdown on Muslims accused of extremism, carrying out dozens of raids, vowing to shut down aid groups and threatening to expel foreigners as anger swept the country following the decapitation of a middle school teacher for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class. Many of those swept up in raids were already in police files for showing “signals” of potential radicalization, like preaching radicalized sermons or sharing hate messages on social networks, government officials said. More than 200 others — the bulk already in prison — were threatened with a rare mass expulsion. But other groups targeted in the raids included Muslim associations previously given government subsidies for their work promoting better civic relations, and only 15 of the people arrested had any connection to the gruesome attack on Friday. The scope of the response was a measure of how the killing of Samuel Paty, a teacher in a suburb north of Paris, had reopened old wounds in France. The nation remains traumatized by terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists that killed scores in 2015, starting with the editorial offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine — whose cartoons the teacher had shown. As much as the Charlie Hebdo killings, the beheading of Mr. Paty has struck deep inside the French psyche as an assault on a principal pillar of the French republic — the secular public school system — as well as the nation’s devotion to freedom of speech. Thousands of people took to the streets in cities around France over the weekend to demonstrate their horror at the killing on Friday. And politicians, especially on the right, jostled to sound the alarm against “the enemy within,” as the hard-line interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, put it in a radio interview, referring to so-called radicalized Muslims. Some voices were raised against the breadth of the government’s raids, but in general the tone was set by President Emmanuel Macron’s likely principal challenger in 2022, the far right leader Marine Le Pen, whose party has targeted Muslims and immigrants for nearly 50 years. “This situation calls for a strategy of reconquest,” Ms. Le Pen said Monday. “Islamism is a bellicose ideology whose means of conquest is terrorism.” Even before the attack on Mr. Paty, Mr. Macron, looking to consolidate a right-leaning electorate that is his only solid base heading into the 2022 election, had embarked on a campaign against what he called “Islamist separatism” in a speech earlier this month. The speech reinforced the idea, current on France’s right, that there is a large and hostile Muslim contingent waiting in the wings — the country’s suburbs — to tear down French values. Mr. Macron vowed to end home-schooling as well as the practice of bringing in foreign imams. On Monday, the police began their work at 6 in the morning, going after “numerous” Muslims in multiple raids, Mr. Darmanin said. “Important police operations have been carried out starting this morning, targeting radicalized individuals,” Mr. Macron’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said in a speech Monday. “Other actions will follow,” Mr. Castex promised, against “networks and individuals who are attacking our basic values and the Republican ideal.” Some 51 Muslim aid organizations will also be targeted by the police this week, the interior minister said, some of which would be dissolved at Mr. Macron’s request. Mr. Darmanin called the most prominent of them, Collective Against Islamophobia, the C.C.I.F., which compiles a register of anti-Muslim acts, “an enemy of the republic.” Its former president, Marwan Muhammad, one of the most prominent of France’s Muslim activists, said the C.C.I.F. “didn’t have the slightest involvement” in the killing of Mr. Paty. Already, 15 people have been arrested, including family members of the suspect, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee named Abdullakh Anzorov, who was shot dead by the police Friday night after the killing. Also in custody is the father of a student at the school who had denounced Mr. Paty online for showing the caricatures and had demanded his dismissal. The video circulated widely on social media. The interior minister announced that it would expel 231 foreign citizens identified for their radicalism, including 180 who were already in prison. Those not imprisoned would soon be arrested, officials said. At times, the French government has expelled foreign Muslims it accuses of being radicalized. But a mass expulsion like the one currently envisioned is unusual. By day’s end it was not clear how many arrests had resulted from the police raids. Some of the country’s prominent Muslim preachers defended the government’s actions. “When the war has already been declared, what you need is a wartime government,” said Hassen Chalghoumi, president of the French Imams’ Congress. But a few Muslim scholars raised questions — not just about the raids, but also about Mr. Paty’s use of the Muhammad caricatures in class. On Monday’s raids, some said politics appeared to be winning out over good sense. “I’m afraid that there has been a rush into a certain number of decisions,” said Rachid Benzine, a political scientist. “It’s, ‘We’re going to do these raids’ — and then they have nothing to do with the actual investigation. It seems like these are punitive expeditions, kind of score-settling.” “And of course there’s a risk that the courts will eventually reject all of this,” Mr. Benzine added. Mr. Macron will deliver a solemn eulogy to Mr. Paty on Wednesday at the Sorbonne. He has already been hailed as a martyr of the French Republic. The emotion of thousands who turned out for him across France was real. A huge gathering at the Place de la Republique in Paris recalled the ones held after the attacks of 2015. But a few wondered about what had transpired in Mr. Paty’s class. “I feel like it’s very hard to use these cartoons for strictly educational purposes,” said Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, EHESS, in Paris. “Secularists think that it is their right, because of the law that allows blasphemy and any form of mockery of religion. But on the other hand, there is the feeling that in doing so, it is the Muslims who are despised, not the prophet,” he said. “By using cartoons to teach freedom of expression, we do not understand that we offend people,” Mr. Khosrokhavar said. “There are a thousand ways to express freedom of expression, so why choose this one?” Françoise Lorcerie, an education expert at the National Center for Scientific Research, said she had never heard of using the caricatures of the prophet in a classroom setting for students of that age. And she was critical of Mr. Paty’s invitation to Muslim students that they leave the class to avoid being offended. “Obviously these caricatures are wounding for Muslims,” said Ms. Lorcerie. “I’m not so sure about presenting these caricatures, without some sort of justification,” she said.  From the standpoint of the absolute value of secularism, “it doesn’t conform to his obligation to be neutral,” Ms. Lorcerie said. “There should be a reflection on all of this.” Constant Meheut and Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']","With dozens of raids against Muslim individuals and groups accused of radicalism, the fury of the response had France’s right wing speaking in terms of warfare."
India Returns a Chinese Soldier Who Got Lost Looking for Yaks,2020-10-21,By Steven Lee Myers,"['India on Wednesday released a Chinese soldier its forces had detained along the disputed mountainous border with China, signaling an easing of months of tensions that at times this summer had threatened to descend into a broader conflict. The soldier inadvertently crossed the border while helping local herdsmen search for missing yaks, according to the news agency of the People’s Liberation Army, which reported his return on Wednesday morning. The Indian military identified him as Cpl. Wang Yalong. The statement offered no new details about the circumstances of his disappearance, including why he would have wandered off unaccompanied by other troops. He was the first Chinese soldier detained by the Indian military since tensions escalated this year. Corporal Wang stumbled into an Indian border post at the base of a hill around 2 a.m. on Monday, an Indian official said. He was wearing civilian clothes and unarmed, and Indian officials believe that he was either genuinely lost or sent on a mission to scout out Indian defenses. Indian forces have surged to the frontier, high in the Himalayas, following a series of incursions by China that began in April into mountainous terrain that India claims as its own, escalating a border dispute that has simmered for decades. Violence erupted in June, when Chinese and Indian soldiers fought with clubs and other makeshift weapons. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, as well as an undisclosed number of Chinese. Soldiers have repeatedly confronted each other since then, and at least one other soldier died after stepping on a land mine. Both sides have sent reinforcements to the border, settling in for the winter dangerously close to each other, in many places only a few hundred yards apart. In September, a few shots were fired for the first time in decades, breaking a longstanding agreement not to use firearms during border confrontations. The clash has whipped up nationalist fervor on both sides of the border and derailed relations that had in recent years shown signs of warming, leaving little room for the countries’ leaders, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, to make concessions. In September, though, the foreign ministers of the two countries announced a five-point agreement to defuse the immediate standoff, if not the underlying territorial disputes. Since then, Indian and Chinese military officials have held a series of discussions that appear to have made some progress in avoiding new violence. An eighth round of talks is scheduled this week. The Indian Army, in disclosing the soldier’s detention on Monday, said that it had given him food, warm clothes, oxygen and medical care to “protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions.” Conditions along the frontier — where the elevation exceeds 14,000 feet — have become even more forbidding with the onset of winter. The Global Times, a newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China that often assumes a nationalist tone, welcomed the soldier’s release on Wednesday, calling it a “positive sign” ahead of the next round of talks. Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from New Delhi.']","After months of tension that turned violent at times, the release signaled a respite in a dispute that has led to a buildup of forces along the disputed mountainous border."
"Europe’s museums are open, but the public isn’t coming.",2020-10-19,By Nina Siegal,"['As cultural institutions reopen across the United States, with new coronavirus protocols in place, many have been looking to Europe, where many museums have been open since May, for a preview of how the public might respond to the invitation to return. So far, there’s little reason to be optimistic. Almost all European museums are suffering from visitor losses, but their ability to cope depends almost entirely on how they are funded. Institutions supported by government funding are able to weather the storm with a little belt-tightening, while those that depend on ticket sales are facing tougher choices. Many are laying off employees and restructuring their business models. Visitor information from across Europe tells a fairly consistent story: Museums that have reopened have about a third of the visitors they had this time last year. The Louvre in Paris reports about 4,500 to 5,000 visitors a day, compared with about 15,000 a year ago. The State Museums of Berlin, a group of 18 museums in the German capital, reports about 30 percent of its usual attendance. Others are faring worse. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is down to about 400 visitors a day, when it used to welcome 6,500. “It’s really very, very quiet in the museum,” said its director, Emilie Gordenker. Travel restrictions and border closings have dramatically reduced the numbers of international tourists in European capitals. Over the summer, institutions in the Netherlands reported a boost in tourism from neighboring Belgium and Germany. That waned again when the school year started in September, and a surge of new coronavirus cases in the Netherlands led to “code red” alerts in several Dutch cities, including Amsterdam. European governments support many national cultural institutions, but there is a broad range of business models across the continent, from privately established museums that receive virtually no government money to those that are wholly subsidized by taxpayers. In recent years, however, governments in many countries, including the Netherlands, have been cutting support of museums, as politicians have encouraged the “American model” of funding, with more reliance on earned income.']",
"In China, the Formidable Prosecutor Turned Lonely Rights Defender",2020-10-20,By Amy Qin,"['Yang Bin was at home when two dozen Chinese police surrounded her house and entered, searching for the man she had recently taken in as a houseguest. Filing in quickly, the officers found their suspect upstairs and arrested him, ending a weekslong manhunt. The police also detained Ms. Yang for questioning. They wanted to know how Xu Zhiyong, one of China’s most outspoken government critics, had come to find refuge with her, a Communist Party member and former government prosecutor. For Ms. Yang, the turn of events came with no small irony. In her old job, she had escorted death row prisoners to a police station near the one in which she was being interrogated, in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. This time she was regarded as a suspect, and the police had also taken her husband and 20-year-old son. “Even though I was being questioned like a criminal, I knew in my heart I hadn’t done anything wrong,” Ms. Yang, 50, who was later released with her family, said in a recent telephone interview from her home on Seagull Island, a rural area on the outskirts of Guangzhou. “When many people look at the system, they see its strength. When I look at it, I see only its fragility.” Ms. Yang’s evolution from government prosecutor to defense lawyer with sympathies for pro-democracy activists is more than just an unusual career trajectory in China. It embodies the disillusionment of those in the Communist Party establishment who have found the space for internal dissent shrinking rapidly amid the worst repression in recent years. An insider in the Communist Party-controlled legal system, Ms. Yang spent 23 years as a prosecutor in Guangzhou. She developed a fearsome reputation, racking up hundreds of convictions of murderers, thieves and drug dealers with clinical efficiency. That experience has given her a deep understanding of the system’s flaws. The courts are sharply tilted in favor of the police and prosecutors and wrongful convictions are common. She once believed in working within the party in the hope that economic progress would bring political openness and a fairer justice system. But when she tried to apply her ideals at work she found herself sidelined and assigned a desk job. That, to her, was proof that the party-controlled system could no longer tolerate even its most loyal critics. Five years ago, she quit to become a defense lawyer, taking on cases that challenge powerful vested interests, such as defending farmers who were being thrown off their land by corrupt local officials. Now her line of work has made her a target of the authorities, who recently revoked her license. Defense lawyers in China often face harassment, disbarment, beatings and imprisonment for their work, particularly if they take on politically sensitive cases. “In China, there is room for exceptional and compassionate people to change things in the system,” said Jeremy L. Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center. “But for some people there comes a moment when you start to believe that nothing you do can stop the worst of injustices.” Since rising to power in 2012, China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, has tightened control over the judiciary and waged a blistering campaign against rights lawyers and activists. Some former establishment insiders have paid a heavy price for criticizing the government, including Ren Zhiqiang, a tycoon and decades-long Communist Party member who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in September after he criticized Mr. Xi.  Ms. Yang, the lawyer, said she used to describe herself as being with the party’s “reform faction,” a loose label for those who hoped for change to come from within the system. She paused, and then laughed darkly. “I guess you could say I belong to the ‘despair faction’ now.” Ms. Yang first rose to national prominence in 2005 when she, as a prosecutor, made a surprising plea for leniency for Zhou Moying, an impoverished migrant worker convicted of drowning her baby. Ms. Zhou, who was already struggling to raise three children, had killed her sick 8-month-old daughter in desperation because she could not pay for her medical treatment. “We must not forget the people behind her who are struggling at the bottom of society,” Ms. Yang said at the time. “This is the conscience that the law should have.” The judge handed down a 10-year prison sentence, but Ms. Yang helped Ms. Zhou find a lawyer to file an appeal, which led to a reduction of her sentence to six years. When Ms. Zhou was released from prison in 2011, many news outlets praised Ms. Yang for her unusual compassion. “I realized that as a prosecutor I could — that I should — make an impact on individual lives,” Ms. Yang recalled. Growing up in a family of factory workers in a small town in Hunan Province, she had rarely felt as empowered. After university, she moved to Guangdong Province in 1992 where she later found work at a local county prosecutor’s office. She began to handle criminal cases at the age of 28 and within several years was promoted to a position in the top prosecutors’ office in Guangzhou. Despite the tight constraints of the job, Ms. Yang looked for ways to push the boundaries. In one case, she brought relatives of a homicide victim and the defendant together for reconciliation. In another, she tracked down the family of a man who she believed had been wrongfully convicted, and offered to help them appeal the sentence. Ms. Yang was publicly praised for her empathy in the case of Zhou Moying but said she faced resistance internally. In 2011, Ms. Yang was pulled from the courtroom and reassigned to a desk job. “I felt like I had lost my soul,” she said. In 2015, Ms. Yang quit.  She yearned for the freedom to take on cases without political intervention.  As a defense lawyer, she successfully sued the Guangzhou Lawyers Association for requiring attorneys to prove that they had no criminal record before practicing, arguing that it placed an undue burden on lawyers. She has also represented villagers in southwestern Yunnan province embroiled in a land dispute with local officials. For years, Ms. Yang and her husband rented a large house on Seagull Island to use as a vacation home and an event space. One day in February, Xu Zhiyong, an outspoken critic of Mr. Xi, showed up at the house, to Ms. Yang’s surprise. They had met only a few times before though she had long admired his work, she said. She said that she had been unaware that he had been on the run since December. On Feb. 15, the police found Mr. Xu on the third floor of her house. He has been accused of subversion. Li Qiaochu, Mr. Xu’s partner, said  the dissident was grateful for the support of people like Ms. Yang. “He said that his mental state has been decent, which has everything to do with friends like Yang Bin,” Ms. Li said. Though the police ultimately released Ms. Yang without charge, the lawyer fears that she, too, could soon be in trouble. The police installed cameras to watch the entrance of her family’s home and garage, she said. Her license to practice was also recently revoked after the law firm she had worked for in Guangzhou refused to renew her contract last year, because she thinks, of her advocacy on behalf of her clients. Ms. Yang said she planned to sue the government but was not optimistic. Still, Ms. Yang says she had no regrets about the path that she has chosen. “The freedom I gained is freedom that would be unimaginable to those within the system,” Ms. Yang said. “Then again, freedom for Chinese people is always very limited.” Cao Li contributed reporting.']","After sheltering a prominent dissident, Yang Bin, a former prosecutor, is now under the scrutiny of the police.

Line holders are paid to wait all night outside a motor vehicle office.,2020-10-20,By Lauren Hard,"['In a New Jersey suburb, a woman sets up a tent around 8 p.m. outside a state Motor Vehicle Commission office. She will spend the night there, accompanied by her 4-year-old son, until just before the office opens at 8 a.m. The woman, Sumbal Nadeem, doesn’t need a driver’s license or anything else from the agency. But she does need money. She is being paid $150 to hold a place in line by a motorist who needs a car registration. The pandemic has spawned a new class of worker in New Jersey: line holders who, for a fee, will wait for hours, sometimes all night, outside a branch of the Motor Vehicle Commission — which was closed for four months — until whoever hired them comes to take that place right before the office opens. The Motor Vehicle Commission has been overwhelmed by demand since it reopened in early July, after having shut down in March during the state’s lockdown. Even after making some services available online and pushing back the expiration dates for certain documents, the agency’s 39 locations — where paperwork is processed — have been inundated by customers. Lines stretch for blocks in the wee hours of the morning. Because of capacity limits to protect public health, offices often start turning people away by mid- or late morning. The agency itself has been hit by the virus, with some offices forced to close for two weeks after employees tested positive. Gov. Philip D. Murphy has acknowledged the aggravation many motorists have experienced, especially as temperatures drop. “Folks are frustrated by long lines, and so am I,” the governor recently told reporters. While these struggles have been maddening to many, for others they have created an opportunity to make money at time when New Jersey has only added back about half of the 800,000 jobs it lost in March and April. Websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are filled with people offering to stand in line, charging $50 to $600.']",
E.U. Tells Cyprus and Malta to Abandon ‘Golden Passports’,2020-10-20,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Monika Pronczuk,"['BRUSSELS — Cyprus and Malta will face European Union penalties if they do not abandon lucrative programs that sell “golden passports” to foreigners, the bloc says, a long-anticipated crackdown on a practice that in certain cases furnished foreigners — some accused of crimes in their home countries — with travel documents. The European Commission, the bloc’s administrative branch, has for years had the two nations in its cross hairs over the practice, and its hand was forced by recent revelations of highly placed politicians being involved in the programs. Most recently, an Al Jazeera investigation in Cyprus purported to show egregious practices by prominent politicians that could enable rich people with criminal records to acquire E.U. passports through citizenship of the two countries, offering them legal protections and the right to freely travel in the bloc. The initiatives have brought a windfall to the two island nations over the years. Both are known for lax financial regulation frameworks and have a history of building opaque banking systems that have been used for money laundering and tax avoidance, particularly by Russian and Asian billionaires. Bulgaria, which is also operating a pay-for-passports program, is being investigated by the commission and could face similar legal action down the line. And while the Cypriot and Maltese initiatives are the most notorious in the bloc, most E.U. countries offer residency-for-investment programs that have been criticized by anticorruption activists and by the bloc itself. Twenty of its 27 members give foreign investors residency rights in exchange for payment, which in some cases put the investors on a path to full citizenship. In a 2018 report, the anticorruption organization Global Witness found that 100,000 people had made use of such initiatives, known as “golden visas,” to acquire legal residence in European Union countries. A 2019 European Commission report said that even the lighter programs, which offered residence benefits to investors, were a cause for concern and risked being abused. In announcing its decision to open infringement proceedings against Cyprus and Malta, the commission said in a statement on Tuesday that “the granting of E.U. citizenship for predetermined payments or investments without any genuine link with the member states concerned undermines the essence of E.U. citizenship.” The infringement process is fairly lengthy. The first stage consists of information exchanges between the European Commission and the countries in question, and the countries’ authorities have two months to reply to the accusations. If the responses are not “satisfactory,” then the commission can up the ante, making penalties more likely. Any punishment for Cyprus and Malta will come only if they do not scrap the programs by the end of the process. Cyprus, which went bankrupt in 2013, promised to overhaul its banking sector and introduce stronger safeguards in exchange for a bailout from other European countries and the International Monetary Fund. While many commercial banks were subject to overhauls, the passport program was seen as a new way of doing business with clientele that had previously relied on the island’s opaque financial services. The “golden passport” plans also offered the island economies with limited resources and small industrial, agricultural and manufacturing sectors a source of state revenue that avoided investing in other sectors or raising taxes. And in the cases of both Cyprus and Malta, it played to their strengths as financial services centers with significant expert work forces. Since Cyprus began its current program in 2013, it has issued about 4,000 passports, raising 7 billion euros, or around $8.2 billion, in revenue. The program allows foreigners to get a Cypriot passport in exchange for at least €2 million investment in the country, usually in real estate, with minimal additional requirements and a light-touch oversight process. The country last year stripped 26 people from Cambodia, Iran, Malaysia and Russia of recently granted passports, most prominent among them Jho Low, a Malaysian financier on the run for a major financial scandal known as 1MDB. Mr. Low has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, Cyprus said that it would end its golden passport program as of Nov. 1 but that it would continue to process the backlog of applications. And while the government acknowledged that the initiative had been abused, it denied any wrongdoing. In Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela spoke out in favor of its program on Monday in anticipation of the E.U. legal action. “We will be defending Malta,” he said, according to local news media. Mr. Abela also pointed to the financial lift that it had given the country. “Had it not been for the contributions from that program, which we are in the process of winding down, we would probably not have been in a position to present a budget of this scale,” Mr. Abela said. Malta’s program was started in 2014, and by mid-2017 had issued more than 2,000 passports and raised €718 million, according to the 2018 Global Witness report. The office that oversees the Maltese program did not reply to a New York Times request on Tuesday for more up-to-date information and comment. The European Commission seemed unconvinced by pledges to end the program in Cyprus and overhaul it in Malta. “Malta in fact informed the commission that it envisages the prolongation of citizenship for investment,” a spokesman, Christian Wigand, said on Tuesday. “And while Cyprus very recently announced it will end its current scheme as of 1st of November, it will continue to process pending applications.” “We understand there are already calls regarding the introduction of new schemes,” Mr. Wigand added. “Such schemes are in violation of E.U. law, and this is why we are launching the infringements today.” Activists welcomed the news on Tuesday. “For years, the governments of both countries have ignored public outrage,” Laure Brillaud of Transparency International E.U. said in a statement. “The European Commission’s decision means they could find themselves in the European Court of Justice unless both countries take swift action to end the abuse.” “We are hopeful that the infringement procedures will be complemented by the urgent and necessary E.U.-wide reform,” she added. “The European Commission should present a plan for phasing out the golden visa schemes as the next step.”']","The two countries have raised billions of euros by selling thousands of coveted travel documents, even in some cases granting citizenship to foreigners fleeing arrest warrants."
"Mask mandate? In a Montana town, it ‘puts us at odds with customers.’",2020-10-20,By Amy Haimerl,"['This summer, Governor Steve Bullock of Montana mandated face coverings in public spaces to combat a spike in Covid-19 cases. But the sheriff in the town of Hamilton, backed up by the Ravalli County commissioners, elected not to enforce the order, saying individual rights took priority. That decision left small businesses stuck in the middle of a monthslong national conflict over mask wearing as they try to keep staff safe and their doors open without alienating customers. For the owner of River Rising Bakery, Nicki Ransier, the commissioners’ decision made her life easier: “It kind of took some pressure off of us, because we’re not having that confrontation with our customers when they walk in.” Before the governor’s order, Ms. Ransier asked her staff to wear masks, but a few customers berated her employees — some of whom are in high school — over the decision. One customer told the teenagers that they were “bending the knee to tyranny” by following Mr. Bullock’s order. Other patrons wanted Ms. Ransier to flatly require masks for all and install costly plexiglass barriers. She felt she couldn’t please anyone, so she decided her policy would focus on what she could control: employees. She would let customers choose, but ask her 14 workers to wear masks even though it can be hot and miserable. But the commissioners’ move frustrated Randy Lint, the owner of Big Creek Coffee Roasters. He thought the governor’s order would put an end to mask conflicts. Instead, he said, the commissioners’ decision “puts us at odds with customers.” “Dealing with fallout from stressed customers has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic,” Mr. Lint said.']",
2 Broke Artists Started a Bakery at Home. It’s a Pandemic Hit.,2020-10-21,By Natalie Kitroeff,"['MEXICO CITY — A toaster oven may not be the ideal gadget for starting a full-fledged bakery, but this is a pandemic and everyone is doing their best with what they have. And what two artists in Mexico City had was a $42 toaster oven. “We were broke,” said Andrea Ferrero, shrugging her elbows out of a bowl of cake batter. “We bought it on credit.” Like legions of others around the world stuck in coronavirus lockdown, Ms. Ferrero and her boyfriend, David Ayala-Alfonso, began baking several months ago to escape unrelenting boredom. They turned out to be very good at it. So they started an addictive Instagram account, Cuarentena Baking, or Quarantine Baking, to showcase their cookies, cakes and doughnuts. And they have since amassed hundreds of clients. With a viable business, they’ve moved out of their tiny apartment into a bigger place — one with a real oven. Their success, a rare bit of good news in a country pummeled by the coronavirus, is a testament to the power of cooking as a survival strategy in Mexico’s food-obsessed capital. Before the virus struck, the streets of Mexico City were already flush with taco stands, people serving tamales on bicycles, and carts offering roasted sweet potatoes or corn on the cob slathered with mayo, cheese and chili powder. The pandemic and the attendant loss of millions of jobs across the country have pushed even more people to try their hand at selling their home cooking. “In Mexico, someone’s kitchen is home, and street food is someone’s home brought to the street,” said Pati Jinich, a Mexican chef and cookbook author. “For people with no resources, they can make the food they grew up eating or they were taught — or just the one thing that they had.” Across the city, there’s been a blossoming of so-called ghost kitchens — set up to make food exclusively for delivery, with the preparation often done in people’s apartments. When their family’s catering business in the capital lost steam, Jonathan Weintraub and his brother Gabriel started selling pastrami sandwiches under the moniker “Schmaltzy Bros Delicatessen.” After getting laid off, Fahrunnisa Bellak turned bagel-making into a full-time job and is now opening a storefront. Encouraged by his wife, Pedro Reyes, a food writer, decided to package and sell his popular salsa macha, a nut-filled hot salsa. He said his venture has a natural market in Mexico City, where an inordinate share of conversations revolve entirely around food. “Most people here like to eat well and they brag about knowing where to eat,” Mr. Reyes said. “That helps people open up to these small businesses, to be able to say, ‘I want to buy cookies from this guy and paella from that one.’” The popularity of Cuarentena Baking has a lot to do with its Instagram account, which every day features close-ups of the owners’ confections, like gooey filling smooshed into a brownie or spilling out of cakes. Instead of advertising out-of-reach luxury for fantasy browsing, it offers something attainable for people with $1.75 to spend on a mound of pure joy. At first, the couple posted pictures just for their friends, who would send them tequila or homemade hummus in exchange for samples. Then friends of friends started placing orders. Someone asked for a menu, so they invented one including babkas, doughnuts, sourdough and later, cakes and brownies. Besides sourdough, the couple had never made any of these treats before quarantine. At first, everything besides the cakes was baked inside their toaster oven. Moving into a new apartment has given the couple only slightly more control over the bedlam of operating a full-fledged bakery from home during a global health crisis. “I obsessively plan,” Ms. Ferrero said. “And then, chaos.” Their home looks like what would happen if Santa’s workshop were located inside a dorm room. The kitchen fits a maximum of four people comfortably. The assembly area is squished into what would be a modest second bedroom. Their trash can is a stool turned upside down with a garbage bag fitted over the four legs. On a recent Saturday, while frenetically churning cake and then brownie batter, Ms. Ferrero asked herself the following questions: “Did I already put eggs in this?” (No.) “Did we run out of vanilla?” (Yes.) “Was this cake supposed to have three layers?” (It was.) She eyed the day’s to-do list — 61 jars filled with cake, icing and crumbled cookies, a best-selling concoction; 162 brownies; 38 cookies; and three cakes — and picked up her phone to respond to the messages flooding her inbox. “Can I come pick the order up now?” she said, reading one of them aloud. “No!” Ms. Fererro, originally from Peru, is a sculptor, and Mr. Ayala-Alfonso, born in Colombia, is a curator — trades that are at least tangentially connected to building structures out of dough and creating an alluring visual vibe on Instagram. But their transformation into professional bakers has not been without mishap. They have started several oven fires, sent countless incomplete or late orders, and once had a delivery person disappear with several brownies and a cheesecake. They constantly run out of ingredients. Over the last few months, Mr. Ayala-Alfonso said, they’ve been working to perfect their craft, searching YouTube for videos on “how to make a cake,” and “why is my cake falling down,” and “what’s the difference between baking soda and powder.” They also recently hired an artist friend, Yorely Valero, to help manage the onslaught of orders a few days a week. They have developed a special intimacy with clients. People ask them to write love notes to their crushes, on top of boxes of brownies. One regular asked Ms. Ferrero to not draw her signature hearts on a box that was to be delivered as a six-month anniversary gift to a boyfriend, because it might scare him off. “I said ‘sure, good luck!’” Ms. Ferrero said. “You’re already interacting on social media more because of quarantine, so people actually talk to us,” Mr. Ayala-Alfonso said. “Our account is a support line.” By 2 p.m. on the recent Saturday, when they officially start handing out orders, a small crowd of couriers and customers was waiting outside the Cuarentena Baking headquarters, which is on a tree-lined street in Roma Norte, a hipster neighborhood south of the city’s center. One woman, who had been waiting for 10 minutes, let out a long sigh and a terse “thank you” when Mr. Ayala-Alfonso handed her a box of cookies. Half an hour later, the woman messaged the Instagram account: “It was worth the wait ;)”']","They didn’t have an oven. Their apartment resembled Santa’s workshop set up in a dorm room.

High-Level U.S. Mission to Syria Sought Release of American Prisoners,2020-10-19,By Richard Pérez-Peña,"['High-level United States officials traveled recently to Syria for rare talks with the Assad government in an attempt to secure the release of American citizens held prisoner there, a high priority for the Trump administration, but there has been little apparent progress so far, officials said. The secret U.S. mission to Damascus in August focused on Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was seized while reporting on the Syrian civil war in 2012, and Majd Kamalmaz, a psychotherapist who was taken in 2017. The trip was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by two U.S. officials with knowledge of American operations in the Middle East, including a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The senior official cautioned that the attempt was still in its early stages, and that the U.S. government did not have any recent proof that Mr. Tice, 39, was still alive. The Syrian government has not publicly acknowledged holding either him or Mr. Kamalmaz, 62, who is diabetic and requires regular medication, according to his family and the U.S. government. Previous contacts by the United States about prisoners held by President Bashar al-Assad’s government have fizzled out, but his regime — which would like to see economic sanctions lifted and American troops withdrawn from Syria — has much to gain, potentially, from improved relations with Washington. The Trump administration has secured the release of people held in several other countries in the Middle East, a goal of particular interest to the president. In August, Kashyap Patel, the senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council, and Roger D. Carstens, the State Department’s special envoy for hostage affairs, went to Damascus to meet with Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria’s National Security Bureau intelligence service, U.S. officials said. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been minimal since the United States closed its embassy in Damascus in 2012 and ordered the closure of the Syrian embassy in Washington in 2014. The United States has long labeled Syria, considered a pariah state by much of the world, as a sponsor of terrorism, and has imposed sanctions on the country and its officials for human rights violations before and during the war that began in 2011. But in 2017, Mike Pompeo, then the C.I.A. director, called Mr. Mamlouk to open back-channel communications on Mr. Tice. Washington then sent an intermediary to see Mr. Mamlouk, the officials said. They met for hours and the intermediary delivered an unsigned letter from the U.S. government. But the effort was put on hold the next year, when the Syrian government launched a chemical attack on a rebel-held area, and the United States responded with missile strikes on Syrian targets. Weeks later, French authorities issued international arrest warrants for Mr. Mamlouk and other officials, in connection with torture, killings and war crimes. In August 2018, the C.I.A. sent a top agency official with expertise in the Middle East to meet Mr. Mamlouk in Damascus, where the official raised the case of Mr. Tice. A year ago, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of most of the American troops in Syria, in effect ceding back to Mr. Assad territory that had been captured from the Islamic State. Critics questioned why the administration had not demanded anything from Syria in return, like the release of prisoners. Mr. Tice, a Marine Corps veteran, was attending law school at Georgetown University when he decided to cover the war in Syria, where he wrote articles for several news organizations. His family has been outspoken about maintaining interest in his case and seeking his release, and said as recently as 2018 they were confident he was still alive. “For years we have pushed for engagement between the U.S. and Syrian governments to help bring our son safely home, so we hope recent reports are accurate,” his parents, Marc and Debra Tice, said in a statement released on Monday. “We are deeply grateful to everyone working for Austin’s safe return, and his continued absence shows there is more to be done.” Mr. Kamalmaz, who was born in Syria and grew up in the United States, had established a mental health clinic in Lebanon for refugees from the Syrian war. He went to Syria to visit family members and was taken the day after he arrived. Reporting was contributed by Adam Goldman and Edward Wong.']","Though the two countries barely talk, American officials met in Damascus with a Syrian intelligence chief to discuss two U.S. citizens held in Syria, Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz."
Spanish Judge Releases a Fugitive Italian Mafia Suspect,2020-10-20,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A Spanish judge has released a fugitive Italian organized-crime suspect just days after his arrest, and a court spokesman said on Tuesday that the judge was unaware the man had been identified as a leading figure in a powerful criminal operation. The apparent blunder was a painful blow to a two-year manhunt and investigation, conducted by the Spanish police in collaboration with the Italian police, that led to the Oct. 10 arrest of the fugitive, Vittorio Raso, 41. On Oct. 12, the Spanish police made his arrest public, identifying Mr. Raso as a “vangelo,” or high-ranking member of the Calabrian ’Ndrangheta criminal organization, and local media widely reported it. One day later, just a few days after his arrest, Judge Alejandro Abascal of Spain’s national court freed him. The court spokesman said the judge thought Mr. Raso had been charged only with extortion. “The information that he had at the time didn’t include any mention of his role in the ’Ndrangheta,” the court spokesman said. A spokeswoman for Spain’s national police on Tuesday did not say whether the Spanish police had provided the judge with sufficient information about the charges against the suspect. “Once we put somebody at the disposal of the judiciary, it is no longer for us to handle,” she said. Both the police spokeswoman and the court spokesman insisted their names be withheld, as is common practice for official spokespeople in Spain. ’Ndrangheta has become one of the most powerful criminal organizations in Italy because of connections with Latin American drug cartels that, over time, made the organization the top importer of cocaine into Europe. It gained international infamy through killings in Italy and abroad as well as multimillion-dollar investments in restaurants and real estate in Rome and across the world. At a trial held in his absence in Italy in 2018, Mr. Raso was found guilty of usury and drug trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison, a sentence and convictions that would become final only if an appeals process is exhausted. He was also wanted on a European arrest warrant on charges of belonging to a criminal organization, drug trafficking and extortion. Mr. Raso was arrested in Barcelona and afterward, Italian police raided different homes in the city of Turin, where he had previously been based, seizing weapons, about 360,000 euros — around $423,000 — and 13 kilograms of drugs. On Oct. 13, he appeared by videoconference before Judge Abascal, who is based in Madrid. The court spokesman confirmed that the judge had interviewed Mr. Raso and decided that he should be released, pending trial on the extortion charge. To reduce the flight risk, the judge ordered that Mr. Raso hand over his passport and report weekly to the police. The Spanish court has reissued an arrest warrant for Mr. Raso, but it was not immediately known whether he was still in Spain or had fled the country. Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Italy.']",A court spokesman said the judge had not been aware of accusations linking the fugitive to organized crime.
"Peter Madsen, Who Killed Kim Wall in a Submarine, Briefly Escapes Prison",2020-10-20,By Martin Selsoe Sorensen and Megan Specia,"['ODENSE, Denmark — Armed with what the police believe was a fake gun and a mock explosive belt, Peter Madsen ran for the gates at the prison outside Copenhagen where he was serving a life sentence for killing the journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine three years ago. But while he managed to get outside the walls of the prison Tuesday morning, he didn’t get far. Five minutes later and just half a mile away, police officers surrounded and eventually detained him, bringing the prison break to a close. Mr. Madsen, a Danish inventor, was already notorious after his conviction in the 2017 killing of and dismemberment of Ms. Wall aboard the submarine he built himself near Copenhagen in a case that horrified the nation. His escape from Herstedvester Prison, on the western outskirts of the Danish capital, captured the country’s attention again, as photos and television footage emerged on local media of Mr. Madsen surrounded by armed police officers and bystanders shouting abuse at him. Mogens Lauridsen, the chief superintendent of the Western Copenhagen police, said at a briefing that in making his escape Mr. Madsen had worn what appeared to be a fake explosive belt and thrown away a “gunlike object” as he fled. “We don’t think it was a gun, but it looked like one,” Mr. Lauridsen said. He said the police were quickly able to surround Mr. Madsen, but took extra precautions because of the belt, and he was only taken back into custody several hours later. Further details on the gunlike object and the belt were not immediately available. Photos and videos posted by Ekstra Bladet, a local news outlet, appeared to show Mr. Madsen seated on the side of the road surrounded by armed police officers with the area cordoned off. Other footage from the scene shows bystanders angrily screaming profanities at Mr. Madsen, and “Drown yourself!” and “You should be dismembered!” The police said that Mr. Madsen didn’t appear to have received outside help in his escape attempt, but that they were investigating that possibility. Nick Haekkerup, the minister for justice, called the escape attempt “very serious” in a post on Twitter and said that prisoners serving a life sentence “shouldn’t be able to escape.” Mr. Madsen had taken a female prison psychologist hostage, the chairman of the prison workers’ union, Bo Yde Sorensen, told Ekstra Bladet, adding that he had been brandishing what appeared to be a gun. “The weapon was so lifelike that prison guards at the gate didn’t take any chances in relation to the hostage,” Mr. Sorensen told the newspaper. Mr. Madsen’s actions were deemed a danger to the prison worker’s life, prompting a decision to let him out of the gate, he said. “It’s a decision I support,” he said. “We don’t want to risk anybody getting killed — we have to find people afterward.” Guards followed Mr. Madsen as he fled, but stepped back when he threatened them, the news outlet reported, before the police eventually took him into custody. Hanne Hoegh Rasmussen, the head of the prison, would not comment on the reports of a hostage-taking but said during the Tuesday news conference that no one at the prison had been physically harmed. “But it’s been very psychologically stressful for everybody involved,” she said. Kirsten Schlichting, 78, who lives and works near the prison, spoke with TV 2, a national news network, and described a heavy police presence as officers tried to apprehend Mr. Madsen. “The only thing I’m worried about is the school which is also close by, but I don’t know if there are students there,” Ms. Schlichting said. “But I’m not afraid. There’s lots of police watching out.” Mr. Madsen was found guilty of the premeditated killing — equivalent to a murder conviction — of Ms. Wall in 2018 and sentenced to life in prison. A life sentence is rare in Denmark, even in murder cases, but Ms. Wall’s grisly death horrified the nation, and the brutality of the crime made Mr. Madsen’s trial one of the most closely watched in Scandinavian history. Ms. Wall, 30, disappeared after meeting Mr. Madsen for an interview aboard his submarine in August 2017. Her body was later discovered dismembered, and Mr. Madsen was arrested and charged with her killing. Mr. Madsen initially offered a series of shifting explanations about Ms. Wall’s whereabouts, before admitting to dismembering her body and tossing body parts overboard. But he denied killing her. Ms. Wall, a freelance journalist who had written for international outlets including The New York Times, graduated from the London School of Economics and received two master’s degrees from Columbia University. She reported from Uganda, Sri Lanka and Cuba, and died only miles from Trelleborg, Sweden, where she grew up. “Kim wanted to give a voice to people who didn’t have one,” Joachim Wall, her father, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “She was always looking for the story behind the story.”A television drama based on the police investigation of her killing premiered in Denmark last month. Martin Selsoe Sorensen reported from Odense, Denmark, and Megan Specia from London.

Festival Cancels Abu Dhabi Event After Allegations of Sexual Assault,2020-10-19,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — The Hay Festival, an annual staple of Britain’s literary calendar, announced on Monday that an offshoot event to promote freedom of speech and women’s empowerment would no longer be held in Abu Dhabi after one of its employees accused the United Arab Emirates’ minister of tolerance of sexual assault. In an article published by The Sunday Times of London over the weekend, the employee, Caitlin McNamara, 32, said that the minister, Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak al-Nahyan, who is also a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, assaulted her in February. In a statement issued later on Sunday, the festival said it would not hold the Abu Dhabi event as long as Sheikh al-Nahyan remained in the position. Caroline Michel, chair of the Hay Festival board, called the alleged attack “an appalling violation and a hideous abuse of trust and position.” “Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak al-Nahyan made a mockery of his ministerial responsibilities and tragically undermined his government’s attempt to work with Hay Festival to promote free speech and female empowerment,” she said in the statement. Sheikh al-Nahyan has denied the accusations, in a statement issued through his lawyers at the Schillings law firm in London. “Our client is surprised and saddened by this allegation, which arrives eight months after the alleged incident and via a national newspaper,” the law firm said. “The account is denied.” The event, a collaboration between the U.A.E. Ministry of Tolerance and the Hay Festival, brought together internationally acclaimed authors and thinkers in Abu Dhabi over four days in February. The festival organizers have defended their decision to go ahead with the 2020 event, even though the festival’s leadership was aware of Ms. McNamara’s allegations before hand. Ms. McNamara, who was hired by the Hay Festival to organize its first event in the U.A.E., spent six months working from the Ministry of Tolerance, which was created as “a bridge of communication between peoples of different cultures in a respectful environment that rejects extremism and emphasis on the acceptance of the other,” according to a government website. She said that Sheikh al-Nahyan invited her to a private dinner at an exclusive resort on Feb. 14, days before the festival, where he attacked her. She reported the events to the British Embassy in Abu Dhabi shortly after the alleged assault, according to The Sunday Times, and she has since been interviewed by Scotland Yard in Britain. The newspaper reported that Ms. McNamara was waiting to hear whether legal action can be taken against Sheikh al-Nahyan in Britain. She told the news outlet she had gone public with the story because she wanted to see him held accountable and because of the “massive mental and physical toll” the attack had taken on her. “I feel I have nothing to lose,” she said. “ I want to do this because I want to highlight the effect of powerful men like him doing things like that and thinking they can get away with it. It seemed clear from the set up I was not the first or last.” Attempts to reach Ms. McNamara were not immediately successful. The festival has grown from its roots as a literary gathering in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, to hosting several international gatherings. The event in February was its first in Abu Dhabi. But even before the sexual assault accusations, it had drawn controversy. Dozens of rights groups and prominent writers issued an open letter to festival organizers before it started, denouncing the United Arab Emirates’ rights record and calling for freedom of speech to be upheld. The event, billed as a platform for freedom of expression, seemed directly at odds with the country’s arbitrary detention of government critics and jailing of those who voice dissent, the critics said, The letter called the festival an opportunity for the country “to back up its promise of tolerance with actions that include the courageous contributors to freedom of expression who live in the country.” The United Arab Emirates has long been criticized for its suppression of political dissent, and limited protections for women under the leadership of the de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. “Despite declaring 2019 the ‘Year of Tolerance,’ United Arab Emirates rulers showed no tolerance for any manner of peaceful dissent,” the international monitoring group Human Rights Watch wrote in its annual world report assessing the rights situation in countries around the world.']",An employee of the Hay Festival in Abu Dhabi said she was accosted by the tolerance minister of the U.A.E. earlier this year.
"‘If There Were No Hashish Here, You Wouldn’t See a Single House’",2020-10-19,By Ben Hubbard,"['YAMOUNEH, Lebanon — In a Lebanese farming village of rocky soil and stone villas, cannabis grows everywhere. It fills the fields that surround the village and lines nearby roads where the army operates checkpoints. It sprouts in the weedy patches between homes and is mixed with other colorful blooms in flower beds. There is a cannabis crop near the mosque, and down the road from a giant yellow flag for Hezbollah, the militant group and political party whose leaders forbid its use on religious grounds. Jamal Chraif, the mukhtar, or village chief, of Yamouneh, praised cannabis as “a blessed shrub” for what he called its many beneficial properties and the ease of its cultivation. “There is something sacred about it,” he said. “God makes it grow.” But for the first time since he began growing cannabis two decades ago, Mr. Chraif planted none this year because a chain of events have erased most of the profits that used to come with the village’s main product: the hashish extracted from the plant. Instead, he is focusing on apples. He blames the woes afflicting the village, and Lebanon in general, on cosmic forces, including aliens, the Antichrist and the Bermuda Triangle — an explanation that could have been inspired by the drug itself. The reality is more terrestrial. The Lebanese pound has lost 80 percent of its value against the United States dollar since last fall, and farmers have taken the hit. The costs of imported fuel and fertilizer needed to grow the crop have soared, while the Lebanese pounds that growers earn by selling their hash are worth less and less. Lebanon’s financial crisis has also undermined the drug’s domestic market, and the war in Syria has snarled smuggling routes, making it harder for middlemen to reach foreign markets. This has forced painful choices in Yamouneh, a picturesque hamlet in a neglected pocket of Lebanon where drugs, poverty, religion and stunning natural beauty converge in unexpected ways. For as long as anyone alive can remember, the yearly cycle in Yamouneh has been driven by the planting, weeding and harvesting of cannabis. The hashish extracted from the plant and sold to smugglers who spirit it out of the country has done more than any other crop to help the village residents edge out of abject poverty. It has provided reliable income not offered by their legal, more fickle crops, like apples and potatoes, and funded home expansions, truck purchases and children’s educations. Now, the drug earns so little that some growers in Yamouneh doubt it is still worth producing. “It’s over,” Mr. Chraif said. “Now, growing hashish is a hobby.” The production here and in other communities made Lebanon the world’s third largest hashish supplier, after Morocco and Afghanistan, according to the United Nations. Although hashish, a cannabis concentrate with high levels of THC, is illegal to produce, possess and sell in Lebanon, the government earlier this year passed a law legalizing some cannabis cultivation for medicinal purposes. The law has yet to be implemented, and the cannabis grown in Yamouneh remains illegal because of its high THC content. Now Lebanon’s economic crisis threatens to do what years of army raids and government efforts to combat the drug never did: reduce hashish production. While fondly recalling the days when a kilogram of hashish easily fetched between $500 and $800 — and the few years when the price shot above $1,000 — the farmers fear the earnings for this year’s product could fall to around $100 per kilo, or about $45 a pound. “If the situation stays like this, we won’t plant,” one longtime grower said, speaking on condition of anonymity like others to avoid legal jeopardy. “Hope has been cut off.” But the full effects of hashish’s declining appeal as a cash crop are yet to be seen in the village. Even as some farmers are abandoning it, others are still clinging on. During a recent visit, scores of Syrian refugees swung scythes to fell waist-high cannabis plants outside town, then piled the cut stalks into large bales. Most were minors, some as young as 9, who said they welcomed the work since fears of the coronavirus had shut their schools. They earned about $2.50 for a long day in the sun. The landowner looked on, occasionally raising a shotgun from his shoulder to fire at birds overhead. He had grown up with hashish and said this was the worst year he had ever seen. The costs for imported supplies — fuel, fertilizer and plastic sheeting to bale the harvest — ate into his profits, but tradition kept him growing. “We were born into this,” he said. “If there were no hashish here, you wouldn’t see a single house in the village.” The 5,000 or so citizens of Yamouneh, at the base of a mountain in the Bekaa Valley, are Shiite Muslims. Nearly all share the same last name, Chraif. About 1,200 Syrians have settled in the area to look for work and escape the war across the border. Talal Chraif, the mayor and elected head of the village council — and a rare resident who says he has never grown cannabis — attributed its prominence to chronic unemployment and the plant’s suitability for the local environment. “No sickness afflicts it. The bugs don’t attack it. The lack of water doesn’t affect it,” Mr. Chraif said. “There is a guarantee with the crop, and that is why the farmers went in that direction.” He recalled the old days when the Lebanese government, with funding from the United States, tried to snuff out cannabis, dispatching soldiers to torch fields and sparking clashes with armed growers. But those efforts yielded to official neglect about a decade ago. “It reached a state where they realized, because of the poverty, ‘Let’s leave those people alone and act like we don’t see them,’” Mr. Chraif said. Efforts to replace cannabis with sunflowers and saffron never took off. Two years ago, as Lebanon’s finances slid toward the abyss, McKinsey, the consulting giant, generated a national buzz by suggesting that legal cannabis cultivation could earn the country big profits. “The quality we have is one of the best in the world,” Raed Khoury, the economy minister at the time, said, suggesting it could spawn a $1 billion industry. Lebanon did legalize cannabis in February of this year, the first Arab country to do so. But the government has made no progress since on implementing the law. And since hashish is still illegal, and the government would be able to tax legal strains of cannabis, Yamouneh’s farmers, long used to operating outside the law, opposed legalization. The many two- and three-story villas and pricey SUVs out front bear testament to the cash that hashish has brought to the village, but residents say the big money has always gone to the smugglers. As he was receiving struggling farmers outside his home, the mayor said he expected hashish production to drop by as much as half this year as growers struggle to make ends meet. “They are asking, ‘Why should I grow it if I am going to lose?’” he said. “They smoke it themselves to forget their worries.” Hwaida Saad and Kareem Chehayeb contributed reporting.']","A village in Lebanon, where cannabis grows everywhere, has long counted on hashish for income.

A Dozen Protesters in Nigeria Reported Killed by Security Forces,2020-10-21,By Shola Lawal and Monica Mark,"['LAGOS, Nigeria — With music playing and food being passed around, a festive atmosphere hung over the protest encampment on Tuesday night, despite the anger over police brutality that in recent weeks had driven youthful demonstrations that were the biggest Nigeria had seen in a generation. As darkness fell, Nigerian flags were handed out among the thousands of people gathered there. Philip Agu, a sound engineer who had volunteered to run the huge speaker system, said a protest leader took the microphone and told the crowd that the police would likely arrive soon, but that if they sat down, sang the national anthem and waved their flags, they would face no danger. The speaker told the crowd, Mr. Agu recalled, that all around the world, “No soldier can shoot any citizen holding their own national flag.” Three hours later, dozens of people were hit by gunfire from security forces, some fatally, and images of bloodied protesters and their bloodied flags strewn on the ground flooded the social media accounts of millions of Nigerians. Survivors recalled a sudden shift from sitting peacefully to fleeing in panic. Some said military and police units surrounded the demonstrators in the affluent suburb of Lekki, preventing them from leaving. “I thought I was going to die,” said Kolade Abiola Ahmed, his voice still quaking a day later. Soldiers and police officers opening fire on unarmed youths in an upscale neighborhood shocked the nation, even older citizens who recalled growing up under a series of military dictatorships. The protests over police brutality in the past two weeks had been larger and even more widespread than the last round of major demonstrations, in 2012, after the government stopped subsidizing fuel, but they had remained largely peaceful. Nigeria’s security forces have long been criticized for human rights abuses, particularly in the impoverished northeastern region, but there was a different set of victims this time. Many of the demonstrators have been middle-class, well-educated young people in the southern and central cities, better off than earlier generations, and too young to remember military rule that ended in 1999. Their movement, like Black Lives Matter in the United States, has been youth-driven, mostly leaderless and propelled by social media — a nimble, amorphous force that has been hard to quell. On Tuesday, the security forces killed at least 12 people at demonstrations in the Lagos area, including 10 at Lekki, Amnesty International reported on Wednesday. “These shootings clearly amount to extrajudicial executions,” said Osai Ojigho, the group’s director for Nigeria. “There must be an immediate investigation and suspected perpetrators must be held accountable through fair trials.” The government did not give casualty figures, but a police officer under the Lagos State Command Area Alpha headquarters, who was at the scene of the killings, told The New York Times on Wednesday that at least 11 people had been killed. On Wednesday, some of the protesters were out in the streets again, violating a 24-hour curfew  imposed the day before, and newly aware that they could be risking their lives. Plumes of smoke rose from at least three buildings, including one that houses TVC News, which stopped broadcasting. Sporadic gunshots could be heard around Lekki and Yaba, districts 20 miles apart, separated by a lagoon. Calling themselves the “Soro Soke” or “speak up” generation in the Yoruba language widely spoken in Lagos, the nation’s largest city, the protesters have insisted that a notorious police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, be disbanded, and its most brutal officers prosecuted. The unit, known as SARS, has earned a reputation for abusing, torturing and even killing young people; an Amnesty report in June referred to its “horrific reign of impunity.” The demonstrators have “generally been from the middle classes, highly-educated Nigerians. And that’s why initially the police perception was the protests wouldn’t last because these are Nigerians that don’t know how to endure hardship,” said Murtala Abdullahi, a reporter with HumAngle, an online national publication. The protests began after a widely seen and shared video appeared to show SARS officers killing a man, unprovoked. Officials said the video was fake and arrested the person who made it, making people still angrier. Calls for action spread rapidly on social media, with the hashtag #EndSars, and celebrities in Nigeria and abroad — including Beyoncé and Justin Bieber — added their voices to the demands. Demonstrations grew in several cities, millions of people watched them unfold live online, and the grievances expanded to include chronic corruption and lack of accountability. President Muhammadu Buhari — a former army general who led a military government in the 1980s — vowed last week to disband SARS. But there was no word on prosecutions, and government officials indicated that the officers would simply be moved to other units, not dismissed. Protesters denounced the changes as window-dressing. On Tuesday, reports of police killing people, followed by the burning of a police station, prompted the governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to declare a 24-hour curfew. He said that people bent on chaos had hijacked the peaceful protests. Despite the curfew, the demonstrators near the Lekki tollgate did not disperse. Mr. Ahmed, who had been attending protests since Thursday, said people remained seated on the ground, chanting slogans and waving their flags, as at least a dozen trucks arrived with police and military units. There were already ominous signs. Witnesses reported seeing people dismantle streetlights and remove security cameras that would have recorded what was to come next. Many protesters contend that the government has used paid provocateurs to sow violence, as an excuse for a brutal crackdown. The police officer who confirmed the deaths said that he and dozens of others were ordered to head to the Lekki protest at around 7 p.m. They piled into 15 Toyota pickup trucks, he said, joined by at least three Tata trucks full of soldiers. Some demonstrators were armed, and others threw rocks at the uniformed forces, according to the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. But other witnesses said that without warning or provocation, the security forces began shooting into the air, and then at the civilians trying to flee in terror. “They were trying to circle us, put us in the middle, they were spreading out and they were trying to go around so that we would be in the middle,” said Eti-Inyene Akpan, a 26-year-old photographer who was there. Many people, including Mr. Akpan and Mr. Ahmed, took shelter behind barricades and under parked cars. “There was a lady who excreted because of fear,” Mr. Ahmed said. Video streams on social media showed wounded people lying in the streets, or being carried by others into teeming hospital emergency rooms. The national government has been all but silent on what happened Tuesday night. Mr. Buhari appealed for calm. In a televised statement on Wednesday, the governor, Mr. Sanwo-Olu, sought to distance himself from the security forces deployed on Tuesday, and said he had ordered an investigation into the “rules of engagement” they adopted. “This is with the view to taking this up with the higher command of the Nigerian Army and to seek intervention of Mr. President” he added. The curfew was extended by three days, until Saturday. The bloodshed drew international condemnation, and not only from human rights groups. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president, and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, called on the authorities to halt the violent crackdown. Despite the violent response, the protest movement will not go away, demonstrators and analysts said. “The movement is succeeding while others have failed because of the format it adopted, both offline and online,” said Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development, a policy research group in Nigeria. “The hashtag has helped them to garner international support but importantly to galvanize the young people.” For his part, Mr. Ahmed was back on the streets and protesting on Wednesday, fueled by anger at being shot. He and a small group first marched to the gates of a house belonging to the governor’s family. “I was shouting his name to come out,” Mr. Ahmed said. “He doesn’t care even if I was killed or my friends were killed, too, and he says he is a leader.” Shola Lawal reported from Lagos, and Monica Mark from Johannesburg.']",Nigerians are stunned after police and soldiers opened fire on protesters against police brutality.

‘It’s a New Day’: Sudan Exults in Move to Take It Off List of Terror States,2020-10-20,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Sudanese people and their government officials are celebrating the news that after 27 years the United States plans to remove the country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism — a move that could help Sudan revive its ailing economy and bolster its transition to democratic rule. President Trump announced on Monday over Twitter that he will lift the terrorist designation as soon as Sudan deposits a payment of $335 million in compensation to victims, and their families, of attacks on U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000. The deal would allow the northeastern African nation of Sudan, one of the continent’s largest, to once again access foreign aid, investment and debt relief, as well as military aid. The announcement is likely to bolster Sudan’s fledgling transitional government, which came to power last year after the ouster of the strongman leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir, and has been facing protests from those calling for a quicker pace of reform. “It feels like we are citizens of the world again,” said Ahmed Abusin, a 26-year-old entrepreneur with a renewable energy firm, in a phone interview from Khartoum. “It’s a new day in Khartoum and the whole of Sudan.” In exchange, American officials say they expect Sudan to take steps in coming days to normalize relations with Israel, becoming the fifth Arab state to do so, and notching a diplomatic win for Mr. Trump in the weeks before the presidential election. But that move could prove unpopular with Sudan’s populace, analysts say. Sudan was added to the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993, accused of harboring groups that the United States deemed terrorists, such as Hezbollah. (Syria, Iran and North Korea continue to remain on the list.) The designation cut off the African state from the global economy, pushing inflation and interest rates up, drawing away foreign investment, forcing local companies to turn to the black market and enabling corruption and money laundering to thrive. The Sudanese economy faced a sharp downward spiral after the secession of South Sudan in 2011, which took with it about three-quarters of Sudan’s oil production and two-thirds of total exports. As the economic turmoil deepened, fuel shortages and food price hikes led to demonstrations that eventually removed Mr. al-Bashir in April 2019. Sudan’s transitional government, consisting of civilian and military leaders, inherited this mess, and promised to deal with the country’s economic challenges. For months, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s administration lobbied American officials to drop Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism by citing a long list of recent reforms. These included banning female genital cutting, scrapping apostasy laws, putting Mr. al-Bashir on trial, opening inquiries into the bloody suppression of the western Darfur region, and signing a peace agreement with rebel groups. Sudan in recent months has faced new outbreaks of polio, record floods and a food crisis that has left almost 10 million people hungry. The country has reported 836 deaths in the coronavirus pandemic. Large demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions are planned for Wednesday across the country. The removal of the terror designation “was seen as a panacea” for the mounting challenges facing the country, said Jonas Horner, a senior Sudan analyst with the International Crisis Group. “The timing of this announcement will dramatically soften those protests, because they were shaping up to be quite vociferous,” Mr. Horner said. Sudanese officials rejoiced at the American decision in a news conference on Tuesday. “We have won the battle to restore the dignity of the Sudanese people,” said Omer Ismail, the acting foreign minister. “This is not a solution to all our problems, but it is the beginning.” For young Sudanese like Mr. Abusin, the announcement brings hope for the future. He said he came to understand how deeply the terrorist designation hurt the economy after starting his renewable energy firm in 2018. “There is a lot of technology and software, especially American and Western goods, that we cannot bring into the country,” he said. Jawhara Kanu, a Sudanese economist, said she was eager to see how the country’s financial system will open up, allowing Sudanese businesses to access capital and pay for online purchases. Credit and debit cards are not widely available in Sudan. In January, when volunteers tried to raise money to save a group of starving lions in a zoo in the capital, the crowdfunding site GoFundMe suspended their campaign, citing American sanctions. The financial change “will not happen today or tomorrow because there are steps and some logistics,” Ms. Kanu, 27, said, “but it’s the kind of real actions needed to show we are part of the world now.” But the lifting of the designation comes with arm-twisting from the Trump administration, which expects Sudan to normalize relations with Israel. Sudanese such as the cartoonist Khalid Albaih say that they regard the American pressure campaign as coercive and bullying. Mr. Albaih, 40, who has editorialized against Sudan improving relations with Israel, said in an interview that the removal from the terrorism list is “part defeat, part victory and part disappointment.” The Americans, he said, didn’t care about how the terror designation had undermined economic growth or kept many people hungry. “It was either you die or join,” Mr. Albaih said in a telephone interview from Copenhagen, where he is in an artist-in-residence program. When the expected normalization with Israel happens, Mr. Horner, the analyst, said that there was “real scope for backlash from Islamists, particularly from within the old regime.” But while many Sudanese might be unhappy that the lifting of the terror designation is linked with recognizing Israel, younger people, particularly those who protested against Mr. al-Bashir, are likely to be more pragmatic in their choices, said Marwa Gibril, a Sudanese activist. For some, Ms. Gibril said in a phone interview, there is a sense that “we need to look back into what’s good for us than trying to be part of the Arab world.” Sudan would need to normalize relations with Israel before the Nov. 3 elections if Mr. Trump is to get the “political boost” he was hoping for, said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Each country is working on a different timeline and with competing political interests domestically,” he said. “I suspect a flurry of activity between Washington, Khartoum and Tel Aviv in the next two weeks.”']","President Trump said on Monday that the U.S. plans to lift Sudan’s 27-year designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, enabling Sudan to access international financial networks."
Why Nigeria Is Now Erupting,2020-10-21,By Rick Gladstone and Megan Specia,"['Tens of thousands of Nigerians have been demonstrating for weeks against a notoriously brutal and corrupt police agency, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad — a show of popular anger, fueled by longstanding grievances over corruption and lack of accountability, that posed the biggest challenge to the government in years. The demonstrations took a deadly turn this week, as soldiers fired on crowds of protesters, inflaming Nigerians who were already concerned about police use of violence against the demonstrators. Here are the basics of what is behind the protests and what they could mean for Nigeria, which at 206 million people is Africa’s most populous nation, its largest oil producer and an epicenter of the continent’s economic, political and cultural trends. Commonly known as SARS, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad was created in 1984 in response to an epidemic of violent crime including robberies, carjackings and kidnappings. While it was credited with having reduced brazen lawlessness in its initial years, the police unit was later accused of evolving into the same problem it had been designed to stop: a criminal enterprise that acts with impunity. In June, Amnesty International issued a report that it said had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill-treatment and extrajudicial executions by SARS officers between January 2017 and May 2020. The victims, Amnesty said, were predominantly men aged 18 to 25, from low-income backgrounds and vulnerable groups. The Nigerian government’s failure to address this problem, Amnesty said, showed “an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards.” The critics include Fulani Kwajafa, the former police commissioner who founded SARS. In an interview with the BBC, he disavowed what it had become, saying the unit had been “turned into banditry.” The catalyst seemed to be an Oct. 3 video that appeared to show the unprovoked killing of a man by black-clad SARS officers in Ughelli, a town in southern Delta state. Nigerian officials said the video, which was widely shared over social media, was fake and arrested the person who took it — inciting even more anger. Demonstrations erupted in Lagos, the nation’s biggest city, and elsewhere around the country, driven by calls from people — many of them young — demanding that the government dismantle SARS. The decentralized movement has coalesced on social media, where people are using the hashtag #EndSARS and sharing images of police brutality. The hashtag has spread internationally, with prominent actors and sports figures from across Africa to Europe and the United States sharing the posts.  President Muhammadu Buhari, seeing that the protests were serious and spreading, agreed on Oct. 12 to  disband SARS, calling his decision “only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reform in order to ensure that the primary duty of the police and other law enforcement agencies remains the protection of lives and livelihood of our people.” But the response did not mollify protesters — especially after Mr. Buhari’s subordinates said SARS officers would be redeployed elsewhere in Nigeria’s police system. People who have been demanding that officers be fired and that the most brutal among them be prosecuted say that the government’s is an attempt to paper over a problem, not to fix it. And in recent days, clashes between protesters and the police have grown increasingly violent. The anger of the protesters seems to have only increased — especially after the deadly suppression of a peaceful demonstration in Lagos on Tuesday, compounded by a 24-hour curfew decree and the deployment of Nigeria’s military forces to quell further demonstrations. The powerful role in the protests played by young Nigerians and their use of social media to share grievances could turn the movement into a much broader crisis for the government. Half the country’s population is under the age of 19. “The protests have started to morph into a much larger critique about Nigeria, everything from police reform to security to extrajudicial killings,” said Judd Devermont,  director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Fueled by young people and an outspoken Nigerian diaspora, Mr. Devermont said,  the movement had become “a platform to talk about a host of challenges.” The movement bears striking similarities to demonstrations in the United States this year amid the outcry over police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But Mr. Devermont said an important difference is that the Nigerian protesters are not demanding a defunding of the police — if anything, he said,  they want more resources devoted to helping improve policing in their country. “They are saying police brutality cannot stand, and at the same time they’re saying the police are underfunded and poorly equipped,” he said. “This is a systemic problem — to get a better Nigeria, we need better police.” Police brutality isn’t the only issue fueling the anti-government sentiment. Nigeria’s stagnant economy, which relies heavily on oil exports that were crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, has become a major issue.  Anger over suspected misuse of government funds during the pandemic has also become an element of popular anger. In one case that received widespread publicity, the Bureau of Public Procurement data showed the Health Ministry had spent $96,000 on 1,808 ordinary face masks — about $53 each. Complaints about government corruption are a longstanding grievance. The country is regarded as highly vulnerable to corruption, ranking in the bottom fourth of an annual 180-country best-to-worst list by Transparency International. Even before the pandemic upended life, Nigeria’s people had a dim view of their politicians.  A Pew Research Center survey conducted a few years ago showed only 39 percent of Nigerians were satisfied with how democracy was working, while 60 percent said they were not.  Asked if they thought  “elected officials care what ordinary people think,” six in 10 said that was not true in Nigeria. ']","Africa’s most populous country and biggest oil producer has been convulsed by protests that started with anger over police brutality and have now broadened, drawing worldwide attention."
1.5 million New Yorkers can’t afford food. Pantries are their lifeline.,2020-10-20,By Nikita Stewart and Todd Heisler,"['As the pandemic settled into New York City, hunger drove tens of thousands of residents into food pantry lines, many for the first time. An estimated 1.5 million people cannot afford food. City Harvest, one of the largest emergency food distributors in New York, recorded nearly 12 million visits to the pantries in its network from March through August — about three million more than in the same period last year. The New York Times spoke with New Yorkers who are relying on food banks to get by. They showed that at a time when we feel that nothing is in our control — not even the air we breathe — food is still comfort. y. José Gavidia and his wife, Leyla Moale, began going to a food pantry in March after his $30,000-a-year freelancing business evaporated overnight. Going to the pantry quickly became part of their shared schedules. One day after they had stood in line for about an hour, José said with a chuckle: “We got carrots. We got chicken. Eggs. What else? Oil. What else? I don’t remember. Oh, some chips, which is good because my wife doesn’t let me have chips. ‘No, that’s too expensive,’” he said, imitating her. Leyla chimed in with her rule about snacks: “We make only popcorn at home.” They had their best conversations over meals. “When we are not together here, it’s not the same,” José said. “Talking, eating, it’s something really special for me.” By August, José was among thousands of Americans who had landed jobs as temporary census data collectors. He was grateful, but still worried. “It ends on October 24,” he said of his job.']",
Murderer Who Wielded Narwhal Tusk to Stop Terrorist Gets Royal Pardon,2020-10-19,By Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has approved a rare royal pardon for an inmate convicted of murder who used a narwhal tusk to help stop a terrorist attack in which two people were killed before the assailant was killed by the police on London Bridge. The decision to pardon the murderer, Steven Gallant, was in recognition of “his exceptionally brave actions,” which “helped save people’s lives despite the tremendous risk to his own,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said in a statement on Monday. If a parole board approves, Mr. Gallant’s minimum 17-year sentence would be reduced by 10 months. The attack in November 2019 began at a prisoner rehabilitation conference when a former inmate in attendance stabbed and killed two young rehabilitation advocates, Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, and fled before eventually being subdued on London Bridge. Three others were also injured before the assailant, Usman Khan, 28, was fatally shot by police. Mr. Khan had served eight years for a terrorism-related offense but had been released in December 2018. Mr. Gallant, who was imprisoned in 2005, was among a crowd of people who banded together to take the assailant down with an unconventional weapon: the narwhal tusk, which had been a wall decoration at Fishmongers’ Hall, the historic building that hosted the conference. He was in the hall for the day on a prison day-release program when he heard noises and saw injured people. He found Mr. Khan holding two large knives and wearing a fake bomb around his waist. “He was a clear danger to all, so I didn’t hesitate,” Mr. Gallant said, in a statement in January. He used a chair and the tusk, passed to him by a civil servant, to confront the attacker, chasing him onto London Bridge and helping restrain him before police arrived. Male narwhals, a species of whale, have a single straight tusk that can grow up to nine feet long; this one was about five feet. The pardon was welcome news, his lawyer, Neil Hudgell, said, adding that Mr. Gallant hoped to be a “positive example” to others after turning around his life in prison. “He is passionate about using his knowledge and experiences to help others steer away from crime,” he said. Mr. Gallant will be eligible for parole next June, though a parole board will have the final say on whether he can be released early. He was convicted along with another man in 2005 of murdering Barrie Jackson, a firefighter in the coastal city of Hull. Mr. Jackson’s son said he had “mixed emotions about his release,” reported The Daily Mirror. “But what happened at London Bridge goes to show the reality that people can change.” Mr. Gallant has apologized to Mr. Jackson’s family and said he accepted his punishment. “Nobody has the right to take another’s life,” he said in the January statement, adding he had vowed to better himself and “never to turn to violence again.” The father of one of the two victims of the terrorist attack, David Merritt, told The Daily Mirror that the pardon was “fully” deserved. He had turned his life around in prison, Mr. Merritt said, and was close to his son. Mr. Gallant has called Jack Merritt a role model and a friend. The queen can exercise a “royal prerogative of mercy,” which reduces the penalty for a criminal offense, but rarely does so. Pardons for early release are generally recommended by officials in exceptional situations, such as if a prisoner risks his safety to prevent death or serious injury to another. Though the queen signs off on the royal pardon, the decision is ultimately in the hands of the government — in this case the Ministry of Justice — said Dickie Arbiter, a former Buckingham Palace spokesman. “By the time it gets to her, it’s a done deal,” he said. “She just rubber-stamps it.” Though he was not privy to the decision-making, Mr. Arbiter said that Mr. Gallant had risked his own life while out of prison for the day to protect others, which was likely to have helped his case. “He could have just walked away and ignored it, but he didn’t.” Pardons for those convicted of murder are highly unusual. Before Mr. Gallant, the last significant pardon for murder was given to Sean O’Callaghan, a paramilitary member of the Irish Republican Army who was freed in 1996.']",Queen Elizabeth II approved a rare form of clemency for an inmate who used a whale tusk to help end a deadly terrorist attack near London Bridge last year.
"France, Waging a Crackdown, Honors a Teacher and Depicts a Plot in Beheading",2020-10-21,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Two teenagers were paid about $350 to identify a teacher who was later decapitated outside the suburban school where he worked, a prosecutor said Wednesday, as officials continued to investigate a killing that has set off a wave of national mourning, tributes to the teacher, and a broad government crackdown against Muslim individuals and groups. The national homage continued Wednesday as President Emmanuel Macron eulogized the slain teacher, Samuel Paty, calling him a “quiet hero” in a solemn evening ceremony at the Sorbonne in Paris. Mr. Paty, who was killed Friday, was also awarded France’s highest civilian honor, the Legion d’Honneur. The special antiterrorism prosecutor, Jean-François Ricard, unveiled the new findings in the inquiry on Wednesday as part of a probe into what he termed a “terrorist murder conspiracy.” That designation suggests officials are attempting to cast a broad net and don’t view the suspect, Abdoullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old Chechen immigrant, as merely a lone-wolf killer, an approach that dovetails with the government’s view that the killing reflects a menacing surge of militant Islamism. That, in their view, has justified dozens of raids all over France, the closure of a prominent mosque, the shutting down of Muslim aid organizations and the mass expulsion of foreigners identified in government antiterrorism files. The right and the anti-immigrant far right have been pushing for even stiffer measures, and Mr. Macron is facing a tough re-election in 2022. Mr. Macron’s prime minister, Jean Castex, was forced to get up in Parliament several times on Tuesday to assert the government’s toughness in facing down Islamists, even as representatives on the right booed him. Criticism of the crackdown among French Muslims has been muted, most likely as the country has been swept up in nationalism after Mr. Paty’s killing. Several figures who have been critical of past government action against Muslims were reluctant to talk when reached by a reporter. The teenagers, students at the school, are among seven people being investigated in connection with the killing of Mr. Paty. They include two young friends of Mr. Anzorov who officials said helped him buy the knife and drove him to the school outside Paris. Mr. Anzorov was shot and killed by the police shortly after the attack. The teacher was targeted for having shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the same images at the origin of the massacre on the magazine’s premises in 2015. Mr. Anzorov hung around the school Friday afternoon, enlisting students to help him identify Mr. Paty. He told the students he wanted to confront the teacher to “force an apology for having used the caricatures of the prophet, to humiliate him, to beat him,” Mr. Ricard said. These students tried to hide from surveillance cameras and a police car, he said. Shortly before 5 p.m., several students, including the two who had been paid, pointed out Mr. Paty as he emerged from the middle school, College du Bois d’Aulne in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Mr. Ricard said. Mr. Anzorov followed him and killed him in the street, posting a picture of his severed head online, officials say. Another man being questioned, identified by the government as Brahim C., was said to be the parent of a student at the school. He had posted a video and vehement online objections to Mr. Paty’s use of the caricatures, and was contacted by Mr. Anzorov after the posting, Mr. Ricard said. Also being investigated is a man described by the French security services as an anti-Semitic militant, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who, in Mr. Ricard’s telling, had egged on Brahim C. Mr. Sefrioui made a video in front of the school before the killing in which he called Mr. Paty a “thug teacher” who had been called on by President Macron to “hate, fight, and stigmatize Muslims.” There is a “direct line of causality between their actions and the death of Samuel Paty,” Mr. Ricard said. “It’s clear that the teacher was singled out by name as a target on the social networks by these two men, through their maneuvers, and their reinterpretation of the facts.” Mr. Sefrioui’s activist organization, Collectif Cheikh Yassine, was disbanded by the government Wednesday. Mr. Paty’s killing, the prosecutor said, took place “in a context of appeals to murder” which were in the air after the republication of the caricatures during the trial of Charlie Hebdo suspects that began in September. He noted that media organs linked to Al Qaeda had recently called for the “murder” of those who disseminated the Charlie Hebdo caricatures. On Tuesday, the French government shut down a large mosque in Pantin, north of Paris, for having shared Brahim C.’s video. That day, parliamentary deputies in the National Assembly stood on the building’s portico steps in a silent tribute, and marches and demonstrations were held throughout France. At the Sorbonne ceremony Wednesday, Mr. Paty’s coffin was carried by uniformed guards across the courtyard of the ancient university in front of dozens of invited officials. Several colleagues paid tribute to him. Mr. Macron said that Mr. Paty was “killed because he incarnated the republic, which is reborn every day, in every class. He was killed because the Islamists want our future and they know that with quiet heroes like him they will never have it.” A day earlier, Mr. Macron made an appearance in a troubled suburb of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis, to declare that “you’ve seen, in the last few days, dozens of concrete actions launched against groups, individuals, whose project is radical Islam.” The raids Monday resulted in a single arrest. Incidents here and there pointed to an increase in tension between France and its large Muslim community. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, a hard-liner who has been the public face of the government’s crackdown, said on television this week that he was “shocked” when he went into supermarkets and saw what he called “communitarian,” or Muslim-oriented, food products. On Tuesday, the Paris police arrested two women on charges of attacking two others near the Eiffel Tower Sunday night, yelling slurs and telling them “go back home” and “this is not your home,” according to a complaint filed by the lawyer of the women who were attacked. One of the women was seriously wounded, suffering a perforated lung. Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']","Two teenagers were paid about $350 to identify a teacher later decapitated outside his school.

Manslaughter Charge Urged for Israeli Officer in Killing of Autistic Palestinian,2020-10-21,By David M. Halbfinger and Adam Rasgon,"['JERUSALEM —\xa0Israeli prosecutors recommended on Wednesday that a police officer who shot and killed an unarmed Palestinian man with autism be charged with manslaughter in a case that became a rallying cry against police brutality. But the failure to seek a murder charge was met with outrage among Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel. Iyad al-Hallaq, 31, was shot along the Via Dolorosa during his morning walk to a school for adults with disabilities in Jerusalem’s Old City on May 30. His killing drew instant comparisons to that of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis five days earlier. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called the shooting a “tragedy” and urged a full investigation. Nevertheless, protesters demanding Mr. Netanyahu’s resignation over the past months have invoked Mr. al-Hallaq’s name and denounced police violence. And those demonstrations have, at times, been met with violent police crackdowns. Khairi al-Hallaq, the victim’s father, said Wednesday that he believed prosecutors had recommended a manslaughter charge only because the shooter was a Jew and the victim an Arab. Had it been the reverse, he said, the authorities would have urged a murder charge. He also complained that the commanding officer on the scene, who was closely involved, had been cleared. “There were two people involved in the crime, which means two people should be put on trial,” he said. Before any manslaughter charge is filed, it is subject to a hearing at which the accused officer can argue to have it reduced or dismissed. If convicted, he could face up to 12 years in prison, officials said. The accused officer’s lawyer, Efrat Nahmani Bar, has stressed her client’s youth — he is 19 — and inexperience. She said she was confident that prosecutors would drop the case entirely after a hearing. “That is the just thing to do,” she said. According to prosecutors, Mr. al-Hallaq, who lived just downhill from the Old City in East Jerusalem, aroused the suspicions of police at about 6 a.m. on a Saturday when, wearing black disposable gloves and a surgical mask because of the pandemic, he crossed under the 500-year-old Lions Gate on his way to school. Without being more specific, prosecutors said that “certain characteristics” of Mr. al-Hallaq’s behavior led two officers, watching him from a distance, to identify him as a potential “terrorist.” When he did not heed their orders to stop, they gave chase, and other officers joined in. One of them, a 21-year-old commander who was to leave the force within days, shot twice at Mr. al-Hallaq’s feet while pursuing him but missed. Mr. al-Hallaq then turned into a fenced-in area used by sanitation workers where, according to witnesses, he cowered in a corner. Among those looking on was one of the teachers from his school. The teacher has said that she yelled to the officers that Mr. al-Hallaq was disabled and posed no threat. When the 19-year-old officer, who had completed his basic training only a few weeks earlier, arrived and spotted Mr. al-Hallaq in the corner, he shot him once in the abdomen, prosecutors said, even as his commander shouted at him to hold his fire. After the commander again shouted at the younger officer to hold his fire, prosecutors said, the younger officer shouted at Mr. al-Hallaq, in Hebrew, not to move. One of the officers then asked Mr. al-Hallaq, in Arabic, “Where is the gun?” prosecutors said. When he did not answer, the officer asked the teacher the same question, to which she replied, “What gun?” At that point, the younger officer fired a second shot at Mr. al-Hallaq, prosecutors said. An autopsy determined that he was shot twice in the torso. Both the 19-year-old and his commander were performing their compulsory military service in the Border Police, a paramilitary arm of the Israeli police that operates on the West Bank, in parts of Jerusalem and in other volatile settings. Israeli law forbids publishing the officers’ names. Explaining their recommendation, the prosecutors said the 19-year-old’s actions were reckless, adding that he had ignored his commander’s repeated orders not to shoot and that Mr. al-Hallaq had posed no danger. They said the officer could have used a more proportional response. As mitigating factors, they pointed to the police’s suspicion that Mr. al-Hallaq was an attacker and the fact that the shooting occurred “in a complex sector” — a euphemism for an area that is a frequent flashpoint of violence between Arabs and Jews. But Arab lawmakers denounced the prosecutors’ reasoning as too forgiving. “Shooting a person in cold blood in a trash room is not ‘manslaughter,’” Yousef Jabareen, an Israeli lawmaker from the predominantly Arab political faction known as the Joint List, wrote on Twitter. “It’s murder. Justice for Iyad al-Hallaq.” Mr. al-Hallaq’s mother, Rana al-Hallaq, expressed her anguish after leaving a meeting where officials of the Department of Police Investigations, the Justice Ministry unit responsible for addressing police misconduct, informed her of their decision. “They destroyed our family. They destroyed us,” she told reporters. “What could an autistic boy do?”']","Palestinians assail the failure to recommend a murder charge in the case, which has become a cause célèbre in the fight against police brutality."
Latest Clash Between China and Taiwan: A Fistfight in Fiji,2020-10-19,By Javier C. Hernández,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — It was supposed to be a quiet diplomatic event at a stylish beachside hotel in Fiji. Instead, a reception hosted this month by Taiwan officials in Suva, the capital of Fiji, gave way to a fistfight between officials representing China and Taiwan, in the latest example of rising tensions between the two governments. Officials in Taipei and Beijing on Monday offered competing accounts of the altercation after reports about the clash spread widely on social media. They accused each other of initiating the feud and causing injuries. Taiwan said the Chinese government was trying to surveil its staff and guests. Beijing said its officials were carrying out normal duties, and complained that a cake at the event was decorated to look like Taiwan’s flag. At the heart of the issue is a longstanding dispute over the status of Taiwan, a self-governing island of 24 million people that China claims as its territory. Fears of a military conflict have grown as Beijing has increased the frequency of live-fire drills and adopted a more bellicose tone. China has led a concerted effort in recent years to undercut Taiwan’s influence on the global stage, including in the Pacific. As part of that campaign, Beijing has poached several allies of Taiwan in the region, despite objections from the United States and other governments. Those tensions spilled over at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva on Oct. 8, when Taiwan hosted a reception to celebrate its national day before an audience of Fijian officials, scholars and nonprofit workers. (Fiji does not have official relations with Taipei.) According to Taiwan’s foreign ministry, a pair of Chinese diplomats showed up at the reception uninvited and sought to photograph guests. Beijing has deployed such tactics — turning up at events, taking photographs of people — in recent years to intimidate its rivals and those who support them. When Taiwanese officials tried to block the Chinese diplomats, the visitors turned violent, according to the ministry. They beat a Taiwanese official so severely that the official was hospitalized, the ministry said. Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Monday called the actions of the Chinese officials a provocation and said it would work to strengthen security for government workers overseas. In a statement, the ministry said it “strongly condemns the serious violation of the rule of law and civilized norms by the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Fiji.” The Chinese government disputed that account, saying Taiwan officials had acted “provocatively” and injured one of its diplomats during the scuffle. The Chinese embassy did not explain why its diplomats were at the reception, saying in a statement only that they were “carrying out their official duties” in a public area. Beijing made clear that it saw the reception as a political threat. While Fiji, an archipelago in the South Pacific, is a longtime ally of Beijing, Taiwan maintains a trade office in Suva and has sought to raise its profile by investing in education and agriculture. “There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an integral part of China,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Monday. He called the image on the cake at the event a “fake national flag.” “Taiwan’s move is intended to create ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’ internationally,” he said. In a statement on Tuesday, the police in Fiji said they would drop an investigation into the dispute because it was “being handled at the diplomatic level as agreed to by all parties involved.” The statement referred only to a complaint by officials from the Chinese Embassy; it did not mention Taiwan’s grievances. The incident resurfaced concerns about China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has stepped up efforts to defend the country’s reputation abroad during the coronavirus pandemic, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has badly damaged China’s image. Chinese emissaries have increasingly practiced what is known as “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, named for two ultrapatriotic Chinese films. But their strident defenses of Chinese policies and attacks on rivals have sometimes backfired, weakening China’s efforts to counter American influence and expand its military and economic power. Wang Ting-yu, a legislator in Taiwan who specializes in foreign affairs, said the dispute in Fiji showed the excesses of China’s assertive approach. “China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy is a mad dog that bites arbitrarily,” Mr. Wang said in an interview. “The biggest problem in China now is that under Xi Jinping’s rule, their diplomats have turned to seeking private revenge. They have disregarded their country’s diplomatic interests to follow the internal orders of the leaders.” In mainland China, the incident stoked an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and criticism of Taiwan. By Monday evening, the scuffle in Fiji was one of the most popular topics on Weibo, a microblogging site. Chinese analysts defended the country’s approach, saying an increasingly hostile international environment meant that Beijing had to act forcefully. “China is now faced with a pack of wolves, including the Taiwan authorities constantly creating all kinds of troubles in the international community,” Song Zhongping, an independent military analyst based in Hong Kong, said in an interview. In recent months, Beijing has increased military activities in the strait that separates the mainland from Taiwan and promoted propaganda to signal that China will go to war if necessary to assert control of Taiwan. Taiwan has sought closer ties with the United States, welcoming Trump administration officials in recent months for high-level visits to the island, angering Beijing. Beijing has intensified its efforts to block symbols of Taiwan’s soft power and de facto independence, denouncing the island’s flag, or events like the national day celebration as illegitimate. “Talk about squeezing Taiwan’s international space,” Margaret Lewis, a law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey who studies China and Taiwan, said in an interview. “It’s sad to see even a celebratory reception at a hotel in Fiji is declared a space by the Chinese government that cannot have freedom of assembly.” Amy Chang Chien and Albee Zhang contributed research.']","Two mainland diplomats attended an event, uninvited, and took offense at symbols of Taiwan — including a flag on a cake.

"In ‘Lobster War,’ Indigenous Canadians Face Attacks by Fishermen",2020-10-20,By Dan Bilefsky,"['Jason Marr, an Indigenous lobsterman in Nova Scotia, was unloading his live catch at a storage facility last week when, he said, an angry mob of 200 commercial fishermen began pounding on the door, screaming to be let in. Terrified, he barricaded himself inside a cold storage area, waiting for more than 90 minutes for police officers to respond to his call for help, as the crowd outside tossed rocks and a man urinated on the passenger seat of his van parked outside. When the authorities finally did arrive at the plant, Mr. Marr’s ordeal was not yet over. As several officers surrounded him, he said, the commercial fishermen formed a human chain and began passing crates of lobster from the building to the shoreline, dumping more than 3,000 pounds of his live lobsters. Then, just days after the plant was ransacked, it was burned to the ground this past weekend, and the fire is being investigated as arson, rattling a sleepy community whose local economy depends on fishing. “It feels like they have declared a lobster war against us,” said Michael Sack, chief of the Sipekne’katik First Nation, whose lobster fishermen were targeted in the attacks and who himself was assaulted last week when a commercial fisherman lunged at him during a protest at a lobster facility. “I believe that systemic racism is at play,” he added, noting that local suppliers were refusing to sell his people fuel, bait or traps. The recent violence in southwestern Nova Scotia is part of escalating tensions over Canada’s lucrative lobster trade. On one side are commercial fishermen who say that Indigenous fishermen are threatening their livelihoods by trapping the crustaceans outside the federally regulated lobster season. On the other are Indigenous lobstermen who say they are being attacked with impunity for exercising their legal right to hunt and fish, a right negotiated in a centuries-old treaty and backed up by a decades-old court decision. It’s a battle with high stakes. Canada is the world’s biggest exporter of lobster, with about $1.1 billion of lobster sent annually to the United States. Nova Scotia is among the country’s leading lobster producers. The lobster skirmish began last month after the Sipekne’katik First Nation opened its own fishery enterprise and began fishing lobster outside of the federal season, which takes place in the area from Nov. 30 to May 31. Commercial fishermen viewed the Indigenous fishery as a threat to their livelihoods, and acts of sabotage began soon after. A fishing boat owned by an Indigenous fisherman was burned as the conflict turned violent. The Sipekne’katik are part of the Mi’kmaq people, who live in Canada’s Atlantic coast, among other areas. Under a treaty dating to 1752, the Mi’kmaq have a right to hunt and fish to earn a “moderate livelihood.” That right was cemented in 1999 in a ruling by Canada’s Supreme Court. But successive governments have failed to define what constitutes a “moderate livelihood,” and commercial fishermen argue that Indigenous fishing is undermining lobster conservation efforts and, by extension, their business. This fight over lobster is only the latest flash point in a series of abuses against Indigenous people that have spurred a national reckoning about systemic racism in Canadian health care, education and law enforcement. The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made reconciling with Canada’s Indigenous community a priority of his premiership in a country where they have been deprived of land, resources and food over the centuries. In 2018, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged the nation’s past “humiliation, neglect and abuse” of the country’s 1.4 million Indigenous people. The violence in Nova Scotia has become a national political issue, with leaders of the opposition parties criticizing the government’s response. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, has called the attacks “terrorism.” On Monday, Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller called the violence “disgusting, unacceptable and racist in nature,” joining a chorus of disapproval from government leaders, including Mr. Trudeau. Members of the commercial fishing industry blamed the government for aggravating tensions by failing to adequately regulate lobster fishing. Colin Sproul, vice president of the Bay of Fundy Inshore Fishermen’s Association, which represents 150 family-owned lobster businesses in southwest Nova Scotia, unequivocally condemned the violence. He said the issue had boiled over amid “commercial scale” fishing by Indigenous people during the off season, which he said was depleting the local lobster supply. “There are existential consequences for our members’ livelihoods,” he said, adding that the well-intentioned imperative to reconcile with the local Indigenous community was taking precedence over science and conservation. But Jeffrey A. Hutchings, a professor of biology at Dalhousie University who specializes in fishing sustainability, said the approximately 550 traps being used by the Mi’kmaq were negligible in a province where about 900,000 traps were used for lobster fishing. “One can reasonably conclude that the mortality of lobsters in the area being fished by the Mi’kmaq is minimal relative to the mortality brought about by commercial fishermen,” he said. The lobster battle has centered in a picturesque area peppered by villages with commercial fishing wharves and lobster plants. The issue has polarized this corner of Nova Scotia, where tensions over fishing rights have flared up in the past. But the recent violence has surprised many with its intensity. The police have charged a man with assaulting Chief Sack while another man has been charged with arson for torching a van during Tuesday’s mob attack. A second lobster plant was also targeted in another attack the same night. Indigenous leaders said the latest attacks underlined how Indigenous people across the country were being unfairly targeted. In late September, there was a national outcry after Joyce Echaquan, an Indigenous woman and mother of seven, broadcast a Facebook live video showing her being insulted by hospital staff with racist taunts. That followed an incident over the summer when Allan Adam, the leader of one of Canada’s First Nations in Alberta, was tackled to the pavement and punched by the police over an expired license plate. Mr. Marr was shocked by the vitriolic hatred he witnessed during the attack, noting how the commercial fishermen poured paint thinners and cement powder in the lobster holding tank in the building. “There wasn’t one lobster that walked out of that alive,” he said. Chief Sack said he was concerned by what he characterized as a woeful lack of police response during last week’s attacks, adding that Indigenous lobster fishermen are now afraid of being attacked while fishing. He has called for the Canadian military to intercede. Over the weekend, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair approved a request by Nova Scotia’s attorney general to send more officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national police force, to the area. On Monday, he said law enforcement has been beefed up, including deploying more police officers and the Coast Guard.  Dora Maillet of Saulnierville, a village where Indigenous people have come to fish for lobster, said people in the area were shaken by the rising violence. “Usually there’s not much going on and it’s quiet,” she said. “It gets you scared.”']",A battle over the lucrative lobster industry in Nova Scotia has become the latest flash point in a series of abuses of Indigenous people in Canada.
1945: Strike Paralyzes Argentina,2020-10-20,By The International Herald Tribune,"['Special to The European Edition BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 19. — Firmly in control of the Argentine government, Colonel Juan D. Peron received a tribute yesterday from country partisans in the form of a twenty-four-hour strike, the worst in Argentine history, which paralyzed the normal life of almost the entire nation. All factories, offices, banks, theaters, restaurants, stores and other commercial establishments were closed tight here and in other Argentine cities yesterday and railways, buses and taxis were at a standstill. The strike surpassed those of 1919 and 1936, which were designed to promote the cause of labor and were opposed by the government. In contrast, this strike was political and was supported by the government and the police. An antigovernment political strike was staged by the democratic opposition on September 19, but this endured only for half a day and was only partially effective. Fear of Reprisals Cited The most incredible success of the latest nationwide strike was attributed in labor circles not only to Colonel Peron’s strength but to the total paralysis of transportation, and to fear among the population of violent reaction if any one defied the order to support the strike. The order was issued by the General Federation of Labor. It instructed all workers to suspend activities for twenty-four hours “to demonstrate the thoughts of the working class regarding the exceptional moment in which the nation is living.” The order was supported by Colonel Peron, who spoke from the government building balcony at midnight Wednesday and advised the workers to support the strike by celebrating the “glory” of their reunion at a mass demonstration. Close in Self-Defense Most merchants closed their shops in self-defense, aware of what happened Wednesday to those who failed to do so in La Plata and suburbs of the capital. In these areas, armed bands of “Peronistas,” supported by the police, stoned and threatened establishments which refused to join their strike. The government newspaper “Critica” spurred an attack made with gunfire and flaming torches. The attack began at 1:20 a.m. and lasted almost two hours. Violence also occurred yesterday at the municipal fruit and vegetable market, where Peron supporters attacked those who wanted to continue working. Six were reported killed and forty injured. Peron men paraded through the deserted streets in groups of several hundred, shouting the name of their leader. They announced that Colonel Peron would be President, and they painted his name on sidewalks, streets, buildings and shop windows. Colonel Peron departed yesterday for a vacation in the territory of Chubut, in southern Argentina, before opening his campaign. He left the government in the hands of President Edelmiro Farrell, whom he publicly embraced twice at a demonstration Wednesday night. — The New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 20, 1945.']",A 24-hour walkout backed by the government to show support for Col.

Vatican Extends Deal With China Over Appointment of Bishops,2020-10-22,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — The Vatican said on Thursday that it had extended an agreement with Beijing over the appointment of bishops in China, weeks after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to the Vatican on an unsuccessful mission to kill it. The announcement renewed for another two years a historic agreement struck in 2018 that ended a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China, despite concerns over religious liberty and human rights in the country. The deal calls for China to formally recognize the pope’s authority within the Roman Catholic Church and his final say over the country’s bishops. The Vatican in turn recognized the legitimacy of bishops previously appointed by the Chinese government and excommunicated by the church. Beyond that, the details of the agreement have been kept largely confidential, to the dismay of some critics of Pope Francis. “The Holy See considers the initial application of the Agreement — which is of great ecclesial and pastoral value — to have been positive, thanks to good communication and cooperation between the parties on the matters agreed upon,” the Vatican said in a statement, adding that the Holy See “intends to pursue an open and constructive dialogue for the benefit of the life of the Catholic Church and the good of Chinese people.” The continuation of the agreement and cooperation between the two states has led some Vatican experts to consider it a critical step on the road to diplomatic relations with Beijing, which could mean the Vatican cutting ties with Taiwan. On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry in Taiwan said that the Holy See had often made it clear the deal was pastoral, and not political, in nature, while noting that it had expressed its “concern and position” while maintaining close contacts. Previewing the deal’s announcement on Wednesday, Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state and its second-ranking official after the pope, said talk of diplomatic relations was premature. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, “After friendly negotiations, China and the Vatican decided to extend the temporary agreement on the appointment of bishops for two years.” “The two sides will continue to maintain close communication and consultations, and continue to promote the process of improving relations,” he added. The pope and the Vatican have portrayed the deal as a step in a long journey to better provide for the pastoral needs of Catholics in China, the world’s most populous nation, where the growth of Protestantism is far outpacing Catholicism. “Today already, for the first time in many decades, all the bishops in China are in communion with the Bishop of Rome and, thanks to the implementation of the Agreement, there won’t be any more illegitimate ordinations,” read a supplemental note on the deal released in the Vatican’s official newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano. The note said that two bishops, Msgr. Antonio Yao Shun of Jining, an autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, and Msgr. Stefano Xu Hongwei of Hanzhong, in the central province of Shaanxi, had been appointed in accordance with the agreement. Other ordinations were in progress, the note said, though the pandemic has slowed things down. “Statistically, this may not look like a great result,” the note said. “It represents, however, a good start.” The agreement has engendered opposition from conservatives in the church who argue that it sells out those who have suffered for decades in China’s underground Catholic Church, because those faithful had refused to recognize bishops appointed by the Communist government and not by Rome. The agreement, they argue, effectively condones China’s religious liberty and human rights violations. The Vatican newspaper pointed out that popes before Francis had sought deeper relations with China and that the work on the current agreement began under his predecessor, Benedict XVI. The agreement, it argued, was “exclusively the matter of bishops’ appointments” and did not broach other issues “that still cause worry for the Church.” Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican foreign minister, had stressed “human rights” in his conversations with the Chinese foreign secretary, the paper said. “The Holy See is deeply aware of them, takes them into much account,” it added, “and doesn’t fail to draw the Chinese government’s attention to favor a more fruitful exercise of religious freedom.” In the prelude to negotiations over the agreement, hackers presumed by cybersecurity experts to be working for the Chinese state appeared to have infiltrated the Vatican’s computer networks. The Vatican moved ahead with talks regardless and, in its statement, preferred to emphasize the meetings between top Vatican diplomats and their Chinese counterparts. The Vatican said that the actual substance and details of the deal would remain secret and “given its experimental nature, was kept confidential by mutual consent.” That bothered some critics. “My main objection to the agreement is we don’t know what it is,” the American cardinal Raymond Burke, the de facto leader of critics of Pope Francis inside the church, said in a brief interview before greeting Mr. Pompeo at an event organized by the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican last month. In September, Mr. Pompeo angered some of the Vatican’s top officials, including those negotiating with the Chinese, by publicly calling on the church to break off talks with China to preserve its moral standing. The fact that he chose a conservative Christian magazine critical of the pope to air his grievances did not engender much sympathy among the church’s leaders. The Vatican brushed off Mr. Pompeo, who was denied a meeting with the pope. Mr. Pompeo’s appeals for Francis to follow the model of John Paul II, who famously stood up to Communism but also practiced realpolitik, were considered inside the Vatican as electioneering. “Some sectors of international politics have tried to analyze the work of the Holy See mainly according to a geopolitical” consideration, a note in the Vatican newspaper read, insisting that the deal was purely a church matter that could, in creating a spirit of communication, be “to the advantage of the entire international community.”']","The agreement calls for China to formally recognize the pope’s authority within the church, while the Vatican in turn recognized the legitimacy of bishops previously appointed by Beijing."
"Edward Snowden, in Russia Since 2013, Is Granted Permanent Residency",2020-10-23,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Edward J. Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor whose 2013 leaks of top-secret documents set off a worldwide debate about government surveillance, is now a permanent resident of Russia. Mr. Snowden, 37, has been living in exile in Moscow since 2013, when he fled to the Russian capital after giving journalists access to a trove of National Security Agency documents detailing the American intelligence service’s mass surveillance programs. On Thursday, the country’s immigration authorities granted Mr. Snowden permanent residency, his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, wrote on Facebook. Mr. Kucherena posted a photograph of himself standing next to a smiling Mr. Snowden, in a dark red shirt and a black suit jacket, holding a blue, passport-style permanent residency document emblazoned with the Russian coat of arms. “People ask me if Edward is planning on getting Russian citizenship,” Mr. Kucherena wrote. “For now, he has not told me this. He describes his end goal as being a return to the United States, but only if he is guaranteed a fair trial.” There was no comment from Mr. Snowden himself on his newfound permanent residency. President Trump said in August that he would “take a very good look at” a pardon for the former intelligence contractor. Mr. Snowden told the German newspaper Die Zeit last month that he was encouraged by Mr. Trump’s comments, even if no pardon was imminent. “It’s a continued normalization of the conversation about this,” Mr. Snowden said, referring to a possible pardon in the United States. “Realistically, I think we are still early in the phase of that.” Changes last year to Russia’s immigration law that have made it easier for foreigners to get permanent residency cleared the path for Mr. Snowden to stay in the country for as long as he wanted. Several prominent Western supporters of President Vladimir V. Putin — including the American actor Steven Seagal and the French actor Gérard Depardieu — have already gone further and received Russian citizenship. But Mr. Snowden is a special case. He is both a living symbol of Mr. Putin’s relish in needling the United States and a hero to many who say he laid bare breathtaking abuse by American intelligence agencies of the power to monitor the online activity of people around the world. In Moscow, Mr. Snowden has led both a mysterious and active lifestyle. He keeps his specific location and movements a secret, but chimes in on online privacy issues on his Twitter account, published a memoir last year and, before the pandemic, often appeared at technology conferences via video link. He has married his American girlfriend, learned Russian and describes Moscow as a “beautiful city.” In the United States, intelligence officials and politicians from both parties have said Mr. Snowden was working with Russian intelligence agencies. Mr. Snowden has denied those accusations, and he has at times lobbed veiled criticism at Mr. Putin; after the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny in August, Mr. Snowden on Twitter called it a possible “crime against the whole of Russia.” “The sad reality is that even in the United States, targeted killings are happening frequently,” Mr. Snowden elaborated in the interview with Die Zeit. “It’s just the means that’s different.” Mr. Snowden was referring to targeted killings of terrorism suspects around the world by American drones. Of Mr. Navalny’s case, Mr. Snowden said: “There needs to be an investigation, and anyone involved needs to go to jail.” The pandemic delayed Mr. Snowden’s residency permit application, his lawyer said, and it appears to have made the exile’s life in Moscow even more cloistered than it already was. When Moscow was under lockdown in April and May, the city authorities required residents to obtain a digital permit for almost any trip outside. Mr. Snowden told Die Zeit he never once sought such a permit because he disagreed with the government’s brute-force approach to keeping people inside their homes. “The politics of the place are as troubled as ever but the people are fundamentally good people,” Mr. Snowden said of Russia. “As I would say in many countries, it is never the people you have to worry about, it’s always the government.” Mr. Kucherena, Mr. Snowden’s Russian lawyer, is also chairman of the Public Chamber of the Russian Interior Ministry, which plays an advisory role with the country’s top law-enforcement body. On Thursday, alongside his note on Facebook announcing Mr. Snowden’s permanent residency, Mr. Kucherena also posted a picture of a gift he had received from his client to commemorate the occasion. It was a photograph of Mr. Snowden and Mr. Kucherena exiting the transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo after Russia granted him asylum in August 2013. The photograph is captioned in Russian: “With thanks for the years of freedom.”']",The former intelligence contractor still hopes to return to the United States.

"In Shift for Church, Pope Francis Voices Support for Same-Sex Civil Unions",2020-10-21,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pope Francis expressed support for same-sex civil unions in remarks revealed in a documentary film that premiered on Wednesday, a significant break from his predecessors that staked out new ground for the church in its recognition of gay people. The remarks, coming from the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, had the potential to shift debates about the legal status of same-sex couples in nations around the globe and unsettle bishops worried that the unions threaten what the church considers traditional marriage — between one man and one woman. “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,” Francis said in the documentary, “Francesco,” which debuted at the Rome Film Festival, reiterating his view that gay people are children of God. “I stood up for that.” Many gay Catholics and their allies outside the church welcomed the pope’s remarks, though Francis’ opposition to gay marriage within the church remained absolute. His conservative critics within the church hierarchy, and especially in the conservative wing of the church in the United States, who have for years accused him of diluting church doctrine, saw the remarks as a reversal of church teaching. “The pope’s statement clearly contradicts what has been the longstanding teaching of the church about same-sex unions,” said Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, R.I., adding that the remarks needed to be clarified. There was little doubt that Francis, recorded on camera, made the statements during his pontificate. But there was confusion on Wednesday about when he had said them and to whom. The Vatican dismissed them as old news.  Francis has a tendency for making off-the-cuff public remarks, a trait that maddens both supporters and critics alike. The comments shown in the film are likely to generate exactly the sort of discussion the pope has repeatedly sought to foster on issues once considered forbidden in the church’s culture wars. Francis had already drastically shifted the tone of the church on questions related to homosexuality, but he has done little on policy and not changed teaching for a church that sees its future growth in the Southern Hemisphere, where the clerical hierarchy is generally less tolerant of homosexuality. The remark “in no way affects doctrine,” the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest and close ally of Francis, told the television channel of the Italian bishops conference on Wednesday evening. The remarks in the documentary were in keeping with Francis’ general support for gay people, but were perhaps his most specific and prominent on the issue of civil unions, which even traditionally Catholic nations like Italy, Ireland and Argentina have permitted in recent years. The director of the documentary, Evgeny Afineevsky, told The New York Times that Francis had made the remarks directly to him for the film. He did not reply to a question about when the remarks were made by the pope. The Vatican and allies of Francis publicly cast doubt on the notion that the pope said the remarks to Mr. Afineevsky, asserting that the pontiff instead had made them to a Mexican journalist, Valentina Alazraki, in an interview in the Vatican in May 2019. Earlier on Wednesday, Ms. Alazraki had told The Times that she did not recall the pope making the comments to her. In 2010, as Argentina was on the verge of approving gay marriage, Francis, then cardinal archbishop of Buenos Aires, supported the idea of civil unions for gay couples. As pope in 2014, he told the Corriere della Sera, Italy’s largest newspaper, that nations legalizing civil unions did so mostly to give same-sex partners legal rights and health care benefits and that he couldn’t express a blanket position. “You have to see the different cases and evaluate them in their variety,” he said then. But Francis’ remarks in the documentary, explicitly supporting civil unions as pope and on camera, had the potential for much greater impact on the debate over the recognition of gay couples by the church. “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family,” Francis says at another point in the documentary. “They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it.” Church teaching does not consider being gay a sin, but it does consider homosexual acts as “intrinsically disordered” and by extension holds that a homosexual orientation is “objectively disordered.” Church doctrine also explicitly states that marriage is between a man and a woman, a teaching Francis unwaveringly supports. Francis’ predecessors had also expressed their opposition, though, to civil unions. In 2003, under the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, the church’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, its doctrinal watchdog then led by the future Pope Benedict XVI, issued “Considerations regarding proposals to give legal recognition to unions between homosexual persons.” The document read, “The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.” Those views were not incorporated into church teaching, but bishops and some bishops conferences, which can be politically influential in certain countries, often opposed civil unions as a threat to the church’s view of traditional marriage. Advocates within the church for civil unions seized on the pope’s remarks in the documentary as a major blow to those efforts and as a breakthrough in the church’s long-painful relationship with gay people. “This is a major step forward in the church’s relationship with L.G.B.T.Q. people,” said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest who has written a book on how to make gay Catholics feel more welcome in the Church, and who has met with the pope and served as a consultor for the Vatican’s Secretariat for Communications. “It’s going to be harder for bishops to say that same-sex civil unions are a threat against marriage,” he said. “This is unmistakable support.” Some of the pope’s most consistent critics inside the Catholic hierarchy agreed that the pope seemed to support civil unions, and they were vexed by it. “The church cannot support the acceptance of objectively immoral relationships,” said Bishop Tobin of Providence. But the pope’s remarks do not mean he has altered church teaching on the subject, and Francis has a track record of making encouraging remarks for gay people. Starting in 2013, on a papal flight back from Brazil, his openness to gay people stunned the faithful inside the church, and secular fans outside of it, who were more accustomed to doctrinaire scoldings about homosexuality and gay marriage. “Who am I to judge,” Francis famously answered when asked about a supposedly gay priest on that flight. In his landmark 2016 document on the theme of family — titled “Amoris Laetitia,” or “The Joy of Love” — Francis rejected same-sex marriage, yet called on priests to be welcoming to people in nontraditional relationships, such as gay people, single parents and unmarried straight couples who live together. He also once told Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean sexual abuse survivor and gay person whom he befriended, and who is featured in the documentary, that “God made you this way and loves you this way, and the pope loves you this way.” But under Francis, the church also rejected what it cast as the notion that individuals can choose their gender, and he also told the leaders of seminaries that it was better not to admit gay candidates. “If you have the slightest doubt, it’s better to refuse them,” he once said. “Better that they live the ministry or their consecrated life than that they live a double life.” Critics pointed out that his church’s rules forced gay priests into a double life. But those who support the church being more welcoming of gay couples were pleased by the pope’s remarks in the film. “A pope sets the tone for the church and what he is doing is signaling to bishops and church leaders that a welcome for gay and lesbian couples has to go forward,” said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of L.G.B.T. Catholics. He noted that in the United States, the Supreme Court was poised to weigh whether Philadelphia may exclude a Catholic agency that does not work with same-sex couples from the city’s foster-care system. In Germany’s more liberal Catholic hierarchy, bishops had built momentum in their push to bless same-sex unions. Those deliberations and others, he hoped, would be influenced by the pope’s remarks. “They will ripple through the church and legislatures and courts and the personal and spiritual lives of Catholics who have been waiting for years and decades for an affirming word from their church leader,” Mr. DeBernardo said. “The significance is immense.” Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting from Washington, and Ruth Graham from Warner, N.H.']","The comments, shown in a new documentary, are the strongest yet from a pontificate that has taken a more tolerant and inclusive tone."
Copenhagen Mayor Resigns Amid #MeToo Wave in Denmark,2020-10-22,By Martin Selsoe Sorensen,"['COPENHAGEN — For nearly three decades, Frank Jensen was at the heart of progressive Danish politics. Twice a government minister, in January he celebrated 10 years as mayor of Copenhagen, a role he combined with the deputy chairmanship of the center-left Social Democrats, currently Denmark’s governing party. He was also a serial sexual harasser, as he admitted over the weekend after several young women described their experiences with him on newspaper front pages and live television. On Monday, Mr. Jensen, 59, resigned from his city and party positions. “I’m terribly sorry for the women I’ve offended through my 30 years in politics,” he told Jyllands-Posten, a Danish daily. The newspaper also cited a post by Mr. Jensen on Facebook in which he wrote: “There are episodes and details that have been experienced differently. But what remains is that some women have experienced that I have crossed their boundaries.” The length of the list of complaints — women have mentioned unwanted kissing, groping, leg fondling and even licking — and the suddenness of his fall have shaken Denmark, a relatively small, liberal nation that routinely tops international measures of women’s rights and gender equality. But the mayor’s disgrace is part of a gathering confrontation over sexual misconduct in the country. The case has exposed a wide generational gap between older Danes who often see unwanted touching and kissing or sexual comments as merely awkward and a younger generation who see them as violations and abusive. It’s a divide that places Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen — at 42 the youngest holder of her office but a Social Democrat insider of long standing — in a difficult position. In a letter to fellow Social Democrats that she posted on Facebook on Tuesday, Ms. Frederiksen promised new independent procedures to tackle misconduct and expressed regret for not speaking out about what she had known about “nooks and crannies” of the party. “I didn’t handle this leadership task well enough,” she added. Cecilie Svaerke Priess, 21, chairwoman of one of the party’s youth branches, was among  those who spoke out about Mr. Jensen. “If we want to change the culture it must have consequences more than an apology on Facebook,” she said. Before issuing his general apology on Monday, Mr. Jensen had denied any wrongdoing against Ms. Priess. He has not spoken about her specific allegations since then. Sonja Marie Jensen, 26, a Social Democrat member of the City Council in Nyborg, a town in central Denmark, in 2017 became one of the first people in Danish politics to speak about having been sexually harassed, in her case by fellow council members. “Legal equality is fine, but we don’t have cultural equality,” she said. “I’ve seen it happen, and I’ve seen that it wasn’t just me,” she added. Nonetheless, change has been slow to come. The momentum increased when a popular television host, Sofie Linde, 30, used the stage during an award show in August to mention that a “TV hot shot” had threatened to destroy her career if she refused to perform oral sex on him. It had happened, she said, during a Christmas party several years ago at DR, the state broadcaster. “You know who you are and you know I said no,” she said with a firm look at the camera. Kristian Madsen, 45, a political analyst and former member of the Social Democrats, said, “Firewood was gathered since 2017, but Sofie Linde was the spark that started the fire.” Ms. Linde was 18 at the time of that Christmas party, and she said that she had made a point of not naming her abuser because she wanted to target the culture more than individuals. In the weeks after her statement, 1,615 employees in the media industry signed a letter stating that they too were either victims of abuse or knew about abuse in their industry. So did 800 nurses and doctors and 689 academics. More specific accusations quickly followed. This month, the political leader of the centrist Social Liberal Party, Morten Ostergaard, resigned and admitted several instances of sexual harassment. This week, Mads Aagaard Danielsen, a well-known radio host, was fired from DR after several women and men came forward with evidence of hate messages and abuse from him over several years. Mr. Danielsen has acknowledged many of the accusations, apologized and said he planned to seek professional help. Pressure is also building on Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, over a sexual encounter in 2008 with a 15-year-old party member. He was a 34-year-old member of Parliament at the time and was briefly demoted when the case became public shortly after it happened. The encounter was not necessarily a criminal offense — Denmark’s age of consent is 15 unless the older party has authority or responsibility over the younger — and the girl never pressed charges. But the minister was forced to repeat his apologies last month, and lawmakers have demanded his resignation. Another senior Social Democrat lawmaker, Jesper Petersen, 39, admitted on Wednesday that he too had had sex with a 15-year-old, at age 20, after having met her as a substitute teacher. In the apology he posted to Facebook after an approach from Ekstra Bladet, a Danish tabloid, he said that he had “neither pressured her into anything nor done anything against her will,” but acknowledged that she had “subsequently been negatively affected by it in various ways.” Mr. Madsen, the political analyst, likened the situation to the impact of the 1968 youth movement. “It’s the young telling the older that their rules don’t apply anymore,” he said. But Ms. Priess, the youth wing chairwoman, said it remained the responsibility of the older people in power to change the culture. She herself, she added, had taken the first chance she got to raise the alarm about Copenhagen’s mayor. “If others had spoken up before I did, it wouldn’t have come this far,” she said.']",Frank Jensen admitted to harassing numerous women over decades. His case is part of a gathering confrontation in the country over sexual misconduct.
"Trump in North Carolina: ‘All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.’",2020-10-22,By Alexander Burns,"['President Trump complained about the news media’s intensive coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at a campaign rally in Gastonia, N.C., on Wednesday evening, describing the disease as an annoying inconvenience even as the country’s case count and death toll continue to soar. Attacking two television networks, CNN and MSNBC, with barbed epithets, Mr. Trump insisted for the second night in a row, “That pandemic is rounding the corner. They hate it when I say it.” “All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Mr. Trump said, repeating the word 11 times. “That’s all they put on, because they want to scare the hell out of everyone.” Mr. Trump’s lament about television news followed a familiar line in his recent speeches, defiantly insisting despite all evidence that the coronavirus is rapidly disappearing as an issue. It is not a perspective shared by most voters: A national poll published Monday by The New York Times found that 51 percent of likely voters believed the worst of the pandemic was yet to come, compared with 37 percent who said the worst was over. And that was not the full extent of Mr. Trump’s dissembling on the pandemic. He repeated a familiar — and false — line claiming that the country appears to have so many cases only because there is so much testing, and telling supporters that his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was seeking to “prolong the pandemic” and “shut down your country,” even though the former vice president has presented a public-health agenda aimed at doing the opposite. The president also continued taunting Democratic governors who have imposed restrictions on gatherings and commercial activity to counter the spread of the virus, including Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat seeking re-election whose popularity has risen in response to his handling of the pandemic. “You got to get your governor to open up your state here,” Mr. Trump said, prodding Mr. Cooper. “Open up your state, governor. It’s time.”']",
‘We Cannot Kill That Little Chihuahua’: Actor’s Puppy Crusade Shines Light on Global Trade,2020-10-21,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['Jean-Claude Van Damme has cracked the skulls and bones of bad guys, escaped from prison to find his dying brother and rescued a woman from a gang of thugs onscreen. And this week, the action movie star helped save a puppy in real life. Mr. Van Damme barreled into an international kerfuffle over a Chihuahua named Raya, who was in danger of being euthanized because, Norwegian officials said, she had entered the country on a fake Pet Passport. Mr. Van Damme’s puppy crusade became a hit on social media. Apparently, amid a coronavirus pandemic that is roaring back just as many countries were tentatively emerging from various levels of lockdown, it was the feel-good, tough-guy-has-a-tender-side tale that many people craved. Animal rights activists said that Raya’s plight most likely exposed a ring of East European breeders trafficking dogs to Western Europe. Dog breeding in Eastern Europe is cheaper and far less regulated, and animals like Raya can be claimed as purebred and vaccinated without real documentation of their origins. They are then often sold online at inflated prices. The 3-month-old puppy’s ordeal began in September, when she was purchased by a Norwegian man from Bulgarians who transported her to Oslo, Norway’s capital. The new owner took her to an Oslo veterinarian, who became suspicious about Raya’s documentation because of the date of her rabies vaccination. According to the date on the passport, she had been vaccinated at 2 months old, but a dog must be at least 3 months old before it can be vaccinated. The vet promptly informed the authorities. Within a week, Raya was apprehended by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and placed in quarantine. After concluding that she had, indeed, been brought into the country on a fake passport, they informed her owner, Alexey Iversen, that the puppy, which they described as an undocumented arrival, would be put to death. “There were several issues with the documents, and I also understand that this is also my fault, as I have not checked the dog’s documents properly,” Mr. Iversen wrote online. But he added that “the dog is innocent, and I think the punishment does not correspond to the crime.” After battling unsuccessfully with the authorities to free Raya, Mr. Iversen contacted a lawyer, who managed to delay the euthanasia date to October, he said. Mr. Iversen also started a petition online to save the dog’s life. Somehow, the Belgian-born Mr. Van Damme — known as “The Muscles From Brussels” for films like “Missing in Action,” “Kickboxer” and “Hard Target” — became aware of Raya’s story, and he stepped in. In a Facebook live video posted on Sunday, a bespectacled Mr. Van Damme implored his more than 27 million followers — and others on Instagram and Twitter — to sign the petition to save the Chihuahua. “We cannot kill that little Chihuahua. It’s bad luck for the future, it’s bad luck for Covid, it’s bad luck for all that stuff,” Mr. Van Damme said in the video, while clutching his own Chihuahua by its tiny barrel chest. Mr. Van Damme really, really loves dogs. He has donated tens of thousands of dollars to animal rights organizations, rescued dozens of strays from around the world, once scrapped a tour to be with one of them (named Scarface) when it was sick, and has said that feeling a dog’s beating heart beside him helps him fall asleep at night. Nearly 200,000 people reacted to the actor’s Facebook video, in which Mr. Van Damme offered to pay any fees associated with saving Raya’s life. Shortly afterward, the authorities told Mr. Iversen that the dog would be returned to Bulgaria. But it is unclear whether she and Mr. Iversen will eventually be reunited. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority could not immediately be reached for comment. Yavor Gechev, the representative for the Bulgarian office of Four Paws, an international animal welfare group that became involved in Raya’s case, said that hers was not a unique situation. “It seems that this, indeed, is a very lucrative business,” he said, adding, “This is a serious issue for the European Union.” Mr. Gechev said that the Bulgarians who had sold Raya claimed she had been bred in Varna, a port city in Bulgaria infamous for its unregulated breeding industry. He said a veterinarian there, who has since been accused of wide-scale forgery of dog passports, provided Raya’s documents. In Norway, the puppy was probably sold to Mr. Iversen for up to 10 times her original price, Mr. Gechev said. Animals bred and sold in Western Europe can bring in more than 1,000 euros (about $1,180) each, which fuels the trade in illegal documents, he said. “I believe we are talking here about thousands of dogs being exported on an annual basis,” he added. All animals in the European Union need documentation to cross borders. In 2018, a cow named Penka was sentenced to death after it wandered from Bulgaria into Serbia. Like Raya, she ultimately survived thanks to another celebrity, Paul McCartney, who promoted a petition on Twitter to save her. Mr. Iversen, who would communicate only through Facebook, described Raya as “a very sweet, active and kind dog” who was terrified of being alone, and who liked to sleep in his bed and be carried in a bag. “My family and I are dreaming about getting our family member, Raya, back,” he wrote.  He thanked Mr. Van Damme not only for saving his dog’s life, but also for restoring “many people’s hopes in humanity and kindness.” Mr. Van Damme could not be reached for comment. In the past, he has melded his love of animals with his onscreen fame. In April, he released a short YouTube film made with his family, in which he rescues canines using a series of karate tricks. “Even my first ancestors, like Jean-Claude ‘Bam Wam’ Van Damme the Fifth, help the path of the dogs of the world,” he says tongue-in-cheek in the clip, as the camera pans over a painting of Mr. Van Damme in a Renaissance-era ruff, with dogs at his feet. “I’m trying to do the same.”']",The action star Jean-Claude Van Damme intervened to save a Bulgarian dog from euthanasia after Norway said it had been imported on a fake passport.
A Radical Cleric Ignites an Islamist Resistance in Afghanistan,2020-10-22,"By David Zucchino, Najim Rahim and Jim Huylebroek","['HERAT, Afghanistan — In one of the oldest districts of the ancient city of Herat, religious vigilantes loyal to a local cleric patrol the streets, routinely detaining and interrogating couples they suspect are unmarried. Then the vigilantes take the suspects to the cleric’s tribunals that enforce his interpretation of Shariah law, which forbids public contact between a single woman and an unrelated male. The penalty for violators: the man is whipped or clubbed, and the woman is returned to male relatives for likely punishment. The cleric, Mawlawi Mujib Rahman Ansari, has also posted billboards declaring that any man whose wife does not completely cover herself in public is a coward. And he has banned music and concerts, while also declaring that Covid-19 was sent by God to punish non-Muslims. Mawlawi Ansari, 36, a burly, bearded cleric, has carved out his own fief in a conservative district of Herat, a western Afghanistan city renowned for art and culture. Residents say his enforcers have seized control of the district from the police, who rarely interfere with their vigorous enforcement of strict Shariah law. Though he says he is not affiliated with the Taliban, Mawlawi Ansari’s edicts are an echo of that movement’s harsh Islamic codes — and perhaps a portent of what could come as the insurgency negotiates a power-sharing deal with the government. Mawlawi Ansari’s tactics have alarmed women’s rights advocates and put the provincial government on the defensive. And Islamic scholars say he is just the vanguard of a rising tide of extremist clerics who have galvanized public resistance to the often corrupt and ineffective American-backed Afghan government — yet another way the government is coming under dire pressure outside the Taliban’s insurgency. In his slice of Herat, Mawlawi Ansari has resurrected perhaps the most despised relic of Taliban rule during the late 1990s: the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which brutally enforced Shariah law. In the mullah’s neighborhood of Gozargah, his enforcers wear white tunics adorned with the crossed-swords logo of his religious movement. They intercept couples in cars, on motorcycles and on the street, questioning them separately and sometimes demanding a marriage certificate. Married couples have been threatened because they didn’t have a certificate on hand. In a sermon last year, Mawlawi Ansari suggested chopping off the hands of thieves and stoning accused adulterers. He bars women from his news conferences. He has cowed the local government with his music ban, though officials did take down his billboards. “He is creating a lot of fear in the community,” said Suraya Pakzad, a prominent women’s rights activist in Herat. She said the tactics evoked painful memories of Taliban rule, when she ran an underground school for girls. “They are there to keep anyone from enjoying life,” she said. Another activist, Fatima Farahi, said she was afraid to let her daughter leave the house. “The government should prevent this sort of extremism,” she said. Herat’s provincial governor, Abdul Wahid Qatali, acknowledged that Mawlawi Ansari had tapped into public resentment of the government. But he said most followers were uneducated villagers drawn by the mullah’s conservative religious and cultural populism. Mawlawi Ansari — Mawlawi is a title meaning Islamic scholar — is venerated by many followers as a descendant of a revered 11th-century Muslim Sufi saint, Abdullah Ansari of Herat, whose tomb is near the cleric’s mosque. “Whatever he says at Friday Prayer, we can deal with,” Governor Qatali said inside his heavily guarded compound. “He’s not taking weapons against the government. But our red line is that we won’t let him panic our people and our women.” He added: “We’re fighting the Taliban now and we don’t want to expend energy fighting this mullah. And we don’t want to lose the mullahs who support the government.” Asked about Mawlawi Ansari’s ban on music and concerts, the governor said such gatherings posed security risks anyway. On a recent Friday, buses crammed with men and boys lumbered up to a city mosque, where thousands of people queued under a punishing sun to submit to body searches. The mullah’s voice boomed over loudspeakers, echoing off the mosque walls and reaching worshipers praying in walkways and gardens well beyond the mosque. The next day, Mawlawi Ansari gave an interview to The New York Times, sitting cross-legged on the library floor of the school at his mosque and condemning the Afghanistan government as un-Islamic and unworthy of allegiance. His radio station and Facebook and Instagram accounts help spread that message even though he has condemned certain secular TV programs and social media platforms as “shameful” and un-Islamic. Mawlawi Ansari boasted that his mosque tribunals had punished more than 100 people accused of violating Shariah law since the patrols began in December. He said detained men had been held briefly in a makeshift jail while a religious committee determined punishment. “If the government did its job properly, we would be its servants,” he said. “But it doesn’t, so we have the responsibility to stand on our own feet.” Told that many women in Herat feared his harsh tactics, he said that only “impure and immoral” women felt threatened. Women of virtue and chastity obey his strictures to cover their bodies and hair, he said. “There is no justice in the Afghanistan system, so we must provide justice,” Mawlawi Ansari said. Even with the old Taliban government long gone and after 19 years of occupation by foreign troops, “the people still want Islamic government with Shariah law,” he said. The local government does not dare confront him, he said, because many officials and police officers agree with his teachings; some officers were seen praying at this mosque. Asked about the peace talks going on with the Taliban, Mawlawi Ansari said he would support any government based on Shariah law, whether or not it included the Taliban. But he said he condemned Taliban suicide attacks and maintained no militia himself — only bodyguards who carry assault rifles and have government-issued weapon permits. He approves of girls attending schools and universities, he said, but separately from male students. At Friday Prayer, Najibullah Sari, 24, a university student, said he supported the cleric because “bad people must be stopped when society is headed toward corruption.” Ahmad Huzaif Noorzaie, 22, who directs one of Mawlawi Ansari’s checkpoints, said he and his colleagues separate men and women seen traveling together in the Gozargah neighborhood. “We question them to see if their answers are the same,” he said. “If not, they face punishment.” Tariq Nabi, a prominent Islamic scholar, said Mawlawi Ansari had created a worrisome parallel government based on the ultraconservative Wahhabi interpretation of Islam learned during his studies in Saudi Arabia. He said other extremist clerics have imposed similar versions of Shariah law in other Afghan provinces. “I’m very concerned, because individual freedoms are endangered,” said Mr. Nabi, who described Mawlawi Ansari’s Wahhabi teachings as unsuited for Afghanistan. On his TV broadcasts, Mr. Nabi has challenged Mawlawi Ansari’s call for Muslims to attend mosques despite Covid-19 risks, telling listeners to avoid crowds, including at mosques. Another Islamic scholar, Abdul Majid Samim, said many Afghans embraced Mawlawi Ansari and other extremist clerics because they condemned the government and its American backers. Some espoused violence, he said. “You can’t implement Islam by force,” he said. Recently, the government-run Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs in Herat revived its dormant Office for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice — though officials insisted that it was not to support Mawlawi Ansari’s vice checkpoints, and that it did not punish anyone. Still, the move has been seen as a victory for Mawlawi Ansari, who said plans were underway to establish such offices in other provinces. Recently, the governor of Nangarhar Province said he would form a vice office, but later backtracked after an angry backlash on social media. Mawlawi Ansari is not taking no for an answer. Sitting inside the mosque library, he insisted that a visiting American journalist convert to Islam. When the journalist declined, the cleric gave him a stern look and said, “Then you will burn in hell.” Asad Timory contributed reporting from Herat and Fahim Abed from Kabul.']","The cleric’s supporters in Herat are enforcing harsh Shariah law reminiscent of the Taliban’s. Women are alarmed, and the government has been able to do little."
She Was in Labor. Floodwaters Were Rising. Then the Boat Tipped Over.,2020-10-23,By Chau Doan and Mike Ives,"['HANOI, Vietnam — It was no time to travel, but when Nguyen Dac Minh’s wife went into labor, he put her on his motorbike and rode toward the hospital. Floodwaters that had killed scores across Vietnam were rising ominously around their village. At a washed-out railway overpass, he hired a man to ferry them in a small boat. But strong winds carried away some of the baby clothes the couple had packed, and Mr. Minh waded into the water to retrieve them. Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment. “Everything happened right in front of my eyes, but I couldn’t save her,” he said by phone on Thursday. “All I could do was scream.” Video from the scene in Thua Thien Hue Province has ricocheted across social media, generating an outpouring of grief and sympathy nationwide. Ms. Phuong, a mother of two, was one of at least 114 people killed this month in record-shattering floods that have pummeled Vietnam’s central coast. Twenty-one people remain missing. More than a quarter of the deaths have been attributed to landslides. One killed at least 20 military personnel last weekend in the central province of Quang Tri, a prime theater of battle during the Vietnam War. It is believed to have been the country’s largest military loss in peacetime. Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, president of the Vietnam Red Cross Society, said the floods were among the worst the aid group had seen in decades. “Everywhere we look, homes, roads and infrastructure have been submerged,” she said. Storms are a fact of life in Vietnam, with its 2,000-mile coastline. Typhoons lash central provinces during the rainy season, which begins in late summer. Tourists visiting Hoi An, a UNESCO World Heritage site on the central coast, are often surprised to see its narrow streets suddenly turn into Venice-like canals. Scientists have pointed to climate change as the main driver of more frequent and deadlier storms around the globe. The authorities in Vietnam tend to be well prepared for natural disasters, but a surge in cyclones, rains and floods this month has overwhelmed some coastal provinces. According to the United Nations, 178,000 homes in central Vietnam had been flooded as of Thursday. Vietnam’s foreign minister, Pham Binh Minh, said on Twitter this week that the country had “suffered a difficult time with huge losses.” Now, as rescuers scramble to reach other flood victims by land, air and sea, Vietnam is bracing for its third major storm in three weeks. Typhoon Saudel was moving through the South China Sea on Friday and was expected to make landfall on Sunday — in the same coastal areas where many villages are already underwater. The amount of rainfall this month was “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it far exceeded the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in central Vietnam by the end of this century, said Pamela McElwee, a professor of human ecology at Rutgers University who studies environmental issues in Vietnam. Other countries in Asia have seen record-breaking rainfall. Earlier this year, torrential rains submerged at least a quarter of Bangladesh. Unusually heavy rains wreaked havoc in central and southwestern China, leaving hundreds dead and disrupting the economy’s post-pandemic recovery. Flooding in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal killed scores of people, destroyed homes and inundated entire villages. In Vietnam, heavy rains can be bad enough along the flat plains of the Red River, which flows southeast from the border with China through the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, before emptying into the sea. But in central Vietnam, where population centers are wedged between mountains and coastline, the potential for catastrophic flooding is that much higher. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go,” Professor McElwee said. It hardly helps, she added, that tree cover is cleared in the mountains for hydropower dams, or that mountain roads are built in ways that weaken the soil. She added that the floods were a lesson for those who believe that building more infrastructure is a silver-bullet solution to the climate crisis. In the central province where Ms. Phuong and Mr. Minh scratched out a living, extreme weather is so common that it animates local folk sayings. “When it is hot, heaven burns the field like baking stones. When it rains, fields go rotten and sand starts to stink,” is a popular one. For years, the couple were too busy to worry much about the weather. He worked construction while she toiled on an assembly line in a garment factory. She also beat breast cancer. Last week, when Ms. Phuong went into labor, Mr. Minh fired up his motorbike, asking his brother-in-law to follow along on a separate bike with his wife’s luggage. When they reached the railway overpass, he hired a boat to take them across a flooded expanse to a taxi on the other side. After he climbed out of the boat to retrieve the baby clothes, it tipped his wife into the floodwaters. He was close enough to see her hands waving as the current pulled her under, he said. The authorities mobilized a search party of more than 100 people, but it was too late. Ms. Phuong’s body was found about 300 feet downstream. As of Friday, video of the search effort and Ms. Phuong’s funeral had been viewed more than a million times, and donations were pouring in for Mr. Minh and the couple’s daughter and son, now 12 and 13. In a video recorded at the site after the accident, on a patch of road by the water, Mr. Minh can be seen bending to the ground in a prayerlike position. “Oh my god,” he said. “My darling.” Chau Doan reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.']",A pregnant woman who drowned in Vietnam was one of at least 114 people killed in record-breaking floods that have pummeled the country’s central coast.
A Francophile’s Unexpected Love Affair With Canadian Wine,2020-10-23,By Dan Bilefsky,"['It began with grape-guzzling bears. I was on vacation in British Columbia’s pristinely beautiful Okanagan winemaking region this summer when I asked Severine Pinte, a French winemaker, to describe her biggest culture shock since arriving in Canada a decade ago. Her answer? The menacing black bears that climbed down from the mountains every September, around harvest time, and devoured rows of her precious grapes, forcing local wineries to employ electrified fences, pepper bombs or hunters. I immediately knew I was on to a story. The settlement of French winemakers in the area also seemed an encouraging sign of its potential. [Read: Canada’s Napa Valley Seeks Elusive Audience: Canadian Wine Drinkers]. Could the country that gave the world such delicacies as seal flipper pie, shmoo cake and poutine become the land of pinot noir, and enter the pantheon of famed winemaking regions like Bordeaux, Napa Valley and Tuscany? I have to confess, I approached the question with snobbery and skepticism. I equated great wine with the country of Voltaire. After all, my oenophilia had taken root while I was a Paris correspondent for The Times. Outside of work, I inhaled glasses of full-bodied Bordeaux wines in crowded Parisien bistros and relished traveling to French wine country. After I moved back to Montreal following nearly three decades in Europe, the sterile efficiency of my neighborhood’s state-run liquor store made me lonesome for my local Parisien wine merchant. There, I had been greeted with a hearty “Daniel!” The wine attendant knew my favorite vintages by heart and lovingly presented me bottles of St.-Joseph or Pomorol as if handing over his children. Nevertheless, in August, I traveled to the Okanagan Valley with an open mind. Like other Canadians, I had been desperate for a pandemic escape and had braved a nearly six-hour, masked flight to Vancouver, followed by a nearly five-hour drive to the region. But when I set eyes on the valley’s awe-inducing mountains and lakes, I momentarily forgot killer viruses. Then I tasted the wine. I experienced a coup de foudre — love at first sight. I was immediately seduced by the dark berry-infused boldness of Black Hills Estate winery’s Nota Bene red wine, as well as Le Vieux Pin’s elegant Violette Syrah and Little Engine Wines’s Platinum Pinot Noir. And even without my wine-induced buzz, the informality of jovial Canadian wine pilgrims in shorts and flip flops made the tastings less stodgy than some I had experienced in France. Possessed by the zeal of a new convert, I was dismayed to discover that most Okanagan wines weren’t easily available in the rest of Canada, including my native Montreal. I needed to find out: Why? The answer dumbfounded me — Prohibition era regulations continued to hold sway and most provinces still forbade individual consumers to order shipments of wine from other provinces. This being Canada, regionalism was also at play. At upmarket restaurants in food-obsessed Montreal, sommeliers were more likely to suggest a plucky Quebec wine or a French vintage than wine from faraway British Columbia (Some Quebecers like to use the acronym “ROC” to refer to the rest of Canada, as if citing a noxious foreign planet). When I asked the Okanagan wineries if I could order wine to Montreal, they explained, often in hushed whispers, that they got around the rules by using a medical supplies company and not labeling shipments as wine. I couldn’t help wondering if this frisson of subterfuge made the wine more enjoyable, like gaining access to an atmospheric speakeasy in New York City in the 1920s. As we gazed over the vineyard of Osoyoos Larose Estate winery, its chief winemaker, Caroline Schaller, explained to me that it was also challenging for Okanagan wines to gain traction nationwide, when low volumes of production kept prices relatively high. “You can find a drinkable bottle of Bordeaux wine in a Paris wine shop for $5,” she observed. In contrast, a glass of her Osoyoos Larose Le Grand Vin, can cost as much as $16 in an upmarket Vancouver restaurant. Nevertheless, the Okanagan Valley is gradually gaining a global following in perhaps unlikely places. Raphaël Merlaut is part of the family that founded France’s Groupe Taillan, which owns, among other things, Osoyoos Larose Estate winery and 21 châteaux in France. He told me that the creativity he observed in the Okanagan Valley made him feel like he was being transported in a time machine to Bordeaux in the 18th century. “For my family, B.C. wine is a love affair, like meeting a woman and falling in love,” he told me. “It’s a new frontier.” Ms. Pinte of Le Vieux Pin explained that the freedom of the Okanagan Valley had attracted her. While the varieties of grapes winemakers are allowed to use is circumscribed in Bordeaux, being able to draw on nearly 60 varieties in the Okanagan Valley made her feel like an expressionist painter. Yet the region still faces prejudices. “French people think Canada is an arctic place with dog sleighs and snow,” she explained. “They don’t realize there are desert conditions in the Okanagan Valley, which are optimal for growing grapes.” After my trip, I hosted a socially-distanced blind wine tasting with a group of fellow cork dorks, in which we hid our bottles’ labels with aluminum foil. The wines in the contest included a venerable Château Pédesclaux 2012 from Pauillac in the Bordeaux region and a Savigny-lès-Beaune, 1er cru, 2012, a Pinot Noir from France’s Bourgogne. And guess what? My offering, a 2018 Nota Bene from Okanagan’s Black Hills Estate winery came in first place, trouncing its French rivals. Like a grape-guzzling Canadian bear. This week, I wrote on the recent “lobster wars” in Nova Scotia, during which angry mobs of commercial fishermen attacked lobster storage facilities used by Indigenous fishermen. The conflict follows a series of abuses of Indigenous people in Canada. Residents of Asbestos, Quebec, have voted to shed the town’s name.

"In a calmer debate, Trump and Biden offer sharply different visions of the pandemic.",2020-10-23,"By Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Pam Belluck","['President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered starkly divergent closing arguments to the country in the final presidential debate on Thursday, offering opposite prognoses for a range of issues, including the coronavirus pandemic. The debate was, on the whole, a more restrained affair than the first encounter between the two candidates last month, when Mr. Trump harangued Mr. Biden for most of an hour and a half and effectively short-circuited any policy debate. But if the tenor of Thursday’s forum was more sedate, the conflict in matters of substance and vision could not have been more dramatic. From the opening minutes, the two candidates took opposing stances on the pandemic, with Mr. Trump promising, in defiance of evidence, that the disease was “going away.” The next morning, Alex M. Azar, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the president was “trying to give people hope, given the vaccines and therapeutics that are coming in around the corner.” Speaking on CNN, Mr. Azar said, “But we do need to acknowledge — and he does acknowledge — that we’re in a very serious moment right now.” Mr. Biden, on Thursday, called for much more aggressive federal action for the “dark winter” ahead. Mr. Trump appeared determined to cast his opponent as a career politician who was, as he jabbed toward the end of the debate, “all talk and no action.” Mr. Trump, however, did little to lay out an affirmative case for his own re-election, or to explain in clear terms what he would hope to do with another four years in the White House. He frequently misrepresented the facts of his own record, and Mr. Biden’s. And on his most important political vulnerability — his mismanagement of the pandemic — Mr. Trump hewed unswervingly to a message that happy days are nearly here again, even as polls show that a majority of voters believe the worst of the coronavirus crisis is still ahead. Mr. Biden, for his part, stuck to the core of the argument that has propelled his campaign from the start, denouncing Mr. Trump as a divisive and unethical leader who has botched the federal response to a devastating public-health crisis. Though Mr. Trump pushed him onto the defensive repeatedly, the former vice president also laid out a fuller version of his own policy agenda than he managed in the first debate, calling for large-scale economic stimulus spending, new aid to states battling the pandemic and a muscular expansion of health care and worker benefits nationwide.']",
The C.D.C. updates its definition of ‘close contact’ in relation to infection risk.,2020-10-21,By Gina Kolata,"['The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its definition of what it means to be in close contact with an infected person and therefore at risk of contracting the coronavirus. The agency made the update in its published guidance for coronavirus contact tracing on Wednesday. The new guideline says close contact means being within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. The previous guideline said a person was at risk after 15 minutes of exposure within 6 feet of an infected person. One school district in Montana interpreted that to mean that if students moved every 15 minutes, the risk of infection was mitigated. The change could mean that when contact tracers speak to people who were close to an infected person, they could consider more of them at risk of also becoming infected. In the guidance, the agency notes that it does not have much data on what actually constitutes “close contact.” But it added that a total of 15 minutes of exposure to an infected person “can be used as an operational definition for contact investigation.” The C.D.C. added that the closer the contact, the greater the risk. Risk also increases over more time in contact with someone infected and from contact with an infected person who has symptoms. Someone who is coughing, singing or shouting is more likely to spread the virus, the C.D.C. said.']",
"In Xi’s Homage to Korean War, a Jab at the U.S.",2020-10-23,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Buckley,"['SEOUL, South Korea — First China’s leader, Xi Jinping, visited the national military museum in Beijing and hailed the country’s “victory in the war to resist American aggression and aid Korea.” Then he wrote a public letter to veterans in a retirement home in Sichuan. On Friday, culminating a weeklong commemoration of the Korean War, he delivered a pugnacious and at times visceral homage to those who sacrificed against the country’s enemies, the United States foremost of them all. “The Chinese people don’t go looking for trouble, but nor do they fear it,” Mr. Xi said before hundreds of party officials, military officers and aged veterans in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. “Confronted with any hardships or dangers, the calves of their legs will not shake, and their backs will not bend.” For Mr. Xi and the country’s propagandists, the anniversary of China’s entry into the Korean War 70 years ago this week could hardly have come at a more opportune time. The country, in their telling, is once again facing an unprovoked assault by a superpower determined to thwart China’s rise. This time the United States, under President Trump, has targeted China’s trade policy, its technological advances and its territorial ambitions. The anniversary unfolded with a barrage of commemorative events, exhibitions, television documentaries and feature films. They all conveyed the same message: The Chinese people have stood up to the United States before and, regardless of the costs, they will again. Another Chinese leader, in a different era, might have moderated the rhetoric before the United States election to avoid alienating the American political and business establishment. Not Mr. Xi. “Seventy years ago, imperialist invaders brought the flames of war burning to the doorway of the new China,” he said on Friday. “The Chinese people have a deep understanding that in responding to invaders, one must speak to them in a language that they understand.” The events commemorating the war — long known as the “forgotten war” in the United States — have followed a series of military drills and an outburst of propaganda. Together they have signaled a hardening resolve against the United States and further raised tensions inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic and President Trump’s continuing derision of China. Popular opinion in both countries has soured as a result, creating animosity that is not likely to ease soon, regardless of the outcome of the American election, which is now less than two weeks away. “Seventy years ago, China was poor and weak,” Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said in an interview, echoing the theme of Mr. Xi’s speech on Friday. “Facing the United States as a superpower, China fought. Is there anything China dare not do now?” History in China has long been repurposed to fit political needs, leaving little room for a frank reckoning with the past. In the last two decades, some Chinese historians quietly challenged the heroic official narrative of Mao’s decision to thrust the country into the Korean War, fought from 1950 to 1953. But that story has long been a pillar of the founding mythology of the People’s Republic of China, and Mr. Xi relived its highlights in his remarks. Coming barely a year after the country’s founding, the war was a searing and painful test. When it broke out, China remained at war with the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek that had retreated to Taiwan, and also faced armed resistance to its invasion of Tibet. Chinese forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the retreating North Korean army on Oct. 19, 1950; six days later, they fought their first battle with the allied troops fighting under a United Nations mandate. According to China’s official account, which Mr. Xi cited on Friday, 197,000 Chinese died in the war, though historians broadly agree that the actual toll was much higher. Commemorations of the war have ebbed and flowed in intensity over the decades for reasons having little to do with the war itself. Guan Ling, a commentator with Duowei News, the Chinese-language site based in New York, has chronicled how major anniversaries have reflected the country’s respective leaders and geopolitical circumstances. Mao Zedong played down the 20th anniversary in 1970 as he sought a normalization of relations with the United States, whereas Jiang Zemin in 2000 emphasized the 50th, which occurred in the wake of the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Serbia during the Kosovo war the year before. John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul and author of a forthcoming book on the Korean War, said that Mr. Xi had delivered a similar speech as vice president 10 years ago, although in substance and tone it was less combative.  “There’s a different resonance now,” Mr. Delury said. “He’s hitting the stand-up-to-America theme pretty hard now. It’s getting intense.” Mr. Xi also appeared to have a domestic audience in mind. He and the rest of the party leadership are scheduled to gather next week in a closed-door assembly to discuss China’s priorities for the next five years. He used Friday’s speech to restate his case for the primacy of the Communist Party leadership, with himself at the core. It is a theme he has often invoked amid the pandemic, which, despite early missteps, his government has managed to bring under control domestically. Even the sight of a cadre of hundreds in a crowded hall — all wearing masks — was a striking contrast to bans on gatherings in many countries. Mr. Xi’s speech had a strikingly hawkish tone, describing at one point the sacrifices of soldiers who had used their bodies as shields against a far superior force. “They smashed the myth that the American military was invincible,” he said. Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has reorganized the Chinese military, trying to create a modern, multipronged fighting force, a model that he said the Korean War first taught the People’s Liberation Army. For most in China, the war has become a distant memory. Its remaining veterans are gradually dying off, and Chinese society today is unimaginably transformed from the impoverished China of the 1950s. The country has not experienced war now since 1979, when it invaded Vietnam and was routed. Lest the idea of war become an abstraction, the party’s propaganda apparatus has churned out dozens of programs. A six-part documentary aired each night this week on state television. The nightly news casts have featured not only Mr. Xi’s appearances, as always, but also profiles of soldiers who fought and died. Film studios have responded to government directives and produced a series of feature films, including an animated movie, called “Salute to Heroes,” that is aimed at younger audiences. Also having its opening on Friday was a blockbuster about the war starring Wu Jing, the lead actor in the “Wolf Warrior” action film franchise that has given a name to Chinese diplomacy of late. The film depicts Chinese soldiers keeping a vital river crossing open against relentless American bombardment. Its title in English: “The Sacrifice.” Near the end, an American pilot marvels at the tenacity of the soldiers below. He radios back to his commanders that their attacks have failed. “There’s nothing we can do to stop them.” Steven Lee Myers reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Chris Buckley from Sydney, Australia. Claire Fu and Amber Wang in Beijing contributed research.']","China is commemorating the war with a barrage of nationalistic propaganda. “They smashed the myth that the American military was invincible,” China’s leader said."
How Bolivia Overcame a Crisis and Held a Clean Election,2020-10-23,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — As Election Day neared, candidates fretted over the possibility of fraud. Voters across Bolivia questioned the solidity of the electoral process. And many worried that the result — any result — would provoke anger and violence from the other side. But in the days that followed the vote, something unexpected happened. The election went smoothly, and its results were quickly and widely accepted — an accomplishment that is being celebrated by many in a country that has weathered years of threats to its democracy. “Democracy won in Bolivia,” said Fernanda Wanderley, director of the socioeconomic institute at the Universidad Católica Boliviana. Exit polls on Sunday showed one candidate, Luis Arce, clearly taking the lead. His main opponent, Carlos Mesa, conceded the next day. On Friday, Bolivia’s electoral tribunal confirmed that Mr. Arce would indeed be the next president of Bolivia, matching the exit polls and voters’ expectations. In the end, Mr. Arce won 55 percent of the vote, and Mr. Mesa had just under 29 percent, a win far bigger than Mr. Arce’s advisers had predicted. Mr. Arce is the chosen candidate of the former president, Evo Morales, a towering figure of Bolivia politics. Mr. Morales is a socialist who transformed the country, lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty and prioritizing Indigenous and rural communities in a nation that had been run for centuries by a mostly white elite. The numbers indicate clear voter interest in continuing with Mr. Morales’s political project, and his party, Movimiento al Socialismo, or MAS. But voters and analysts also say the election signals a promising moment for a democratic system that had been slipping under Mr. Morales, who bypassed the rules in his government’s own constitution to run for a third and then a fourth term, and was criticized for persecuting opponents, harassing journalists and stacking the judiciary in his favor. His attempt to run for a fourth term last year ended in allegations of electoral fraud, and demands from opponents and protesters in the streets that he step down. Once police and the armed forces joined the call for his resignation, he left the country — and called his ouster a coup. Sunday’s election was a do-over of last year’s. The president who has served in an interim capacity over the last year, Jeanine Añez, an opponent of Mr. Morales, has also persecuted her political enemies and stifled dissent, and infuriated many Bolivians by postponing the new election. Her hard-line anti-MAS rhetoric, which made little distinction between party officials and everyday voters, turned off many Bolivians, said Raúl Peñaranda, a Bolivian journalist. In interviews, many Bolivians attributed the relative calm after the election and the high turnout for Mr. Arce to a yearning for stability. In the country’s fewer than 200 years, it has seen 190 revolutions and coups. The last year included deadly protests, a presidential ouster, a health crisis that killed thousands, a financial crisis that has left many hungry and a contentious election that has riven the nation. Mr. Morales, who was in office for 14 years, was Bolivia’s longest-serving president and presided over the country at a time when a commodities boom sent money flowing into the country. Mr. Arce was his economics minister for much of that time, and is often associated with that prosperity and relative political stability. He has also promised to stay in office just five years. All of this seems to have convinced more than half of the country to give him a chance. “I think the crisis of the last year did a lot of damage to Bolivian democracy, part of an accumulative process,” said Ms. Wanderley. “But in the end, Bolivia found a path to overcome that crisis, and was able to conduct a clean, legitimate election in which the winner was decided by the popular vote.” After Mr. Morales’s ouster, Bolivia also made a concerted effort to address mistrust in the electoral system. It overhauled its electoral tribunal, which had been stacked with Morales loyalists. It also rolled out a voter education campaign and cleaned up the electoral rolls, said Naledi Lester, an election expert working in La Paz to assess the vote for the Carter Center, a nonprofit that has been observing elections since 1989. Her colleague José Antonio de Gabriel, also working in La Paz, said the tribunal conducted an organized vote, and “acted with impartiality and independence and protected political plurality.” Mr. Morales was forced out last year after his critics accused his government of trying to rig the vote in his favor. The Organization of American States, which fielded the largest electoral observer mission in Bolivia last year, heavily criticized the 2019 process, concluding that election officials had engaged in “intentional manipulation” and “serious irregularities” that made it impossible to verify the result. These irregularities included hidden data servers, manipulated voting receipts and forged signatures, the O.A.S. said. Several reports by academics and policy experts have since criticized the organization’s statistical analysis of the election. But the O.A.S. report has shaped the local and global narrative of the election. It has been used by Mr. Morales’s supporters to claim that global forces are conspiring against them, and by Mr. Morales’s critics to claim that MAS rigged the vote. These differing views have sent people to the streets over the last year, sometimes resulting in violent clashes. This year the O.A.S. sent 40 people to observe the election. On Wednesday, the organization issued a report calling it “exemplary” and “without fraudulent actions.” The relatively smooth nature of the election may also have to do with who won. Before Sunday’s election, Mr. Arce’s party had been a lead voice sowing doubt in the impartiality of the electoral tribunal. His supporters, in many interviews, often said that they wouldn’t trust the vote if he didn’t emerge as the victor. “Arce is going to win, but they’re going to try and cheat him out of it,” said Graciela Fernández, 41, a produce seller, just days before the election. “Then there is going to be a fight.” Mr. Mesa, on the other hand, said in an interview that he would “absolutely, categorically” accept the results if he lost. And then he did. Mr. Arce’s criticisms of the electoral tribunal mostly fell away once he won. “If the results had been different,” said Ms. Wanderley, “we could have had problems, grave problems.”']",
Libya Cease-Fire Raises Hopes for Full Peace Deal,2020-10-23,By Nick Cumming-Bruce and Declan Walsh,"['GENEVA — Libya’s two main warring factions agreed to a cease-fire on Friday, raising hopes for an end to years of bloody turmoil that have drawn in military forces from Russia, Turkey and other regional powers. The two sides signed the agreement at the United Nations in Geneva at the end of a weeklong meeting of delegates from the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, which is based in the capital Tripoli, and the self-styled Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Hifter and based in the country’s east. The two sides agreed to a complete, countrywide and permanent agreement with immediate effect, said Stephanie Williams, the United Nations acting special envoy who was chairwoman of the most recent talks. She said it called for frontline forces to return to their bases and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries within three months, a process that would be monitored by the United Nations. “God willing, it will be the key to peace and security in all Libya,” Col. Ali Abushama, the head of the government delegation, said at the signing ceremony. “We have had enough suffering, enough division, enough bloodshed.” Libya has a long history of failed peace initiatives and the reaction of the foreign sponsors that have driven the long-running war, on both sides of the conflict, will be crucial to the success of the cease-fire. Ms. Williams said the agreement will be sent immediately to the U.N. Security Council, stressing the critical importance of international backing. The former U.N. envoy, Ghassan Salame, quit his job earlier this year, partly in exasperation at the failure of the international community to provide meaningful support for peace efforts in Libya. Mr. Salame has been vocal about his disillusionment with the open meddling by some foreign countries in Libya, such as Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, combined with the failures of Western countries like the United States, France and Britain to meaningfully counter that meddling. The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, welcomed the truce agreement as a “fundamental step” toward ending the conflict. “I congratulate the parties for putting the interest of their nation ahead of their differences,” he said. Mr. Guterres, who for the past seven months has been calling for cease-fires around the world to help contain the Covid-19 pandemic, expressed hope that combatants in other conflicts — in the Middle East, Afghanistan and more recently between Armenia and Azerbaijan — would use the “inspiration of the Libyan agreement” to follow the same path. The latest agreement comes four months after Mr. Hifter’s forces were forced into a humiliating retreat from their positions around the capital, Tripoli, which they had mounted a bitter, 15-month campaign to capture. Although the assault ended in failure, it drew powerful foreign actors ever deeper in the war for control of the oil-rich North African nation. Russia sent mercenaries and the United Arab Emirates shipped vast amounts of weaponry in support of Mr. Hifter. On the other side, Turkey intervened decisively on the side of the beleaguered Tripoli government, sending military advisers, drones and Syrian mercenaries. For months, the two sides have been engaged in a tense standoff around Surt, in central Libya, where the country’s longtime dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was born and died violently in 2011. Surt is the gateway to a region known as the oil crescent, where most of Libya’s oil production takes place. Mr. Hifter halted most oil production in January in an effort to starve the Tripoli government of funds. But production has risen sharply in recent weeks, to 300,000 barrels a day, amid wider expectations that the blockade would be lifted. Although Mr. Hifter remains the leader of a powerful military coalition, his political strength has steadily diminished since his forces were routed from Tripoli in June. On his home turf in eastern Libya, other powerful political players have emerged in recent months and grown close to some of Mr. Hifter’s foreign allies, notably Egypt. In his first interview after resigning from the envoy job, Mr. Salame accused the U.N. Security Council of hypocrisy, saying the majority of its members had initially supported Mr. Hifter’s assault on Tripoli and actively stymied his own peace efforts. Mr. Salame said he had been “stabbed in the back” by those same countries in the interview with The Mediator’s Studio, a podcast of the Oslo Forum, an organization that promotes conflict mediation. Ms. Williams described the accord reached on Friday as “a moment that will go down in history,” praising the courage, commitment and professionalism of the delegates in forging the deal. She said it also set an exceptional example for Libyan politicians who now face the challenge of converting the cease-fire into a broader political settlement in talks due to open in Tunis in early November. The two sides agreed on Wednesday to reopen road and air links throughout the country. Friday’s agreement is intended to set in motion steps to unify security forces and disarm, demobilize and reintegrate the numerous armed factions that have operated unchecked by any central authority for years. The two sides also agreed to measures that will reestablish national control over oil facilities and key institutions such as the central bank, Ms. Williams said. Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva and Declan Walsh from Nairobi, Kenya.']","The two main factions in years of civil war that have drawn in Russia, Turkey and other regional powers signed an accord at the United Nations in Geneva."
Demand for Pakistan Visas Sets Off Deadly Stampede in Afghanistan,2020-10-21,By Zabihullah Ghazi and Fahim Abed,"['JALALABAD, Afghanistan — A stampede in a crowded stadium in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday left at least 12 women dead, officials said. The women were among thousands of people hoping to get visas to enter Pakistan for medical treatment. Many people in Afghanistan, a war-ravaged country with minimal health care facilities, cross the border into Pakistan for treatment. But since the spring, Pakistan had drastically reduced the number of visas that it issued to Afghans, hoping to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. Pakistan recently announced that it would resume issuing visas at a more normal rate. But there was so much pent-up demand that thousands of people gathered before dawn at the soccer stadium, in the city of Jalalabad, waiting for tokens to be given out that would enable them to apply for visas. Just 1,000 visas were to be processed that day. About 10,000 people were in the stadium when the stampede occurred, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province, which includes Jalalabad. The stampede began as the tokens were being distributed to the crowd, Mr. Khogyani said. “There were several thousand women,” he said. “All of those killed were ill women who were trying to get a visa and go for their treatment to Pakistan.” Pakistan, despite its tense relations with the Afghan government over its tacit support for the Taliban, is a key destination for Afghans. About three million Afghan refugees live there, and until the pandemic struck, there was a constant flow of Afghans across the border, seeking work or medical care. The Pakistani Consulate in Jalalabad, which distributes visas for residents of seven eastern and southeastern provinces, recently reopened after being closed for nearly eight months because of Pakistan’s coronavirus travel restrictions. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan, had recently announced a new visa regime that would ease the process for issuing long-term, multiple-entry visas for Afghans. “The charges of corruption and mishandling of applicants in recent years had tarnished the image of Pakistan and caused hardship to visa applicants,” Mr. Sadiq said in announcing the new visa policy. The provincial authorities in Nangarhar announced the new procedure for distributing tokens to visa applicants, which was meant to discourage crowding in light of the heavy demand. Under the rules, the first 1,000 people would get tokens and the rest would have to try their luck the next day, Mr. Khogyani said. “The stampede broke out in the women’s section,” said an eyewitness, Abdullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name. “Then police arrived and the situation got worse. I escaped from the stadium. When I came back, several women were lying on the ground and they were dead.” In July, clashes along the Afghan-Pakistani border left 15 civilians dead in Kandahar Province, as the Pakistani Army fired heavy artillery into civilian areas. Protesters on both sides of the border had demanded the reopening of a border crossing that Pakistan had closed because of the pandemic. The stampede came on another bloody day of violence across Afghanistan, as the Taliban waged attacks despite continuing peace talks in Qatar between the militants and government negotiators. The bloodiest attack took place in the northern province of Takhar, where a police special forces unit was ambushed by the Taliban, officials said. More than 42 police officers were killed, according to Wafiullah Rahmani, head of the provincial council, who spoke from a hospital where bodies were arriving. Mr. Rahmani said the head of the special forces unit, a provincial deputy police chief, was among the dead. “The hospital is so busy, and many people are looking for their loved ones,” he said. “The casualties may increase, as many police officers are still missing.” Other security officials put the toll even higher. “I have counted 50 dead bodies and I have got tired of counting,” said Karimullah Bek, a pro-government militia commander in the area. In what appeared to be a retaliatory strike by Afghan forces gone wrong, the Afghan air force struck a mosque in a nearby area, killing at least 12 children, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Takhar said. “It was a mistake,” the spokesman, Ahmad Jawad Hijri, said. “All of the victims were under 16 years old, and they were studying in the mosque.” Zabihullah Ghazi reported from Jalalabad, and Fahim Abed from Kabul, Afghanistan. Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Kabul.']","At least 12 people died as thousands crowded a soccer stadium.

"For Italy’s Masked Rap Diva, an Era of Face Coverings Poses a Dilemma",2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz,"['MILAN — When the pandemic first hit Italy and masks became scarce, Myss Keta, the mysterious Queen of the Milan Night, came to the rescue. The Italian rapper, performance artist and L.G.B.T.Q. icon had amassed a vast collection of face coverings that she wore for years to hide her identity. So she began distributing them to her friends in need. “I had so many,” she said. “Surgical, cloth, vinyl, silk, whatever material.” This month, with a second wave of the coronavirus rising and Italy requiring the wearing of masks in public at all times, grandparents, politicians, middle-management businesspeople, doctors, lawyers, delivery people — just about everyone — is covering up. That has rendered Myss Keta — whose use of masks took her from underground clubs to the cusp of national, if incognito, celebrity — an improbable authority on life behind the surgical veil. It has also threatened to strip her of her defining shtick. “Before, it was a distinguishing characteristic. Now, it’s something we all have in common,” she said as she lifted a black surgical mask — the casual black T-shirt of her vast collection — to sip a Bloody Mary at Bar Basso in her Porta Venezia stomping grounds of Milan. Under her trademark blond bangs, her eyes remained covered as usual in dark Givenchy sunglasses. It used to be only the front-row fans at her concerts who emulated her by wearing masks. “Now, everyone seems like a Myss fan,” she said. The Myss behind the mask remains a mystery. Gentle inquiries into her true identity yield only blatantly fictitious biographical details that she called “Myssketiana mythology.” “I’m always Myss Keta. I’m always myself, 100 percent,” said Keta, who later froze in her full-length faux leather trench coat when a friend accidentally let a first name slip. “Myss Keta is the diva of Porta Venezia. I’ll say it until they name parks after me.” Myss Keta, a woman of uncertain age, is a John Waters dream of an Italian rap star. She first appeared in 2013, like a voluptuous Venus from a clubbing clamshell, with the release of the song “Milano, Sushi & Coca.” The debut, rapped in her hypersexualized, cartoonishly sultry and gleefully trashy style, simultaneously venerated and mocked Milan’s nightlife. She and her arts collective, Motel Forlanini, decided that she should appear anonymous in the video to better become “the voice of a certain period, of a certain Milan scene,” she said. The mask she wore at her first concert intrigued more people, and the crew decided that she should stick with the disguise. For nearly a decade, she has hidden her face with every mask imaginable\xa0— sequined, metallic, feathered. She has worn a digital clock over her eyes, a Yosemite Sam beard over her jowls. In recent years, she has sought to branch out from her dance club roots to something approaching mainstream success. She sold out concerts, brought her campy, languorous rap verses to Germany, became a featured guest on Italian national radio and television shows and appeared on the cover of a national magazine for an article about Milan nightlife. She signed with Universal and discussed her book and identity and women’s empowerment with the director of Turin’s book fair, Italy’s largest. Last year, she collaborated with some of the country’s most recognizable pop singers and rappers. She said she felt carried on the crest of popularity leading to a breakout year. Instead, she ran mask first into a lockdown. “It put the brakes on the Myss project,” she said. In September, she released her first pandemic-era song and video, in which she dances wildly alone in an open field with a mask on. (“The most diligent of all,” she said.) But with masks omnipresent, she and her collaborators have began to contemplate “a new trick, another way of keeping anonymity,” she said. She considered a motorcycle helmet, extreme makeup and “prosthetic modifications” as possibilities. The mask mandate, she said, “accelerated” the move forward. But while she researches a new look, she remains one of Italy’s leading authorities on incessant mask wearing. Pragmatically speaking, she said, surgical masks are best for talking. For performing, the singer of “Burqa di Gucci” prefers a “mèches burka.” She has learned that the mask can shift power balances to the wearer. She noticed that her fans who donned masks also felt freer and more themselves. Dressing up for a wild night out, though, is different from breathing behind a particulate-filtering face piece for the foreseeable future. At least, she said, the early negative connotation of the mask — linked to sickness, hospitalization and hypochondriac anxiety — has transitioned to respect for others and a possible font of expression, bursting with colors, fabrics and name-brand cachet. She said she herself had pulled Myss Keta brand masks at the outset of the epidemic to avoid exploiting the tragedy. But as someone who hardly removed her mask outside her apartment for seven years, she also commiserated with an Italian populace entering a stuffy new reality. “I know guys, it’s a pain. I get it — it’s not easy,” she said languidly. “You need to get used to it.” The pandemic has also taken its toll on other prominent masked Italians. Only days before Italy began locking down towns, the popular Neapolitan artist Liberato, who for three years has hidden his identity, released a video for his song “We Come From Napoli.” In the video, Liberato and his masked friends are intended to look menacing as they stalk the Port of Naples playing cards, tagging walls and eating pork. But in the pandemic, it looks like any given Tuesday. “Today, it’s strange to see those images,” said Francesco Lettieri, a close associate of Liberato’s who directed the video. “Because that’s all become very normal.” Others see more of an upside. Valerio Massimo Visintin, the restaurant critic for Italy’s largest newspaper, Il Corriere Della Sera, said he was sometimes jokingly referred to as “Myss Keta’s uncle,” because he has sought to preserve his anonymity for the last decade by dressing as “the man in black” during public appearances. As he sat on a couch in his Milan agent’s office dressed like a cross between Darkman and an Irish Republican Army militant, he recommended that novice mask wearers practice increasing the volume, pausing between sentences and gesticulating more. In addition to a Donnie Brasco leather jacket and a black Stetson, he wore black gloves cut at the fingers, because his wife said that women recognized men’s hands. He said that he had tried a Zorro mask but that it was too revealing, and said he couldn’t breathe through a Venetian carnival guise. He settled on a ski mask usually worn under a motorcycle helmet. He hasn’t taken a photo, not even a family one, in years and he said he uses taxis “like Superman did phone booths.” His years of practice, he said, have made it easier for him to wear his FFP2 medical mask, which he donned under his disguise. It offers him “double protection,” he said, both in terms of health and of staying anonymous. “Now, the most they would recognize is a mask.” Myss Keta also said that the widespread mask wearing provided her with anonymity on the Milan streets where she used to be constantly accosted and which this week became subject to a no-nightlife curfew. This was especially the case in the summer, when so many others joined her in wearing sunglasses atop their masks. “It was everybody’s look,” she said. After signing an autograph, she got up and walked past a sexagenarian using his blue mask as a pocket kerchief as he drank a spring break-sized Negroni Sbagliato cocktail. She gave a tour of the neighborhood, offering observations peppered with her Milanese slang (good things were “top” or “total”; the best things were “morta,” or dead) and got noticed among the masked masses. Teenagers looked at one another with shell shock. A table of Germans shouted out, “We love you, Myss Keta!” For now, the mask has its appeal and she intends to keep wearing it.

South Korea Tries to Quell Anxiety Over Flu Shots After 13 Unexplained Deaths,2020-10-21,By Choe Sang-Hun and Sui-Lee Wee,"['\u200bSEOUL\u200b, South Korea — The South Korean authorities are investigating the mysterious deaths of 13 people after they had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. And though officials said there was no link between the deaths and the vaccinations, there was worry that the cases could cause panic at a critical time for vaccination efforts. The deaths happened over the past week, including five reported on Wednesday and four others overnight Thursday. Officials said that two of the deaths might have resulted from anaphylactic shock, a serious allergic reaction, but gave no further details. The deaths are under investigation, but officials were quick to rule out the vaccines themselves — which they said were all from local drugmakers and not from lots for export — as the main cause. Given the scope of South Korea’s flu vaccination program, and the small number of other problems reported so far, some experts said that coincidence is more likely to be involved. Instead, officials vowed to step up a government flu-vaccination campaign to prevent the country’s health care system from being overloaded with flu patients amid the coronavirus pandemic — both viruses have similar symptoms of early infection, like fever and cough. “We have not found a direct connection between these deaths and vaccines, or a relationship between the deaths and adverse effects reported after flu shots,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. “We don’t think that the situation calls for the suspending of the inoculation program.” Ms. Jung convened a special news conference on Wednesday after the rapid series of deaths, starting with a teenager who died on Friday, grabbed headlines in South Korea. But with autopsies likely to take days, public anxiety is running high in a country where anti-vaccine sentiment has flared before. South Korea, and many other countries, have seen annual flu inoculation programs as critical to efforts to also deal with the coronavirus, especially for children, the elderly, pregnant women and medical personnel. Officials unveiled plans to procure 20 percent more flu vaccines for this winter than last year to inoculate up to 30 million people, more than half the country’s population. But the campaign made headlines last month when it was discovered that some vaccines supplied by a local company, which needed to be refrigerated at all times, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported. \u200b A recall was ordered and officials said about 2,300 people had received doses from the faulty batch, which was meant mainly for young children and teenagers. Still, officials said that alone should not have rendered the vaccines dangerous. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the concern about lack of temperature control is that it can render the vaccines ineffective, rather than toxic. Then, earlier this month, 615,000 doses of a flu vaccine\u200b shipped by another company were also recalled after some of them were found to contain white particles, which the government described as being a harmless protein. Almost 18,000 people had received doses before they were recalled. No serious harm had been reported from either of those lots, though dozens of people who received those doses reported fevers or other minor complaints — which are common reactions to flu shots, officials said. None of nine people who died had received vaccines from those that had been recalled, they added. After suspending the vaccination program for teenagers for three weeks, it resumed on Oct. 13. Three days later, a 17-year-old boy in Incheon, just west of Seoul, died after receiving his shot. On Tuesday, a 77-year-old woman was found dead at her home in Gochang, south of Seoul, after being vaccinated a day earlier. On the same day, an 82-year-old man who had also been inoculated died in the central city of Daejeon. Four of the five people who died on Wednesday ranged in age from 53 to 89. Information about the two other people who died, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday, has not been released. Nine of those who died, all of whom had received flu shots in the past, received vaccines supplied by several different local drugmakers, officials said. “Since most people who got flu shots with the same vaccines reported no major problems, we concluded that those vaccines do not contain toxic materials,” said Kim Joong-gon, \u200ba professor of medicine at Seoul National University who led a team of investigators. “We\u200b concluded that we can exclude \u200bthe vaccine \u200bas a problem.”\u200b In general, flu vaccines have a good safety record. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the body of scientific evidence over decades “overwhelmingly” supports their safety. Specifically in South Korea, officials said that since 2009, 25 people in South Korea had died after receiving flu vaccinations, but that only one of the deaths was tied to the process. Nearly 13 million South Koreans have received flu shots so far this year, 8.3 million of them for free as part of the government program. There have been complaints about minor reactions to shots, but those are normal every flu season. And Ms. Jung said Wednesday that some of the complaints were likely to have been influenced by media coverage of the recalls. The anxiety over flu shots could also undermine public trust in an eventual coronavirus vaccine, which is already faltering as countries race to get their candidates approved. In a survey this month of 2,500 people in Gyeonggi-do, a populous province surrounding the South Korean capital of Seoul, 62 percent of respondents said they would not get vaccinated against the coronavirus until after the vaccine was proved to be completely safe. Many scientists have expressed concern about the speed with which coronavirus vaccines are being developed. But getting a vaccine approved is only one hurdle. Managing public perception is another, especially if there are concerns about the vaccine being mishandled during transportation and storage. Most vaccines have to be kept at low temperatures from the time they are manufactured to the time they are administered to prevent them from spoiling — what the industry calls a “cold chain.” The flu vaccine, for example, needs to stay refrigerated, at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. That could complicate the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. A number of the leading candidates under development would need to be kept at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius (minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit). In the United States, transportation and warehouse companies are scrambling to build “freezer farms.” Airlines are fitting their planes with freezers, and glass vial makers are inventing methods to make vials that do not crack from very cold temperatures. Courier services like UPS and FedEx are making dry ice. But cold facilities are lacking in other parts of the world, including Central America, rural India and Southeast Asia, which experts say could hinder mass immunization. Typically, multiple reports of adverse reactions from vaccines are investigated by a country’s drug regulator in an attempt to determine the frequency of such events and whether there are causal links. While these investigations are underway, countries can choose to continue the vaccination program if the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks. Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Sui-Lee Wee from Singapore.']","Health officials say there is no link between the deaths and the flu vaccines.

Puerto Rico’s 911 call centers close after employees test positive.,2020-10-22,By Frances Robles,"['Puerto Rico’s two 911 emergency call centers were shut down Wednesday night after two employees tested positive for Covid-19, the public safety secretary announced. Workers were moved to the emergency management bureau headquarters, and Puerto Ricans were given two different telephone numbers to call the police or an ambulance. On Thursday morning, the agency announced that it had enabled call forwarding, so residents could once again dial 911 for an emergency. Employees who were in contact with the sick co-workers were isolated and were to be tested in the coming days, the public safety secretary, Pedro Janer, said in a statement. The alternative numbers were quickly overloaded by people testing to see if they worked. In a sign of just how chaotic the situation had become, island officials reached out to an American journalist with a large social media following in Puerto Rico for help. Mr. Janer said both call centers would be decontaminated. “The date on which they will resume operations will be reported shortly,” he said. Puerto Rico has reported nearly 60,000 total cases of the coronavirus and 783 deaths, according to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has categorized the island as “warning level three,” because the risk there is considered high. Nonessential travel should be avoided, the C.D.C. said.']",
"No, mouthwash will not save you from the coronavirus, despite that study going around.",2020-10-21,By Katherine J. Wu,"['A rash of provocative headlines this week flooded social media platforms with a tantalizing idea: that mouthwash can “inactivate” coronaviruses and help curb their spread. The idea came from a new study that found that a coronavirus that causes common colds — not the one that causes Covid-19 — could be killed in a laboratory by dousing virus-infected cells with mouthwash. The study’s authors concluded that the products they tested “may provide an additional level of protection against” the new coronavirus. But outside experts warned against overinterpreting the study’s results, which might not have practical relevance to the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 220,000 Americans. Not only did the study not investigate this deadly new virus, but it also did not test whether mouthwash affects how viruses spread from person to person. “I don’t have a problem with using Listerine,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. “But it’s not an antiviral.” The study, which was published last month in the Journal of Medical Virology, looked only at a coronavirus called 229E, which causes common colds — not the new coronavirus. The researchers flooded 229E coronaviruses grown in human liver cells in the lab with several types of mouthwash and nasal rinses for 30 seconds, one minute or two minutes — longer than the typical swig or spritz into a nose or mouth. Around 90 to 99 percent of the viruses could no longer infect cells after this exposure, the study found. But because the study didn’t recruit any human volunteers to gargle the products in question, the findings have limited value for the real world, other experts said. The human mouth, full of nooks and crannies and a slurry of chemicals secreted by a diverse cadre of cells, is far more complicated than the inside of a laboratory dish. Researchers warn people not to misuse mouthwash or nasal rinses or ingest large quantities of the liquids, because they can be dangerous.']",
A #MeToo Awakening Stirs in Iran,2020-10-22,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Three years into the global #MeToo movement, women who say they have been sexually assaulted are improbably going public in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The movement’s reach inside Iran gained momentum in late August after allegations aired on Iranian social media against more than 100 men, including a giant e-commerce company’s former star manager, a prominent sociology professor and the owner of a popular bookstore. But the highest-profile person to face such allegations so far is a nearly 80-year-old, internationally acclaimed artist with ties to the ruling elite. Thirteen women, in interviews with The New York Times, accused the artist, Aydin Aghdashloo, of sexual misconduct over a 30-year span. Most are former students, and some are journalists who have reported on art and culture. The willingness by women who say they were victims to share their stories more openly is a groundbreaking shift in Iran’s conservative society, where discussing sex is culturally prohibited, sex outside marriage is illegal, and the burden of proof for victims of sexual crimes is onerous. A raped woman often gets the blame. Mr. Aghdashloo declined requests for an interview but strenuously denied wrongdoing, and according to his lawyer has already taken legal action against one accuser. In a written statement provided to The Times, Mr. Aghdashloo described himself as an independent artist whose career was built on creative achievement. “The allegations of sexual abuse against me are full of significant inaccuracies, mischaracterizations and fabrications,” he wrote. “To be clear, I have always sought to treat people with respect and dignity and I have never abused, assaulted nor taken advantage of anyone.” Still, he wrote, “I am not a perfect man,” and that if his behavior had offended or distressed anyone, “I deeply apologize.” How the authorities treat the perpetrators and victims of sexual misconduct has become a test of the #MeToo movement’s durability in Iran, a country of more than 80 million. Compared with the impact in the United States after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, the imprisoned Hollywood mogul, the fallout in Iran is only beginning to unfold. But there are signs that the male-controlled power structure in Iran has started to respond to accusations like those made against Mr. Aghdashloo. Tehran’s police chief announced on Oct. 12 that the bookstore owner, Keyvan Emamverdi, had confessed to raping 300 women, after 30 took the brave step of filing legal complaints. The police said he would be charged with “corruption on earth,” a capital offense. The e-commerce company Digikala opened an investigation into its former manager and apologized to female employees. Iran’s sociology union expelled the accused professor and called for a zero-tolerance policy at universities. A painting by Mr. Aghdashloo was pulled from the cover of a famous literary collection, and at least three women have said they are considering legal action against him. “This is a turning point for sexual abuse, the biggest taboo for women in Iran has been sex and sexual violence and abuse,” said Elnaaz Mohammadi, a 33-year-old member of Dideban Azar, or Abuse Watch, an education and advocacy group in Tehran. Ms. Mohammadi said she had received complaints about Mr. Aghdashloo from “students who have left his classes distraught and crying,” and that “all his denials have no value.” Paintings by Mr. Aghdashloo, a dual citizen of Canada,  have been auctioned and displayed worldwide, and France honored him in 2016. Before the 1979 Islamic revolution he worked with the family of the shah to curate museums. He then moved into the circles of the revolution’s ruling clerics, and he and his family have business links to the hierarchy. Despite a few mentions in Iran’s conservative media as a royalist and Western spy, Mr. Aghdashloo has generally received glowing coverage in state media, with no hint of any possible sexual abuse. The Times found and interviewed former students of Mr. Aghdashloo’s after an Iranian journalist now living in the United States, Sara Omatali, posted on Twitter Aug. 22 that he had sexually assaulted her in 2006 when she visited to interview him. She wrote that he had greeted her while naked with a robe draped on his shoulder, forced a kiss and pressed his body on hers. Her account appeared to be the catalyst for others. In telephone interviews, 45 people — including former students, a longtime teaching assistant, art gallery owners, actresses, a Tehran art agent and journalists covering art and culture in Iran — all said Mr. Aghdashloo’s behavior toward young female students had been known in Iran’s art circles. Thirteen said they had been victims, including one who was 13 years old at the time. Many said they did not know each other. In each of these 13 instances, a family member, friend, or colleague recalled in separate interviews having been told about it. Nineteen described him as the “Harvey Weinstein of Iran,” elevating or destroying careers of women depending on their receptiveness to his advances. One former student said he had offered her one of his paintings — worth $100,000, the price of a small apartment in Tehran — if she slept with him. Another said he had retaliated when she refused him, telling galleries to shun her artwork. Her career faltered. “Aghdashloo’s reputation was an open secret in the art world but nobody did anything about it,” said Solmaz Azhdari, 32, who studied painting under him. She said she had witnessed him placing his hands between a young female student’s legs in 2007 during a sketching class, as Ms. Azhdari stooped to retrieve a dropped pencil. In telling their stories, some asked to be identified only by their first names — a reflection of the subject’s sensitivity in a conservative society and their fear of Mr. Aghdashloo. Maryam, an art photographer, 49, said she had visited Mr. Aghdashloo in 2010, to collect two paintings from his basement studio for the gallery where she worked. She said Mr. Aghdashloo had insisted she view his paintings of nude women, then forcibly kissed her and tore at her clothes. When she screamed, Maryam said, he covered her mouth with his hands; she pushed him away and fled, shouting, “You have no shame!” Maryam said she quit her job, and on her mother’s advice never publicized the encounter or contacted the police. “I was terrified of what he could do to me and my career if I told anyone or brought charges,” she said. In his art classes, the former students said, he asked the women to sit on his lap when he reviewed their work, pressed against them while teaching, touched their bodies, made lewd comments and shared explicit details of a fascination with adolescent girls. Mehrnaz, 54, said he made her sit on his lap and caressed her thighs. Atty, 30, said he had locked her in his office and forcibly kissed her. Another said he asked the color of her underwear as he touched her. Afarin, a Tehran teacher, said she had been molested repeatedly 30 years ago, at age 13, by Mr. Aghdashloo, who would press his groin against her and touch her thighs while teaching painting technique. She had been too terrified to tell her parents, she said, and still avoids the street where Mr. Aghdashloo held class. “I feel relieved that a man who has abused so many women and girls is finally being exposed,” she said. Laleh Sabouri, a 50-year-old actress and television star, took art lessons with Mr. Aghdashloo for two years. Days after Ms. Omatali’s Twitter posting, Ms. Sabouri tweeted that most women were terrified of being alone with him and that accusations of rape would be “befitting.” Mr. Aghdashloo’s lawyer said he had taken legal action over that tweet, calling it “baseless.” One of Mr. Aghdashloo’s teaching assistants, who helped manage his workshops for 12 years, said she had witnessed frequent misbehavior by him toward female students and that some had complained to her. She had confronted him and  he replied that women should consider his affection a privilege, the assistant recalled. She ultimately resigned, she said, because he had assaulted her. Ms. Omatali’s account struck a nerve among Iranian female journalists. Several said the advice in newsrooms was that no woman should interview Mr. Aghdashloo alone. Solmaz Naraghi, 42, an art and culture reporter, said Mr. Aghdashloo sexually harassed her repeatedly in public after she had rebuffed his advances during one such interview. Her former husband recalled her in tears at a gallery after an encounter with Mr. Aghdashloo. His supporters have rallied to defend him, including former students who posted a letter on Instagram. His first wife, the Hollywood actress Shoreh Aghdashloo, said he was “simply not capable of such heinous acts.” One former student, Mitra Zad, said she had seen “nothing but good things” from him. Mr. Aghdashloo’s influence in Iran’s art world seemed to only grow after the revolution. He often boasted about connections to government and religious officials and said he was invulnerable because of them, former students and the teaching assistant said — a description he rejected in his statement to The Times. “I have always worked as an independent artist and, following the revolution, have earned my living not through credits and connections to the state but through my art,” Mr. Aghdashloo wrote. His students have included the daughter of Tehran’s Friday Prayer imam and grandchildren of a founding cleric of the revolution. He has worked as a consultant, instructor, author and art appraiser for Astan Quds Razavi, a religious and economic conglomerate controlled by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is under U.S. sanctions. The former head of Astan is Iran’s judiciary chief. Mr. Aghdashloo’s daughter married into a family that owns Part Sazan, a conglomerate with ties to state-owned enterprises in the oil, gas and automotive industries. The link to the company, which lists a senior member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Basij militia as chief executive and board member, has further strengthened his aura of impunity, a number of women said. Anonymous allegations against Mr. Aghdashloo first surfaced in 2018 when an Iranian investigative journalist, Afshin Parvaresh, posted on Instagram that he had interviewed 21 women, including a minor, who said Mr. Aghdashloo had assaulted them. Mr. Parvaresh said he received violent threats. Mr. Aghdashloo’s lawyer denied his client was responsible. Some Iranian women’s rights activists say significant challenges hinder #MeToo cases. If an accuser fails to meet the high standard of proof for rape, she can then be accused of adultery. “A woman who is a victim can quickly turn into a criminal if she can’t prove rape,” said Shadi Sadr, a prominent Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate based in London. “When she testifies that there was sex, she is testifying against herself as well.” Still, more women are asking how to bring charges, said Leila Rahimi, a Tehran lawyer offering them free consultation and representation. “You cannot hide this crime happening over and over in our society,” Ms. Rahimi said. “Both for women and men, silence does not improve things.”']",
Thailand’s Leader Offers End to Crackdown on Pro-Democracy Protesters,2020-10-21,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — In a conciliatory speech Wednesday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand acknowledged that the country cannot become “a better society through the use of water cannon” and said he intended to withdraw an emergency decree cracking down on pro-democracy protests. As thousands of demonstrators marched on Government House, home of the prime minister’s office, he urged all sides to resolve their differences through the parliamentary process and said he would to seek to call Parliament into session next week. “I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,” he said in a televised evening address. “I am currently preparing to lift the state of severe emergency in Bangkok and will do so promptly if there are no violent incidents.” Protesters appeared to be unmoved by the prime minister’s words and, hours later outside Government House, a delegation hand-delivered a resignation letter to a police commander for Mr. Prayuth to sign. On Thursday morning, after an evening of relatively peaceful protests, Mr. Prayuth did, indeed, withdraw the emergency decree he issued last week. It had banned gatherings of more than four people — an order ignored by the protesters — and news or online content that “could create fear or intentionally distort information.” Over the past 90 years, Thailand’s elected government has repeatedly been supplanted by military regimes — and in the case of the current administration, a ruling junta extended its power through a curtailed democratic process. In recent months, a movement for democracy has been building, inspired in part by outspoken student leaders willing to risk prison by criticizing the government and the monarchy. While withdrawing the emergency decree was a first step in easing tensions, it is unlikely that the proposal for parliamentary intervention will satisfy protesters who demand the resignation of Mr. Prayuth, a retired general who has led Thailand’s government since he took power in a 2014 coup. The protesters are also calling for an overhaul of the 2017 Constitution that Mr. Prayuth pushed through, diluting the power of the electorate by creating an appointed Senate. And, boldest of all, the protesters are seeking to bring the monarchy under the Constitution. Thailand is headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, one of the world’s richest men, who spends most of his time in Europe. Criticism of the monarchy is extremely rare in Thailand, and comments deemed to be insulting to the king or his family are punishable by as much as 15 years in prison under the country’s harsh lèse-majesté law. Over the past week, many thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Bangkok and other cities, issuing three demands summed up by the slogan: “Resign, Rewrite, Reform.” On Friday, when thousands of protesters gathered in the commercial Pathumwan district of Bangkok, the police dispersed the crowd with powerful water cannons that drenched demonstrators with a liquid containing a chemical irritant and blue dye. That move, which the prime minister now seems to acknowledge was excessive, served only to bring out even bigger crowds over the weekend. Protest leaders shifted tactics, starting to call demonstrations on short notice in multiple locations, giving the police less chance to mobilize in force. After taking a day off on Tuesday, thousands of protesters gathered Wednesday at Victory Monument, the site of earlier protests, and marched about two miles toward Government House, which is heavily barricaded and guarded by the police. The protesters broke through a barricade several blocks from Government House as the police retreated, allowing the crowd to swarm the gap and move in close to the seat of government. Helmeted police officers holding shields lined up shoulder-to-shoulder behind razor-wire barricades to keep back demonstrators, many of whom wore helmets themselves. Some also carried umbrellas, which have proven effective against tear gas canisters, although they did not need them Wednesday. Demonstrators, many of them sitting in the street, chanted, “Reform the monarchy,” and “Who owns the country? The people.” The police kept water cannons nearby, despite the prime minister’s expression of regret over their earlier use. In his speech, Mr. Prayuth, 66, sought to cast himself as a leader who must try to unite the country and resolve disagreements among its people. “We must now step back from the edge of the slippery slope that can easily slide to chaos, where all sides lose control of the situation,” Mr. Prayuth said, “where emotions take over our better judgment, violence begets more violence, and, as history has shown us all too many times, we can end in a situation where the entire country suffers.” Mr. Prayuth repeatedly called on the protesters to rely on Parliament to resolve the crisis. But in doing so, he highlighted an institution that has lost credibility with much of the public. In February, the Constitutional Court dissolved a popular new political party, the Future Forward Party, and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years. The party had placed third in parliamentary elections last year, winning 81 seats. Some former Future Forward leaders have been helping the young leaders of the protest movement, in some cases bailing them out of jail after they have been arrested. “The protesters have made their voices and views heard,” Mr. Prayuth said. “It is now time for them to let their views be reconciled with the views of other segments of Thai society through their representatives in Parliament.” In announcing that he would withdraw the emergency decree if there was no further violence, Mr. Prayuth had requested that the demonstrators also make concessions. “I ask the protesters to reciprocate with sincerity, to turn down the volume on hateful and divisive talk, and to let us, together, disperse this terrible dark cloud before it moves over our country,"" he said. “Let us respect the law and parliamentary democracy, and let our views be presented through our representatives in Parliament.” Outside Government House, the protesters seemed unmoved. A young man called out to the crowd over a megaphone, “Are we backing down?” “No!” the crowd shouted. “Keep fighting?” he called out. And the crowd answered, “Fight!” Adam Dean contributed reporting.']","Prayuth Chan-ocha, who withdrew an emergency decree on Thursday, has called for mediation by a weakened Parliament.

Lebanon’s Former Prime Minister Tapped to Lead Again Despite Cries for Change,2020-10-22,By Hwaida Saad and Megan Specia,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Despite a public outcry for change, Lebanon’s president has tapped Saad Hariri, the embattled former prime minister who stepped down late last year amid antigovernment protests, to again try to form a government. Mr. Hariri, who left office amid multiple crises as the country teetered on economic collapse, received the mandate after garnering enough support from Parliament on Thursday. President Michel Aoun asked Mr. Hariri to try to cobble together a governing coalition, the office of the presidency said. There is no guarantee he will succeed. Lebanon remains mired in crisis, its economy in shambles, as the country also struggles with the fallout from an Aug. 4 explosion in the port of Beirut that killed nearly 200 people, caused billions of dollars in damage and devastated entire neighborhoods of the city. Mr. Hariri vowed to form a cabinet of experts and technocrats “away from political parties” that will be committed to financial and economic overhauls to make the country viable again and to rebuild after the damage of the blast. “This is the only and last opportunity for our beloved country,” he said at the presidential palace on Thursday. Mr. Hariri’s return would represent the staying power of Lebanon’s longstanding sectarian power brokers despite the public’s desire for a change of political leadership even before the Beirut blast, which amplified those demands. In addition to the death toll, the explosion injured hundreds and left thousands homeless as it tore through much of the city. It was triggered by a fire that ignited 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used to make fertilizer and bombs, which had been stored unsafely in the Beirut port since 2014 while some politicians wrangled in secret over what to do about it. Many officials had long warned behind the scenes that it was dangerous, though that debate never came into the public light. And much of the country considered the devastating explosion the latest crisis resulting from poor governance. In the wake of that outcry, the former government stepped down. The blast — the latest crisis in a dysfunctional system that was already unraveling by the time Mr. Hariri resigned in October — drew tens of thousands to the streets calling for an end to rampant corruption. It is now up to Mr. Hariri to put together a cabinet and persuade enough government factions to join his coalition and secure a majority in Parliament. Lina Khatib, the head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, the British international policy institute, said that Mr. Hariri’s being tapped again for the role was no surprise after his successor, Hassan Diab, stepped down and the prime minister-designate, Mustapha Adib, was then unable to form a government. “Nether Hariri nor his opponents, frankly, expected a different outcome,” she said. “It was always a matter of when rather than if.” “The irony in Hariri’s nomination now is that it takes Lebanon back to square one,” Ms. Khatib said. “Just over a year after the start of protests in Lebanon, the country finds itself with the same prime minister who was ousted by the protesters, making the kinds of promises that he had made in the immediate aftermath of the protests and failed to implement back then.” Despite this, Ms. Khatib said the situation had fundamentally changed since a year ago. The economic crisis has become more acute, exacerbated by the pandemic and the port blast, and that could put more pressure on the governing elite to accept a degree of compromise they previously had not. “This of course is not going to satisfy those protesters who were hoping for a complete overhaul for the political system in Lebanon and for wide-ranging fundamental reforms,” she said. The country has struggled to win financial assistance from the international community over the past two years, with potential donors conditioning significant aid on economic and structural reforms. Talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout came to a halt in July with virtually no progress. President Emmanuel Macron of France has visited Lebanon twice since the Beirut explosion to push the government on structural changes to make the country viable again. The United States has previously imposed sanctions on Lebanese businesses and officials for links to the Shiite group Hezbollah, the most powerful political faction and militia in Lebanon, and for alleged corruption. Hezbollah is backed by Iran, and the United States has designated the group a terrorist organization. Hezbollah did not back the designation of Mr. Hariri as prime minister in consultations with the president on Thursday. While Mr. Hariri’s opportunity to form a government comes with little promise to rescue the country from collapse, some Beirut residents say it is better to have a dysfunctional government than none at all. Hussein Ayoub, a butcher watching the news on a television in his shop in western Beirut on Thursday, seemed resigned to whatever the political outcome might be. “Hariri won’t be the best option,” he said. “But I would say better to be half-blind than fully blind. The country is falling below hell.” Abed al-Kadiri, an artist who lost most of his paintings in the blast and participated in last year’s protests, said he was planning to leave the country for good. “We are still going around the same names, the same previous leaders, the same parties that we revolted against, and they are coming back,” he said. “I’m not going to protest again, and I won’t change my plans to leave Lebanon.” Hwaida Saad reported from Beirut, Lebanon, and Megan Specia from London. Kareem Chehayeb contributed reporting from Beirut.']","Saad Hariri, who stepped down amid antigovernment protests last year, could return as the head of the government amid multiple crises."
"In Azerbaijan, Pain and Loss Drive War Fever",2020-10-21,By Carlotta Gall and Ivor Prickett,"['BAKU, Azerbaijan — As dusk fell, the sound of wailing carried on the soft evening breeze. Women filled the courtyard of a small house, keening over a coffin draped in the national flag. Men clustered in hushed groups in the narrow alley outside. The working-class neighborhood of Ahmedli, in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, was mourning its first martyred son since war broke out anew between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the southern Caucasus three weeks ago. Eldar Aliyev, 26, a manager in one of Azerbaijan’s biggest finance companies and a volunteer soldier, had spent barely two weeks at the front before returning home in a coffin. Azerbaijan has not released numbers of military casualties, but funerals are underway, bringing the war home to its people. As well as Mr. Aliyev, a colonel of the army was also buried in Baku on Sunday. “If the nation calls, he has to go,” said Mr. Aliyev’s father, Suleyman Eldar Aliyev, standing against a wall and leaning on a crutch. His face deeply lined, he had few words. “Long live the nation,” he said. Azerbaijan is in full war mode as it engages in the heaviest fighting since the original conflict with Armenia in the early 1990s over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian district inside Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan suffered a bitter defeat then, losing about 13 percent of its territory, with as many as 26,000 dead and around 800,000 displaced. That’s where matters stood for 26 years of a frozen truce, interrupted periodically by spasms of violence that were quickly tamped down by outside powers. But Azerbaijan, an oil-and-gas-rich former Soviet republic, has been quietly rearming for years. When clashes broke out three weeks ago, the country plunged into an all-out war to reclaim the lands it lost. Around the capital of Baku, signs of war fever are not hard to spot. The country’s bright three-colored flag hangs from every public building, while giant screens along the main streets downtown play horrifying video footage of precision drone strikes on Armenian soldiers. Every few days, President Ilham Aliyev, who has ruled the country since inheriting the office from his father in 2003, speaks to the nation and announces the names of villages and towns that have been newly “liberated.” Anar Mamedov, 36, a cousin of the volunteer soldier who was buried in Baku on Sunday, said, “The Azerbaijani Army has shown its power.” “This will continue until we liberate the last piece of our land, and at the end I would like to note that everyone will finally understand Azerbaijan,” added Mr. Mamedov, himself a war veteran who lost an arm. “We were all waiting for this,” he said. “We were waiting for Ilham Aliyev to give the order.” Azerbaijan is a tightly controlled society where dissent is quickly quashed. Criticism of the war, where it exists, is muted. Yet the general mood is overwhelmingly supportive. In numerous interviews, Azerbaijanis expressed their frustration that peace efforts led by France, Russia and the United States have never brought a resolution, despite repeated United Nations resolutions in Azerbaijan’s favor. “This is not Aliyev’s war,” said Zaur Shiriyev, the South Caucasus analyst for the International Crisis Group, in reference to the president. “It is all of the people’s war.” Mr. Shiriyev said that many Armenians, and Western officials working in the region, had never fully understood how important the losses of both life and territory were to Azerbaijanis. An award-winning investigative journalist, Khadija Ismayilova, who was jailed by the Aliyev government for her work in 2015, said that she and other activists were keeping a moratorium on dissent while the war raged. “You keep it down because soldiers are dying there,” she said. But she said she could feel popular anger building in recent months as the Armenian side adopted an increasingly aggressive stance. “I am usually cool about politics,” she said, “but I was angry.” In a dilapidated, half-built school building in a northern suburb of Baku, more than 1,000 refugees still live in cramped, unsanitary conditions where they first found refuge from the war decades ago. Their rooms are divided by flimsy plywood walls and residents cook and hang washing along a narrow underground corridor. “Everyone lost hope with the peace discussions,” said Ulriya Suleymanova, 34, who lives with an extended family of eight in a damp set of rooms that smelled of the sewers below. “Our president offered peace for years, but nothing changed.” But now she has reason to celebrate. Both her family and that of her husband are refugees from Jabrail, a district near the Iranian border. She pulled out her cellphone and played a video of Azerbaijani soldiers celebrating a day earlier as they raised the national flag at a bridge near her village. “From 1993, we were called refugees, but now our lands have been liberated, we are no longer refugees,” she said. “We have proof. We saw the bridge and the flags in Jabrail. Of course we are very happy when we see these things. I was 7 when we left.” For Ms. Suleymanova, there is no doubt they will return home. In Baku, she works cleaning houses and her husband sells security cameras. But work has dried up with the coronavirus, and they are struggling, she said. “My grandfather had lands, we had fruit and vegetable farms,” she noted wistfully. “It was not like now, this poor life.” Many of the Azerbaijani refugees come from agricultural villages and towns in seven districts, including Jabrail, that surround Nagorno-Karabakh, which was populated mainly by ethnic Armenians and was always the focus of the dispute between the two countries. The districts now lie largely abandoned except for military defenses. The withdrawal of occupying Armenian troops and the return of the Azerbaijani refugees have long been considered first steps in any negotiated settlement. The Azerbaijani Army has sought to push back the Armenian troops by force, focusing on three of the southernmost districts, Fizuli, Jabrail and Zengilan, that border Iran. On Tuesday, the president, Mr. Aliyev, announced that troops had secured Zengilan, the third district, though an Armenian government spokesman said that heavy fighting was continuing. The declared capture of some of their home districts has fired the refugees with excitement but also brought painful emotions flooding back. “We were crying and smiling at the same time,” said Ulker Allahverdiyev, 78, a refugee at the derelict school building who lost her husband and a son in the war. A widow with five children, she worked as a cleaner in a school, but lost two more daughters in the years as a refugee. “I was working day and night,” she said. “I was scared of my own shadow.” A teenager lay asleep under covers on the sofa beside her. “Her uncle and her neighbor went to the war and we cannot reach them and we are worried about them, so we are taking care of her,” she said. Her memories from the earlier conflict were crowding in. “It makes it harder,” she said. “Our children become martyrs and I am very worried. All of them are my children.” But she said she supported the war. “Of course, I want to see peace. I don’t want people to die, but of course it is worth it.” Along an underground passage, another refugee, eager to talk, opened the door to a cramped single room where his wife and two sons have lived for two decades. Ceyhun Seymur Khudiyev is from the city of Agdam, a ghost town today, that remains under Armenian control. But he was fired with confidence. “I believe that we are going to get our lands back,” he said. “Justice is taking its place.” Even refugees who have been able to build businesses and buy property have started plans to return to their homes, said Eldar Hamzali, 26, whose family comes from Fizuli. He pulled up a page from Google maps to show his family house and land. Although the government has said it has secured much of Fizuli, the village where Mr. Hamzali’s family comes from is apparently not yet under Azerbaijani control. Nonetheless, he said his uncles had already decided where each would rebuild their homes. Mr. Hamzali has even been asked to calculate the costs of transporting the remains of relatives who died in exile for reburial in the village, he added. “The feeling that you are temporarily here never left us,” he said of his life growing up in Baku. “I think I could find some peace of mind. Here I’m a guest, but there it’s my village. I think I would feel much more secure.”']","As the country’s soldiers advance in the conflict with Armenia, every “liberated” territory is celebrated and tens of thousands of refugees plan their return to lost lands."
India Returns a Chinese Soldier Who Got Lost Looking for Yaks,2020-10-21,By Steven Lee Myers,"['India on Wednesday released a Chinese soldier its forces had detained along the disputed mountainous border with China, signaling an easing of months of tensions that at times this summer had threatened to descend into a broader conflict. The soldier inadvertently crossed the border while helping local herdsmen search for missing yaks, according to the news agency of the People’s Liberation Army, which reported his return on Wednesday morning. The Indian military identified him as Cpl. Wang Yalong. The statement offered no new details about the circumstances of his disappearance, including why he would have wandered off unaccompanied by other troops. He was the first Chinese soldier detained by the Indian military since tensions escalated this year. Corporal Wang stumbled into an Indian border post at the base of a hill around 2 a.m. on Monday, an Indian official said. He was wearing civilian clothes and unarmed, and Indian officials believe that he was either genuinely lost or sent on a mission to scout out Indian defenses. Indian forces have surged to the frontier, high in the Himalayas, following a series of incursions by China that began in April into mountainous terrain that India claims as its own, escalating a border dispute that has simmered for decades. Violence erupted in June, when Chinese and Indian soldiers fought with clubs and other makeshift weapons. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, as well as an undisclosed number of Chinese. Soldiers have repeatedly confronted each other since then, and at least one other soldier died after stepping on a land mine. Both sides have sent reinforcements to the border, settling in for the winter dangerously close to each other, in many places only a few hundred yards apart. In September, a few shots were fired for the first time in decades, breaking a longstanding agreement not to use firearms during border confrontations. The clash has whipped up nationalist fervor on both sides of the border and derailed relations that had in recent years shown signs of warming, leaving little room for the countries’ leaders, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, to make concessions. In September, though, the foreign ministers of the two countries announced a five-point agreement to defuse the immediate standoff, if not the underlying territorial disputes. Since then, Indian and Chinese military officials have held a series of discussions that appear to have made some progress in avoiding new violence. An eighth round of talks is scheduled this week. The Indian Army, in disclosing the soldier’s detention on Monday, said that it had given him food, warm clothes, oxygen and medical care to “protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions.” Conditions along the frontier — where the elevation exceeds 14,000 feet — have become even more forbidding with the onset of winter. The Global Times, a newspaper controlled by the Communist Party of China that often assumes a nationalist tone, welcomed the soldier’s release on Wednesday, calling it a “positive sign” ahead of the next round of talks. Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from New Delhi.']","After months of tension that turned violent at times, the release signaled a respite in a dispute that has led to a buildup of forces along the disputed mountainous border."
Houston teachers stage a sickout over virus safety after the district loosens its closure policy.,2020-10-22,By Frances Robles,"['Just three days after classrooms reopened for in-person learning, teachers in the Houston Independent School District, the seventh-largest public school system in the nation, staged a sickout to protest what they view as lax Covid-19 safety procedures. The move came a day after the district loosened its strict policy regarding the closure of schools when cases are detected in them. The protest is the latest example of the difficulties that school districts and teachers around the country are navigating as they attempt to resume in-person instruction. On Wednesday, Boston public schools suspended the phased reopening of in-person classes. Houston schools reopened its 280 schools on Monday. The next day, 16 of them were forced to close again because someone had tested positive on campus, according to the district. Administrators responded with an announcement on Wednesday that schools would no longer be closed when just a single person tests positive, a stricter policy than many other large districts across the nation had adopted. Now it will take two sick people to close a campus. When there is just one, the infected person and others who were directly exposed will be isolated and “if possible, sent home,” and the campus will be disinfected overnight. “Learning will continue as normal, with students and staff remaining in their assigned classrooms throughout the day to limit movement and contacts,” the district said in a statement. “If two or more confirmed positive cases are reported on a campus, the campus will close and shift to virtual learning to adequately identify contacts of positive cases.” Dozens of teachers in at least 35 campuses called in sick on Thursday to protest the district’s policies on social distancing —\xa0including allowing students to be within three feet of one another —\xa0and on class size, according to one of the leaders involved. Teachers with chronic health conditions have been forced to report to work while their applications for accommodations are reviewed, and requests to switch to virtual teaching are being denied even for people with cancer, the leader said. The school district declined to confirm how many teachers called in sick. “Face-to-face instruction will continue to occur with safety measures in place in accordance with guidelines provided by the C.D.C., state and local health authorities,” the district said in a statement. “The health, safety and well-being of our students and staff remains our top priority as we work to meet the educational needs of all families in the district.” [A photo caption accompanying an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of a mural about the pandemic.

Pope Francis’ Views on Same-Sex Civil Unions Were Cut From a 2019 Vatican Interview,2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz and Natalie Kitroeff,"['ROME — Pope Francis was an hour into a sprawling interview with a Mexican journalist at his Vatican residence in 2019 when he was asked if he had changed since his time as archbishop of Argentina, when he staunchly opposed gay marriage. Francis responded that he had always defended the church’s teaching on marriage, then began to delve into the question of legalizing same-sex relationships when suddenly the video skipped forward. “One changes in life,” he said. The words that went missing — expressing support for same-sex civil unions — surfaced only this week in a new documentary, stoking the hopes of gay Catholics and the fury of conservatives. But the clip also became the subject of sudden intrigue over when and where the pope made the remarks, and why they were only now being made public. The pope made the comments in an interview with the Vatican correspondent for the Mexican broadcaster Televisa, said Teresa Villa, a spokeswoman for Televisa, late on Thursday. Two people close to the company, who did not want to be identified while discussing such sensitive matters, said that the Vatican had required that the interview be filmed with Vatican cameras and that the Vatican be given control over the footage. The Vatican cut out the pope’s remarks on same-sex unions in the edited version provided to Televisa, the two people said. Gone was this comment from the pope: “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered.” The excerpt, which the two people said was never seen by the network, remained buried until the Church allowed a documentary filmmaker access to the Vatican archives, including the raw footage of the Televisa interview. The filmmaker put the clip in a new documentary — “Francesco” — that premiered this week at the Rome Film Festival. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to respond on Thursday evening when asked whether the Vatican had tried to suppress the Pope’s potentially groundbreaking remarks. It remained unclear who at the Vatican would have edited the footage, or if Francis himself knew of the cut. But the disappearance, then re-emergence, of footage of Francis weighing in on one of the most divisive issues facing the Roman Catholic Church raised questions about whether the pope’s handlers sought to silence his apparent approval of legal unions for same-sex couples.  Since the remarks surfaced Wednesday in the new documentary, they have been welcomed as a major breakthrough by liberal Catholics and L.G.B.T. activists, and reviled by conservative bishops as a contradiction of church teaching. The Catholic Church teaches that homosexuality is a sin. The confusion over the provenance of the footage sucked in a host of players on Thursday — the ambitious, Oscar-nominated director of the film, Evgeny Afineevsky; a respected Mexican journalist with Televisa, Valentina Alazraki, to whom Francis presented a cake on the papal plane on the occasion of her 150th papal trip; and the Vatican’s own communications department, which has a tradition of secrecy, strict message control and often ham-handed execution. Almost everyone involved declined to comment or evaded questions of how the footage emerged. The film’s director, Mr. Afineevsky, who had extensive access to the Vatican over years of production, told The New York Times on Wednesday that the pope had made the remarks in an interview with him. But when the Vatican suggested otherwise, he did not answer repeated inquiries about where and when the pope made the remarks, or about whether he had instead recycled the footage from the Vatican’s cutting-room floor. Vatican officials and confidants of Francis sought to dismiss the comments as old news, even though they had never seen the light of day. Ms. Alazraki, the Televisa correspondent, told The Times on Wednesday that she did not recall the pope making such remarks to her. By that evening, video began circulating among Vatican reporters of her nearly hour-and-20 minute interview with the pope on the environment, sexual abuse and plenty else. The setting appears identical to the clip used in the new documentary. In both, Francis is seated in his residence in Casa Santa Marta on a gold-trimmed chair with a honey-combed pattern chair behind his right shoulder, and a small microphone in the same spot on his robe. On Thursday, Ms. Alazraki referred all questions to her employer, Televisa, Mexico’s largest media conglomerate, which said in a statement that at the time of the interview she was focused on the pope’s comments on the sexual abuse scandal. Ms. Alazraki’s reputation is hardly that of a pushover. In early 2019, she was invited to address many of the church’s leaders at a summit on sexual abuse, and used the occasion to warn the clerics that unless the church publicly admitted its sins instead of “playing ostrich,” then “we journalists, who seek the common good, will be your worst enemies.” But Ms. Alazraki, who has covered five popes, is also operating in a Vatican media environment that follows Italian journalistic practices and ethics. In Italy, the line between press office and reporter is blurry; reporters often share questions in advance and allow sources to vet stories before publication. And in the Vatican, officials also often require that the Vatican’s own cameras do the filming. But what is remarkable in this case is that the pope appears to have been censored in the Vatican’s postproduction process. It is also possible that the Vatican officials who worked closely with Mr. Afineevsky, the film’s director, clued him in to the cut footage. The pope’s penchant for speaking in an off-the-cuff manner has maddened not only supporters and critics, but also his staff in the Roman bureaucracy. He has at times sought to circumvent his media office by personally granting and arranging his own interviews. John Thavis, author of “The Vatican Diaries,” and a veteran church analyst, said some confusion was inevitable with Francis, who was purposefully breaking a centuries-old mold in which popes spoke in an extremely formal and controlled manner. “He recognizes the headline he created yesterday is more important than all the footnoting and cleaning up that comes afterward,” Mr. Thavis said. “His goal is to set a tone, not a policy, so I don’t think he’s worried about the fallout.” But perhaps someone in the Vatican communications office was. Its major force is Andrea Tornielli, a former star Vatican reporter for Italian publications who has helped expand the power and footprint of the Vatican’s new communications department, leaving the press office, which it now oversees, weakened and out of the loop. Another powerful voice is the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest and close ally of the pope, who has vigorously defended him against conservative critics on social media. On Wednesday, Father Spadaro told reporters that the pope’s remarks had been contained in the Televisa interview — leaving it to be later discovered that those remarks never actually aired. Both he and Mr. Tornielli declined to comment on Thursday. Regardless of who may be trying to control the message at the Vatican, it has proved difficult with Francis. “The Vatican attitude toward Pope Francis’ interviews is the same as the White House attitude toward Trump tweets,” said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and expert on the Vatican bureaucracy. “They would prefer a much more controlled message where they write the speeches and he reads them. He’s just not going to do that.” Jason Horowitz reported from Rome, and Natalie Kitroeff from Mexico City.']","A Mexican broadcast company says Francis made the comments to its correspondent more than a year ago, and people close to the company say the Vatican then edited them out."
Poland Court Ruling Effectively Bans Legal Abortions,2020-10-22,By Monika Pronczuk,"['A constitutional tribunal in Poland ruled on Thursday that abortions for fetal abnormalities violate the country’s Constitution, effectively imposing a near-total ban in a nation that already had some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. The debate over a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy, a divisive issue in a staunchly Roman Catholic country, mirrors the bitter polarization of a society caught between traditional religious values and more liberal ones.  In the ruling, the tribunal’s president, Julia Przylebska, said that allowing abortions in cases of fetal abnormality legalized “eugenic practices with regard to an unborn child, thus denying it the respect and protection of human dignity.” Because the Polish Constitution guarantees a right to life, she added, terminating a pregnancy based on the health of the fetus amounted to “a directly forbidden form of discrimination.” Before the decision, which cannot be appealed, Poland permitted terminations only for fetal abnormalities, a threat to a woman’s health or in the case of incest or rape. But in practice, the overwhelming majority of legal abortions — 1,074 of 1,100 performed last year — resulted from fetal abnormalities. Abortion rights advocates say those numbers reflect the restrictions already in effect, which make it all but impossible for Polish women to obtain a legal abortion, prompting them to seek illegal abortions or go abroad. “In practice it takes weeks, sometimes months,” to obtain a legal abortion, said Karolina Wieckiewicz, a lawyer and activist with the group Abortion Without Borders. “Some people decide to risk the battle in Poland; others look for alternatives.” Dunja Mijatovic, the human rights commissioner of the Council of Europe, which advocates for rights and democratic rule, noted that situation in criticizing the court decision. “Today’s ruling of the Constitutional Court means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford & even greater ordeal for all others,” Ms. Mijatovic wrote on Twitter. She called it a “sad day for women rights.” Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw and the opposition’s candidate in last summer’s presidential election, denounced the ruling and accused the government of effectively “tightening the abortion law” in an effort “to cover up their inefficiency in the fight against the coronavirus.” President Andrzej Duda welcomed the court’s decision, his spokesman, Blazej Spychalski, said in an interview with the Polish Press Agency.  “We are expressing our satisfaction that the tribunal stood on the side of life,” he said. The government has been at loggerheads with the European Union, of which Poland is a member, over minority and women’s rights. It has also been criticized for compromising the independence of the judiciary, including the constitutional tribunal, which is supposed to be the main check on the governing party. But the bloc has failed to tame Poland’s illiberal drift. “The European Union does not want to get involved,” said Barbara Nowacka, an opposition lawmaker who had co-written a letter appealing to the tribunal’s president, Ms. Przylebska. “We are left to fend for ourselves, with a barbarian law.” “Ensuring women’s human rights, including their reproductive rights, is essential to upholding E.U. values,” said Hillary Margolis, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Poland’s flagrant disregard for these values is dangerous not only for women and girls in Poland, but throughout Europe.” The tribunal ruled, though, that abortions on the basis of fetal abnormalities violated the dignity of human life, a principle enshrined in the Polish Constitution. It further held that such abortions go against the principle of nondiscrimination and respect for human life, and that a fetus acquires those rights at conception. Women’s rights advocates say that the tribunal’s decision will in some cases force women to give birth to terminally ill children and amount to an effective ban on abortion — something the government has not been able to accomplish through legislation. Previous legislative bids to tighten abortion laws were met with mass demonstrations with thousands of women pouring into the streets. Public opinion polls have shown overwhelming support for the country’s current abortion rules, though it is unclear how the tribunal’s decision will affect that. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing Law and Justice party and Poland’s most powerful politician, has repeatedly promised to tighten access to legal abortions. “I would really like this kind of abortion to be at least restricted to the most extreme cases,” Mr. Kaczynski said of fetal abnormalities in an interview this year with Polish news outlets. Analysts say the Law and Justice party is unlikely to have a more auspicious moment to end legal abortion, with the pandemic discouraging mass demonstrations and the next election three years away. Nevertheless, a group of conservative lawmakers asked the constitutional tribunal to review the compatibility of the current legislation with the Constitution. “The Parliament has been unsuccessfully trying to strengthen the protection of life for the past 20 years,” said Bartlomiej Wroblewski, a Law and Justice lawmaker who was one of the initiators of the request. “This speaks in favor of trying a different road.” Ms. Nowacka, the opposition lawmaker, said it was introducing a total abortion ban through the backdoor. “There will be no better time for the ruling party to do this,” she said. “A pandemic is raging in Poland, people are busy with other things, and the next election is far away.” “The decision of the constitutional tribunal means freezing the issue for years, accepting that life and dignity of women are less important than life of a fetus,” Ms. Nowacka added. Critics of the government at home and abroad have accused the tribunal of doing the government’s bidding. Eleven of its 12 judges were appointed by the governing party, and the head of the tribunal, Ms. Przylebska, is a longtime friend of Mr. Kaczynski. “Since Kaczynski and his party came to power, the tribunal has been deliberately destroyed,” said Monika Platek, a law professor at the University of Warsaw. “Its function is to endorse all decisions of the authorities regardless of whether they’re rational or in accordance with the Constitution.” Amnesty International, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Human Rights Watch, which sent an expert to monitor the hearing, expressed concern over what they described as the government’s assault on women’s rights and the judiciary. “The proceedings take place in the context of repeated government attacks on women’s rights and efforts to roll back reproductive rights, as well as legal and policy changes that have undermined the independence of the judiciary and rule of law in Poland,” the organizations said in a statement. Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.']","The decision, which cannot be appealed, halts pregnancy terminations for fetal abnormalities, virtually the only type currently performed in the country."
The U.S. reported its second-highest daily case total since the start of the pandemic.,2020-10-23,By Elaine Yu and Mitch Smith,"['More than 75,000 cases of the coronavirus were announced in the United States on Thursday, the second-highest daily total nationwide since the pandemic began. Eight states set single-day case records, and 13 states have added more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch. The Midwest and the Rocky Mountains are struggling to contain major outbreaks, while new hot spots are emerging in other parts of the country. Officials in Kentucky announced more than 1,470 cases on Thursday, the biggest one-day jump in that state. And more than 1,300 cases were recorded in Colorado, setting another single-day record.

OSHA is under fire over its regulation of meatpacking plants.,2020-10-22,By Noam Scheiber,"['When the pandemic hit in March, a JBS meatpacking plant in Greeley, Colo., began providing paid leave to workers at high risk of serious illness. But last month, shortly after the plant was cited by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration for a serious virus-related safety violation and given two initial penalties totaling about $15,500, it brought the high-risk employees back to work. “Now the company knows where the ceiling is,” said Kim Cordova, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union local that represents the workers, about half a dozen of whom have died of Covid-19. “If other workers die, it’s not going to cost them that much.” JBS USA said the return of the vulnerable workers in late September had nothing to do with the citation. “It was in response to the low number of Covid-19 cases at the facility for a sustained period of time,” a spokesman said, noting that the company began informing workers of the return in late July. The JBS case reflects a skew in OSHA’s coronavirus-related citations, most of which it has announced since September: While the agency has announced initial penalties totaling over $1 million to dozens of health care facilities and nursing homes, it has announced fines for only two meatpacking plants for a total of less than $30,000. JBS and the owner of the second plant, Smithfield Foods, combined to take in tens of billions of dollars worldwide last year. The meat industry has gotten the relatively light touch even as the virus has infected thousands of its workers — including more than 1,500 at the two facilities in question — and dozens have died. The disparity in the way OSHA has treated health care and meatpacking is no accident. In April, the agency announced that it would largely avoid inspecting workplaces in person outside a small number of industries deemed most susceptible to coronavirus outbreaks, like health care, nursing homes and emergency response.']",
‘These are everyday people who are dying’: A study offers a new picture of the lives lost to the virus.,2020-10-22,By Katherine J. Wu,"['There have been more than 220,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States, and each one represents years of potential life lost. They are years that might otherwise have been filled with moments rich and mundane: Time spent with family and friends. Trips to the grocery store. Late-night conversations on the phone. Tearful firsts with a newborn baby. Staggering as the 220,000 number is, it may not fully capture the true toll of the pandemic, according to a recent analysis. Tabulating the ages of Americans known to have died of Covid-19, and tallying the number of years they might have lived had they reached a typical life expectancy, the report concluded that the virus had claimed more than 2.5 million years of potential life in the United States. “Think of everything that a person does in a year,” said the author of the report, Stephen Elledge, a geneticist at Harvard. “Who among us would not give anything to have one more year with a parent, a spouse, a son or daughter, a close friend?” The report, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, comes as 37 states continue to see sustained increases in new infections, according to a New York Times database. Twelve have been roughly flat over the past couple of weeks. Only Hawaii is seeing consistent declines. On Wednesday, at least four states broke their single-day records for new cases reported. Just last week, scientists published a high-profile and discredited declaration arguing that businesses and schools should be quickly opened and that people “who are not vulnerable” to the virus — presumably the young and healthy — should return to “life as normal” while older Americans remain cloistered from the coronavirus. Dr. Elledge’s analysis found that nearly half of the years lost were taken from people younger than 65. “These are everyday people who are dying,” said Dr. Utibe Essien, a physician and health equity researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in the analysis. “They’re losing time with their kids, their grandkids, their opportunities to build their futures.” Dr. Essien was one of several experts who reviewed the study at the request of The New York Times.']",
2 Broke Artists Started a Bakery at Home. It’s a Pandemic Hit.,2020-10-21,By Natalie Kitroeff,"['MEXICO CITY — A toaster oven may not be the ideal gadget for starting a full-fledged bakery, but this is a pandemic and everyone is doing their best with what they have. And what two artists in Mexico City had was a $42 toaster oven. “We were broke,” said Andrea Ferrero, shrugging her elbows out of a bowl of cake batter. “We bought it on credit.” Like legions of others around the world stuck in coronavirus lockdown, Ms. Ferrero and her boyfriend, David Ayala-Alfonso, began baking several months ago to escape unrelenting boredom. They turned out to be very good at it. So they started an addictive Instagram account, Cuarentena Baking, or Quarantine Baking, to showcase their cookies, cakes and doughnuts. And they have since amassed hundreds of clients. With a viable business, they’ve moved out of their tiny apartment into a bigger place — one with a real oven. Their success, a rare bit of good news in a country pummeled by the coronavirus, is a testament to the power of cooking as a survival strategy in Mexico’s food-obsessed capital. Before the virus struck, the streets of Mexico City were already flush with taco stands, people serving tamales on bicycles, and carts offering roasted sweet potatoes or corn on the cob slathered with mayo, cheese and chili powder. The pandemic and the attendant loss of millions of jobs across the country have pushed even more people to try their hand at selling their home cooking. “In Mexico, someone’s kitchen is home, and street food is someone’s home brought to the street,” said Pati Jinich, a Mexican chef and cookbook author. “For people with no resources, they can make the food they grew up eating or they were taught — or just the one thing that they had.” Across the city, there’s been a blossoming of so-called ghost kitchens — set up to make food exclusively for delivery, with the preparation often done in people’s apartments. When their family’s catering business in the capital lost steam, Jonathan Weintraub and his brother Gabriel started selling pastrami sandwiches under the moniker “Schmaltzy Bros Delicatessen.” After getting laid off, Fahrunnisa Bellak turned bagel-making into a full-time job and is now opening a storefront. Encouraged by his wife, Pedro Reyes, a food writer, decided to package and sell his popular salsa macha, a nut-filled hot salsa. He said his venture has a natural market in Mexico City, where an inordinate share of conversations revolve entirely around food. “Most people here like to eat well and they brag about knowing where to eat,” Mr. Reyes said. “That helps people open up to these small businesses, to be able to say, ‘I want to buy cookies from this guy and paella from that one.’” The popularity of Cuarentena Baking has a lot to do with its Instagram account, which every day features close-ups of the owners’ confections, like gooey filling smooshed into a brownie or spilling out of cakes. Instead of advertising out-of-reach luxury for fantasy browsing, it offers something attainable for people with $1.75 to spend on a mound of pure joy. At first, the couple posted pictures just for their friends, who would send them tequila or homemade hummus in exchange for samples. Then friends of friends started placing orders. Someone asked for a menu, so they invented one including babkas, doughnuts, sourdough and later, cakes and brownies. Besides sourdough, the couple had never made any of these treats before quarantine. At first, everything besides the cakes was baked inside their toaster oven. Moving into a new apartment has given the couple only slightly more control over the bedlam of operating a full-fledged bakery from home during a global health crisis. “I obsessively plan,” Ms. Ferrero said. “And then, chaos.” Their home looks like what would happen if Santa’s workshop were located inside a dorm room. The kitchen fits a maximum of four people comfortably. The assembly area is squished into what would be a modest second bedroom. Their trash can is a stool turned upside down with a garbage bag fitted over the four legs. On a recent Saturday, while frenetically churning cake and then brownie batter, Ms. Ferrero asked herself the following questions: “Did I already put eggs in this?” (No.) “Did we run out of vanilla?” (Yes.) “Was this cake supposed to have three layers?” (It was.) She eyed the day’s to-do list — 61 jars filled with cake, icing and crumbled cookies, a best-selling concoction; 162 brownies; 38 cookies; and three cakes — and picked up her phone to respond to the messages flooding her inbox. “Can I come pick the order up now?” she said, reading one of them aloud. “No!” Ms. Fererro, originally from Peru, is a sculptor, and Mr. Ayala-Alfonso, born in Colombia, is a curator — trades that are at least tangentially connected to building structures out of dough and creating an alluring visual vibe on Instagram. But their transformation into professional bakers has not been without mishap. They have started several oven fires, sent countless incomplete or late orders, and once had a delivery person disappear with several brownies and a cheesecake. They constantly run out of ingredients. Over the last few months, Mr. Ayala-Alfonso said, they’ve been working to perfect their craft, searching YouTube for videos on “how to make a cake,” and “why is my cake falling down,” and “what’s the difference between baking soda and powder.” They also recently hired an artist friend, Yorely Valero, to help manage the onslaught of orders a few days a week. They have developed a special intimacy with clients. People ask them to write love notes to their crushes, on top of boxes of brownies. One regular asked Ms. Ferrero to not draw her signature hearts on a box that was to be delivered as a six-month anniversary gift to a boyfriend, because it might scare him off. “I said ‘sure, good luck!’” Ms. Ferrero said. “You’re already interacting on social media more because of quarantine, so people actually talk to us,” Mr. Ayala-Alfonso said. “Our account is a support line.” By 2 p.m. on the recent Saturday, when they officially start handing out orders, a small crowd of couriers and customers was waiting outside the Cuarentena Baking headquarters, which is on a tree-lined street in Roma Norte, a hipster neighborhood south of the city’s center. One woman, who had been waiting for 10 minutes, let out a long sigh and a terse “thank you” when Mr. Ayala-Alfonso handed her a box of cookies. Half an hour later, the woman messaged the Instagram account: “It was worth the wait ;)”']","They didn’t have an oven. Their apartment resembled Santa’s workshop set up in a dorm room.

U.S. Embassy in Turkey Issues Terrorism Alert and Halts Services,2020-10-23,By The Associated Press,"['ISTANBUL — The U.S. Embassy in Turkey issued a security alert on Friday, saying it had received reports of a possible coming attack on Americans and other foreigners, and temporarily suspended consular services. “The U.S. Mission in Turkey has received credible reports of potential terrorist attacks and kidnappings against U.S. citizens and foreign nationals in Istanbul, including against the U.S. Consulate General, as well as potentially other locations in Turkey,” the embassy said in a statement. The embassy in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, urged American citizens to exercise caution, including while at large office buildings, shopping malls and other places foreigners gather. It said citizen and visa services would be suspended temporarily at all U.S. consulates in Turkey. The Islamic State and an outlawed Kurdish militant group conducted deadly attacks on Turkish soil between 2015 and 2017. A far-left group has also targeted the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. A representative of the embassy said: “The U.S. mission to Turkey issued this notice as a result of our ongoing assessment of security conditions. The statement speaks for itself. We are grateful for the support of the Turkish government in ensuring the safety of Americans living in Turkey as well as Turkish citizens who visit our embassy and consulates.”']",The embassy said it had received “credible reports” of potential attacks and kidnappings aimed at Americans and other foreign nationals in Istanbul.
Outcry in Philippines Over General’s ‘Warning’ to Female Celebrities,2020-10-23,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — The 22-year-old actress’s voice broke last week as she talked about being threatened online with rape. She said she worried about the environment that her young nieces would grow up in, and called for creating “a better future for everyone.” This week, a Philippine general said that unless she changed her ways, she could end up dead. The general, Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade — the de facto head of a military task force fighting a long-running Communist insurgency in the Philippines — directed his criticism not at the remarks made by the actress, Liza Soberano, but at the forum where she made them: an online discussion on the rights of women and girls organized by the youth wing of Gabriela, a women’s rights group that the military claims is tied to Communist guerrillas. (Gabriela denies the accusation.) “Liza Soberano, there’s still a chance to abdicate that group,” General Parlade said on Facebook. Otherwise, he said, she would “suffer the same fate” as Josephine Ann Lapira, a young activist who was killed in a 2017 battle between the military and the Communist rebels, the New People’s Army. The general’s comments led to an outcry from social media users, liberal politicians and the Commission on Human Rights, an independent government body. “Coming from a high-ranking military official, such a statement is a form of suppression and restriction that serves to dissuade those who speak up for their beliefs and advocacies,” a member of the rights commission, Gwendolyn Pimentel-Gana, said on Friday. A lawyer for Ms. Soberano, Jun Lim, said that the actress was “apolitical,” and accused General Parlade of “red-tagging” her — that is, accusing her of being a Communist. “Expressing her love and respect for women and children is her personal advocacy,” Mr. Lim said. General Parlade denied implying that Ms. Soberano was a Communist, saying that he had meant only to warn her against associating with militants. He said he supported women’s rights. But some of the general’s critics said his comments reflected a hostility toward women that is prevalent in President Rodrigo Duterte’s government. In his Facebook remarks, General Parlade also warned another Filipina celebrity — Catriona Gray, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 2018 — against associating with left-leaning activist groups. And he accused Angel Locsin, an outspoken actress, of being involved with the rebels. Ms. Gray, in particular, has been vocal about the government’s crackdown on human rights organizations and its passage of a contentious antiterrorism law that rights groups say was designed to stifle opposition voices. “To Liza and Catriona: It is difficult and painful to be at the front lines fighting beside persons oppressed by a norm that advocates rape, murder and exploitation,” Senator Risa Hontiveros said by telephone. “We will be monitoring him from now on,” Senator Hontiveros said of General Parlade. “He should not use his power as a general and threaten these women.” Mr. Duterte, a self-confessed womanizer, has been repeatedly accused of misogyny. He once joked about the gang rape of an Australian missionary during a prison riot in the southern Philippines, saying that he should have been allowed to participate. The New People’s Army, the armed wing of the country’s Communist Party, has been waging guerrilla warfare since 1969. Mr. Duterte, who calls himself a leftist and who once studied under the party’s founder, Jose Maria Sison, wooed the rebels to the negotiating table soon after taking office and had hoped to complete a peace deal before stepping down in 2022. But the relationship soured, with the rebels and the military accusing each other of continuing to foment violence. Mr. Duterte scrapped the peace talks and said he would resume them only if Mr. Sison returned to the Philippines from self-imposed exile in the Netherlands. Gabriela, the country’s most prominent women’s rights organization, has denied having ties to the Communist Party or the rebels. Arlene Brosas, a Philippine lawmaker who is a member of Gabriela, said the military was using a “rehashed script” to attack the group. “Our 20 years of advancing women and children’s rights inside and outside of Congress cannot be smeared by their repeated lies,” she said. Ms. Soberano is a popular film and television actress whose breakthrough came with “Forevermore,” a soap opera on the ABS-CBN network. On Friday, ABS-CBN issued statements in support of both Ms. Soberano and Ms. Locsin, who also appears on the network. In the online discussion last week, Ms. Soberano became emotional as she talked about supportive messages she had received from women after filing a criminal complaint against someone alleged to have posted a rape threat against her on social media. “I cried when they sent me those messages,” she said, “because I didn’t realize how many women were struggling to stand up for themselves.”']","Accusing a women’s rights group of ties to Communist rebels, the general told an actress she could be killed if she associated with the organization."
The worst virus outbreaks in the U.S. are now in rural areas.,2020-10-22,By Lauren Leatherby,"['With the U.S. case count and hospitalization rates approaching a third peak, none of the country’s biggest hot spots are currently in a large city. Almost all the counties with the largest outbreaks have populations under 50,000, and most have populations under 10,000. Nearly all are in the Midwest or the Mountain West. Among the counties with the worst per capita outbreaks, seven of the top 20 were in South Dakota — six of which have fewer than 10,000 people. Leading the nation was Norton, Kan., — population 5,486 — with an average of 44 new daily cases a day per 10,000 people. The shift to rural areas is a stark contrast to earlier in the pandemic, when previous peaks saw virus cases concentrated mainly in cities and suburbs. The current surge is the most geographically dispersed yet, and it is hitting hard remote counties that often lack a hospital or other critical health care resources. Since late summer, per capita case and death rates in rural areas have outpaced those in metropolitan areas. The total number of coronavirus cases and deaths in rural places remains smaller than those in cities because of the comparatively low population in rural areas. But the rural share of the virus burden has grown over time. Now, about one in four deaths from the virus is recorded in a rural county. In March and April, almost every death was in a metropolitan area, as the virus tore through the Northeast, after early clusters in the Seattle area and populous parts of California.']",
A Dozen Protesters in Nigeria Reported Killed by Security Forces,2020-10-21,By Shola Lawal and Monica Mark,"['LAGOS, Nigeria — With music playing and food being passed around, a festive atmosphere hung over the protest encampment on Tuesday night, despite the anger over police brutality that in recent weeks had driven youthful demonstrations that were the biggest Nigeria had seen in a generation. As darkness fell, Nigerian flags were handed out among the thousands of people gathered there. Philip Agu, a sound engineer who had volunteered to run the huge speaker system, said a protest leader took the microphone and told the crowd that the police would likely arrive soon, but that if they sat down, sang the national anthem and waved their flags, they would face no danger. The speaker told the crowd, Mr. Agu recalled, that all around the world, “No soldier can shoot any citizen holding their own national flag.” Three hours later, dozens of people were hit by gunfire from security forces, some fatally, and images of bloodied protesters and their bloodied flags strewn on the ground flooded the social media accounts of millions of Nigerians. Survivors recalled a sudden shift from sitting peacefully to fleeing in panic. Some said military and police units surrounded the demonstrators in the affluent suburb of Lekki, preventing them from leaving. “I thought I was going to die,” said Kolade Abiola Ahmed, his voice still quaking a day later. Soldiers and police officers opening fire on unarmed youths in an upscale neighborhood shocked the nation, even older citizens who recalled growing up under a series of military dictatorships. The protests over police brutality in the past two weeks had been larger and even more widespread than the last round of major demonstrations, in 2012, after the government stopped subsidizing fuel, but they had remained largely peaceful. Nigeria’s security forces have long been criticized for human rights abuses, particularly in the impoverished northeastern region, but there was a different set of victims this time. Many of the demonstrators have been middle-class, well-educated young people in the southern and central cities, better off than earlier generations, and too young to remember military rule that ended in 1999. Their movement, like Black Lives Matter in the United States, has been youth-driven, mostly leaderless and propelled by social media — a nimble, amorphous force that has been hard to quell. On Tuesday, the security forces killed at least 12 people at demonstrations in the Lagos area, including 10 at Lekki, Amnesty International reported on Wednesday. “These shootings clearly amount to extrajudicial executions,” said Osai Ojigho, the group’s director for Nigeria. “There must be an immediate investigation and suspected perpetrators must be held accountable through fair trials.” The government did not give casualty figures, but a police officer under the Lagos State Command Area Alpha headquarters, who was at the scene of the killings, told The New York Times on Wednesday that at least 11 people had been killed. On Wednesday, some of the protesters were out in the streets again, violating a 24-hour curfew  imposed the day before, and newly aware that they could be risking their lives. Plumes of smoke rose from at least three buildings, including one that houses TVC News, which stopped broadcasting. Sporadic gunshots could be heard around Lekki and Yaba, districts 20 miles apart, separated by a lagoon. Calling themselves the “Soro Soke” or “speak up” generation in the Yoruba language widely spoken in Lagos, the nation’s largest city, the protesters have insisted that a notorious police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, be disbanded, and its most brutal officers prosecuted. The unit, known as SARS, has earned a reputation for abusing, torturing and even killing young people; an Amnesty report in June referred to its “horrific reign of impunity.” The demonstrators have “generally been from the middle classes, highly-educated Nigerians. And that’s why initially the police perception was the protests wouldn’t last because these are Nigerians that don’t know how to endure hardship,” said Murtala Abdullahi, a reporter with HumAngle, an online national publication. The protests began after a widely seen and shared video appeared to show SARS officers killing a man, unprovoked. Officials said the video was fake and arrested the person who made it, making people still angrier. Calls for action spread rapidly on social media, with the hashtag #EndSars, and celebrities in Nigeria and abroad — including Beyoncé and Justin Bieber — added their voices to the demands. Demonstrations grew in several cities, millions of people watched them unfold live online, and the grievances expanded to include chronic corruption and lack of accountability. President Muhammadu Buhari — a former army general who led a military government in the 1980s — vowed last week to disband SARS. But there was no word on prosecutions, and government officials indicated that the officers would simply be moved to other units, not dismissed. Protesters denounced the changes as window-dressing. On Tuesday, reports of police killing people, followed by the burning of a police station, prompted the governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to declare a 24-hour curfew. He said that people bent on chaos had hijacked the peaceful protests. Despite the curfew, the demonstrators near the Lekki tollgate did not disperse. Mr. Ahmed, who had been attending protests since Thursday, said people remained seated on the ground, chanting slogans and waving their flags, as at least a dozen trucks arrived with police and military units. There were already ominous signs. Witnesses reported seeing people dismantle streetlights and remove security cameras that would have recorded what was to come next. Many protesters contend that the government has used paid provocateurs to sow violence, as an excuse for a brutal crackdown. The police officer who confirmed the deaths said that he and dozens of others were ordered to head to the Lekki protest at around 7 p.m. They piled into 15 Toyota pickup trucks, he said, joined by at least three Tata trucks full of soldiers. Some demonstrators were armed, and others threw rocks at the uniformed forces, according to the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. But other witnesses said that without warning or provocation, the security forces began shooting into the air, and then at the civilians trying to flee in terror. “They were trying to circle us, put us in the middle, they were spreading out and they were trying to go around so that we would be in the middle,” said Eti-Inyene Akpan, a 26-year-old photographer who was there. Many people, including Mr. Akpan and Mr. Ahmed, took shelter behind barricades and under parked cars. “There was a lady who excreted because of fear,” Mr. Ahmed said. Video streams on social media showed wounded people lying in the streets, or being carried by others into teeming hospital emergency rooms. The national government has been all but silent on what happened Tuesday night. Mr. Buhari appealed for calm. In a televised statement on Wednesday, the governor, Mr. Sanwo-Olu, sought to distance himself from the security forces deployed on Tuesday, and said he had ordered an investigation into the “rules of engagement” they adopted. “This is with the view to taking this up with the higher command of the Nigerian Army and to seek intervention of Mr. President” he added. The curfew was extended by three days, until Saturday. The bloodshed drew international condemnation, and not only from human rights groups. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president, and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, called on the authorities to halt the violent crackdown. Despite the violent response, the protest movement will not go away, demonstrators and analysts said. “The movement is succeeding while others have failed because of the format it adopted, both offline and online,” said Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development, a policy research group in Nigeria. “The hashtag has helped them to garner international support but importantly to galvanize the young people.” For his part, Mr. Ahmed was back on the streets and protesting on Wednesday, fueled by anger at being shot. He and a small group first marched to the gates of a house belonging to the governor’s family. “I was shouting his name to come out,” Mr. Ahmed said. “He doesn’t care even if I was killed or my friends were killed, too, and he says he is a leader.” Shola Lawal reported from Lagos, and Monica Mark from Johannesburg.']",Nigerians are stunned after police and soldiers opened fire on protesters against police brutality. The largely peaceful demonstrations have grown into a challenge for the government.
"Europe Wonders if It Can Rely on U.S. Again, Whoever Wins",2020-10-22,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Treated with contempt by President Trump, who considers them rivals and deadbeats instead of allies, many European leaders look forward to the possibility of a Biden presidency. But they are painfully aware that four years of Mr. Trump have changed the world — and the United States — in ways that will not be easily reversed. Even if civility can be restored, a fundamental trust has been broken, and many European diplomats and experts believe that U.S. foreign policy is no longer bipartisan, so is no longer reliable. “The shining city on the hill is not as shining as it used to be,” Reinhard Bütikofer, a prominent German member of the European Parliament, put it bluntly. For the first time, said Ivan Krastev, director of the Center for Liberal Strategies, “Europeans are afraid that there is no longer a foreign-policy consensus in the United States. Every new administration can mean a totally new policy, and for them this is a nightmare.” The ideological divide will be on display on Thursday, when Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. are scheduled to hold their final presidential debate. There will be what most consider low-hanging fruit for a Biden administration that will please Europeans. The crop includes an extension to the New Start nuclear arms control treaty with Russia and returns to the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization and even the Iran nuclear accord. There will be feel-good meetings and statements about multilateralism, less confrontation about trade, renewed efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and a less combative atmosphere at summit meetings of the Group of 7 and NATO. But Mr. Trump’s complaints are shared by many Americans, and given the polarization in America, President Emmanuel Macron of France has pushed Europe to step up in an altered world, where China is rising and the Trump administration is only a symptom of an American retreat from global leadership, not the cause. The idea of European “strategic autonomy” — of a Europe less dependent on Washington and with its own strong voice in the world — has been gaining ground, even if it is more aspiration than reality. Some, like Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs, and François Heisbourg, a French security analyst, fear that a Biden presidency could short-circuit European autonomy and let Europeans continue, as Ms. Tocci said, “sticking our heads in the sand.” A Trump re-election, of course, might accelerate the trend toward autonomy, even if few believe that Mr. Trump would be able to pull out of NATO, as one of his former national security advisers, John Bolton, suggested he might. American foreign policy was traditionally bipartisan — the old phrase that “politics stops at the water’s edge” had merit, especially during the Cold War. But the collapse of the Soviet Union meant that foreign policy, too, was subject to deepening political polarization in the United States. “There is an incredible decay in Europe of the sense of the United States as a leader,” accelerated and symbolized by mishandling of the coronavirus, said Jeremy Shapiro of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Biden doesn’t solve their America problem,” he said. “He’s not going to be president for ever, and Democrats won’t always be in power, and people have learned that the U.S. can’t be trusted on foreign policy, because the next administration will come in and wipe it away.” The inconsistency of U.S. foreign policy has undermined American credibility, some warned. There is “an American decline in geopolitical weight,” said Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University. “The single fact that shapes the U.S. role in global politics is polarization, and this polarization will not disappear if Joe Biden is elected,” he said. “Americans simply don’t agree with one another on basic premises, even on how much America should be involved in global affairs and NATO.” William J. Burns, a former senior American diplomat who now runs the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, thinks the damage is lasting, no matter who wins the election. “One of the more insidious effects of polarization is to make foreign policy a tool of partisan politics,” he said. “It’s done enduring damage to America’s reputation in the world for being able to keep its word.” While Europeans would see a Biden presidency “as a return to civilization,” as Mr. Heisbourg called it, a new partnership would come with demands for new obligations and commitments, especially on China. After Mr. Trump, however, there would also be a new wariness and unwillingness to take big risks on the part of America’s allies, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If you know that whatever you’re doing will at most last until the next election, you look at everything in a more contingent way,” he said. Europeans see American confrontation with China as one of the few bipartisan issues that are driving American foreign policy, and Europeans are reluctant to be made a pawn or a playing card in that rivalry, given that China is Europe’s second-largest trading partner behind the United States. Opinion polls show that most Europeans do not want to take sides in some battle between Washington and Beijing. “We don’t see the China challenge the same way and we’re not the peer competitor,” said Rem Korteweg of the Clingendael Institute. There will also be continued pressure from Washington on Europeans to spend more on defense — one bipartisan demand that has not fractured. Mr. Trump successfully goaded the Europeans to spend more. But Europeans were also reacting to a vacuum in trans-Atlantic leadership, doubts about Mr. Trump’s commitment to collective security and his view of Europe as  a burden and a competitor. “I see European partners more assertive in saying that we disagree with U.S. policies — that’s the healthier legacy left by Trump,” said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, director of the German Marshall Fund in Paris. Before Mr. Trump, those disagreements were rarely fundamental. “We had differences, but there was never a basic mistrust about having common views of the world,” said Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway, who has dealt with numerous American presidents of both parties. But over the past four years, she said, several European leaders “no longer take for granted that they can trust the U.S., even on basic things.” Confidence in Washington will not return quickly, she said. “While most European leaders think it best for the global system to build on a close U.S.-Europe relationship,” she said, “to have such a polarized situation between the two main parties in the U.S. is scary, and you wonder where that goes.” For Mr. Burns of the Carnegie Endowment, American global hegemony is over. He sees little American appetite “for grand foreign-policy crusades” and says: “We cannot return to 1949 or 1992 — or even 2016. The world has changed, and the trans-Atlantic relationship must change with it.” A Biden administration would first concentrate on domestic renewal in a country clobbered by the coronavirus, he said. It would seek a more collaborative partnership with Europe, supporting “a European security identity that doesn’t come at the expense of NATO.” The Europeans have “their own skepticism, given the drift they’ve seen in a more inward-looking America,” Mr. Burns said. But workable coalitions are possible on China, 5G, Russia, Africa and climate change. But Europeans must commit, too, Mr. Burns said. “Both sides must step up to invest in a new relationship, which they haven’t always done in the past.”']","America’s deeply polarized politics have marked foreign policy, too, undermining Washington’s authority and reputation for reliability."
"New state unemployment claims in the U.S. fell below 800,000 last week.",2020-10-22,By Patricia Cohen,"['The federal government reported on Thursday that 757,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, a drop of 73,000 from the previous week but still a stubbornly high rate as the incipient economic recovery struggles to maintain a foothold. Another 345,000 new claims were filed under a federal jobless program that provides benefits to freelancers, part-time workers and others during the pandemic. Neither figure is seasonally adjusted. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 787,000. The latest evidence of continuing stress in the labor market comes as coronavirus cases are again surging in the United States and as a second round of federal relief faces opposition from Senate Republicans over a possible $2 trillion price tag. “The claims remain very elevated, and the lack of continuing fiscal aid for the unemployed is going to weigh on consumer attitudes and consumer spending,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “It’s a very painful reality for those households who were relying on it.” Seven months into the pandemic, the nature of the job losses is changing. The hope that business interruptions would be brief and that most laid-off workers would quickly be rehired has faded. Every week, more Americans join the ranks of the long-term unemployed, defined as those out of work for more than 27 weeks. “We’re in a new phase of jobless claims,” said Ernie Tedeschi, managing director and policy economist for Evercore ISI. “More and more people are exhausting their initial 26 weeks of state unemployment.”']",
Why Nigeria Is Now Erupting,2020-10-21,By Rick Gladstone and Megan Specia,"['Tens of thousands of Nigerians have been demonstrating for weeks against a notoriously brutal and corrupt police agency, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad — a show of popular anger, fueled by longstanding grievances over corruption and lack of accountability, that posed the biggest challenge to the government in years. The demonstrations took a deadly turn this week, as soldiers fired on crowds of protesters, inflaming Nigerians who were already concerned about police use of violence against the demonstrators. Here are the basics of what is behind the protests and what they could mean for Nigeria, which at 206 million people is Africa’s most populous nation, its largest oil producer and an epicenter of the continent’s economic, political and cultural trends. Commonly known as SARS, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad was created in 1984 in response to an epidemic of violent crime including robberies, carjackings and kidnappings. While it was credited with having reduced brazen lawlessness in its initial years, the police unit was later accused of evolving into the same problem it had been designed to stop: a criminal enterprise that acts with impunity. In June, Amnesty International issued a report that it said had documented at least 82 cases of torture, ill-treatment and extrajudicial executions by SARS officers between January 2017 and May 2020. The victims, Amnesty said, were predominantly men aged 18 to 25, from low-income backgrounds and vulnerable groups. The Nigerian government’s failure to address this problem, Amnesty said, showed “an absolute disregard for international human rights laws and standards.” The critics include Fulani Kwajafa, the former police commissioner who founded SARS. In an interview with the BBC, he disavowed what it had become, saying the unit had been “turned into banditry.” The catalyst seemed to be an Oct. 3 video that appeared to show the unprovoked killing of a man by black-clad SARS officers in Ughelli, a town in southern Delta state. Nigerian officials said the video, which was widely shared over social media, was fake and arrested the person who took it — inciting even more anger. Demonstrations erupted in Lagos, the nation’s biggest city, and elsewhere around the country, driven by calls from people — many of them young — demanding that the government dismantle SARS. The decentralized movement has coalesced on social media, where people are using the hashtag #EndSARS and sharing images of police brutality. The hashtag has spread internationally, with prominent actors and sports figures from across Africa to Europe and the United States sharing the posts.  President Muhammadu Buhari, seeing that the protests were serious and spreading, agreed on Oct. 12 to  disband SARS, calling his decision “only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reform in order to ensure that the primary duty of the police and other law enforcement agencies remains the protection of lives and livelihood of our people.” But the response did not mollify protesters — especially after Mr. Buhari’s subordinates said SARS officers would be redeployed elsewhere in Nigeria’s police system. People who have been demanding that officers be fired and that the most brutal among them be prosecuted say that the government’s is an attempt to paper over a problem, not to fix it. And in recent days, clashes between protesters and the police have grown increasingly violent. The anger of the protesters seems to have only increased — especially after the deadly suppression of a peaceful demonstration in Lagos on Tuesday, compounded by a 24-hour curfew decree and the deployment of Nigeria’s military forces to quell further demonstrations. The powerful role in the protests played by young Nigerians and their use of social media to share grievances could turn the movement into a much broader crisis for the government. Half the country’s population is under the age of 19. “The protests have started to morph into a much larger critique about Nigeria, everything from police reform to security to extrajudicial killings,” said Judd Devermont,  director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Fueled by young people and an outspoken Nigerian diaspora, Mr. Devermont said,  the movement had become “a platform to talk about a host of challenges.” The movement bears striking similarities to demonstrations in the United States this year amid the outcry over police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But Mr. Devermont said an important difference is that the Nigerian protesters are not demanding a defunding of the police — if anything, he said,  they want more resources devoted to helping improve policing in their country. “They are saying police brutality cannot stand, and at the same time they’re saying the police are underfunded and poorly equipped,” he said. “This is a systemic problem — to get a better Nigeria, we need better police.” Police brutality isn’t the only issue fueling the anti-government sentiment. Nigeria’s stagnant economy, which relies heavily on oil exports that were crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, has become a major issue.  Anger over suspected misuse of government funds during the pandemic has also become an element of popular anger. In one case that received widespread publicity, the Bureau of Public Procurement data showed the Health Ministry had spent $96,000 on 1,808 ordinary face masks — about $53 each. Complaints about government corruption are a longstanding grievance. The country is regarded as highly vulnerable to corruption, ranking in the bottom fourth of an annual 180-country best-to-worst list by Transparency International. Even before the pandemic upended life, Nigeria’s people had a dim view of their politicians.  A Pew Research Center survey conducted a few years ago showed only 39 percent of Nigerians were satisfied with how democracy was working, while 60 percent said they were not.

‘We Are Not Going to Lie Down’: A Coronavirus Revolt in England,2020-10-22,By Stephen Castle,"['LIVERPOOL, England — The first time the police came to the Body Tech Fitness gym it was with a polite warning. But four hours later they were back, and this time in force. As lunchtime gymgoers worked out, about half a dozen officers, some with Tasers, ordered the closure of the fitness center, which had been deemed in breach of England’s toughest coronavirus restrictions. But even a show of strength like that doesn’t always work — particularly not in a city like Liverpool. While the main entrance was closed, the gym kept a discreet side door open for members to come in and work out. On Friday, in a head-snapping turn of events, the gym will operate legally for the first time in nine days, having forced the authorities into an unlikely retreat. The Body Tech Fitness saga, with its combination of opaque rule making, inconsistent enforcement and, ultimately, reversal, is in many ways emblematic of the British government’s overall performance since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Its handling of the pandemic has been in turns hesitant, halting, confused and contradictory — with policy deliberations taking place behind closed doors and limited engagement with the people and places bearing the brunt of the orders. Over time, that has generated confusion and distrust, along with signs of growing resistance to the diktats from Westminster. And if there was one place that was not going to suffer quietly, local people say, it was Liverpool. “Anyone who’s from Liverpool will tell you they are proud of the city. Historically, we have shown that we are not going to lie down when something is unfair,” said Nick Whitcombe, 29, the owner of the gym in Moreton, about six miles from the city center, as he celebrated a victory achieved through concerted lobbying of politicians and slick outreach to the media. “Strategically, if you were trying to enforce an unjust measure anywhere, Liverpool should have been the last place to do it,” added Mr. Whitcombe, a former stuntman and body builder who can make his case like a seasoned politician. Resilience — some would say stubbornness — has long been considered a feature of this port city, historically enriched by commerce  but more recently battered by deindustrialization and unemployment. In the 1980s, economic decline brought some of the highest rates of joblessness in the country, riots and pockets of real deprivation, before more recent regeneration spurred recovery in the city, which has always had a strong sense of identity. None of that has made the city an easy testing ground for a new system of coronavirus rules that divides England into three tiers, with corresponding restrictions, depending on the seriousness of coronavirus infection rates. While the main aim was to reduce social contact, the government also hoped the system would allow schools to stay open and protect the economy as much as possible. The overarching imperative was to avoid a repetition of the full national lockdown that sent the economy into free fall earlier this year. Instead, the system has left many frustrated and confused, even as they acknowledge the gravity of the worsening health situation in Liverpool, whose mayor, Joe Anderson, lost a brother to Covid-19. One of the most blatant contradictions was the order to close gyms in Liverpool while those just miles away in Lancashire — also placed last week in the highest tier of restrictions — were allowed to operate. (The reverse was the case for indoor playgrounds.) There were other oddities. While there is a ban on people from different households mixing, pubs can stay open. The catch, however, is that they can only do so if they serve meals. According to Paul Brant, the Liverpool City Council member responsible for health, the risk is “incomprehension by the public, who then are less likely to follow the rules.” Mr. Brant is a member of the opposition Labour Party, which runs Liverpool, a city that has never been strong territory for the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. But Mr. Brant thinks that the government is guilty not only of bad politics but also of “terrible public health, because we cannot police our way out of this pandemic, we have to do it through public consent.” Right now, that has been strained — sometimes close to breaking point — though there is less consensus about who is to blame. “People in London are making decisions that they don’t really understand,” said Joanne Buckley, 34, as she worked out at the Body Tech Fitness gym, a converted cinema that contains a huge sign reading, “The People’s Gym.” Ms. Buckley acknowledged that government ministers and public health authorities were “in a very high-pressure situation, so I struggle to entirely blame them.” The dangers of Covid-19 are well known to her: She lost a family member to the disease. But she does not see a gym with good hygiene standards as a danger, and she said exercise helped her control a pain disorder. After days of argument with Mr. Whitcombe and local politicians, the government reversal over Liverpool’s gyms was announced in Parliament on Wednesday. But that does nothing for other businesses in the city, including the comedy club Hot Water, whose owners now feel their predicament matches the club’s name. In the effort to keep operating, the club has had to address a bewildering web of orders, each more damaging than the last. First, seating had to be reduced. Then, it was prohibited to sell drinks directly from the bar. Most recently, all sales of alcohol were banned because the club does not serve food. The club has kept customers informed through a blizzard of emails and in person. The reaction has not always been good. “You try explaining to people on a Saturday night, ‘You can’t get a drink, but you can get a nonalcoholic cider,’” said Binty Blair, a co-owner, as he prepared for another session that would go ahead with many of the seats unused. “It does not go down well,” he said. Some establishments have tried serving a token portion of food, perhaps a pizza slice, to circumvent the alcohol ban. But Mr. Blair rejected that idea. “I don’t see why I should pretend,” he said, noting that there were “people in town who are doing it — places where people are just ordering a dessert and they are leaving it on the table all night and they drink as much as they want.” He rejected the other alternative of closing down, because that would threaten the livelihoods of the staff and of the comedians who perform there. Although he said he was confident that the comedy club could survive and eventually recover — despite a loss in revenue of around 1 million pounds, or about $1.3 million, to date — Mr. Blair expressed fear for the vibrancy of a city whose nightlife famously launched the Beatles. “We rely on there being a scene. You can’t be the only thing — us surrounded by rubble,” Mr. Blair said. “Liverpool nightlife is that famous.” Balanced against such concerns are the health risks brought on by the rising level of infections. Health experts say they believe that the situation in Liverpool and in other northern cities is particularly acute because the virus was more prevalent there when national lockdown measures were lifted this year. Another factor cited is the structure of Liverpool’s economy, which is particularly strong in arts and culture, care homes, hospitality and tourism, sectors that involve a lot of face-to-face contact. It is also a university town, and the arrival of students from different parts of the country complicated matters further. Even before the students returned, the City Council called for a short but much deeper lockdown, accompanied by an economic support package, to try to slow the spread of the virus. That never happened, and some fear the outcome is the worst of all worlds. Waiting at Liverpool Central rail station, Hannah Rainford, a 22-year-old student, was skeptical that citizens would take much notice of regulations that allowed pubs to stay open but only if they served food. “So many people have been confused, and it is just such a mess,” she said. “I think people have their own rules now.”']",How a Liverpool gym led a local rebellion against the government’s inscrutable rules.
The virus has dimmed the Friday night lights of football in Texas.,2020-10-22,By Jeré Longman,"['During the summer, the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the Rio Grande Valley, in the southern tip of Texas along the border with Mexico. In July, ambulances lined up in a grim parade, waiting to drop patients at emergency rooms. Some funeral homes ordered refrigerated trucks to store bodies. As of Wednesday, more than 63,200 coronavirus cases had been reported and more than 3,200 people had died in the four counties that constitute the valley — more fatalities than in any of the urban centers of Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. The valley’s predominantly Latino population is among the poorest in Texas and among the most susceptible to the worst effects of the virus. During such a crisis, holding a football season might seem inconsequential. But the game is perhaps more urgent and galvanizing in Texas than anywhere else. As towns along or near the Rio Grande have shut off their Friday night lights, or left them flickering in uncertainty, there has been a sense of cultural casualty. In late August, the school district that includes Palmview High, La Joya High and Juarez-Lincoln High decided to cancel fall sports. But some parents and athletes protested, and in late September officials reconsidered. In the end, though, only Palmview decided to proceed with football — and only with severe limitations and precautions. Jeré Longman, a sports reporter for The New York Times, spoke to players, their families and coaches about the decision. “We have to be very cautious,” said Ernesto Lerma, an assistant coach for Palmview who, at 78, would be especially vulnerable to the virus. “This is a deadly disease.”']",
E.U. Says Veggie Burgers Can Keep Their Name,2020-10-23,By Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — When is a burger not a burger? When it contains no meat. At least according to a divisive proposal that was in front of the European Parliament this week, part of a set of measures that would have banned the use of terms like “steak,” “sausage,” “escallop” or “burger” on labels for plant-based alternative products. But after a decisive vote against the measure on Friday, it seems veggie burgers will still be on the menu. “Reason prevailed, and climate sinners lost,” Nikolaj Villumsen, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark posted on Twitter. “It’s worth celebrating with a veggie burger.” A proposal to expand a ban on descriptions such as “yogurt-style” or “cream imitation” for nondairy replacements did pass, extending previous limitations on the use of words like “milk” and “butter” on nondairy alternatives. The proposed changes — a small part of a package of agricultural measures — received more attention than perhaps desired either by their proponents among meat and livestock groups, who said they would prefer to focus on helping farmers work sustainably, or the environmentalists and food manufacturers opposing it, for whom it is a distraction from climate-change policy. Jasmijn de Boo, vice president of ProVeg International, a group aimed at reducing meat consumption, said that the proposal was not in the interest of consumers or manufacturers, and that shoppers were not confused by the labels currently on store shelves. “Why change something to a ‘veggie disc’ or ‘tube’ instead of a sausage?” she said. “It’s ridiculous.” Those in favor of the change said that labeling plant-based products with meat terms were misleading and could open the door for other confusing labels. “We simply call for the work of millions of European farmers and livestock sector workers to be acknowledged and respected,” Jean-Pierre Fleury, the chairman of Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest farming lobby group, said in a statement this month. He described the use of meatlike names for plant-based products as “cultural hijacking.” The decision is a victory for environmental advocates over an E.U. farming lobby that is one of the strongest voices in the bloc and plays an outsize role in policymaking, considering that the sector has been shrinking for years. Camille Perrin, the senior food policy officer at the European Consumer Organization, called decision “great news” and a “common sense” vote. “Consumers are in no way confused by a soy steak or chickpea-based sausage, so long as it is clearly labeled as vegetarian or vegan,” she said in a statement after the vote. “Terms such as ‘burger’ or ‘steak’ on plant-based items simply make it much easier for consumers to know how to integrate these products within a meal.” It is not the first debate over plant-based foods as that sector has exploded in recent years. Labels for plant-based dairy alternatives like “soy milk” or “tofu butter” are illegal in the bloc after dairy producers won a 2017 ruling backed by the European Court of Justice. In 2018, France banned the use of meat terms to describe vegetarian products. In dozens of states in the United States, advocates of vegetarian food have clashed with farmers and lobbyists over legislation that makes it illegal for plant-based products to be called meat. Several parties in the European Parliament had also submitted proposals with different caveats since the initial amendment was introduced, and those are still to be voted on. Manufacturers like Beyond Meat, Unilever and Ikea, along with the European Medical Association, have opposed the changes, which they described in an open letter as “disproportionate and out of step with the current climate.” Many said that approving the amendment would be counter to a goal set by the European Parliament this month to reduce carbon emissions 60\u2009percent by 2030. And shoppers seem to like the names. In a 2020 survey from the European Consumer Organization, about 42 percent of respondents said they believed “meaty” names for plant-based products should be permitted if products were clearly labeled vegetarian or vegan. Twenty-five percent said that such names should be banned. A spokesman for Copa-Cogeca said the organization did not believe that shoppers could not tell the difference between meat and plant-based products, and said that farmers were not against vegetable alternatives. But he said that differentiating the markets — much like those of butter and margarine — was among a host of initiatives that would support struggling farmers who are trying to adapt to a world more focused on sustainability. Some said the proposal would provide more fodder for what critics call the European Union’s penchant for overregulation. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, said the bloc should legislate only “where there are impediments to the free movement of goods, services, money and people.” He described the amendment as “overkill” that would bolster the arguments of those who campaigned for Britain’s exit from the bloc: “This is one of these symbolic sad cases — a bit like legislating on the curve of cucumbers.”']",The European Parliament voted on Friday on proposals that would have banned products without meat from being labeled burgers or sausages.
Forgotten on the presidential campaign: schools in crisis.,2020-10-22,By Abby Goodnough,"['For months now, the extraordinary challenges of schooling during the coronavirus pandemic have dominated life in communities large and small across the United States, yet the topic has not been at the forefront of the presidential campaign. Communities are battling over whether and how to reopen schools closed since March. Superintendents are warning of drastic budget cuts on the horizon. Teachers’ unions are calling for standardized tests to be canceled for a second straight year. And millions of children are learning remotely — with little known about the long-term effects on their intellectual growth. Yet none of this has been a big campaign talking point for either President Trump or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “It should really be a pivotal topic,” said Kisha Hale, principal of the upper grades at Eagle Academy Public Charter School in Washington. Just this week, parents in one major city school system — Boston’s — had hopes dashed that their pre-K and kindergarten children might soon find themselves back in the classroom. With cases rising, the city put a hold on its school reopening plans and even ended what little in-person teaching there already was, for so-called high-needs students. It was a microcosm of the disarray across the country as school districts try to get back to normal, or something resembling it. Several recent polls have suggested that the issue is a leading concern for many voters. With the lives of schoolchildren upended across the country, the presidential campaign’s lack of focus on the issue has frustrated parents and educators alike. The subject of school reopening is not a major theme of either candidate’s ad campaigns, and it got less than a minute of airtime at the first debate between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump last month. Nor is it among the topics that Kristen Welker of NBC News plans to question them on at Thursday’s debate, though “Fighting Covid-19” is. To the dismay of parents and educators, the discussion has been limited partly because states and local districts have a larger role than the federal government in running — and funding — schools. When Mr. Trump brings up schools at rallies, he can generally be counted on to say that he will fight for school choice and protect charter schools. And he has consistently called for schools to reopen, threatening at one point to withhold federal funds from districts that resist. But he has said little to nothing about the role of federal funding in helping districts reopen safely. Mr. Biden has presented ideas on how and when school districts should reopen. But he has not addressed the divisions that exist within his own party about what conditions need to be in place before sending students and teachers back to classrooms. Nor has either campaign put forth ideas on improving remote learning, or on how colleges should handle the return to campuses — deeply relevant issues to huge slices of the electorate.']",
"France, Waging a Crackdown, Honors a Teacher and Depicts a Plot in Beheading",2020-10-21,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Two teenagers were paid about $350 to identify a teacher who was later decapitated outside the suburban school where he worked, a prosecutor said Wednesday, as officials continued to investigate a killing that has set off a wave of national mourning, tributes to the teacher, and a broad government crackdown against Muslim individuals and groups. The national homage continued Wednesday as President Emmanuel Macron eulogized the slain teacher, Samuel Paty, calling him a “quiet hero” in a solemn evening ceremony at the Sorbonne in Paris. Mr. Paty, who was killed Friday, was also awarded France’s highest civilian honor, the Legion d’Honneur. The special antiterrorism prosecutor, Jean-François Ricard, unveiled the new findings in the inquiry on Wednesday as part of a probe into what he termed a “terrorist murder conspiracy.” That designation suggests officials are attempting to cast a broad net and don’t view the suspect, Abdoullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old Chechen immigrant, as merely a lone-wolf killer, an approach that dovetails with the government’s view that the killing reflects a menacing surge of militant Islamism. That, in their view, has justified dozens of raids all over France, the closure of a prominent mosque, the shutting down of Muslim aid organizations and the mass expulsion of foreigners identified in government antiterrorism files. The right and the anti-immigrant far right have been pushing for even stiffer measures, and Mr. Macron is facing a tough re-election in 2022. Mr. Macron’s prime minister, Jean Castex, was forced to get up in Parliament several times on Tuesday to assert the government’s toughness in facing down Islamists, even as representatives on the right booed him. Criticism of the crackdown among French Muslims has been muted, most likely as the country has been swept up in nationalism after Mr. Paty’s killing. Several figures who have been critical of past government action against Muslims were reluctant to talk when reached by a reporter. The teenagers, students at the school, are among seven people being investigated in connection with the killing of Mr. Paty. They include two young friends of Mr. Anzorov who officials said helped him buy the knife and drove him to the school outside Paris. Mr. Anzorov was shot and killed by the police shortly after the attack. The teacher was targeted for having shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the same images at the origin of the massacre on the magazine’s premises in 2015. Mr. Anzorov hung around the school Friday afternoon, enlisting students to help him identify Mr. Paty. He told the students he wanted to confront the teacher to “force an apology for having used the caricatures of the prophet, to humiliate him, to beat him,” Mr. Ricard said. These students tried to hide from surveillance cameras and a police car, he said. Shortly before 5 p.m., several students, including the two who had been paid, pointed out Mr. Paty as he emerged from the middle school, College du Bois d’Aulne in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Mr. Ricard said. Mr. Anzorov followed him and killed him in the street, posting a picture of his severed head online, officials say. Another man being questioned, identified by the government as Brahim C., was said to be the parent of a student at the school. He had posted a video and vehement online objections to Mr. Paty’s use of the caricatures, and was contacted by Mr. Anzorov after the posting, Mr. Ricard said. Also being investigated is a man described by the French security services as an anti-Semitic militant, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who, in Mr. Ricard’s telling, had egged on Brahim C. Mr. Sefrioui made a video in front of the school before the killing in which he called Mr. Paty a “thug teacher” who had been called on by President Macron to “hate, fight, and stigmatize Muslims.” There is a “direct line of causality between their actions and the death of Samuel Paty,” Mr. Ricard said. “It’s clear that the teacher was singled out by name as a target on the social networks by these two men, through their maneuvers, and their reinterpretation of the facts.” Mr. Sefrioui’s activist organization, Collectif Cheikh Yassine, was disbanded by the government Wednesday. Mr. Paty’s killing, the prosecutor said, took place “in a context of appeals to murder” which were in the air after the republication of the caricatures during the trial of Charlie Hebdo suspects that began in September. He noted that media organs linked to Al Qaeda had recently called for the “murder” of those who disseminated the Charlie Hebdo caricatures. On Tuesday, the French government shut down a large mosque in Pantin, north of Paris, for having shared Brahim C.’s video. That day, parliamentary deputies in the National Assembly stood on the building’s portico steps in a silent tribute, and marches and demonstrations were held throughout France. At the Sorbonne ceremony Wednesday, Mr. Paty’s coffin was carried by uniformed guards across the courtyard of the ancient university in front of dozens of invited officials. Several colleagues paid tribute to him. Mr. Macron said that Mr. Paty was “killed because he incarnated the republic, which is reborn every day, in every class. He was killed because the Islamists want our future and they know that with quiet heroes like him they will never have it.” A day earlier, Mr. Macron made an appearance in a troubled suburb of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis, to declare that “you’ve seen, in the last few days, dozens of concrete actions launched against groups, individuals, whose project is radical Islam.” The raids Monday resulted in a single arrest. Incidents here and there pointed to an increase in tension between France and its large Muslim community. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, a hard-liner who has been the public face of the government’s crackdown, said on television this week that he was “shocked” when he went into supermarkets and saw what he called “communitarian,” or Muslim-oriented, food products. On Tuesday, the Paris police arrested two women on charges of attacking two others near the Eiffel Tower Sunday night, yelling slurs and telling them “go back home” and “this is not your home,” according to a complaint filed by the lawyer of the women who were attacked. One of the women was seriously wounded, suffering a perforated lung. Antonella Francini contributed reporting.']","Two teenagers were paid about $350 to identify a teacher later decapitated outside his school.

Manslaughter Charge Urged for Israeli Officer in Killing of Autistic Palestinian,2020-10-21,By David M. Halbfinger and Adam Rasgon,"['JERUSALEM —\xa0Israeli prosecutors recommended on Wednesday that a police officer who shot and killed an unarmed Palestinian man with autism be charged with manslaughter in a case that became a rallying cry against police brutality. But the failure to seek a murder charge was met with outrage among Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel. Iyad al-Hallaq, 31, was shot along the Via Dolorosa during his morning walk to a school for adults with disabilities in Jerusalem’s Old City on May 30. His killing drew instant comparisons to that of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis five days earlier. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called the shooting a “tragedy” and urged a full investigation. Nevertheless, protesters demanding Mr. Netanyahu’s resignation over the past months have invoked Mr. al-Hallaq’s name and denounced police violence. And those demonstrations have, at times, been met with violent police crackdowns. Khairi al-Hallaq, the victim’s father, said Wednesday that he believed prosecutors had recommended a manslaughter charge only because the shooter was a Jew and the victim an Arab. Had it been the reverse, he said, the authorities would have urged a murder charge. He also complained that the commanding officer on the scene, who was closely involved, had been cleared. “There were two people involved in the crime, which means two people should be put on trial,” he said. Before any manslaughter charge is filed, it is subject to a hearing at which the accused officer can argue to have it reduced or dismissed. If convicted, he could face up to 12 years in prison, officials said. The accused officer’s lawyer, Efrat Nahmani Bar, has stressed her client’s youth — he is 19 — and inexperience. She said she was confident that prosecutors would drop the case entirely after a hearing. “That is the just thing to do,” she said. According to prosecutors, Mr. al-Hallaq, who lived just downhill from the Old City in East Jerusalem, aroused the suspicions of police at about 6 a.m. on a Saturday when, wearing black disposable gloves and a surgical mask because of the pandemic, he crossed under the 500-year-old Lions Gate on his way to school. Without being more specific, prosecutors said that “certain characteristics” of Mr. al-Hallaq’s behavior led two officers, watching him from a distance, to identify him as a potential “terrorist.” When he did not heed their orders to stop, they gave chase, and other officers joined in. One of them, a 21-year-old commander who was to leave the force within days, shot twice at Mr. al-Hallaq’s feet while pursuing him but missed. Mr. al-Hallaq then turned into a fenced-in area used by sanitation workers where, according to witnesses, he cowered in a corner. Among those looking on was one of the teachers from his school. The teacher has said that she yelled to the officers that Mr. al-Hallaq was disabled and posed no threat. When the 19-year-old officer, who had completed his basic training only a few weeks earlier, arrived and spotted Mr. al-Hallaq in the corner, he shot him once in the abdomen, prosecutors said, even as his commander shouted at him to hold his fire. After the commander again shouted at the younger officer to hold his fire, prosecutors said, the younger officer shouted at Mr. al-Hallaq, in Hebrew, not to move. One of the officers then asked Mr. al-Hallaq, in Arabic, “Where is the gun?” prosecutors said. When he did not answer, the officer asked the teacher the same question, to which she replied, “What gun?” At that point, the younger officer fired a second shot at Mr. al-Hallaq, prosecutors said. An autopsy determined that he was shot twice in the torso. Both the 19-year-old and his commander were performing their compulsory military service in the Border Police, a paramilitary arm of the Israeli police that operates on the West Bank, in parts of Jerusalem and in other volatile settings. Israeli law forbids publishing the officers’ names. Explaining their recommendation, the prosecutors said the 19-year-old’s actions were reckless, adding that he had ignored his commander’s repeated orders not to shoot and that Mr. al-Hallaq had posed no danger. They said the officer could have used a more proportional response. As mitigating factors, they pointed to the police’s suspicion that Mr. al-Hallaq was an attacker and the fact that the shooting occurred “in a complex sector” — a euphemism for an area that is a frequent flashpoint of violence between Arabs and Jews. But Arab lawmakers denounced the prosecutors’ reasoning as too forgiving. “Shooting a person in cold blood in a trash room is not ‘manslaughter,’” Yousef Jabareen, an Israeli lawmaker from the predominantly Arab political faction known as the Joint List, wrote on Twitter. “It’s murder. Justice for Iyad al-Hallaq.” Mr. al-Hallaq’s mother, Rana al-Hallaq, expressed her anguish after leaving a meeting where officials of the Department of Police Investigations, the Justice Ministry unit responsible for addressing police misconduct, informed her of their decision. “They destroyed our family. They destroyed us,” she told reporters. “What could an autistic boy do?”']","Palestinians assail the failure to recommend a murder charge in the case, which has become a cause célèbre in the fight against police brutality."
"For Italy’s masked rap diva, an era of face coverings poses a dilemma.",2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz,"['When the pandemic first hit Italy and masks became scarce, Myss Keta, the mysterious Queen of the Milan Night, came to the rescue. The Italian rapper, performance artist and L.G.B.T.Q. icon had amassed a vast collection of face coverings that she wore for years to hide her identity. So she began distributing them to her friends in need. “I had so many,” she said. “Surgical, cloth, vinyl, silk, whatever material.” This month, with a second wave of the coronavirus rising and Italy requiring the wearing of masks in public at all times, grandparents, politicians, middle-management businesspeople, doctors, lawyers, delivery people — just about everyone — is covering up. That has rendered Myss Keta — whose use of masks took her from underground clubs to the cusp of national, if incognito, celebrity — an improbable authority on life behind the surgical veil. It has also threatened to strip her of her defining shtick. “Before, it was a distinguishing characteristic. Now, it’s something we all have in common,” she said as she lifted a black surgical mask — the casual black T-shirt of her vast collection — to sip a Bloody Mary at Bar Basso in  Milan. Under her trademark blond bangs, her eyes remained covered as usual in dark Givenchy sunglasses. It used to be only the front-row fans at her concerts who emulated her by wearing masks. “Now, everyone seems like a Myss fan,” she said.']",
"A resurgent virus attacks the heartland, just before the election.",2020-10-23,"By Eileen Sullivan, Albert Sun, Sarah Mervosh and Rebecca Halleck","['The latest coronavirus surge is raging across the American heartland, most acutely in the Midwest and Mountain West. This harrowing third surge, which led to a U.S. single-day record of more than 85,000 new cases on Friday, is happening less than two weeks from Election Day, which will mark the end of a campaign dominated by the pandemic and President Trump’s much-criticized response to it. As of Friday evening, 15 states had added more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch of the pandemic: Wisconsin, a battleground in the presidential election, Colorado, Kentucky, Illinois, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, Alaska, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and North Dakota. And four states had added more deaths in the past week than in previous weeks: Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota and Oklahoma. North Dakota leads the nation in coronavirus cases per capita. Illinois is averaging more than 4,400 new cases per day, up 90 percent from the average two weeks ago. And Pennsylvania, another battleground state, on Friday reported a record of 2,258 cases. The virus will be front of mind for voters in several key states, including Ohio, where more people are hospitalized than at any other time during the pandemic, and Wisconsin, home to seven of the country’s 10 metro areas with the highest numbers of recent cases. On Friday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked Gov. Tony Evers’ emergency order restricting the size of indoor gatherings to 25 percent capacity. Citing a rise in hospitalizations across the state, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced a strengthening of coronavirus restrictions in certain counties, capping gatherings at 10 people from no more than two separate households. For the fourth straight day, Colorado on Saturday announced a single-day record for new cases (five more states also set records Saturday). Overnight, nearly 2,500 people were hospitalized in Illinois, the state’s top public health official, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, said in a news conference Friday afternoon. The mayor of Chicago, Lori E. Lightfoot, announced a curfew on nonessential businesses beginning at 10 p.m. on Friday. In the final presidential debate on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that the virus was “going away” as he defended his management of the pandemic. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, attacked Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis, calling for much more aggressive federal action for the “dark winter” ahead. Mr. Trump and many supporters blame restrictions on business activity, often imposed by Democratic governors and mayors, for prolonging the economic crisis initially caused by the virus. But the experience of states like Iowa, which recently set a record for patients hospitalized with Covid-19, shows the economy is far from back to normal even in Republican-led states that have imposed few business restrictions. Iowa was one of only a handful of states that never imposed a full stay-at-home order. Restaurants, movie theaters, hair salons and bars were allowed to reopen starting in May, earlier than in most states. Many businesses worry they won’t be able to make it through the winter without more help from Congress. Others have already failed. Defying the guidance of infectious disease experts, who say that universal masking and social distancing are essential to limiting the virus’s spread, has eroded support for both Mr. Trump and Gov. Kim Reynolds in Iowa, especially among voters over 65, normally a solid Republican constituency, according to public and private polls. Mr. Trump and Senator Joni Ernst — whose seat could play a decisive role in determining control of the Senate — are both in tight races in a state that the president easily won four years ago.']",
Trump continues to take swipes at pandemic-stricken New York.,2020-10-23,By Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Maggie Haberman,"['In the final weeks of the presidential race, President Trump cannot seem to stop harping on New York City. “Look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town,” he said at the debate on Thursday night. “For so many years I loved it, it was vibrant. It’s dying, everyone is leaving New York.” For the president, belittling New York seems to serve two purposes: It appeals to his base as a campaign strategy, and allows him to address personal scores with his foes. While many New Yorkers feel that Mr. Trump has turned his back on the city, the feeling is mutual with Mr. Trump. The city overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There were protests when he returned to Trump Tower. His name was stripped from skyscrapers. Democratic prosecutors in New York are digging into his family’s finances, and Democratic leaders, like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, frequently accuse him of betraying his hometown. The president is now balking at granting New York more coronavirus recovery funds, despite entreaties from Representative Peter T. King to reconsider. But the constant taunting from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio — including painting “Black Lives Matter” on the street in front of Trump Tower — does not help, Mr. King said. In May, Mr. Trump said that he would visit New York City, where more than 20,000 people have died from the coronavirus, “when things calm down.” He has not done so. Jesse Garcia, a county Republican leader on Long Island, said Mr. Trump had shown his love for the city by providing relief funds through the $2 trillion CARES Act in March and sending the Navy hospital ship U.S.N.S. Comfort to the city, along with the Army Corps of Engineers.']",
Here’s a look at Vermont’s approach to the virus.,2020-10-23,,"['In today’s edition of the Morning newsletter, David Leonhardt writes: The coronavirus is spreading more rapidly in rural areas of the U.S. than in urban areas. But one rural state continues to do a fabulous job keeping the virus away: Vermont. The starkest sign of Vermont’s success is that it has not recorded a single Covid-19 death in more than two months. Vermont is succeeding partly because it has not allowed the virus to become a partisan issue. The Republican governor, Phil Scott — unlike many other Republican politicians around the country — has consistently told people to take the virus seriously. “He started wearing a mask early in the pandemic and has stood at the back of the room in many of the state’s coronavirus briefings, letting Dr. Mark Levine, Vermont’s answer to Dr. Anthony Fauci, dominate proceedings,” Bill McKibben, a Vermont resident, wrote in The New Yorker. Vermont also benefits from having a high degree of social trust among its residents, as Maria Sacchetti explained in The Washington Post. And Vermont has two strong local media organizations — VTDigger and Seven Days — that keep residents informed and that both took an intriguing step early in the pandemic, McKibben notes: They shut down their comments sections, to prevent misinformation from spreading.']",
Swimming to Sanity in Melbourne’s Lockdown,2020-10-23,By Yan Zhuang,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Yan Zhuang, a new reporter with the Australia bureau. As Melbourne fights its way out of one of the longest and strictest coronavirus lockdowns in the world, outdoor pools have been one of the few facilities allowed to reopen. The week that my local pool opened, the weather was miserable with temperatures below the 60s, but every time slot was still booked full days in advance. Even in its second week of operation, the only available time was 6 a.m. — which is how I ended up stifling my yawn as we filed into the center with the sky still dark. I’m pretty apathetic toward pools — why bother, when we’re surrounded by some of the best beaches in the world? But they’re embedded in my childhood. Upon moving to Australia from China, my parents diligently signed me up for lessons at the local pool to make sure I fit in with the other kids. Primary and high school were marked by yearly swimming carnivals, during which I usually sat as far away from the action as possible and caught up on homework. Still, I jumped on this opportunity, eager for something to break up the monotony of lockdown life. It felt like an adventure to venture outside the four walls of my house and the well-trodden path to the supermarket that my world has narrowed down to in the past few months. Precautions were in place. When booking, I had to confirm that I didn’t have any coronavirus symptoms. Each swimmer’s temperature was taken upon entering the center. We couldn’t use the change rooms or showers. We had 50 minutes to swim, after which the center staff would spend 10 minutes sanitizing the pool. The scent of chlorine hit my nose as I slipped into the bath-warm water. I had to stop halfway through my first lap to take a breather — apparently the daily walks I’ve been taking haven’t been as effective at keeping me fit as I’d hoped. My lane-mate and I commiserated over how out of shape we were although she still managed two laps for every one that I swam. Like many, my roommate far prefers the beach to the pool. When I mentioned where I was going, she commented: “The warm water — body temperature — reminds you of what other bodily fluids are circulating in there.” She’s not wrong. It’s a far cry from the bracing chill and crashing waves of the beaches that backdrop Australian life. The sanitized stillness of the pool is a poor substitute for sinking your feet into soft sand as wind stings your eyes and feeling like you’re standing at the edge of the world. It feels like a partial freedom, like so many things in Melbourne these days. Even with the weekend’s easing of restrictions, our lives are still limited. We’re now able to travel 25 kilometers from home instead of just 5 kilometers. Up to 10 people from two households can now meet outdoors. But for people like my roommate and I, whose friends mostly come from households of one or two, this doesn’t make much of a difference. Police drones will still hover in our skies this weekend to ensure no one is holding big celebrations for the AFL grand final (Victoria’s Super Bowl). I still jump at every notification on my phone, fearing and anticipating news of another outbreak that would send restrictions crashing back down. And yet, as the water closes around me, it’s easy to forget about all that for a moment and just concentrate propelling myself forward, lungs burning and muscles aching. I find myself marking our progress out of lockdown by cataloging the reintroduction of mundane activities as a series of “firsts,” a chain of bright archipelagos rising out of a dark sea. Seeing a friend in person for the first time after months of video chat. Stepping foot outside my suburb again and reveling in the change of scenery. Getting a haircut for the first time since January. And going for a swim as the sky floods with pink and orange light.

Reviving his Borat character and playing the political activist Abbie Hoffman, the actor feels he “had to ring the alarm bell and say that democracy is in peril this year.” In last week’s newsletter, we asked readers for their reactions to the daily news conferences from Victoria Premier Dan Andrews. We received a flood of responses. Here’s a small sample: Locked in our homes 22 hours a day with Netflix binges over, with all our books read twice, gardens now cleared places where weeds are afraid to pop up, we have reluctantly watched most of them. Andrews’ press calls have been robotic, mesmerizing, ritualistic and predictable — until Sky News Commentator Peta Credlin (previous Prime Minister’s chief of staff) started turning the screws on Dan during his daily monologues. Watching him then grow red in the face, his expression turn to anger and his brilliant non-answers and deflections in self-defense have started to become entertainment. We are more horrified by the thought of having him as Premier for another two years than catching COVID. — Susan Salopayevs Whether or not you agree with him, it’s comforting to see a leader take the heat and deliver the real news every morning. It’s almost masochistic to watch him throw himself to the wolves (journalists) whose jobs it is, of course, to catch him out (and for some, to frustrate and irritate to get a reaction). Sometimes he delivers, but most times he reacts like a school principal or an over-involved father and maintains his temper while explaining himself as clearly as he can. I don’t always agree with him, but appreciate his ability to put himself out there every day to a sometimes angry mob and explain his work and decisions. — Amanda Spagnolo I am from the left side of politics, and before all our lives changed forever, I was moderately impressed by Dan Andrews’ performance as Premier. However, I am not impressed by the way he has handled this crisis. He has relied far too much on policing and public shaming. He has belittled the mental health impacts of the lockdown. He has also failed to acknowledge the starkly unequal effects of the lockdown, in terms of class, race and gender. But what has really appalled and shocked me is the cult like following around Andrews, a cult that he has actively encouraged. Melbourne is now bitterly divided. And criticism of any aspect of the lockdown is seen as treasonous. Families and friendships have split asunder over this issue. Dan Andrews, like Fidel Castro, is now clearly addicted to his daily press conferences. When will he ever shut up, and delegate some of his responsibilities? Hopefully Melbourne can heal after the trauma of one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world. But I am not sure if the cruelty and racism that were so casually displayed will ever be forgotten. — Fia Clendinnen Enjoying the Australia Letter? Sign up here or forward to a friend.

"Edward Snowden, in Russia Since 2013, Is Granted Permanent Residency",2020-10-23,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Edward J. Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor whose 2013 leaks of top-secret documents set off a worldwide debate about government surveillance, is now a permanent resident of Russia. Mr. Snowden, 37, has been living in exile in Moscow since 2013, when he fled to the Russian capital after giving journalists access to a trove of National Security Agency documents detailing the American intelligence service’s mass surveillance programs. On Thursday, the country’s immigration authorities granted Mr. Snowden permanent residency, his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, wrote on Facebook. Mr. Kucherena posted a photograph of himself standing next to a smiling Mr. Snowden, in a dark red shirt and a black suit jacket, holding a blue, passport-style permanent residency document emblazoned with the Russian coat of arms. “People ask me if Edward is planning on getting Russian citizenship,” Mr. Kucherena wrote. “For now, he has not told me this. He describes his end goal as being a return to the United States, but only if he is guaranteed a fair trial.” There was no comment from Mr. Snowden himself on his newfound permanent residency. President Trump said in August that he would “take a very good look at” a pardon for the former intelligence contractor. Mr. Snowden told the German newspaper Die Zeit last month that he was encouraged by Mr. Trump’s comments, even if no pardon was imminent. “It’s a continued normalization of the conversation about this,” Mr. Snowden said, referring to a possible pardon in the United States. “Realistically, I think we are still early in the phase of that.” Changes last year to Russia’s immigration law that have made it easier for foreigners to get permanent residency cleared the path for Mr. Snowden to stay in the country for as long as he wanted. Several prominent Western supporters of President Vladimir V. Putin — including the American actor Steven Seagal and the French actor Gérard Depardieu — have already gone further and received Russian citizenship. But Mr. Snowden is a special case. He is both a living symbol of Mr. Putin’s relish in needling the United States and a hero to many who say he laid bare breathtaking abuse by American intelligence agencies of the power to monitor the online activity of people around the world. In Moscow, Mr. Snowden has led both a mysterious and active lifestyle. He keeps his specific location and movements a secret, but chimes in on online privacy issues on his Twitter account, published a memoir last year and, before the pandemic, often appeared at technology conferences via video link. He has married his American girlfriend, learned Russian and describes Moscow as a “beautiful city.” In the United States, intelligence officials and politicians from both parties have said Mr. Snowden was working with Russian intelligence agencies. Mr. Snowden has denied those accusations, and he has at times lobbed veiled criticism at Mr. Putin; after the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny in August, Mr. Snowden on Twitter called it a possible “crime against the whole of Russia.” “The sad reality is that even in the United States, targeted killings are happening frequently,” Mr. Snowden elaborated in the interview with Die Zeit. “It’s just the means that’s different.” Mr. Snowden was referring to targeted killings of terrorism suspects around the world by American drones. Of Mr. Navalny’s case, Mr. Snowden said: “There needs to be an investigation, and anyone involved needs to go to jail.” The pandemic delayed Mr. Snowden’s residency permit application, his lawyer said, and it appears to have made the exile’s life in Moscow even more cloistered than it already was. When Moscow was under lockdown in April and May, the city authorities required residents to obtain a digital permit for almost any trip outside. Mr. Snowden told Die Zeit he never once sought such a permit because he disagreed with the government’s brute-force approach to keeping people inside their homes. “The politics of the place are as troubled as ever but the people are fundamentally good people,” Mr. Snowden said of Russia. “As I would say in many countries, it is never the people you have to worry about, it’s always the government.” Mr. Kucherena, Mr. Snowden’s Russian lawyer, is also chairman of the Public Chamber of the Russian Interior Ministry, which plays an advisory role with the country’s top law-enforcement body. On Thursday, alongside his note on Facebook announcing Mr. Snowden’s permanent residency, Mr. Kucherena also posted a picture of a gift he had received from his client to commemorate the occasion. It was a photograph of Mr. Snowden and Mr. Kucherena exiting the transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo after Russia granted him asylum in August 2013. The photograph is captioned in Russian: “With thanks for the years of freedom.”']",The former intelligence contractor still hopes to return to the United States. But the Russian authorities have given him the right to stay in Russia indefinitely.
"Turning 100, a Former Spanish Soldier Laments the Curse of His Birth Year",2020-10-24,By Raphael Minder,"['CARDEDEU, Spain — Andreu Canet turns 100 next month. And his birth year, as it turned out, was a curse. Having been drafted into Spain’s Republican army at 17, he is now a rare survivor of a contingent of about 27,000 soldiers dubbed the “baby bottle conscription.” They were all born in 1920 and called up by the Republican government in 1938 to replenish the army’s ranks as it prepared a last-ditch attempt to stop Gen. Francisco Franco from winning the country’s civil war. This July, as he has done every year for the past three decades, Mr. Canet made his annual journey to a peace monument built on hilltops near the Ebro river — the site of a major counterattack launched by Republican troops in July 1938. The already difficult pilgrimage was made even harder by the pandemic. And for the first time, he said, he was the only one who turned up on the day of the commemoration. “Perhaps I’m in fact the only one left alive by now,” he said wistfully. Mr. Canet’s story is just one chapter in a civil war legacy that Spain is still trying to come to terms with. In September, the government led by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez presented a draft bill aimed at reviving and extending a 2007 law to facilitate the opening of more than 2,000 mass graves scattered across Spain and to identify the remains of those inside. Most are believed to have died during or just after the war, which took place from 1936 to 1939. The government also wants to close down any venture or institution that glorifies Franco’s dictatorship, and to revamp the giant underground mausoleum from which his remains were exhumed last year and transferred to a cemetery where his family already had a crypt. Looking back on the war, Mr. Canet said he was utterly unprepared for battle when he was drafted at 17. “We had to bring our own clothing and a blanket, and I fought in my espadrilles because my family was simply too poor to afford shoes,” he recalled in a recent interview in his apartment in Cardedeu, about 25 miles northeast of Barcelona. “We got zero training and zero instructions about what we would be doing, and I, of course, had never seen the Ebro until I was told to get across it.” Their crossing of the river, which slices across northwestern Spain, enabled the Republicans to regain some of the territory that Franco had conquered. But under heavy bombing by German and Italian planes flown by his fascist allies, the Republican advance soon ground to a halt, and the fighting turned into the war’s longest, largest and most deadly battle. While historians have offered different numbers, most estimate a death toll of at least 20,000 soldiers from both sides during the nearly four months that the battle endured. Once the Republican forces were pushed back across the Ebro, Franco secured his victory, which then paved the way for a dictatorship that lasted until his death in 1975. Mr. Canet, whose 100th birthday is Nov. 30, said he could still vividly remember both the trench warfare that followed the treacherous river crossing and the aftermath of the conflict. He spent the first part of the postwar period in a military hospital recovering from typhoid, which he probably caught while stationed on a rat-infested islet in the middle of the Ebro. “The rats kept crawling over my face when I was trying to sleep,” he said. He shunned any notion of heroism and said that his military promotion, eventually to the rank of sergeant, reflected more a shortage of officer candidates than his own merits. “When we captured our first hill,” he recalled, “what I really remember is how tired and thirsty I was, being even forced to drink my own urine, and how little sense of pride there was when so many others had already died.” He teared up when recalling the cruelty of some of his commanders, who once threatened to shoot him for falling asleep during a night watch. After surrendering to Franco’s troops, Mr. Canet was conscripted again — but this time into military service in Franco’s army. His battalion, based in the northern city of Burgos, was filled with defeated Republicans. “The war had been horrible,” Mr. Canet said, “but so then was my military service under officers who hated us, while suffering the humiliation of marching through villages where children spat at our feet.” And although Mr. Canet was the only one who showed up for this year’s commemoration, Víctor Amela, a writer who recently published a book about the conscription, said the veteran was probably not the only surviving member of the “baby bottlers.” Mr. Amela estimates that there are about a dozen survivors left, most of them living in the Catalonia region. He said that the monument near the Ebro, erected in 1989, had been financed by former soldiers and their families because “the Spanish state has sadly refused to look back and confront the legacy of our civil war, let alone offer an apology to a bunch of children who were forced to fight in it.” The “baby bottle” conscription showed “the most miserable side of a very ugly war,” Mr. Amela said, as most of the enlisted teenagers came from poor families without the personal connections that allowed others to avoid the draft. “I feel that it is a crime that a government sent 17-year-olds to an almost certain death, in full knowledge of how superior Franco was by this late stage of the war.” Once Mr. Canet finally returned to civilian life in late 1943, he worked in a factory that made fountain pens and then set up his own shop in the entrance hall of one of Barcelona’s subway stations, where he sold and repaired pens, lighters and watches. Until he grew more frail, Mr. Canet said, he enjoyed visiting schools to tell children about the experiences of the “baby bottle conscription” in hopes of keeping the soldiers’ memory alive. But he is unimpressed by the government’s latest attempts to set right the historical record of the war. “It just all feels too late,” he said. “The current generation has no idea what the war was really like, and no government has actually ever done anything for us.”']","Andreu Canet is one of the last survivors of the “baby bottle conscription.” Born in 1920, they were drafted as teenagers in an ill-fated bid to stop Franco from winning Spain’s civil war."
Bangkok Is Engulfed by Protests. What’s Driving Them?,2020-10-24,By Richard C. Paddock and Emmett Lindner,"['BANGKOK — Protests in Thailand that began as a student-led revolt against the military’s influence on the classroom have ballooned to encompass a sweeping range of issues at the heart of the country’s deep-rooted social and economic disparities. The growing crowds of demonstrators who have been assembling for weeks at peaceful protests across the country have made three primary demands, encapsulated by the slogan “Resign, Rewrite, Reform.” They are calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief and the architect of a 2014 coup; the overhaul of a Constitution he pushed through that took power from citizens and created an appointed Senate; and bringing the monarchy under the purview of the Constitution. As the protests have grown, Mr. Prayuth has adopted a more conciliatory approach. But the protesters appear to be unmoved. Thailand ended its absolute monarchy and established itself as a constitutional monarchy in 1932. But its political system has never found stability for long. The military has played a key role in politics, with a dozen successful coups against elected leaders, most recently in 2006 and 2014. The country is now on its 20th Constitution. The monarchy is protected by Thailand’s powerful lese-majeste law, which can bring a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for making statements deemed critical of members of the royal family. Laws on sedition and criminal defamation, as well as a computer crimes law that governs online content, can also be used to limit free speech. The protesters: They are mostly students, including many in high school, who are unaligned with earlier anti-government factions. Many initially chafed at military-style school rules over their behavior and attire. That dissatisfaction has grown into a broader challenge to the government, the military and the monarchy. A three-finger salute signifying silent rebellion, taken from the “Hunger Games” films, has become a symbol of defiance. The protests started in Bangkok and have spread to other provinces. The prime minister: As the head of the army in 2014, then-General Prayuth led a coup that ousted a democratically elected government. He has remained as the head of government since then. He pushed through a new Constitution that took effect in 2017, weakening the power of political parties in Parliament, allowing for an appointed Senate and ensuring continued military influence over the government. A newly constituted Parliament elected him prime minister in 2019. Now 66, Mr. Prayuth has refused protesters’ demands that he resign and has called on Parliament to help resolve the conflict. The king: Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, 68, one of the world’s richest men, ascended to the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for seven decades. Since becoming king, Maha Vajiralongkorn has continued to spend most of his time in Germany, returning to Thailand for relatively short periods. He has asserted his authority by taking personal control of the crown assets and by requesting changes to the Constitution after voters ratified it in a junta-controlled 2016 referendum. The royalists: Supporters of the monarchy, often identifiable by their yellow shirts, have taken to the streets in smaller numbers to counter the student protesters, sometimes clashing with them. Protesters have posted videos online that they say show royalists attacking them.  They are calling on Mr. Prayuth to resign, for the Constitution to be revised and for the king to come under the Constitution’s authority.  They also call for the dissolution of Parliament, the same body that chose Mr. Prayuth as prime minister and that he has called on to resolve the current conflict. Their boldest demand is to limit the power of the monarchy, which has seldom faced a challenge in the last 88 years. Among other steps, they want the king to return control of the crown assets, worth tens of billions of dollars, and to relinquish direct control over certain Thai Army units. The plaque: In September, thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok at the biggest pro-democracy rally yet. Afterward, a group placed a plaque near the royal palace that displayed the three-finger salute and read, “At this place, the people have expressed their will that this country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarchy, as they have deceived us.” Officials removed the plaque soon after. The queen’s motorcade: During an Oct. 14 protest in Bangkok, a limousine carrying Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya unexpectedly drove past a crowd of protesters. Some yelled “My taxes” and gave the three-finger salute. Several protesters were later arrested and could face harsh penalties under an obscure law that prohibits “an act of violence against the queen’s liberty.” The government issued an emergency decree that banned gatherings of more than four people and authorized sanctions on media outlets deemed to have disseminated false information. Water cannons deployed: As thousands of protesters occupied commercial streets in Bangkok on Oct. 16, the police dispersed them with water cannons, spraying liquid that contained blue dye and a chemical irritant. Appalled by this tactic, demonstrators ignored the emergency decree and turned out in even bigger numbers for rallies in the following days. Mr. Prayuth revoked the emergency decree on Oct. 22, a day after acknowledging that Thailand would not become “a better society through the use of water cannon.” Richard C. Paddock reported from Bangkok and Emmett Lindner from New York. Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Bangkok.']",Rebellious youths. A history of coups.

She Was in Labor. Floodwaters Were Rising. Then the Boat Tipped Over.,2020-10-23,By Chau Doan and Mike Ives,"['HANOI, Vietnam — It was no time to travel, but when Nguyen Dac Minh’s wife went into labor, he put her on his motorbike and rode toward the hospital. Floodwaters that had killed scores across Vietnam were rising ominously around their village. At a washed-out railway overpass, he hired a man to ferry them in a small boat. But strong winds carried away some of the baby clothes the couple had packed, and Mr. Minh waded into the water to retrieve them. Suddenly, the boat capsized in the fast-moving current. His wife, Hoang Thi Phuong, a 35-year-old cancer survivor, was just out of reach, and she was swept away by water turned brown by loosened sediment. “Everything happened right in front of my eyes, but I couldn’t save her,” he said by phone on Thursday. “All I could do was scream.” Video from the scene in Thua Thien Hue Province has ricocheted across social media, generating an outpouring of grief and sympathy nationwide. Ms. Phuong, a mother of two, was one of at least 114 people killed this month in record-shattering floods that have pummeled Vietnam’s central coast. Twenty-one people remain missing. More than a quarter of the deaths have been attributed to landslides. One killed at least 20 military personnel last weekend in the central province of Quang Tri, a prime theater of battle during the Vietnam War. It is believed to have been the country’s largest military loss in peacetime. Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, president of the Vietnam Red Cross Society, said the floods were among the worst the aid group had seen in decades. “Everywhere we look, homes, roads and infrastructure have been submerged,” she said. Storms are a fact of life in Vietnam, with its 2,000-mile coastline. Typhoons lash central provinces during the rainy season, which begins in late summer. Tourists visiting Hoi An, a UNESCO World Heritage site on the central coast, are often surprised to see its narrow streets suddenly turn into Venice-like canals. Scientists have pointed to climate change as the main driver of more frequent and deadlier storms around the globe. The authorities in Vietnam tend to be well prepared for natural disasters, but a surge in cyclones, rains and floods this month has overwhelmed some coastal provinces. According to the United Nations, 178,000 homes in central Vietnam had been flooded as of Thursday. Vietnam’s foreign minister, Pham Binh Minh, said on Twitter this week that the country had “suffered a difficult time with huge losses.” Now, as rescuers scramble to reach other flood victims by land, air and sea, Vietnam is bracing for its third major storm in three weeks. Typhoon Saudel was moving through the South China Sea on Friday and was expected to make landfall on Sunday — in the same coastal areas where many villages are already underwater. The amount of rainfall this month was “so extraordinarily out of the normal” that it far exceeded the government’s midrange predictions of how climate change might increase precipitation in central Vietnam by the end of this century, said Pamela McElwee, a professor of human ecology at Rutgers University who studies environmental issues in Vietnam. Other countries in Asia have seen record-breaking rainfall. Earlier this year, torrential rains submerged at least a quarter of Bangladesh. Unusually heavy rains wreaked havoc in central and southwestern China, leaving hundreds dead and disrupting the economy’s post-pandemic recovery. Flooding in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal killed scores of people, destroyed homes and inundated entire villages. In Vietnam, heavy rains can be bad enough along the flat plains of the Red River, which flows southeast from the border with China through the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, before emptying into the sea. But in central Vietnam, where population centers are wedged between mountains and coastline, the potential for catastrophic flooding is that much higher. “The earth is just soaked with water and has nowhere to go,” Professor McElwee said. It hardly helps, she added, that tree cover is cleared in the mountains for hydropower dams, or that mountain roads are built in ways that weaken the soil. She added that the floods were a lesson for those who believe that building more infrastructure is a silver-bullet solution to the climate crisis. In the central province where Ms. Phuong and Mr. Minh scratched out a living, extreme weather is so common that it animates local folk sayings. “When it is hot, heaven burns the field like baking stones. When it rains, fields go rotten and sand starts to stink,” is a popular one. For years, the couple were too busy to worry much about the weather. He worked construction while she toiled on an assembly line in a garment factory. She also beat breast cancer. Last week, when Ms. Phuong went into labor, Mr. Minh fired up his motorbike, asking his brother-in-law to follow along on a separate bike with his wife’s luggage. When they reached the railway overpass, he hired a boat to take them across a flooded expanse to a taxi on the other side. After he climbed out of the boat to retrieve the baby clothes, it tipped his wife into the floodwaters. He was close enough to see her hands waving as the current pulled her under, he said. The authorities mobilized a search party of more than 100 people, but it was too late. Ms. Phuong’s body was found about 300 feet downstream. As of Friday, video of the search effort and Ms. Phuong’s funeral had been viewed more than a million times, and donations were pouring in for Mr. Minh and the couple’s daughter and son, now 12 and 13. In a video recorded at the site after the accident, on a patch of road by the water, Mr. Minh can be seen bending to the ground in a prayerlike position. “Oh my god,” he said. “My darling.” Chau Doan reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.']",A pregnant woman who drowned in Vietnam was one of at least 114 people killed in record-breaking floods that have pummeled the country’s central coast.
A Francophile’s Unexpected Love Affair With Canadian Wine,2020-10-23,By Dan Bilefsky,"['It began with grape-guzzling bears. I was on vacation in British Columbia’s pristinely beautiful Okanagan winemaking region this summer when I asked Severine Pinte, a French winemaker, to describe her biggest culture shock since arriving in Canada a decade ago. Her answer? The menacing black bears that climbed down from the mountains every September, around harvest time, and devoured rows of her precious grapes, forcing local wineries to employ electrified fences, pepper bombs or hunters. I immediately knew I was on to a story. The settlement of French winemakers in the area also seemed an encouraging sign of its potential.

Could the country that gave the world such delicacies as seal flipper pie, shmoo cake and poutine become the land of pinot noir, and enter the pantheon of famed winemaking regions like Bordeaux, Napa Valley and Tuscany? I have to confess, I approached the question with snobbery and skepticism. I equated great wine with the country of Voltaire. After all, my oenophilia had taken root while I was a Paris correspondent for The Times. Outside of work, I inhaled glasses of full-bodied Bordeaux wines in crowded Parisien bistros and relished traveling to French wine country. After I moved back to Montreal following nearly three decades in Europe, the sterile efficiency of my neighborhood’s state-run liquor store made me lonesome for my local Parisien wine merchant. There, I had been greeted with a hearty “Daniel!” The wine attendant knew my favorite vintages by heart and lovingly presented me bottles of St.-Joseph or Pomorol as if handing over his children. Nevertheless, in August, I traveled to the Okanagan Valley with an open mind. Like other Canadians, I had been desperate for a pandemic escape and had braved a nearly six-hour, masked flight to Vancouver, followed by a nearly five-hour drive to the region. But when I set eyes on the valley’s awe-inducing mountains and lakes, I momentarily forgot killer viruses. Then I tasted the wine. I experienced a coup de foudre — love at first sight. I was immediately seduced by the dark berry-infused boldness of Black Hills Estate winery’s Nota Bene red wine, as well as Le Vieux Pin’s elegant Violette Syrah and Little Engine Wines’s Platinum Pinot Noir. And even without my wine-induced buzz, the informality of jovial Canadian wine pilgrims in shorts and flip flops made the tastings less stodgy than some I had experienced in France. Possessed by the zeal of a new convert, I was dismayed to discover that most Okanagan wines weren’t easily available in the rest of Canada, including my native Montreal. I needed to find out: Why? The answer dumbfounded me — Prohibition era regulations continued to hold sway and most provinces still forbade individual consumers to order shipments of wine from other provinces. This being Canada, regionalism was also at play. At upmarket restaurants in food-obsessed Montreal, sommeliers were more likely to suggest a plucky Quebec wine or a French vintage than wine from faraway British Columbia (Some Quebecers like to use the acronym “ROC” to refer to the rest of Canada, as if citing a noxious foreign planet). When I asked the Okanagan wineries if I could order wine to Montreal, they explained, often in hushed whispers, that they got around the rules by using a medical supplies company and not labeling shipments as wine. I couldn’t help wondering if this frisson of subterfuge made the wine more enjoyable, like gaining access to an atmospheric speakeasy in New York City in the 1920s. As we gazed over the vineyard of Osoyoos Larose Estate winery, its chief winemaker, Caroline Schaller, explained to me that it was also challenging for Okanagan wines to gain traction nationwide, when low volumes of production kept prices relatively high. “You can find a drinkable bottle of Bordeaux wine in a Paris wine shop for $5,” she observed. In contrast, a glass of her Osoyoos Larose Le Grand Vin, can cost as much as $16 in an upmarket Vancouver restaurant. Nevertheless, the Okanagan Valley is gradually gaining a global following in perhaps unlikely places. Raphaël Merlaut is part of the family that founded France’s Groupe Taillan, which owns, among other things, Osoyoos Larose Estate winery and 21 châteaux in France. He told me that the creativity he observed in the Okanagan Valley made him feel like he was being transported in a time machine to Bordeaux in the 18th century. “For my family, B.C. wine is a love affair, like meeting a woman and falling in love,” he told me. “It’s a new frontier.” Ms. Pinte of Le Vieux Pin explained that the freedom of the Okanagan Valley had attracted her. While the varieties of grapes winemakers are allowed to use is circumscribed in Bordeaux, being able to draw on nearly 60 varieties in the Okanagan Valley made her feel like an expressionist painter. Yet the region still faces prejudices. “French people think Canada is an arctic place with dog sleighs and snow,” she explained. “They don’t realize there are desert conditions in the Okanagan Valley, which are optimal for growing grapes.” After my trip, I hosted a socially-distanced blind wine tasting with a group of fellow cork dorks, in which we hid our bottles’ labels with aluminum foil. The wines in the contest included a venerable Château Pédesclaux 2012 from Pauillac in the Bordeaux region and a Savigny-lès-Beaune, 1er cru, 2012, a Pinot Noir from France’s Bourgogne. And guess what? My offering, a 2018 Nota Bene from Okanagan’s Black Hills Estate winery came in first place, trouncing its French rivals. Like a grape-guzzling Canadian bear.

"In a calmer debate, Trump and Biden offer sharply different visions of the pandemic.",2020-10-23,"By Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Pam Belluck","['President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered starkly divergent closing arguments to the country in the final presidential debate on Thursday, offering opposite prognoses for a range of issues, including the coronavirus pandemic. The debate was, on the whole, a more restrained affair than the first encounter between the two candidates last month, when Mr. Trump harangued Mr. Biden for most of an hour and a half and effectively short-circuited any policy debate. But if the tenor of Thursday’s forum was more sedate, the conflict in matters of substance and vision could not have been more dramatic. From the opening minutes, the two candidates took opposing stances on the pandemic, with Mr. Trump promising, in defiance of evidence, that the disease was “going away.” The next morning, Alex M. Azar, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the president was “trying to give people hope, given the vaccines and therapeutics that are coming in around the corner.” Speaking on CNN, Mr. Azar said, “But we do need to acknowledge — and he does acknowledge — that we’re in a very serious moment right now.” Mr. Biden, on Thursday, called for much more aggressive federal action for the “dark winter” ahead. Mr. Trump appeared determined to cast his opponent as a career politician who was, as he jabbed toward the end of the debate, “all talk and no action.” Mr. Trump, however, did little to lay out an affirmative case for his own re-election, or to explain in clear terms what he would hope to do with another four years in the White House. He frequently misrepresented the facts of his own record, and Mr. Biden’s. And on his most important political vulnerability — his mismanagement of the pandemic — Mr. Trump hewed unswervingly to a message that happy days are nearly here again, even as polls show that a majority of voters believe the worst of the coronavirus crisis is still ahead. Mr. Biden, for his part, stuck to the core of the argument that has propelled his campaign from the start, denouncing Mr. Trump as a divisive and unethical leader who has botched the federal response to a devastating public-health crisis. Though Mr. Trump pushed him onto the defensive repeatedly, the former vice president also laid out a fuller version of his own policy agenda than he managed in the first debate, calling for large-scale economic stimulus spending, new aid to states battling the pandemic and a muscular expansion of health care and worker benefits nationwide.']",
At Least 6 Children Killed in Attack on School in Cameroon,2020-10-24,By Reuters,"['DOUALA, Cameroon — Gunmen killed at least six children and badly wounded about eight others when they opened fire in a school in the city of Kumba in Cameroon’s Southwest region on Saturday, officials told Reuters. The officials blamed the attack on secessionist insurgents who are seeking to form a breakaway state in Cameroon’s English-speaking west, though Reuters was unable to immediately confirm that. “They attacked around noon. They found the children in class and they opened fire on them,” Ali Anougou, an official from Kumba, told Reuters. Many of the injured students had jumped from second-story windows in an attempt to escape. Videos circulating on social media filmed by local journalists showed adults rushing from the school with children in their arms, surrounded by a crowd of wailing onlookers. A local education official, Ahhim Abanaw Obase, confirmed the death toll and said that eight children were taken to hospital. He said the dead children ranged in age from 12 to 14. Anglophone secessionists have imposed curfews and closed schools as part of their protest against the country’s French-speaking government and its perceived marginalization of the English-speaking minority. Last year, officials blamed separatists for kidnapping dozens of schoolchildren, charges the separatists denied.']",The officials blamed the attack on secessionist insurgents who are seeking to form a breakaway state in Cameroon’s English-speaking west.
"New Airport, Beleaguered Symbol of ‘Irreverent’ Berlin, Is Opening at Long Last",2020-10-24,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Styled like a boarding card, Gregor Gysi’s invitation to the opening party of the “most modern airport in Europe” arrived in the mail. There would be 10,000 guests and a red carpet landing by Chancellor Angela Merkel on the runway. Mr. Gysi couldn’t wait. Eight years later, Mr. Gysi, a lawmaker and native Berliner, is still waiting. Berlin-Brandenburg Willy Brandt Airport, conceived 30 years ago in the giddy aftermath of German reunification as a symbol of freedom and modernity, has instead become the butt of jokes. When the opening on Mr. Gysi’s invitation was abruptly scrapped, it was neither the first postponement nor the last for a project delayed by a seemingly endless succession of problems. With the latest opening date now scheduled for Oct. 31, invitations have again gone out. This time there is no party (“It felt wrong,” the airport’s public relations manager said), just an opening — fingers crossed. “I’m the only one who always knew this airport would open in the fall,” said Mr. Gysi. “I just didn’t know which year!” The litany of engineering blunders, corruption scandals and lawsuits that have plagued what was once Europe’s biggest building site have chipped away at the story Germany likes to tell about itself as a model of efficiency and good government. Six opening dates have come and gone. Miles of cables were incorrectly installed. Firewalls turned out to be just walls. Escalators came up short. Screens had to be replaced, having  reached the end of their lives. Under construction for 14 years, the airport is nine years past its original opening date and more than $4 billion over budget. Every month, it costs several million dollars just to keep the unused airport running. Airport staff are paid to flush all the toilets to keep the plumbing working. Ghost trains run to the ghost terminal at night to stop the tunnels from molding. Cleaners clean the unused rooms of the four-star airport hotel. With so many costly setbacks, T-shirts spotted in the city offer this advice: “Let’s just move the city of Berlin to a functioning airport.” But this time, insists Engelbert Lütke Daldrup, the airport’s chief executive, everything is functioning. Perhaps the biggest incentive to make sure the airport opens, he said, is not to be “laughed at” anymore. “We German engineers are mortified,” said Mr. Lütke Daldrup, a trained engineer and longtime public official who was called in to save the project in 2017. “Germany is known for its engineering competence. We think of ourselves as punctual, efficient and competent. This was embarrassing for Berlin and for Germany as a whole.” Even Ms. Merkel has publicly aired her exasperation: “The very Chinese with whom we have government consultations are asking themselves, ‘what on earth is going on in Berlin that they can’t even build an airport with two runways’,” she said two years ago. With its doors finally about to open, the airport already has the whiff of another era, like a giant movie set created for a period drama set in the 1990s. If it looks vintage — light walnut paneling on check-in counters and chocolate-colored suede on seats by the gates — it’s because it is vintage. The conspicuously small flight information screens were “cutting edge” a decade ago, said Patrick Muller, the operations chief. Self check-in and cellphone charging stations did not exist when the airport plans were drawn up, so they are being added. Hovering below the ceiling in the check-in hall is a giant red sculpture of a flying carpet — testimony, some snicker, to the fairy-tale approach to big infrastructure projects in a city that defies the German stereotype of punctuality, order and planning. “This airport is an allegory for Berlin itself,” said John C. Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany, who has lived in the city on and off since the 1960s. “It’s charming, irreverent, eccentric — and utterly dysfunctional.” Chronically indebted and reliant on subsidies from richer states, Berlin is “a sort of failed state” at the heart of Germany, Mr. Kornblum said. In recent years, Germany’s capital has amused and exasperated the country in equal measure, with headlines about regular prison breaks and a famously unresponsive bureaucracy, at least by German standards. It can take up to 38 days to issue a death certificate, Die Zeit reported in an article about Berlin entitled “In love with failure.” The developers of software used in the city’s registry offices claim it works everywhere else, just not in Berlin. Berlin’s reputation as “poor but sexy,” in the words of one former mayor, is a legacy of the Cold War, when East Berlin was run by Communists and West Berlin was a heavily subsidized capitalist outpost. Starting with the Berlin airlift during the Soviet blockade in 1948, airports had a special significance in the city for generations: They represented freedom to West Berliners surrounded by the Communist East, and freedom to easterners once the Berlin Wall came down. A state-of-the-art airport worthy of the reunited capital became a shared dream after reunification — and more recently a matter of real urgency as the city’s existing airports were overwhelmed by rising passenger numbers. But just picking a location took half a decade — and was arguably the first blunder: Instead of an abandoned airfield in a remote area south of Berlin, politicians opted for a more densely populated spot closer to the city, leading to premium land prices and lawsuits from residents living under the flight path. To minimize noise, pilots flying from the southerly runway will be required to make a complex 145-degree turn on takeoff, which the national air traffic control association describes as “demanding” and pilots have dubbed “the vomit curve.” The list of stumbles has only grown. The foundations of the terminal were already laid when it emerged that the star architect hired for the project, Meinhard von Gerkan, had designed the airport without a proper duty-free area — a vital source of revenue — because he had no time for the “mall-ifiction” of airports. Plans had to be adjusted in a panic. Then, a month before the scheduled 2012 opening — tickets had already been sold, and taxis had been practicing drop-off and pickup — it was revealed that hundreds of fire safety doors and a giant smoke extraction system (“the monster”) in the basement did not work. When management proposed to hire “human fire alarms,” the building inspector told them they were insane. To avoid another last-minute disaster this year, the airport has run dress rehearsals for months. Thousands of volunteers pose as passengers, testing the airport staff on everything from check-in to crisis response. On a recent morning, the terminal was buzzing with yellow-vested volunteers dragging suitcases through security. One pretend-passenger had lost her bag, another her child. A third had been instructed she was a pickpocket. “If the police stop you, do cooperate but do not admit the theft,” her script said. Most extras were Berliners curious to see an airport that in some cases had been talked about for longer than they had been alive. Susanne Wendt, a 33-year-old bank employee, said wryly that she had signed up “to see the airport at least once before it fails to open again.” Mr. Lütke Daldrup dismisses such doubts. It may no longer be Europe’s most modern airport, he conceded, but “it’s the safest airport in the world.” “Every screw in the building has been scrutinized,” he said. Whether anyone will actually be flying is another question. Having missed out on the travel boom of the past two decades, Berlin’s new airport now opens in the middle of a pandemic. “The ultimate irony is that after all this, after 30 years, hardly anyone is flying,” Mr. Kornblum said. At least, he added, “social distancing will be easy.” Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']","Nine years late and $4 billion over budget, the airport is already outdated. Repeated blunders dented the image of German efficiency, but the “poor but sexy” capital has long been a bit different."
"In South Korea, Draft Resisters Still Go to Prison. But Now It’s a Job.",2020-10-24,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Like thousands of other Jehovah’s Witnesses who refused to join the military because of their religious beliefs, Lee Seung-ki will serve time in a South Korean prison. But unlike those before him, Mr. Lee will not enter as a convicted criminal. He will be among the first conscientious objectors in South Korea allowed to perform alternative service — jobs like cook, \u200bjanitor and clinic assistant\u200b\u200b — behind prison walls. For three years starting on Monday, Mr. Lee and 63 others will work, eat and sleep in prisons, though they will live apart from the inmates and will be allowed several weeks of leave. And unlike Jehovah’s Witnesses who served prison terms for their beliefs, they will have no criminal record to trail them for the rest of their lives. Alternative service is a seismic shift in a country that considers conscription crucial to its defense against North Korea, with which it is still technically at war. Military duty is seen as a revered rite of passage for able-bodied young men, who are required to spend 21 months in uniform, usually between the ages of 18 and 28. South Korea has imprisoned more conscientious objectors than any other country. Its Military Service Act requires up to three years in prison for those who refuse the draft without “justifiable” reasons. For decades, hundreds of young men, almost all of them Jehovah’s Witnesses, were put behind bars each year, usually for 18 months. As inmates, they did much of the same work that Mr. Lee will be doing. “The difference is that the old objectors did it for 18 months wearing a prisoner’s uniform, but we will do it for three years as legalized conscientious objectors,” Mr. Lee said. “I am grateful that I am finally given this chance to serve the country without \u200bviolating my conscience.” A historic 2018 ruling by the Constitutional Court found that imprisoning conscientious objectors was unconstitutional because there were no alternative forms of service, and it ordered the government to create some. In December, Parliament passed legislation that allowed for civilian service in prisons “and other areas of public interest” — though for now, at least, prison work is the only option the government is offering. Human rights groups were critical, saying that the three-year requirement made South Korea’s alternative service the longest in the world. Conscientious objectors “are confronted with little more than an alternative punishment,” Arnold Fang, an East Asia researcher for Amnesty International, said in December. “Confining people to work in a prison — and for almost twice as long as the typical military service — does not respect their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.” Still, for Jehovah’s Witnesses, alternative service is a hard-won victory. In the decades after the Korean War, when South Korea was ruled by military dictators, male Jehovah’s Witnesses of draft age who refused to serve were dragged into military boot camps and stockades, where they were vilified as “traitors,” beaten and in some cases killed, according to reports from a presidential commission in 2008. One member of the church, Kim Keun-hyeong, 27, said he knew from an early age that he would end up in prison unless he abandoned his beliefs. His older brother, also a Jehovah’s Witness, was imprisoned for refusing military service. When Mr. Kim disobeyed his enlistment order, he, too, was put on trial on charges of dodging the draft. But his case was suspended in 2013, when he joined 27 others to mount the legal challenge that led to the Constitutional Court’s ruling. “I respect \u200bthe decision of \u200bthose who join the military,” Mr. Kim said. “But I also wanted my decision not to join the military for my religious conviction to be respected, as well.” After the court’s ruling, officials and lawmakers weighed various forms of civilian service, like working in nursing homes, fire stations or hospitals. Some argued that if alternative service was not long and rigorous enough, young men would try to evade the draft under the pretext of ethical principles, compromising the country’s ability to deter North Korea’s 1.1 million-strong military.  In their prison work, conscientious objectors will be exempt from guard and prisoner-escort duty, which involves carrying firearms. But like soldiers, they will live together in barrackslike facilities. The question of who should be excused from military service has long been a sensitive topic in South Korea. “It’s a sacred duty to defend our country, but that doesn’t mean that everyone has to \u200bcarry a weapon,” Noh Woong-rae, a senior lawmaker in the governing party, said this month. He floated the idea that K-pop stars, like members of BTS, should be exempted from the draft. For decades, top athletes have been excused from military service on the grounds that they enhanced national prestige. K-pop fans say it is unfair that world-class pop stars are denied that privilege. In a report to Parliament this month, the Military Manpower Administration, which oversees the draft, offered a compromise: It would let top K-pop stars postpone their service so that they could perform for a few more years at the peak of their careers. Such a revision would be a godsend for the oldest member of BTS, Kim Seok-jin, who turns 28 in December and must enlist within the following year. But South Korea cannot afford too many exemptions. After decades of low birthrates, it will soon lack enough young men to maintain its conscript military at 620,000 members, defense officials say. (The military accepts female volunteers — about 13,000 are now serving — but there has never been serious discussion of drafting women.) There is still much hostility in South Korea toward men seen as draft dodgers. Yoo Seung-jun, 43, once one of the most popular K-pop singers, saw his career crash and burn in 2002, after he was accused of evading military service by becoming an American citizen. He has since been barred from entering South Korea. As for Kim Keun-hyeong, his travails did not end with the Constitutional Court’s ruling. His original case in a lower court was reopened, with prosecutors focusing on whether he was a genuine conscientious objector. Trying to debunk his argument that he had lived according to pacifist biblical teachings, they asked online gaming companies if Mr. Kim had ever played games involving guns and violence. It was not until last month, eight years after he first disobeyed his draft order, that Mr. Kim was acquitted and recognized as a legitimate conscientious objector. The ripple effects of his ordeal still linger. When he got married last year, the couple had to cancel their honeymoon to Malaysia because he had no passport. He had been denied one because he was still on trial. Mr. Kim must now apply to a government panel that selects conscientious objectors for alternative service.  He and his wife are bracing for years of living apart once his prison job begins. “We wept together when we discussed how we were going to live separated for three years,” said his wife, Kim Seo-young, who is also a Jehovah’s Witness. “But we promised each other to travel around the world together when he finally gets free.”']",A court ruled that conscientious objectors must be allowed to serve their country in other ways. The government says they’ll still have to do so behind prison walls.
"In Xi’s Homage to Korean War, a Jab at the U.S.",2020-10-23,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Buckley,"['SEOUL, South Korea — First China’s leader, Xi Jinping, visited the national military museum in Beijing and hailed the country’s “victory in the war to resist American aggression and aid Korea.” Then he wrote a public letter to veterans in a retirement home in Sichuan. On Friday, culminating a weeklong commemoration of the Korean War, he delivered a pugnacious and at times visceral homage to those who sacrificed against the country’s enemies, the United States foremost of them all. “The Chinese people don’t go looking for trouble, but nor do they fear it,” Mr. Xi said before hundreds of party officials, military officers and aged veterans in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. “Confronted with any hardships or dangers, the calves of their legs will not shake, and their backs will not bend.” For Mr. Xi and the country’s propagandists, the anniversary of China’s entry into the Korean War 70 years ago this week could hardly have come at a more opportune time. The country, in their telling, is once again facing an unprovoked assault by a superpower determined to thwart China’s rise. This time the United States, under President Trump, has targeted China’s trade policy, its technological advances and its territorial ambitions. The anniversary unfolded with a barrage of commemorative events, exhibitions, television documentaries and feature films. They all conveyed the same message: The Chinese people have stood up to the United States before and, regardless of the costs, they will again. Another Chinese leader, in a different era, might have moderated the rhetoric before the United States election to avoid alienating the American political and business establishment. Not Mr. Xi. “Seventy years ago, imperialist invaders brought the flames of war burning to the doorway of the new China,” he said on Friday. “The Chinese people have a deep understanding that in responding to invaders, one must speak to them in a language that they understand.” The events commemorating the war — long known as the “forgotten war” in the United States — have followed a series of military drills and an outburst of propaganda. Together they have signaled a hardening resolve against the United States and further raised tensions inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic and President Trump’s continuing derision of China. Popular opinion in both countries has soured as a result, creating animosity that is not likely to ease soon, regardless of the outcome of the American election, which is now less than two weeks away. “Seventy years ago, China was poor and weak,” Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said in an interview, echoing the theme of Mr. Xi’s speech on Friday. “Facing the United States as a superpower, China fought. Is there anything China dare not do now?” History in China has long been repurposed to fit political needs, leaving little room for a frank reckoning with the past. In the last two decades, some Chinese historians quietly challenged the heroic official narrative of Mao’s decision to thrust the country into the Korean War, fought from 1950 to 1953. But that story has long been a pillar of the founding mythology of the People’s Republic of China, and Mr. Xi relived its highlights in his remarks. Coming barely a year after the country’s founding, the war was a searing and painful test. When it broke out, China remained at war with the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek that had retreated to Taiwan, and also faced armed resistance to its invasion of Tibet. Chinese forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the retreating North Korean army on Oct. 19, 1950; six days later, they fought their first battle with the allied troops fighting under a United Nations mandate. According to China’s official account, which Mr. Xi cited on Friday, 197,000 Chinese died in the war, though historians broadly agree that the actual toll was much higher. Commemorations of the war have ebbed and flowed in intensity over the decades for reasons having little to do with the war itself. Guan Ling, a commentator with Duowei News, the Chinese-language site based in New York, has chronicled how major anniversaries have reflected the country’s respective leaders and geopolitical circumstances. Mao Zedong played down the 20th anniversary in 1970 as he sought a normalization of relations with the United States, whereas Jiang Zemin in 2000 emphasized the 50th, which occurred in the wake of the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Serbia during the Kosovo war the year before. John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul and author of a forthcoming book on the Korean War, said that Mr. Xi had delivered a similar speech as vice president 10 years ago, although in substance and tone it was less combative.  “There’s a different resonance now,” Mr. Delury said. “He’s hitting the stand-up-to-America theme pretty hard now. It’s getting intense.” Mr. Xi also appeared to have a domestic audience in mind. He and the rest of the party leadership are scheduled to gather next week in a closed-door assembly to discuss China’s priorities for the next five years. He used Friday’s speech to restate his case for the primacy of the Communist Party leadership, with himself at the core. It is a theme he has often invoked amid the pandemic, which, despite early missteps, his government has managed to bring under control domestically. Even the sight of a cadre of hundreds in a crowded hall — all wearing masks — was a striking contrast to bans on gatherings in many countries. Mr. Xi’s speech had a strikingly hawkish tone, describing at one point the sacrifices of soldiers who had used their bodies as shields against a far superior force. “They smashed the myth that the American military was invincible,” he said. Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has reorganized the Chinese military, trying to create a modern, multipronged fighting force, a model that he said the Korean War first taught the People’s Liberation Army. For most in China, the war has become a distant memory. Its remaining veterans are gradually dying off, and Chinese society today is unimaginably transformed from the impoverished China of the 1950s. The country has not experienced war now since 1979, when it invaded Vietnam and was routed. Lest the idea of war become an abstraction, the party’s propaganda apparatus has churned out dozens of programs. A six-part documentary aired each night this week on state television. The nightly news casts have featured not only Mr. Xi’s appearances, as always, but also profiles of soldiers who fought and died. Film studios have responded to government directives and produced a series of feature films, including an animated movie, called “Salute to Heroes,” that is aimed at younger audiences. Also having its opening on Friday was a blockbuster about the war starring Wu Jing, the lead actor in the “Wolf Warrior” action film franchise that has given a name to Chinese diplomacy of late. The film depicts Chinese soldiers keeping a vital river crossing open against relentless American bombardment. Its title in English: “The Sacrifice.” Near the end, an American pilot marvels at the tenacity of the soldiers below. He radios back to his commanders that their attacks have failed. “There’s nothing we can do to stop them.” Steven Lee Myers reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Chris Buckley from Sydney, Australia.

How Bolivia Overcame a Crisis and Held a Clean Election,2020-10-23,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — As Election Day neared, candidates fretted over the possibility of fraud. Voters across Bolivia questioned the solidity of the electoral process. And many worried that the result — any result — would provoke anger and violence from the other side. But in the days that followed the vote, something unexpected happened. The election went smoothly, and its results were quickly and widely accepted — an accomplishment that is being celebrated by many in a country that has weathered years of threats to its democracy. “Democracy won in Bolivia,” said Fernanda Wanderley, director of the socioeconomic institute at the Universidad Católica Boliviana. Exit polls on Sunday showed one candidate, Luis Arce, clearly taking the lead. His main opponent, Carlos Mesa, conceded the next day. On Friday, Bolivia’s electoral tribunal confirmed that Mr. Arce would indeed be the next president of Bolivia, matching the exit polls and voters’ expectations. In the end, Mr. Arce won 55 percent of the vote, and Mr. Mesa had just under 29 percent, a win far bigger than Mr. Arce’s advisers had predicted. Mr. Arce is the chosen candidate of the former president, Evo Morales, a towering figure of Bolivia politics. Mr. Morales is a socialist who transformed the country, lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty and prioritizing Indigenous and rural communities in a nation that had been run for centuries by a mostly white elite. The numbers indicate clear voter interest in continuing with Mr. Morales’s political project, and his party, Movimiento al Socialismo, or MAS. But voters and analysts also say the election signals a promising moment for a democratic system that had been slipping under Mr. Morales, who bypassed the rules in his government’s own constitution to run for a third and then a fourth term, and was criticized for persecuting opponents, harassing journalists and stacking the judiciary in his favor. His attempt to run for a fourth term last year ended in allegations of electoral fraud, and demands from opponents and protesters in the streets that he step down. Once police and the armed forces joined the call for his resignation, he left the country — and called his ouster a coup. Sunday’s election was a do-over of last year’s. The president who has served in an interim capacity over the last year, Jeanine Añez, an opponent of Mr. Morales, has also persecuted her political enemies and stifled dissent, and infuriated many Bolivians by postponing the new election. Her hard-line anti-MAS rhetoric, which made little distinction between party officials and everyday voters, turned off many Bolivians, said Raúl Peñaranda, a Bolivian journalist. In interviews, many Bolivians attributed the relative calm after the election and the high turnout for Mr. Arce to a yearning for stability. In the country’s fewer than 200 years, it has seen 190 revolutions and coups. The last year included deadly protests, a presidential ouster, a health crisis that killed thousands, a financial crisis that has left many hungry and a contentious election that has riven the nation. Mr. Morales, who was in office for 14 years, was Bolivia’s longest-serving president and presided over the country at a time when a commodities boom sent money flowing into the country. Mr. Arce was his economics minister for much of that time, and is often associated with that prosperity and relative political stability. He has also promised to stay in office just five years. All of this seems to have convinced more than half of the country to give him a chance. “I think the crisis of the last year did a lot of damage to Bolivian democracy, part of an accumulative process,” said Ms. Wanderley. “But in the end, Bolivia found a path to overcome that crisis, and was able to conduct a clean, legitimate election in which the winner was decided by the popular vote.” After Mr. Morales’s ouster, Bolivia also made a concerted effort to address mistrust in the electoral system. It overhauled its electoral tribunal, which had been stacked with Morales loyalists. It also rolled out a voter education campaign and cleaned up the electoral rolls, said Naledi Lester, an election expert working in La Paz to assess the vote for the Carter Center, a nonprofit that has been observing elections since 1989. Her colleague José Antonio de Gabriel, also working in La Paz, said the tribunal conducted an organized vote, and “acted with impartiality and independence and protected political plurality.” Mr. Morales was forced out last year after his critics accused his government of trying to rig the vote in his favor. The Organization of American States, which fielded the largest electoral observer mission in Bolivia last year, heavily criticized the 2019 process, concluding that election officials had engaged in “intentional manipulation” and “serious irregularities” that made it impossible to verify the result. These irregularities included hidden data servers, manipulated voting receipts and forged signatures, the O.A.S. said. Several reports by academics and policy experts have since criticized the organization’s statistical analysis of the election. But the O.A.S. report has shaped the local and global narrative of the election. It has been used by Mr. Morales’s supporters to claim that global forces are conspiring against them, and by Mr. Morales’s critics to claim that MAS rigged the vote. These differing views have sent people to the streets over the last year, sometimes resulting in violent clashes. This year the O.A.S. sent 40 people to observe the election. On Wednesday, the organization issued a report calling it “exemplary” and “without fraudulent actions.” The relatively smooth nature of the election may also have to do with who won. Before Sunday’s election, Mr. Arce’s party had been a lead voice sowing doubt in the impartiality of the electoral tribunal. His supporters, in many interviews, often said that they wouldn’t trust the vote if he didn’t emerge as the victor. “Arce is going to win, but they’re going to try and cheat him out of it,” said Graciela Fernández, 41, a produce seller, just days before the election. “Then there is going to be a fight.” Mr. Mesa, on the other hand, said in an interview that he would “absolutely, categorically” accept the results if he lost. And then he did. Mr. Arce’s criticisms of the electoral tribunal mostly fell away once he won. “If the results had been different,” said Ms. Wanderley, “we could have had problems, grave problems.”']",
"As China Clamps Down, Activists Flee Hong Kong for Refuge in the West",2020-10-24,By Austin Ramzy and Maria Abi-Habib,"['HONG KONG — In Western democracies, they have been welcomed as refugees escaping Beijing’s tightening grip over Hong Kong. In China, they have been denounced as violent criminals escaping punishment for their seditious activities. A group of Hong Kong activists who have been granted asylum in the United States, Canada and Germany in recent weeks are the latest catalyst for deteriorating relations between China and the West. Western leaders have asserted that they will stand up for human rights in Hong Kong, while Chinese officials have rebuked the countries for what they called interference in Beijing’s affairs. The protesters’ newly conferred status has made clear how profoundly Hong Kong has changed since China imposed a tough new security law this summer. For decades, the city had been a place of shelter for people escaping war, famine and political oppression in mainland China. Now the semiautonomous city has become a source of asylum seekers. “The United States is a country that allows us freedom,” said Vicky Xiao, a 20-year-old university student from Hong Kong who is in California and seeking asylum in America. Ms. Xiao said she feared being arrested if she returned to Hong Kong because she had taken part in the demonstrations that roiled the city last year. One of her former classmates who had also joined in the demonstrations in Hong Kong had been detained by the police, she said. The United States is directly challenging Beijing over its crackdown on Hong Kong. The Trump administration moved to list refugees from the city as a priority for the first time — even as it reduced the total number of refugees the United States will take in annually. At least three bills now before Congress would enact greater protections for people fleeing Hong Kong for the United States. And the government has moved unusually quickly to grant asylum to at least two protesters who left Hong Kong late last year. The two activists, who asked not to be named to protect their families in Hong Kong, showed The New York Times documents stating they had received asylum in September. They said they had fled to the Los Angeles area after receiving multiple calls from an unlisted number that made them concerned they were at risk of being detained. Ms. Xiao, the university student who is awaiting a decision on her asylum application, is also in Southern California. She is currently on a student visa and lives with her parents, who are on business visas. She described sneaking out of her parents’ house with a backpack of clothes last August and flying to Hong Kong to join the protests without their approval. She said she returned after three days, but has also helped organize protests in the United States, which she thinks could put her at risk of arrest if she had to return to Hong Kong after her visa expires. “I don’t know what will happen to me if I go back to Hong Kong,” Ms. Xiao said. “But I don’t think that the consequences will be good.” China has not commented on the U.S. asylum cases. But Beijing and the Hong Kong government have dismissed the notion that the city’s residents might need shelter from oppression, saying the authorities guarantee the rights of its people. “There are no so-called ‘refugees being persecuted’ in Hong Kong,” the city government said in a statement. And officials have lashed out publicly at other countries. Hong Kong’s No. 2 leader, Matthew Cheung, summoned Germany’s consul general on Wednesday to complain after Germany granted asylum to a university student who was wanted on a rioting charge. Mr. Cheung said the move would “only send a plainly wrong message to criminals.” In Canada, China’s ambassador, Cong Peiwu, warned Ottawa against accepting refugees from Hong Kong. He said that such a policy would embolden criminals in the Chinese city and put “the good health and safety” of 300,000 Canadian passport holders and companies in the territory at risk. The ambassador’s remarks were regarded by some as a potential threat against Canadians in Hong Kong. They were also a reminder of the two Canadians who have been held for nearly two years in China in retaliation for the arrest of a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese technology giant. Canada’s foreign affairs minister, François-Philippe Champagne, denounced the comments as “totally unacceptable and disturbing.” (The Chinese government later asserted that the remarks had been taken out of context.) China’s crackdown over Hong Kong has prompted residents with means to consider their options elsewhere. Some have turned to Britain, Hong Kong’s former colonial master, which has expanded channels for the city’s residents to immigrate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in June that the country would allow holders of British overseas passports in Hong Kong to live and work in Britain for up to five years and later apply for citizenship. The residency plan is open to nearly three million people in total. China has criticized the plan. A foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Friday that Beijing is now considering not recognizing the British overseas passport as a valid travel document. Interest in the passports has grown, with the number of overseas passport holders more than doubling to over 357,000 in April from about 170,000 in 2018. Such passports, which were given to Hong Kong residents before the territory was returned to China in 1997, bear the insignia of the British government but do not confer the rights of citizenship. Derek Yeung, 60, who worked in sales for technical products, moved to Britain in August to take advantage of the new policy. He said that he had often traveled to the mainland for work and had seen corruption and abuses of power. His experience convinced him that he would eventually need to leave Hong Kong after it returned to Chinese rule. “Because of my experience in China, I predicted that Hong Kong will soon degenerate into a police state,” he said by phone from Cambridge. The security law imposed this summer “just confirmed my fears,” he said. Overseas activists have also set up nonprofits like Haven Assistance to help Hong Kong’s protesters navigate asylum procedures abroad. Popular destinations include the United States, Britain, Germany and Taiwan, which opened a government office to assist asylum seekers from Hong Kong this summer. The group was started by Simon Cheng, who was granted political asylum in Britain in June, and other activists. Mr. Cheng says he gets 10 to 15 inquiries a day about asylum procedures in Britain alone. “I am now safe here, but I need to help more people,” Mr. Cheng said. “I can’t be like a free rider.” Mr. Cheng, a former employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong, had been detained for 15 days in mainland China last year and accused of soliciting prostitution, a charge he denies. He says that while he was in custody he was beaten and hung for hours in a spread-eagle position, and coerced into making a videotaped confession. Mr. Cheng said that as an overseas passport holder, he was eligible to stay in Britain, but that gaining asylum would demonstrate the injustice of his experience. “I wanted to fight for my reputation, to show my detention politically motivated, that it was intrinsically persecution,” he said.']",China calls them “violent criminals.” Asylum seekers from Hong Kong are the latest catalyst for deteriorating relations between Beijing and Western countries.
Libya Cease-Fire Raises Hopes for Full Peace Deal,2020-10-23,By Nick Cumming-Bruce and Declan Walsh,"['GENEVA — Libya’s two main warring factions agreed to a cease-fire on Friday, raising hopes for an end to years of bloody turmoil that have drawn in military forces from Russia, Turkey and other regional powers. The two sides signed the agreement at the United Nations in Geneva at the end of a weeklong meeting of delegates from the internationally recognized Government of National Accord, which is based in the capital Tripoli, and the self-styled Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Hifter and based in the country’s east. The two sides agreed to a complete, countrywide and permanent agreement with immediate effect, said Stephanie Williams, the United Nations acting special envoy who was chairwoman of the most recent talks. She said it called for frontline forces to return to their bases and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries within three months, a process that would be monitored by the United Nations. “God willing, it will be the key to peace and security in all Libya,” Col. Ali Abushama, the head of the government delegation, said at the signing ceremony. “We have had enough suffering, enough division, enough bloodshed.” Libya has a long history of failed peace initiatives and the reaction of the foreign sponsors that have driven the long-running war, on both sides of the conflict, will be crucial to the success of the cease-fire. Ms. Williams said the agreement will be sent immediately to the U.N. Security Council, stressing the critical importance of international backing. The former U.N. envoy, Ghassan Salame, quit his job earlier this year, partly in exasperation at the failure of the international community to provide meaningful support for peace efforts in Libya. Mr. Salame has been vocal about his disillusionment with the open meddling by some foreign countries in Libya, such as Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, combined with the failures of Western countries like the United States, France and Britain to meaningfully counter that meddling. The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, welcomed the truce agreement as a “fundamental step” toward ending the conflict. “I congratulate the parties for putting the interest of their nation ahead of their differences,” he said. Mr. Guterres, who for the past seven months has been calling for cease-fires around the world to help contain the Covid-19 pandemic, expressed hope that combatants in other conflicts — in the Middle East, Afghanistan and more recently between Armenia and Azerbaijan — would use the “inspiration of the Libyan agreement” to follow the same path. The latest agreement comes four months after Mr. Hifter’s forces were forced into a humiliating retreat from their positions around the capital, Tripoli, which they had mounted a bitter, 15-month campaign to capture. Although the assault ended in failure, it drew powerful foreign actors ever deeper in the war for control of the oil-rich North African nation. Russia sent mercenaries and the United Arab Emirates shipped vast amounts of weaponry in support of Mr. Hifter. On the other side, Turkey intervened decisively on the side of the beleaguered Tripoli government, sending military advisers, drones and Syrian mercenaries. For months, the two sides have been engaged in a tense standoff around Surt, in central Libya, where the country’s longtime dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was born and died violently in 2011. Surt is the gateway to a region known as the oil crescent, where most of Libya’s oil production takes place. Mr. Hifter halted most oil production in January in an effort to starve the Tripoli government of funds. But production has risen sharply in recent weeks, to 300,000 barrels a day, amid wider expectations that the blockade would be lifted. Although Mr. Hifter remains the leader of a powerful military coalition, his political strength has steadily diminished since his forces were routed from Tripoli in June. On his home turf in eastern Libya, other powerful political players have emerged in recent months and grown close to some of Mr. Hifter’s foreign allies, notably Egypt. In his first interview after resigning from the envoy job, Mr. Salame accused the U.N. Security Council of hypocrisy, saying the majority of its members had initially supported Mr. Hifter’s assault on Tripoli and actively stymied his own peace efforts. Mr. Salame said he had been “stabbed in the back” by those same countries in the interview with The Mediator’s Studio, a podcast of the Oslo Forum, an organization that promotes conflict mediation. Ms. Williams described the accord reached on Friday as “a moment that will go down in history,” praising the courage, commitment and professionalism of the delegates in forging the deal. She said it also set an exceptional example for Libyan politicians who now face the challenge of converting the cease-fire into a broader political settlement in talks due to open in Tunis in early November. The two sides agreed on Wednesday to reopen road and air links throughout the country. Friday’s agreement is intended to set in motion steps to unify security forces and disarm, demobilize and reintegrate the numerous armed factions that have operated unchecked by any central authority for years. The two sides also agreed to measures that will reestablish national control over oil facilities and key institutions such as the central bank, Ms. Williams said. Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva and Declan Walsh from Nairobi, Kenya.']","The two main factions in years of civil war that have drawn in Russia, Turkey and other regional powers signed an accord at the United Nations in Geneva."
"For Italy’s Masked Rap Diva, an Era of Face Coverings Poses a Dilemma",2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz,"['MILAN — When the pandemic first hit Italy and masks became scarce, Myss Keta, the mysterious Queen of the Milan Night, came to the rescue. The Italian rapper, performance artist and L.G.B.T.Q. icon had amassed a vast collection of face coverings that she wore for years to hide her identity. So she began distributing them to her friends in need. “I had so many,” she said. “Surgical, cloth, vinyl, silk, whatever material.” This month, with a second wave of the coronavirus rising and Italy requiring the wearing of masks in public at all times, grandparents, politicians, middle-management businesspeople, doctors, lawyers, delivery people — just about everyone — is covering up. That has rendered Myss Keta — whose use of masks took her from underground clubs to the cusp of national, if incognito, celebrity — an improbable authority on life behind the surgical veil. It has also threatened to strip her of her defining shtick. “Before, it was a distinguishing characteristic. Now, it’s something we all have in common,” she said as she lifted a black surgical mask — the casual black T-shirt of her vast collection — to sip a Bloody Mary at Bar Basso in her Porta Venezia stomping grounds of Milan. Under her trademark blond bangs, her eyes remained covered as usual in dark Givenchy sunglasses. It used to be only the front-row fans at her concerts who emulated her by wearing masks. “Now, everyone seems like a Myss fan,” she said. The Myss behind the mask remains a mystery. Gentle inquiries into her true identity yield only blatantly fictitious biographical details that she called “Myssketiana mythology.” “I’m always Myss Keta. I’m always myself, 100 percent,” said Keta, who later froze in her full-length faux leather trench coat when a friend accidentally let a first name slip. “Myss Keta is the diva of Porta Venezia. I’ll say it until they name parks after me.” Myss Keta, a woman of uncertain age, is a John Waters dream of an Italian rap star. She first appeared in 2013, like a voluptuous Venus from a clubbing clamshell, with the release of the song “Milano, Sushi & Coca.” The debut, rapped in her hypersexualized, cartoonishly sultry and gleefully trashy style, simultaneously venerated and mocked Milan’s nightlife. She and her arts collective, Motel Forlanini, decided that she should appear anonymous in the video to better become “the voice of a certain period, of a certain Milan scene,” she said. The mask she wore at her first concert intrigued more people, and the crew decided that she should stick with the disguise. For nearly a decade, she has hidden her face with every mask imaginable\xa0— sequined, metallic, feathered. She has worn a digital clock over her eyes, a Yosemite Sam beard over her jowls. In recent years, she has sought to branch out from her dance club roots to something approaching mainstream success. She sold out concerts, brought her campy, languorous rap verses to Germany, became a featured guest on Italian national radio and television shows and appeared on the cover of a national magazine for an article about Milan nightlife. She signed with Universal and discussed her book and identity and women’s empowerment with the director of Turin’s book fair, Italy’s largest. Last year, she collaborated with some of the country’s most recognizable pop singers and rappers. She said she felt carried on the crest of popularity leading to a breakout year. Instead, she ran mask first into a lockdown. “It put the brakes on the Myss project,” she said. In September, she released her first pandemic-era song and video, in which she dances wildly alone in an open field with a mask on. (“The most diligent of all,” she said.) But with masks omnipresent, she and her collaborators have began to contemplate “a new trick, another way of keeping anonymity,” she said. She considered a motorcycle helmet, extreme makeup and “prosthetic modifications” as possibilities. The mask mandate, she said, “accelerated” the move forward. But while she researches a new look, she remains one of Italy’s leading authorities on incessant mask wearing. Pragmatically speaking, she said, surgical masks are best for talking. For performing, the singer of “Burqa di Gucci” prefers a “mèches burka.” She has learned that the mask can shift power balances to the wearer. She noticed that her fans who donned masks also felt freer and more themselves. Dressing up for a wild night out, though, is different from breathing behind a particulate-filtering face piece for the foreseeable future. At least, she said, the early negative connotation of the mask — linked to sickness, hospitalization and hypochondriac anxiety — has transitioned to respect for others and a possible font of expression, bursting with colors, fabrics and name-brand cachet. She said she herself had pulled Myss Keta brand masks at the outset of the epidemic to avoid exploiting the tragedy. But as someone who hardly removed her mask outside her apartment for seven years, she also commiserated with an Italian populace entering a stuffy new reality. “I know guys, it’s a pain. I get it — it’s not easy,” she said languidly. “You need to get used to it.” The pandemic has also taken its toll on other prominent masked Italians. Only days before Italy began locking down towns, the popular Neapolitan artist Liberato, who for three years has hidden his identity, released a video for his song “We Come From Napoli.” In the video, Liberato and his masked friends are intended to look menacing as they stalk the Port of Naples playing cards, tagging walls and eating pork. But in the pandemic, it looks like any given Tuesday. “Today, it’s strange to see those images,” said Francesco Lettieri, a close associate of Liberato’s who directed the video. “Because that’s all become very normal.” Others see more of an upside. Valerio Massimo Visintin, the restaurant critic for Italy’s largest newspaper, Il Corriere Della Sera, said he was sometimes jokingly referred to as “Myss Keta’s uncle,” because he has sought to preserve his anonymity for the last decade by dressing as “the man in black” during public appearances. As he sat on a couch in his Milan agent’s office dressed like a cross between Darkman and an Irish Republican Army militant, he recommended that novice mask wearers practice increasing the volume, pausing between sentences and gesticulating more. In addition to a Donnie Brasco leather jacket and a black Stetson, he wore black gloves cut at the fingers, because his wife said that women recognized men’s hands. He said that he had tried a Zorro mask but that it was too revealing, and said he couldn’t breathe through a Venetian carnival guise. He settled on a ski mask usually worn under a motorcycle helmet. He hasn’t taken a photo, not even a family one, in years and he said he uses taxis “like Superman did phone booths.” His years of practice, he said, have made it easier for him to wear his FFP2 medical mask, which he donned under his disguise. It offers him “double protection,” he said, both in terms of health and of staying anonymous. “Now, the most they would recognize is a mask.” Myss Keta also said that the widespread mask wearing provided her with anonymity on the Milan streets where she used to be constantly accosted and which this week became subject to a no-nightlife curfew. This was especially the case in the summer, when so many others joined her in wearing sunglasses atop their masks. “It was everybody’s look,” she said. After signing an autograph, she got up and walked past a sexagenarian using his blue mask as a pocket kerchief as he drank a spring break-sized Negroni Sbagliato cocktail. She gave a tour of the neighborhood, offering observations peppered with her Milanese slang (good things were “top” or “total”; the best things were “morta,” or dead) and got noticed among the masked masses. Teenagers looked at one another with shell shock. A table of Germans shouted out, “We love you, Myss Keta!” For now, the mask has its appeal and she intends to keep wearing it. Plus, she noted: “It’s the law. There’s no escaping it.”']","Myss Keta, the mysterious Queen of the Milan Night and an authority on life behind the surgical veil, was on the brink of celebrity.

Pope Francis’ Views on Same-Sex Civil Unions Were Cut From a 2019 Vatican Interview,2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz and Natalie Kitroeff,"['ROME — Pope Francis was an hour into a sprawling interview with a Mexican journalist at his Vatican residence in 2019 when he was asked if he had changed since his time as archbishop of Argentina, when he staunchly opposed gay marriage. Francis responded that he had always defended the church’s teaching on marriage, then began to delve into the question of legalizing same-sex relationships when suddenly the video skipped forward. “One changes in life,” he said. The words that went missing — expressing support for same-sex civil unions — surfaced only this week in a new documentary, stoking the hopes of gay Catholics and the fury of conservatives. But the clip also became the subject of sudden intrigue over when and where the pope made the remarks, and why they were only now being made public. The pope made the comments in an interview with the Vatican correspondent for the Mexican broadcaster Televisa, said Teresa Villa, a spokeswoman for Televisa, late on Thursday. Two people close to the company, who did not want to be identified while discussing such sensitive matters, said that the Vatican had required that the interview be filmed with Vatican cameras and that the Vatican be given control over the footage. The Vatican cut out the pope’s remarks on same-sex unions in the edited version provided to Televisa, the two people said. Gone was this comment from the pope: “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered.” The excerpt, which the two people said was never seen by the network, remained buried until the Church allowed a documentary filmmaker access to the Vatican archives, including the raw footage of the Televisa interview. The filmmaker put the clip in a new documentary — “Francesco” — that premiered this week at the Rome Film Festival. The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to respond on Thursday evening when asked whether the Vatican had tried to suppress the Pope’s potentially groundbreaking remarks. It remained unclear who at the Vatican would have edited the footage, or if Francis himself knew of the cut. But the disappearance, then re-emergence, of footage of Francis weighing in on one of the most divisive issues facing the Roman Catholic Church raised questions about whether the pope’s handlers sought to silence his apparent approval of legal unions for same-sex couples.  Since the remarks surfaced Wednesday in the new documentary, they have been welcomed as a major breakthrough by liberal Catholics and L.G.B.T. activists, and reviled by conservative bishops as a contradiction of church teaching. The Catholic Church teaches that homosexuality is a sin. The confusion over the provenance of the footage sucked in a host of players on Thursday — the ambitious, Oscar-nominated director of the film, Evgeny Afineevsky; a respected Mexican journalist with Televisa, Valentina Alazraki, to whom Francis presented a cake on the papal plane on the occasion of her 150th papal trip; and the Vatican’s own communications department, which has a tradition of secrecy, strict message control and often ham-handed execution. Almost everyone involved declined to comment or evaded questions of how the footage emerged. The film’s director, Mr. Afineevsky, who had extensive access to the Vatican over years of production, told The New York Times on Wednesday that the pope had made the remarks in an interview with him. But when the Vatican suggested otherwise, he did not answer repeated inquiries about where and when the pope made the remarks, or about whether he had instead recycled the footage from the Vatican’s cutting-room floor. Vatican officials and confidants of Francis sought to dismiss the comments as old news, even though they had never seen the light of day. Ms. Alazraki, the Televisa correspondent, told The Times on Wednesday that she did not recall the pope making such remarks to her. By that evening, video began circulating among Vatican reporters of her nearly hour-and-20 minute interview with the pope on the environment, sexual abuse and plenty else. The setting appears identical to the clip used in the new documentary. In both, Francis is seated in his residence in Casa Santa Marta on a gold-trimmed chair with a honey-combed pattern chair behind his right shoulder, and a small microphone in the same spot on his robe. On Thursday, Ms. Alazraki referred all questions to her employer, Televisa, Mexico’s largest media conglomerate, which said in a statement that at the time of the interview she was focused on the pope’s comments on the sexual abuse scandal. Ms. Alazraki’s reputation is hardly that of a pushover. In early 2019, she was invited to address many of the church’s leaders at a summit on sexual abuse, and used the occasion to warn the clerics that unless the church publicly admitted its sins instead of “playing ostrich,” then “we journalists, who seek the common good, will be your worst enemies.” But Ms. Alazraki, who has covered five popes, is also operating in a Vatican media environment that follows Italian journalistic practices and ethics. In Italy, the line between press office and reporter is blurry; reporters often share questions in advance and allow sources to vet stories before publication. And in the Vatican, officials also often require that the Vatican’s own cameras do the filming. But what is remarkable in this case is that the pope appears to have been censored in the Vatican’s postproduction process. It is also possible that the Vatican officials who worked closely with Mr. Afineevsky, the film’s director, clued him in to the cut footage. The pope’s penchant for speaking in an off-the-cuff manner has maddened not only supporters and critics, but also his staff in the Roman bureaucracy. He has at times sought to circumvent his media office by personally granting and arranging his own interviews. John Thavis, author of “The Vatican Diaries,” and a veteran church analyst, said some confusion was inevitable with Francis, who was purposefully breaking a centuries-old mold in which popes spoke in an extremely formal and controlled manner. “He recognizes the headline he created yesterday is more important than all the footnoting and cleaning up that comes afterward,” Mr. Thavis said. “His goal is to set a tone, not a policy, so I don’t think he’s worried about the fallout.” But perhaps someone in the Vatican communications office was. Its major force is Andrea Tornielli, a former star Vatican reporter for Italian publications who has helped expand the power and footprint of the Vatican’s new communications department, leaving the press office, which it now oversees, weakened and out of the loop. Another powerful voice is the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest and close ally of the pope, who has vigorously defended him against conservative critics on social media. On Wednesday, Father Spadaro told reporters that the pope’s remarks had been contained in the Televisa interview — leaving it to be later discovered that those remarks never actually aired. Both he and Mr. Tornielli declined to comment on Thursday. Regardless of who may be trying to control the message at the Vatican, it has proved difficult with Francis. “The Vatican attitude toward Pope Francis’ interviews is the same as the White House attitude toward Trump tweets,” said the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and expert on the Vatican bureaucracy. “They would prefer a much more controlled message where they write the speeches and he reads them. He’s just not going to do that.” Jason Horowitz reported from Rome, and Natalie Kitroeff from Mexico City.']","A Mexican broadcast company says Francis made the comments to its correspondent more than a year ago, and people close to the company say the Vatican then edited them out."

"Venezuela Opposition Figure, Long Confined, Flees Country",2020-10-24,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['The Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López fled the country Saturday after spending the past six years in jail, house arrest and diplomatic asylum, his political party said. Mr. López, 49, went to Spain after leaving the Spanish Embassy in Caracas, according to Spain’s Foreign Ministry. He had sought refuge at the Spanish ambassador’s residence after he helped lead a failed uprising against the government in April 2019. A charismatic U.S.-educated former mayor with a piercing glare, Mr. López has for years been one of the most radical opponents of Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro, whom he sought to overthrow through street protests and increasingly desperate palace plots. His maximalist tactics, however, have backfired, leaving the opposition dismantled and increasingly irrelevant to the struggles facing Venezuelans amid one the deepest economic recessions in modern history. Mr. López came nearest his goal in early 2019, when his protégé, Juan Guaidó, a young lawmaker, with the backing of the Parliament, declared himself the country’s interim president, citing Mr. Maduro’s fraudulent re-election. The United States and most European and Latin American countries swiftly backed Mr. Guaidó, cutting the government off from the global economy. Mr. Guaidó and Mr. López called on the military to help them take power, but it largely stood by Mr. Maduro. Mr. Maduro, however, has weathered the challenge and used his control over security forces to gradually suppress the opposition and terrorize its supporters. As Venezuela’s political crisis escalated, sanctions by the Trump administration to aid Mr. Guaidó’s bid for power plunged an already rapidly shrinking Venezuelan economy and its people into a full-scale humanitarian crisis. Mr. López now becomes the latest opposition leader to leave for exile, leaving Mr. Guaidó increasingly isolated. Mr. Guaidó’s term as the speaker of Parliament, on which his claim to the country’s leadership is based, expires in January, threatening to leave the opposition without its last base of support. Mr. López’s party, Popular Will, said its departed leader had pledged his unconditional support for Mr. Guaidó and would continue fighting against Mr. Maduro, who has resorted to torture, extrajudicial killings and legal persecution to maintain his grip on power. “Like other Venezuelans, Leopoldo López is not fully free, as long as there’s a dictatorship that violates human rights of the people,” his party said in a statement Saturday. When Mr. López arrived in Madrid, he was “reunited with his family,” Spain’s foreign ministry said. Lilian Tintori, Mr. López’s wife, had met with President Trump at the White House in early 2017, which help pave the way for his administration’s decision to recognize Mr. Guaidó. Mr. López’s parents have also been living in Madrid as part of a growing diaspora of Venezuelans who have resettled in Spain. His father, also called Leopoldo López, was among the prominent Venezuelans who were granted Spanish citizenship by the previous Spanish conservative government of Mariano Rajoy, and he was elected last year as a member of the European Parliament, representing Spain’s conservative Popular Party. Spain’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. López had taken the “personal and voluntary” decision to leave its embassy in Caracas. After Mr. López fled, the Venezuelan police detained a security guard working at the Spanish embassy. Spain’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that it condemned acts committed by Venezuela’s government against people working at its embassy, including detentions and the raiding of homes, which it said amounted to violations of international diplomatic conventions. Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Mexico City and Raphael Minder reported from Madrid.']","Leopoldo López had spent the past six years in jail, house arrest and diplomatic asylum.

Outcry in Philippines Over General’s ‘Warning’ to Female Celebrities,2020-10-23,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — The 22-year-old actress’s voice broke last week as she talked about being threatened online with rape. She said she worried about the environment that her young nieces would grow up in, and called for creating “a better future for everyone.” This week, a Philippine general said that unless she changed her ways, she could end up dead. The general, Lt. Gen. Antonio Parlade — the de facto head of a military task force fighting a long-running Communist insurgency in the Philippines — directed his criticism not at the remarks made by the actress, Liza Soberano, but at the forum where she made them: an online discussion on the rights of women and girls organized by the youth wing of Gabriela, a women’s rights group that the military claims is tied to Communist guerrillas. (Gabriela denies the accusation.) “Liza Soberano, there’s still a chance to abdicate that group,” General Parlade said on Facebook. Otherwise, he said, she would “suffer the same fate” as Josephine Ann Lapira, a young activist who was killed in a 2017 battle between the military and the Communist rebels, the New People’s Army. The general’s comments led to an outcry from social media users, liberal politicians and the Commission on Human Rights, an independent government body. “Coming from a high-ranking military official, such a statement is a form of suppression and restriction that serves to dissuade those who speak up for their beliefs and advocacies,” a member of the rights commission, Gwendolyn Pimentel-Gana, said on Friday. A lawyer for Ms. Soberano, Jun Lim, said that the actress was “apolitical,” and accused General Parlade of “red-tagging” her — that is, accusing her of being a Communist. “Expressing her love and respect for women and children is her personal advocacy,” Mr. Lim said. General Parlade denied implying that Ms. Soberano was a Communist, saying that he had meant only to warn her against associating with militants. He said he supported women’s rights. But some of the general’s critics said his comments reflected a hostility toward women that is prevalent in President Rodrigo Duterte’s government. In his Facebook remarks, General Parlade also warned another Filipina celebrity — Catriona Gray, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 2018 — against associating with left-leaning activist groups. And he accused Angel Locsin, an outspoken actress, of being involved with the rebels. Ms. Gray, in particular, has been vocal about the government’s crackdown on human rights organizations and its passage of a contentious antiterrorism law that rights groups say was designed to stifle opposition voices. “To Liza and Catriona: It is difficult and painful to be at the front lines fighting beside persons oppressed by a norm that advocates rape, murder and exploitation,” Senator Risa Hontiveros said by telephone. “We will be monitoring him from now on,” Senator Hontiveros said of General Parlade. “He should not use his power as a general and threaten these women.” Mr. Duterte, a self-confessed womanizer, has been repeatedly accused of misogyny. He once joked about the gang rape of an Australian missionary during a prison riot in the southern Philippines, saying that he should have been allowed to participate. The New People’s Army, the armed wing of the country’s Communist Party, has been waging guerrilla warfare since 1969. Mr. Duterte, who calls himself a leftist and who once studied under the party’s founder, Jose Maria Sison, wooed the rebels to the negotiating table soon after taking office and had hoped to complete a peace deal before stepping down in 2022. But the relationship soured, with the rebels and the military accusing each other of continuing to foment violence. Mr. Duterte scrapped the peace talks and said he would resume them only if Mr. Sison returned to the Philippines from self-imposed exile in the Netherlands. Gabriela, the country’s most prominent women’s rights organization, has denied having ties to the Communist Party or the rebels. Arlene Brosas, a Philippine lawmaker who is a member of Gabriela, said the military was using a “rehashed script” to attack the group. “Our 20 years of advancing women and children’s rights inside and outside of Congress cannot be smeared by their repeated lies,” she said. Ms. Soberano is a popular film and television actress whose breakthrough came with “Forevermore,” a soap opera on the ABS-CBN network. On Friday, ABS-CBN issued statements in support of both Ms. Soberano and Ms. Locsin, who also appears on the network. In the online discussion last week, Ms. Soberano became emotional as she talked about supportive messages she had received from women after filing a criminal complaint against someone alleged to have posted a rape threat against her on social media. “I cried when they sent me those messages,” she said, “because I didn’t realize how many women were struggling to stand up for themselves.”']","Accusing a women’s rights group of ties to Communist rebels, the general told an actress she could be killed if she associated with the organization."
Israel Sees Warming Ties With Sudan as Symbolic Progress in Hostile Region,2020-10-24,By David M. Halbfinger and Ronen Bergman,"['JERUSALEM — For Israel, the move toward normalization of ties with Sudan does not represent the same kind of landmark strategic achievement as the peace treaties decades ago with Egypt and Jordan, once-bitter Arab enemies on its borders. Nor does the move open up major new economic opportunities, as did Israel’s two new pacts with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, brokered by the Trump administration in August. About all that Israelis could truly savor in Friday’s announcement by President Trump that he had fostered another diplomatic breakthrough was its symbolic value: Sudan was the scene of the Arab League’s defiant 1967 Khartoum Resolution. Soon after Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War, the league’s members all vowed in the resolution “No to peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel.” Suddenly, Sudan, of all the Arab countries, was saying yes to all of the above. In that sense, even the limited economic and trade relations that President Trump ballyhooed on Friday as a victory “for peace in the world” would drive another nail in the coffin of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s old strategy of maintaining Arab solidarity behind the rejection of Israel until the Palestinians establish a state. The step toward normalizing relations with Israel would also cement a Sudanese strategic realignment begun in 2015, when after decades as an ally of Iran, the African nation abruptly took Saudi Arabia’s side in the Yemen civil war and broke off relations with Tehran the following year. “That was the great turnover, or the tipping point,” said Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, a veteran Israeli military strategist at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “When they moved over from being a hub of Iranian weapons proliferation to Gaza to at least siding on the right side of the Gulf, that’s a substantial thing,” he added. “When it becomes a diplomatic achievement for Israel,” he said, “it’s also nice.” Dore Gold, a former director-general of Israel’s foreign ministry with extensive experience in Africa, said that Israel and Sudan now were like-minded in wanting to deny Iran, which he said once had effective control of Port Sudan, a strategic presence in the Red Sea. Beyond that, he said, “I think there’s a cumulative impact every time you get another country, especially one of the largest in Africa, both in population and geographic expanse.” As a practical matter, détente with Sudan could open up a new, if modest, market for Israel’s agricultural, arms and medical industries, experts said. Overflight rights for Israel could also shorten some flights from Tel Aviv to southern Africa or Latin America. Some analysts also said that, with its expertise at desalination and desert-climate irrigation, Israel could play a role in helping Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia resolve their longstanding differences over the Blue Nile. Ethiopia is building a huge, $4.6 billion dam on the river, one that Mr. Trump suggested on Friday that Egypt “will end up blowing up” — a comment that enraged Ethiopian leaders. But there were few illusions in Israel about what was motivating the Trump administration to race to Friday’s announcement less than two weeks before Election Day. Privately, government officials said that aiding Israel could help Mr. Trump peel off some Jewish voters in pivotal swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump used the announcement of the Sudan-Israel agreement to ridicule his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, from the Oval Office on Friday. “Do you think Sleepy Joe could have made this deal, Bibi? Sleepy Joe?” Mr. Trump asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in a call that was televised on cable news. Perhaps mindful of polls showing the Democratic challenger in the lead, Mr. Netanyahu, who is facing his own political crisis, demurred from attacking Mr. Biden. “We appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America,” he replied. “And we appreciate what you’ve done enormously.” Irit Bak, a Sudan expert who leads the African Studies department at Tel Aviv University, said she was disgusted by the two embattled leaders’ use of “the situation in Sudan, which is so desperate,” to help themselves politically. Ms. Bak warned that normalizing ties with Israel carried great peril for the leaders of Sudan, a country with a long history of Islamism. Any blowback could be dangerous for the fragile transitional government, which came to power after the ouster last year of the longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Relations between Israel and Sudan have long been a roller-coaster ride, frequently colorful, generally covert, and often confrontational. In 1948, a small detachment of troops from Sudan, then under Anglo-Egyptian rule, were among the Arab armies Israel fought against in its war of independence. After Sudan gained independence in 1956, Israel secretly aided the Anyanya separatist rebels in southern Sudan, partly to pin down as many Egyptian forces as possible, who were aiding the Muslim central government in Khartoum. And Sudan sent a small contingent of troops to aid Egyptian forces in the 1967 war with Israel. In the 1970s, Israeli pilots operating from Uganda and Kenya flew arms to the Anyanya forces, and Israeli agents on the ground helped them ambush government soldiers and bomb bridges on the Nile. In the late 1970s and 1980s, tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews migrated to Sudan in hopes of getting to Israel, and Israeli spies mounted a series of daring operations to spirit them away under the noses of Sudanese authorities. The operation was managed from a hotel on the Sudanese coast, used as cover for Mossad agents, in a clandestine operation depicted in the 2019 film “The Red Sea Diving Resort.” In the 1980s, Israeli officials briefly plotted with Gen. Jaafar al-Nimeiry, the Sudanese leader, to stockpile weapons in his country to be used to try to overthrow the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. And in 1984, bribes to General al-Nimeiry and his security chief led the Sudanese to turn a blind eye as Israel airlifted 30,000 more Ethiopian Jews from Khartoum. Still, in 1985, according to Milton Bearden, then the C.I.A. station chief in Khartoum, two Mossad agents involved in the Ethiopian rescue operations were forced to take refuge in his home. They were eventually smuggled out of Sudan in cargo crates fitted with oxygen tanks, he said in an interview. The 1989 coup by Mr. al-Bashir, however, led Sudan to take a sharp turn toward Islamism and enter into a long alliance with Iran, which used Sudan to funnel weapons to Hamas in Gaza. Beginning in 2009, Israel conducted airstrikes in Sudan against suspected arms convoys, and in 2012 it bombed a munitions depot in Khartoum, lighting up the night skies. In a more recent bit of derring-do, the Mossad sent a private plane loaded with medical gear and doctors to Khartoum to try to save an influential diplomat, Najwa Gadaheldam, when she became ill with Covid-19 in May. She did not survive. It was Ms. Gadaheldam who had helped initiate the first public meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and the Sudanese military leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in Kampala, Uganda, in February. David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem and Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv.']","Sudan holds historic significance for Israeli leaders because it was the scene of a landmark resolution by Arab states that vowed to shun Israel.

President Andrzej Duda of Poland Tests Positive for Coronavirus,2020-10-24,By Monika Pronczuk and Tess Felder,"['BRUSSELS — President Andrzej Duda of Poland has tested positive for Covid-19 and will go into quarantine, his spokesman said on Saturday, adding to the list of global leaders who have been infected as coronavirus cases rise unabated in several world hot spots. “The president is feeling well,” the spokesman, Blazej Spychalski, said of Mr. Duda. The head of the presidential office said that it would “probably compile a list of the president’s contacts,” adding that this was “a new situation.” The country’s de facto leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, also went into self-isolation this week, after learning that he had been in contact with someone infected with the virus. A government spokesman said that Mr. Kaczynski, the 71-year-old leader of the governing Law and Justice Party, “feels well and will continue performing his duties from home.” Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are experiencing among the most severe outbreaks in Europe. This second wave of infection has led Poland’s government to impose new restrictions on public life starting on Saturday and to convert the country’s national stadium in Warsaw into a temporary field hospital with room for 500 coronavirus patients. Mr. Duda visited the stadium on Friday and met with site managers, an encounter that has now raised concerns that the construction will have to be halted. He also met Iga Swiatek, who this month became the first Polish female tennis player to win the French Open. Although Mr. Duda wore a mask and gloves during his stadium visit, Mr. Kaczynski did not wear a mask while handing out an award at a ceremony last week, and briefly removed his mask while being sworn in as deputy prime minister on Oct. 6. Other world leaders who have contracted the virus have taken casual approaches to masks or resisted them. President Trump, who throughout the pandemic has largely shunned the use of face masks and social distancing practices, removed his mask during a public appearance this month despite having fallen ill with the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who in March boasted of shaking hands with “everyone” while visiting a hospital that was treating coronavirus patients, adopted a more somber approach after being hospitalized with the virus himself. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil continued to question the merits of lockdown measures even after contracting a mild case of the virus. In Poland, which largely avoided the first wave of the pandemic by imposing an early lockdown in March, nearly a third of its approximately 215,000 total cases have emerged in the past week. The country, which Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki designated as a “red zone” at a news conference on Friday, has also had more than 4,000 recorded deaths from the virus. There are concerns about how Poland’s underfunded health care system will cope with the growing number of virus patients. In addition to plans to turn the national stadium into a field hospital, the government said that temporary virus hospitals would be also built in major cities. At the news conference, Mr. Morawiecki also announced new restrictions that came into effect on Saturday. The government ordered all cafes, bars and restaurants to close, except for take out, and gyms and swimming pools were also shut. Residents must use face coverings outside their homes, and remote teaching will become a norm for older children in primary schools, as well as in high schools and at universities. Young people up to 16 years old are not allowed outside from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. without adult supervision under the new measures, and socializing in groups of more than five is forbidden. The government also asked that people over 70 stay home. “We are far away from the comfort zone,” Adam Niedzielski, the health minister, said during the news conference. Monika Pronczuk reported from Brussels, and Tess Felder from London. Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting from Warsaw.']",A spokesman said the head of state was feeling well despite a positive test result.

"She Used to Clean City Hall. Now, She Runs It.",2020-10-24,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['POVALIKHINO, Russia — With election day looming, Nikolai Loktev was in a panic: The mayor of a tiny village of log houses, wood-burning stoves and rutted dirt roads 300 miles east of Moscow, he was running for re-election unopposed. In a Western democracy, this would not necessarily set off alarms; it might even be welcomed. But in Russia, where elections are rigged and the ruling United Russia party virtually always wins, the bedrock political principle is to create the illusion of democratic choice. For that, Mr. Loktev needed an opponent. But it was proving difficult to find one in the village. He had already asked a number of Povalikhino’s residents, including his assistant at city hall and a member of the Communist Party who had run and lost in elections in 2011, but both declined. When he finally found who he thought was a willing patsy in the person of one Marina Udgodskaya, who cleans city hall, he thought his troubles were over. But then she won. Nobody was more surprised than Ms. Udgodskaya, who did not campaign and who said she had agreed to run in the election last month only to help her boss. “He just needed somebody else, anybody at all, so the election could take place,” Ms. Udgodskaya said. At first, she said, she was “worried and confused” when the results rolled in, but she is now quite clearly warming to the idea of the mayoralty. “You shouldn’t expect anything in an election,” she said. She agreed to be sworn in, more than doubling her salary to 29,000 rubles, or about $380 a month, and settled into the mayor’s office in city hall before isolating at home last week because of a coronavirus scare. As a first order of business — after finding her replacement as cleaner, that is — she plans to bring streetlights to the village, she said, something that people have long been asking for. The goings-on in Povalikhino precipitated a Russian media frenzy, focusing predictably on the farcical nature of it all. But by illuminating the essential cynicism that is gnawing away at democracy around the world, the election of Ms. Udgodskaya served a more serious purpose. Apart from in a few Arab monarchies and the remaining Communist dictatorships in places like North Korea, democratic elections are the only method in almost all the world today for legitimizing political power. That’s why Russia, a number of other former Soviet states and a growing number of countries practice so-called managed democracy, where elections take place on schedule, like clockwork, but the incumbent virtually never loses. To achieve this, the police squelch real political opposition, and election commissions bump promising candidates off the ballot with technicalities — such as an electoral ban in Russia against the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who was also incapacitated with poison before this year’s local elections. These repressive measures have proven to be effective — sometimes too effective. The problem then becomes finding supposed opponents to play the role of losers, to keep up the facade of democratic process. In Russia, Vladimir V. Putin has won the presidency three times against the same hapless candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, a humorless man with a droning, wooden voice conveniently put forward by the Communist Party. In 2018, Mr. Putin ran against a lineup that included his reputed goddaughter, Ksenia Sobchak, who of course also lost. In Turkmenistan, the president once ran against his minister of water resources. In Kazakhstan in 2011, a candidate running against the president endorsed the president. “I didn’t want to become president because that is not possible,” the Kazakh presidential candidate, Mels Yeleusizov, said in an unusually candid interview at the time of his role as a fig leaf of democratic process. Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst with the Moscow Carnegie Center, said that in Russia, political advisers to the Kremlin keep a close eye on national and local politics, scouting for talent for both pro-government candidates and for those who can plausibly and safely play the role of losers. “This is one of the instruments of legitimizing elections in Russia,” Mr. Kolesnikov said in a telephone interview of fielding weak opponents. “They look like elections without being real elections.” The system does occasionally cough up the wrong result. In the Siberian region of Khabarovsk, an opposition candidate won the governorship and was later arrested, touching off months of protests. “In small communities, such breakdowns can happen,” Mr. Kolesnikov said. That, of course, is what happened in Povalikhino. Irina Nechayeva, the mayor’s assistant, said it wasn’t so much the assumed hopelessness of running against Mr. Loktev that turned off most people but, in fact, the remote possibility of winning. “You have to listen to everybody’s point of view,” Ms. Ivanova said of the mayor’s role, “and in Russia, there are as many opinions as there are people.” Ms. Udgodskaya, 35, lives with her husband, a day laborer, and two teenage children in a cozy, if weather beaten, house, raising chickens, ducks, rabbits and geese in the backyard. In an interview, she said she was never interested in politics and had no idea whether her story reflected any larger issues. “I like farming,” she said. In Povalikhino, logging trucks rumble through town, sending up splashes of dirty water from potholes on the main street. To get around, the residents navigate a maze of wooden walkways to stay above the swampy ground, passing garden plots and cow pastures. Tatyana Murzina, a clerk in the village store, said Ms. Udgodskaya stood a chance only because the village is small enough that people knew her personally and liked her. “Everything was clear to us,” Ms. Murzina said. Vladimir Yeltsov, 62, a retired trucker, said he voted for Ms. Udgodskaya, “though I pity her,” because the village budget never has enough to fix the roads. The former mayor, Mr. Loktev, actually did a good job repairing water mains, he said, but was such an introvert he rarely talked to people. “He didn’t show he cared,” Mr. Yeltsov said. Mr. Loktev declined to be interviewed. Tamara Lokteva, his wife, said in an interview outside their tidy blue house that the loss was a “very painful topic.” Ms. Lokteva said that her husband never really wanted to be mayor and never clung to power. He now blames her for encouraging him to run twice, and for the way things turned out. “He always says, ‘You got me into this.’”']",
"Indigenous Colombians, Facing New Wave of Brutality, Demand Government Action",2020-10-24,By Julie Turkewitz and Sofía Villamil,"['Protesters descended by the thousands on Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, this week, horrified by a brutal wave of violence sweeping the country, one so intense that mass killings have taken place every other day on average. Most traveled hundreds of miles, from the rural Indigenous communities that have been particularly ravaged by the violence, which they trace to government failures to protect them under the country’s halting peace process. They call their movement the “minga Indígena.” Minga is an Indigenous word, one used long before the Spanish arrived in South America, to refer to an act of communal work, an agreement between neighbors to build something together: a bridge, a road, a government. But minga has also come to mean a collective act of protest, a call to recover what a community believes it has lost: territory, peace, lives. And the protests, which lasted all week, punctuated by a large march on Wednesday, have amounted to an extended, cooperative howl. “If we don’t stand before the world and say, ‘This is happening,’” said Ermes Pete, 38, an Indigenous leader from the country’s southwest, “we will be exterminated.” The demonstrations are another sign of public frustration and anger over the pace of peace in Colombia. Four years ago, the government signed a historic peace deal with the country’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, ending the longest-running conflict in the Americas. The accord called for the Colombian government to provide basic services — education, health care and safety — in areas battered by the long civil war. But many protesters said that when the FARC moved out of their communities, the government never moved in. Instead, new criminal groups arrived. “We fear for our lives,” said one protester, Samay Sacha, 61, “and that is why we are here.” Protesters — many of them farmers, teachers and community organizers from small towns — arrived by bus, pooling their salaries to rent colorful vehicles called “chivas,” and leaving children and jobs back home. They camped in a sports arena provided by the city, or on the grass outside, and gathered around fires to cook, plan and share stories. As new criminal groups have moved into former FARC territory, Indigenous communities, often located on drug routes and in areas rich with minerals and timber, have been among the most vulnerable. The criminal groups have used deadly violence to stifle dissent and discourage people from working with rivals. Community leaders who speak out against the brutality have become targets. This year alone, at least 233 civic leaders have been killed, according to the human rights group Indepaz. More than 1,000 have died since the peace accord was signed. Mass killings, defined as three or more deaths, have shot up as well. Indepaz has counted 68 this year, with a marked uptick between July and September. The killings come after decades of strife in which communities were squeezed between the FARC and the military in a war that left well over 200,000 dead and displaced an estimated six million people. Many thought they would find relief after the peace accord. But that has not always been the case. “After the peace deal, the war worsened,” said Aida Quilcue, a leader in the Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia, a union of the country’s Indigenous groups. Protesters demanded a meeting with President Iván Duque, a conservative elected after the adoption of the 2016 peace accord, which his party had opposed on grounds it was too lenient on the FARC. Mr. Duque’s critics have accused him of not doing enough to carry out the deal, pointing out, for example, that only a limited number of families have been able to participate in a program that would help them switch from growing coca — the plant used to make cocaine — to legal products. Many have continued growing coca, and drug trafficking and associated violence have proliferated around them. Mr. Duque did not meet with the minga in Bogotá, instead sending a delegation to meet with people in the country’s southwest, which has been hard hit by the violence. His office said that it was spending millions of dollars to address the problem. In an interview earlier this year, his high commissioner for peace, Miguel Ceballos, urged Colombians to be patient with the peace process. “Give the man a chance,” he said, speaking of Mr. Duque, who took office in 2018. “We cannot undo 56 years of war in just two years.” Mr. Pete, one of the protest leaders, recalled growing up with war in his home in the department of Cauca, the FARC sleeping on his doorstep. At the time, the military accused his family of collaborating with the guerrillas — and the guerrillas accused them of collaborating with the military. Some days, he would watch helicopters fly overhead. Occasionally, bullets would rain down. The violence pushed Mr. Pete to run for a leadership position in his community, and when the FARC left, he urged his neighbors to abandon coca cultivation. He thought the state would move in to protect them. “The state,” he said, “never arrived.” Mr. Pete soon became a target himself. In 2017, as he left his home, two men began to shoot at him. He hit the ground, and survived. Another protester, Bertha Rivera, 53, came to Bogotá from an Indigenous territory nearly 400 miles away. She slept in a tent overnight at the arena. The following day, she marched with the minga through the streets of the capital. “We had so many dreams,” she said of the peace process. “It was, ‘Now we won’t hear the dead, we won’t hear the bombs, we won’t hear the threats.’” She went on: “When we were just beginning ‘peace,’ we thought it was the best thing, and though we had heard from other nations that the post-conflict era was often more difficult than the conflict itself, we didn’t believe it.” “Today,” she said, “we understand that they were right.”']","“If we don’t stand before the world and say, ‘This is happening,’ we will be exterminated,” a protest leader said.

E.U. Says Veggie Burgers Can Keep Their Name,2020-10-23,By Isabella Kwai,"['LONDON — When is a burger not a burger? When it contains no meat. At least according to a divisive proposal that was in front of the European Parliament this week, part of a set of measures that would have banned the use of terms like “steak,” “sausage,” “escallop” or “burger” on labels for plant-based alternative products. But after a decisive vote against the measure on Friday, it seems veggie burgers will still be on the menu. “Reason prevailed, and climate sinners lost,” Nikolaj Villumsen, a member of the European Parliament from Denmark posted on Twitter. “It’s worth celebrating with a veggie burger.” A proposal to expand a ban on descriptions such as “yogurt-style” or “cream imitation” for nondairy replacements did pass, extending previous limitations on the use of words like “milk” and “butter” on nondairy alternatives. The proposed changes — a small part of a package of agricultural measures — received more attention than perhaps desired either by their proponents among meat and livestock groups, who said they would prefer to focus on helping farmers work sustainably, or the environmentalists and food manufacturers opposing it, for whom it is a distraction from climate-change policy. Jasmijn de Boo, vice president of ProVeg International, a group aimed at reducing meat consumption, said that the proposal was not in the interest of consumers or manufacturers, and that shoppers were not confused by the labels currently on store shelves. “Why change something to a ‘veggie disc’ or ‘tube’ instead of a sausage?” she said. “It’s ridiculous.” Those in favor of the change said that labeling plant-based products with meat terms were misleading and could open the door for other confusing labels. “We simply call for the work of millions of European farmers and livestock sector workers to be acknowledged and respected,” Jean-Pierre Fleury, the chairman of Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest farming lobby group, said in a statement this month. He described the use of meatlike names for plant-based products as “cultural hijacking.” The decision is a victory for environmental advocates over an E.U. farming lobby that is one of the strongest voices in the bloc and plays an outsize role in policymaking, considering that the sector has been shrinking for years. Camille Perrin, the senior food policy officer at the European Consumer Organization, called decision “great news” and a “common sense” vote. “Consumers are in no way confused by a soy steak or chickpea-based sausage, so long as it is clearly labeled as vegetarian or vegan,” she said in a statement after the vote. “Terms such as ‘burger’ or ‘steak’ on plant-based items simply make it much easier for consumers to know how to integrate these products within a meal.” It is not the first debate over plant-based foods as that sector has exploded in recent years. Labels for plant-based dairy alternatives like “soy milk” or “tofu butter” are illegal in the bloc after dairy producers won a 2017 ruling backed by the European Court of Justice. In 2018, France banned the use of meat terms to describe vegetarian products. In dozens of states in the United States, advocates of vegetarian food have clashed with farmers and lobbyists over legislation that makes it illegal for plant-based products to be called meat. Several parties in the European Parliament had also submitted proposals with different caveats since the initial amendment was introduced, and those are still to be voted on. Manufacturers like Beyond Meat, Unilever and Ikea, along with the European Medical Association, have opposed the changes, which they described in an open letter as “disproportionate and out of step with the current climate.” Many said that approving the amendment would be counter to a goal set by the European Parliament this month to reduce carbon emissions 60\u2009percent by 2030. And shoppers seem to like the names. In a 2020 survey from the European Consumer Organization, about 42 percent of respondents said they believed “meaty” names for plant-based products should be permitted if products were clearly labeled vegetarian or vegan. Twenty-five percent said that such names should be banned. A spokesman for Copa-Cogeca said the organization did not believe that shoppers could not tell the difference between meat and plant-based products, and said that farmers were not against vegetable alternatives. But he said that differentiating the markets — much like those of butter and margarine — was among a host of initiatives that would support struggling farmers who are trying to adapt to a world more focused on sustainability. Some said the proposal would provide more fodder for what critics call the European Union’s penchant for overregulation. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, said the bloc should legislate only “where there are impediments to the free movement of goods, services, money and people.” He described the amendment as “overkill” that would bolster the arguments of those who campaigned for Britain’s exit from the bloc: “This is one of these symbolic sad cases — a bit like legislating on the curve of cucumbers.”']",The European Parliament voted on Friday on proposals that would have banned products without meat from being labeled burgers or sausages.
Deadly Explosion Hits Kabul Tutoring Center,2020-10-24,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — A deadly explosion struck a tutoring center in Kabul on Saturday, puncturing a relatively peaceful period in the Afghan capital even as violence has spiraled upward in the countryside. Tariq Arian, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, said at least 24 people were killed and 57 others wounded in the attack. He said the explosion happened in an alley leading to an educational center called Kawsar e Danish. Mr. Arian said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber on foot who was stopped before he could enter the educational center and detonated his explosives at the entrance. “Ambulances are still transferring the bodies,” said Abuzar Motaqi, head of the main hospital in the area. “ Most of them are very young.” Kabul has recently been spared the large attacks that had once struck the capital regularly. But Saturday’s explosion comes amid an intensifying wave of violence happening elsewhere across the country as peace talks continue in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The Taliban, in a statement issued soon after the explosion, denied they were behind the Kabul bombing. Recent appeals from Afghan leaders and American diplomats for a reduction of violence to allow for progress in negotiations have proved futile. Insurgents have launched bloody assaults across the country that have killed dozens of people, both security personnel and civilians, on a daily basis. Civilians often bear the brunt of the violence. In eastern Ghazni province, a Taliban roadside bomb was detonated early Saturday morning as a civilian and a police vehicle were passing through the area. At least eight civilians and one police officer were killed, according to Wahidullah Jumazada, the spokesman for the governor of Ghazni. After the United States in February agreed to begin withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban and the Afghan government finally came to the negotiating table last month. But since then, the two sides have been stuck in preliminary discussions on the rules and regulations that will govern their negotiations. In the area west of Kabul city where the Kawsar education center is based, soft civilian targets such as learning centers, wedding halls and hospitals have been repeatedly attacked in recent years. Most of those attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State offshoot in Afghanistan. While the Islamic State’s stronghold in eastern Afghanistan has been nearly dismantled by government military operations, the group remains a threat in urban centers. Afghan officials say the group has changed its tactics by splitting into small cells that communicate with sophisticated technology, making the monitoring of them difficult.']","At least 24 people were killed and 57 wounded in latest attack, which happened as peace talks are at an impasse and as violence rises across Afghanistan."
"As Lawlessness Roils Nigeria, Police Chief Vows to Take Back Streets",2020-10-24,By Shola Lawal,"['LAGOS — Nigeria’s police chief on Saturday ordered the mobilization of all police resources to reclaim public space after more than two weeks of peaceful protests over police brutality gave way to widespread vandalism and looting. The order came four days after the police and soldiers fired on demonstrators, killing 12 and injuring hundreds in an upscale Lagos neighborhood. The protesters are demanding that the government dismantle and discipline a police unit known as SARS, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which for years has been known for detaining, brutalizing and stealing from citizens, particularly young people. Tuesday’s violent crackdown on protesters, combined with a nighttime curfew imposed in its wake and protest leaders urging people to stay home, have largely cleared peaceful demonstrators from the streets of Lagos. But following the shootings, which outraged Nigerians, at least 17 police stations were destroyed in Lagos, according to a police spokesman. Widespread looting has also taken place, including at government warehouses stocked with food. Malls, TV stations and banks have been targeted as well as retail stores in popular shopping districts in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial and cultural hub. “Enough is enough to all acts of lawlessness, disruption of public peace and order and wanton violence which have resulted in indiscriminate looting of shops, malls and warehouses, damage to property and loss of lives in some parts of the country,” said the police chief, M.A. Adamu, in a statement on Saturday evening. Additional police units are being deployed to all 36 states, Mr. Adamu said. He added that the police would “use all legitimate means to halt the further slide into lawlessness and brigandage.” Violence and looting were also reported in other states. On Saturday, the governor of the southwestern state of Osun, Adegboyega Oyetola, imposed a 24-hour curfew “to forestall the breakdown of law and order and protect the lives and property of citizens and residents.” Dozens have died in the protests against police brutality that started Oct. 8, with 38 killed across the country on Tuesday alone, Amnesty International said. The turmoil has been the worst street violence since Nigeria’s return to civilian rule in 1999. Many of the demonstrators have been middle-class, well-educated young people in the southern and central cities, and are too young to remember the military rule that ended two decades ago. The government has promised to reform the police force in the wake of the protests, but President Muhammadu Buhari has been criticized for not mentioning Tuesday’s shooting and for warning Nigerians against “undermining national security.” He further inflamed the protesters Friday by saying security forces have exercised “extreme restraint” in handling the situation. Mr. Buhari has said 51 civilians have been killed, along with 11 police officers and seven soldiers since the protests began. Protesters said the surge in violence this week could damage their peaceful efforts at reform and allow the government to cast the movement as having been hijacked by criminal elements. “The lootings don’t put us in a good light,” said Chiamaka Ebochue, 27, a protester in Lagos. “We have to take this loss and restrategize. We need to be aware of our voting rights — that’s the only ammunition we have.” Tony Iyare contributed reporting from Lagos. ']","As protests against police brutality have subsided after a violent crackdown, they have been followed by a wave of looting and vandalism that the police have vowed to end."
"For Italy’s masked rap diva, an era of face coverings poses a dilemma.",2020-10-23,By Jason Horowitz,"['When the pandemic first hit Italy and masks became scarce, Myss Keta, the mysterious Queen of the Milan Night, came to the rescue. The Italian rapper, performance artist and L.G.B.T.Q. icon had amassed a vast collection of face coverings that she wore for years to hide her identity. So she began distributing them to her friends in need. “I had so many,” she said. “Surgical, cloth, vinyl, silk, whatever material.” This month, with a second wave of the coronavirus rising and Italy requiring the wearing of masks in public at all times, grandparents, politicians, middle-management businesspeople, doctors, lawyers, delivery people — just about everyone — is covering up. That has rendered Myss Keta — whose use of masks took her from underground clubs to the cusp of national, if incognito, celebrity — an improbable authority on life behind the surgical veil. It has also threatened to strip her of her defining shtick. “Before, it was a distinguishing characteristic. Now, it’s something we all have in common,” she said as she lifted a black surgical mask — the casual black T-shirt of her vast collection — to sip a Bloody Mary at Bar Basso in  Milan. Under her trademark blond bangs, her eyes remained covered as usual in dark Givenchy sunglasses. It used to be only the front-row fans at her concerts who emulated her by wearing masks. “Now, everyone seems like a Myss fan,” she said.']",
"A resurgent virus attacks the heartland, just before the election.",2020-10-23,"By Eileen Sullivan, Albert Sun, Sarah Mervosh and Rebecca Halleck","['The latest coronavirus surge is raging across the American heartland, most acutely in the Midwest and Mountain West. This harrowing third surge, which led to a U.S. single-day record of more than 85,000 new cases on Friday, is happening less than two weeks from Election Day, which will mark the end of a campaign dominated by the pandemic and President Trump’s much-criticized response to it. As of Friday evening, 15 states had added more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch of the pandemic: Wisconsin, a battleground in the presidential election, Colorado, Kentucky, Illinois, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, Alaska, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and North Dakota. And four states had added more deaths in the past week than in previous weeks: Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota and Oklahoma. North Dakota leads the nation in coronavirus cases per capita. Illinois is averaging more than 4,400 new cases per day, up 90 percent from the average two weeks ago. And Pennsylvania, another battleground state, on Friday reported a record of 2,258 cases. The virus will be front of mind for voters in several key states, including Ohio, where more people are hospitalized than at any other time during the pandemic, and Wisconsin, home to seven of the country’s 10 metro areas with the highest numbers of recent cases. On Friday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked Gov. Tony Evers’ emergency order restricting the size of indoor gatherings to 25 percent capacity. Citing a rise in hospitalizations across the state, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced a strengthening of coronavirus restrictions in certain counties, capping gatherings at 10 people from no more than two separate households. For the fourth straight day, Colorado on Saturday announced a single-day record for new cases (five more states also set records Saturday). Overnight, nearly 2,500 people were hospitalized in Illinois, the state’s top public health official, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, said in a news conference Friday afternoon. The mayor of Chicago, Lori E. Lightfoot, announced a curfew on nonessential businesses beginning at 10 p.m. on Friday. In the final presidential debate on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that the virus was “going away” as he defended his management of the pandemic. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, attacked Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis, calling for much more aggressive federal action for the “dark winter” ahead. Mr. Trump and many supporters blame restrictions on business activity, often imposed by Democratic governors and mayors, for prolonging the economic crisis initially caused by the virus. But the experience of states like Iowa, which recently set a record for patients hospitalized with Covid-19, shows the economy is far from back to normal even in Republican-led states that have imposed few business restrictions. Iowa was one of only a handful of states that never imposed a full stay-at-home order. Restaurants, movie theaters, hair salons and bars were allowed to reopen starting in May, earlier than in most states. Many businesses worry they won’t be able to make it through the winter without more help from Congress. Others have already failed. Defying the guidance of infectious disease experts, who say that universal masking and social distancing are essential to limiting the virus’s spread, has eroded support for both Mr. Trump and Gov. Kim Reynolds in Iowa, especially among voters over 65, normally a solid Republican constituency, according to public and private polls. Mr. Trump and Senator Joni Ernst — whose seat could play a decisive role in determining control of the Senate — are both in tight races in a state that the president easily won four years ago.']",
Trump continues to take swipes at pandemic-stricken New York.,2020-10-23,By Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Maggie Haberman,"['In the final weeks of the presidential race, President Trump cannot seem to stop harping on New York City. “Look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town,” he said at the debate on Thursday night. “For so many years I loved it, it was vibrant. It’s dying, everyone is leaving New York.” For the president, belittling New York seems to serve two purposes: It appeals to his base as a campaign strategy, and allows him to address personal scores with his foes. While many New Yorkers feel that Mr. Trump has turned his back on the city, the feeling is mutual with Mr. Trump. The city overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There were protests when he returned to Trump Tower. His name was stripped from skyscrapers. Democratic prosecutors in New York are digging into his family’s finances, and Democratic leaders, like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, frequently accuse him of betraying his hometown. The president is now balking at granting New York more coronavirus recovery funds, despite entreaties from Representative Peter T. King to reconsider. But the constant taunting from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio — including painting “Black Lives Matter” on the street in front of Trump Tower — does not help, Mr. King said. In May, Mr. Trump said that he would visit New York City, where more than 20,000 people have died from the coronavirus, “when things calm down.” He has not done so. Jesse Garcia, a county Republican leader on Long Island, said Mr. Trump had shown his love for the city by providing relief funds through the $2 trillion CARES Act in March and sending the Navy hospital ship U.S.N.S. Comfort to the city, along with the Army Corps of Engineers.']",
Here’s a look at Vermont’s approach to the virus.,2020-10-23,,"['In today’s edition of the Morning newsletter, David Leonhardt writes: The coronavirus is spreading more rapidly in rural areas of the U.S. than in urban areas. But one rural state continues to do a fabulous job keeping the virus away: Vermont. The starkest sign of Vermont’s success is that it has not recorded a single Covid-19 death in more than two months. Vermont is succeeding partly because it has not allowed the virus to become a partisan issue. The Republican governor, Phil Scott — unlike many other Republican politicians around the country — has consistently told people to take the virus seriously. “He started wearing a mask early in the pandemic and has stood at the back of the room in many of the state’s coronavirus briefings, letting Dr. Mark Levine, Vermont’s answer to Dr. Anthony Fauci, dominate proceedings,” Bill McKibben, a Vermont resident, wrote in The New Yorker. Vermont also benefits from having a high degree of social trust among its residents, as Maria Sacchetti explained in The Washington Post. And Vermont has two strong local media organizations — VTDigger and Seven Days — that keep residents informed and that both took an intriguing step early in the pandemic, McKibben notes: They shut down their comments sections, to prevent misinformation from spreading.']",
Swimming to Sanity in Melbourne’s Lockdown,2020-10-23,By Yan Zhuang,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Yan Zhuang, a new reporter with the Australia bureau. As Melbourne fights its way out of one of the longest and strictest coronavirus lockdowns in the world, outdoor pools have been one of the few facilities allowed to reopen. The week that my local pool opened, the weather was miserable with temperatures below the 60s, but every time slot was still booked full days in advance. Even in its second week of operation, the only available time was 6 a.m. — which is how I ended up stifling my yawn as we filed into the center with the sky still dark. I’m pretty apathetic toward pools — why bother, when we’re surrounded by some of the best beaches in the world? But they’re embedded in my childhood. Upon moving to Australia from China, my parents diligently signed me up for lessons at the local pool to make sure I fit in with the other kids. Primary and high school were marked by yearly swimming carnivals, during which I usually sat as far away from the action as possible and caught up on homework. Still, I jumped on this opportunity, eager for something to break up the monotony of lockdown life. It felt like an adventure to venture outside the four walls of my house and the well-trodden path to the supermarket that my world has narrowed down to in the past few months. Precautions were in place. When booking, I had to confirm that I didn’t have any coronavirus symptoms. Each swimmer’s temperature was taken upon entering the center. We couldn’t use the change rooms or showers. We had 50 minutes to swim, after which the center staff would spend 10 minutes sanitizing the pool. The scent of chlorine hit my nose as I slipped into the bath-warm water. I had to stop halfway through my first lap to take a breather — apparently the daily walks I’ve been taking haven’t been as effective at keeping me fit as I’d hoped. My lane-mate and I commiserated over how out of shape we were although she still managed two laps for every one that I swam. Like many, my roommate far prefers the beach to the pool. When I mentioned where I was going, she commented: “The warm water — body temperature — reminds you of what other bodily fluids are circulating in there.” She’s not wrong. It’s a far cry from the bracing chill and crashing waves of the beaches that backdrop Australian life. The sanitized stillness of the pool is a poor substitute for sinking your feet into soft sand as wind stings your eyes and feeling like you’re standing at the edge of the world. It feels like a partial freedom, like so many things in Melbourne these days. Even with the weekend’s easing of restrictions, our lives are still limited. We’re now able to travel 25 kilometers from home instead of just 5 kilometers. Up to 10 people from two households can now meet outdoors. But for people like my roommate and I, whose friends mostly come from households of one or two, this doesn’t make much of a difference. Police drones will still hover in our skies this weekend to ensure no one is holding big celebrations for the AFL grand final (Victoria’s Super Bowl). I still jump at every notification on my phone, fearing and anticipating news of another outbreak that would send restrictions crashing back down. And yet, as the water closes around me, it’s easy to forget about all that for a moment and just concentrate propelling myself forward, lungs burning and muscles aching. I find myself marking our progress out of lockdown by cataloging the reintroduction of mundane activities as a series of “firsts,” a chain of bright archipelagos rising out of a dark sea. Seeing a friend in person for the first time after months of video chat. Stepping foot outside my suburb again and reveling in the change of scenery. Getting a haircut for the first time since January. And going for a swim as the sky floods with pink and orange light. Now for our stories of the week: Jacinda Ardern, Hero to Liberals Abroad, Is Validated at Home.

As the Coronavirus Surges, a New Culprit Emerges: Pandemic Fatigue. Exhaustion and impatience are creating new risks as cases soar in parts of the world. “They have had enough,” one U.S. mayor said of her residents. Sacha Baron Cohen: This Time He’s Serious. Reviving his Borat character and playing the political activist Abbie Hoffman, the actor feels he “had to ring the alarm bell and say that democracy is in peril this year.” In last week’s newsletter, we asked readers for their reactions to the daily news conferences from Victoria Premier Dan Andrews. We received a flood of responses. Here’s a small sample: Locked in our homes 22 hours a day with Netflix binges over, with all our books read twice, gardens now cleared places where weeds are afraid to pop up, we have reluctantly watched most of them. Andrews’ press calls have been robotic, mesmerizing, ritualistic and predictable — until Sky News Commentator Peta Credlin (previous Prime Minister’s chief of staff) started turning the screws on Dan during his daily monologues. Watching him then grow red in the face, his expression turn to anger and his brilliant non-answers and deflections in self-defense have started to become entertainment. We are more horrified by the thought of having him as Premier for another two years than catching COVID. — Susan Salopayevs Whether or not you agree with him, it’s comforting to see a leader take the heat and deliver the real news every morning. It’s almost masochistic to watch him throw himself to the wolves (journalists) whose jobs it is, of course, to catch him out (and for some, to frustrate and irritate to get a reaction). Sometimes he delivers, but most times he reacts like a school principal or an over-involved father and maintains his temper while explaining himself as clearly as he can. I don’t always agree with him, but appreciate his ability to put himself out there every day to a sometimes angry mob and explain his work and decisions. — Amanda Spagnolo I am from the left side of politics, and before all our lives changed forever, I was moderately impressed by Dan Andrews’ performance as Premier. However, I am not impressed by the way he has handled this crisis. He has relied far too much on policing and public shaming. He has belittled the mental health impacts of the lockdown. He has also failed to acknowledge the starkly unequal effects of the lockdown, in terms of class, race and gender. But what has really appalled and shocked me is the cult like following around Andrews, a cult that he has actively encouraged. Melbourne is now bitterly divided. And criticism of any aspect of the lockdown is seen as treasonous. Families and friendships have split asunder over this issue. Dan Andrews, like Fidel Castro, is now clearly addicted to his daily press conferences. When will he ever shut up, and delegate some of his responsibilities? Hopefully Melbourne can heal after the trauma of one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world. But I am not sure if the cruelty and racism that were so casually displayed will ever be forgotten. — Fia Clendinnen Enjoying the Australia Letter? Sign up here or forward to a friend.
