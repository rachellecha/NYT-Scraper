"Professors, Beware. In China, Student Spies Might Be Watching.",2019-11-01,By Javier C. Hernández,"['CHENGDU, China — With a neon-red backpack and white Adidas shoes, he looks like any other undergraduate on the campus of Sichuan University in southwestern China. But Peng Wei, a 21-year-old chemistry major, has a special mission: He is both student and spy. Mr. Peng is one of a growing number of “student information officers” who keep tabs on their professors’ ideological views. They are there to help root out teachers who show any sign of disloyalty to President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party. “It’s our duty to make sure that the learning environment is pure,” Mr. Peng said, “and that professors are following the rules.” In a throwback to the Mao Zedong era, Chinese universities are deploying students as watchdogs against their teachers, part of a sweeping campaign by Mr. Xi to eliminate dissent and turn universities into party strongholds. The use of student informers has surged under Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful leader in decades, with hundreds of universities now employing the practice, according to interviews with more than two dozen professors and students, as well as a review of public records. “Everyone feels they are in danger,” said You Shengdong, a longtime economics professor at Xiamen University in eastern China who was fired last year after students reported him for criticizing one of Mr. Xi’s favorite propaganda slogans. “How do we make progress,” Mr. You asked, “how can we produce inventions in this environment?” Universities are posting advertisements recruiting students to spy on their teachers, with some aiming to have one in every classroom. It has created a chilling effect that some have compared to the ideological purification campaigns of the decade-long Cultural Revolution, in which radical students attacked Mao’s perceived enemies. At a time when Mr. Xi is seeking to ward off supposed threats to social stability and to silence pockets of opposition to his authoritarian policies, students are increasingly playing a key role by monitoring how teachers view Mr. Xi, the party and ideas like democracy. In exchange, they are promised rewards like scholarships, higher grades and advancement within prestigious Communist Party groups. Professors and students described at least a dozen instances since early last year in which professors at Chinese universities have been fired or punished after students filed reports against them. A university in central China fired a professor after a student reported her for criticizing the elimination of presidential term limits by Mr. Xi, a move that allows him to remain in office indefinitely. In Beijing, a university suspended a math professor after a student complained that she had suggested Japanese students worked harder than their Chinese counterparts. The proliferation of student informers has raised concerns among scholars and students, who see the practice as another attempt to stifle classroom debate. All universities in the country are controlled by the party, which appoints the institutions’ top administrative officials and runs party committees on campuses. “Teachers can be reported for anything,” said Tang Yun, a veteran literature professor at Chongqing Normal University in southwestern China. Professor Tang, 56, was speaking from experience. While teaching a class earlier this year, he criticized a popular, folksy phrase Mr. Xi uses often — “roll up your sleeves and work hard” — as coarse. A student complained, prompting officials at Chongqing Normal to strip him of his teaching credentials and reassign him to the library this spring. Mr. Xi, who has sought a historical standing on a par with Mao, has borrowed from his playbook to restore the party’s place at the center of everyday life in China, including higher education. Education officials have fired dissident professors, banned some Western textbooks and ordered schools to start research centers devoted to Mr. Xi’s signature ideology, known as “Xi Jinping Thought.” China has long relied on students to serve as checks against their teachers. During the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and 1970s, academics and people with ties to the West or who were deemed “class enemies” were persecuted. Young people were called upon to spy on and denounce teachers and other intellectuals suspected of dissent. Under Mr. Xi, many universities now appoint one student monitor per class, according to public notices posted by universities. Students must apply to serve as informers, and many schools accept only party members or those who can demonstrate they hold “correct” political views. Some students take an expansive view of their mandate, keeping an eye not only on what professors say in class, but on their private lives, including tastes in books and movies, informers said in interviews. Mr. Peng, the student informer at Sichuan University, said he also speaks regularly with other students to gather impressions of teachers, including about their character, values and patriotism. He rejected the idea that the rise of informers is hurting classroom debate and said that for too long, Chinese universities have ignored the views of students. “Teachers need to listen to the concerns of students,” he said. At some schools, student informers are required to submit reports about their teachers to campus branches of the Communist Party, according to advertisements for the positions. Ankang University in northwest China said in an online notice that student informers should formally report professors who spread superstition, cults and pornography, “promote Western political values,” and criticize the party’s tenets. School administrators, the notice says, should respond to each complaint within three working days. At Xiantao Vocational College in central China, informers are expected to monitor for “behavior or speech that violates the party’s line.” Xinyang Normal University in central China calls on student informers to report anything teachers say that “endangers national security” or “national unity.” The Ministry of Education did not respond to a request for comment. It issued new ethics rules for teachers of all levels last year, saying they should not do anything to contradict the authority of the party. Under Mr. Xi, the party has also dispatched teams of officials to universities with the aim of monitoring the ideological views of teachers. Professors say the use of student informers is creating a climate of fear in classrooms. Mr. You, the economics professor who was fired from Xiamen University, said students had reported him for questioning Mr. Xi’s trademark slogan, the “Chinese dream,” a vision of prosperity and strength for the nation. Mr. You said he told his students that dreams are “delusions and fantasies — not ideals.” Mr. You, 71, who has since relocated to New York, said his students began referring to him as extreme and “anti-Communist.” His classroom was equipped with a video camera, which is standard at many Chinese universities, and the authorities warned that they could easily turn up evidence of inappropriate remarks. Carl Minzner, a professor of law at Fordham University in New York, said the rise of student informers was part of Mr. Xi’s efforts to make the party “a leading force in state and society alike.” “Xi’s goal is to reintroduce that element of self-censorship so that people start to think twice about speaking,” he said. “When political orthodoxy takes over, that’s how the collective mind of society begins to close down.” The culture of political denunciation has permeated the campuses of even China’s most prestigious universities. At Tsinghua University in Beijing, Mr. Xi’s alma mater, Lü Jia, a professor of Marxism, was investigated by the school’s administrators this year after students led an online campaign accusing him of speaking critically of China and socialism. The students said they were inspired by a call by Mr. Xi in March to strengthen ideological training and to prepare for a “national rejuvenation.” They started an anonymous social media account where they published line-by-line criticisms of Professor Lü’s lectures and criticized him for saying that Western civilization was still predominant in the world while China’s civilization was in decline. Professor Lü could not be reached and Tsinghua’s School of Marxism did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the investigation. At Chongqing Normal University, Mr. Tang, the literature professor, called the decision to bar him from teaching “pure ignorance of power.” The school had accused Mr. Tang of harming China’s reputation and forced him to apologize. After the school stripped him of his teaching credentials, he wrote a social media post saying he did not blame his students and that “not all of them are Judas.” “I leave today, clothed in shame,” Mr. Tang wrote. “But tomorrow I will certainly return garlanded with laurels.”']",
"New Delhi, Choking on Toxic Air, Declares Health Emergency",2019-11-01,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — A toxic, throat-burning cloud has settled over India’s capital, swallowing national monuments, sending people to emergency rooms and prompting officials on Friday to declare a public health emergency and close schools for days. Air pollution in parts of New Delhi rose to levels around 20 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. By Friday afternoon, officials in the capital region had halted all construction projects, planned to limit the number of vehicles on roads, urged people to stay inside and shut several thousand primary schools until Tuesday. “We are in trouble,” said Dr. G.C. Khilnani, a pulmonologist in the city. Every winter, as wind speeds slow and farmers burn their crops to make room for a new harvest, dirty air settles over India’s cities, putting hundreds of millions at risk. Adding to it, pollution in New Delhi got even worse after weekend celebrations of Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, when families set off fireworks despite government warnings against it. India has struggled to get in front of its pollution crisis. Reports have found that the country’s children may be facing permanent brain damage from poisonous air and that millions of Indians have already died from health problems connected to living in polluted cities.  The problem is not confined to the capital. Urban areas across the country, from Mumbai in the west to Varanasi in the east, are all struggling with filthy air, lending India the distinction of having 15 of the world’s 20 most-polluted cities, according to a recent study. But even as air pollution climbed to dangerous levels this week, turning the sun a murky white, some businesses in New Delhi kept their doors open and patrons at higher-end restaurants chose to sit outside. Face masks were still a rare sight on streets, and many politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, refrained from publicly acknowledging the problem. Jyoti Kumar, 47, the owner of a supermarket chain in New Delhi, said that many Indians had become fatalistic about the air. She said that more people were buying air purifiers if they could afford them, but that collective pressure on politicians to act was still not happening.  “I wish I could shut down my business and leave this city for good,” she said. Over the past few years, India’s environmentalists have warned about the long-term effects of sustained exposure to air pollution levels that can reach the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. A recent report found that major causes of pollution in the capital and surrounding cities, a metropolis of more than 46 million people, were construction dust, vehicle emissions and burning of agricultural waste. Dr. Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon in the city, said that 90 percent of his lung cancer patients three decades ago were smokers. Today, he said, the ratio was one to one, with at least 10 percent of his clients only in their 30s. “Fifty percent of the patients I operate on throughout the year are nonsmokers,” he said. “This kind of demographic change is shocking.” The Indian government has tried to take action this year, including enforcing a Supreme Court ban on most types of fireworks ahead of Diwali and introducing new “green” designs. In October, the country’s health minister, Harsh Vardhan, said that the eco-friendly fireworks would “resolve the crisis of air pollution” and slash emissions by 30 percent. But on Sunday evening, many families still celebrated the festival by climbing to their rooftops and setting off firecrackers. By morning, the city was under a halo of fog. In parts of the city, levels of the most dangerous air particles, called PM 2.5, eventually climbed to around 600 micrograms per cubic meter, which is considered hazardous to breathe, according to data provided by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Scientists have linked that kind of air pollution to increased death rates.  Mohammad Islam, 43, a rickshaw driver who wore a mask on Friday, said he was worried for his job and his life. In recent years, he said, he has developed a persistent cough, forcing him to cut four crucial hours of work from his days. As the air grew worse this week, Mr. Islam said he began to wonder how much longer he could last. “I have started to get shortness of breath, a suffocation I cannot explain,” he said. “It’s like someone is physically choking me.” Hari Kumar contributed reporting.']","Schools were closed after pollution in India’s capital soared, reaching levels many times the global safe limit."
He Left His 310-Year-Old Violin on a Train. He Retrieved It in a Parking Lot.,2019-11-03,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Stephen Morris, a professional musician, was so exhausted after a long day in the recording studio that when he got off a train in southeastern London on Oct. 22, he did not realize he had left his 310-year-old violin behind.  “Devastated” once he realized his mistake the following morning, Mr. Morris  started a treasure hunt for his missing instrument — one of the few made by the master craftsman David Tecchler in 1709. It is said to be worth about 250,000 pounds, or more than $320,000. He wrote to Southeastern Railway, which operated the train he had taken that night, and made public appeals on social media for its return. The British Transport Police later released an image taken from CCTV of a man who might have taken the violin, asking him to get in touch, British news outlets reported.  As time passed, the possibility of its return seemed increasingly bleak. But on Saturday, Mr. Morris announced a surprise breakthrough: His antique instrument was back.  “My violin is home safe and sound,” Mr. Morris wrote on Twitter, before posting a photograph showing him kissing its side.  His joy was understandable. Mr. Morris told the BBC last week that he had been playing the same violin for 15 years. He is a soloist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, has worked with musicians such as Stevie Wonder and U2, and has performed as a leader of the ensemble of the popular composer Max Richter.  Mr. Morris told the BBC that the violin was in a “white glossy case” when he boarded the train from London Victoria to Orpington. Also inside were two “quite historic” bows, one of which had belonged to the American violinist Michael Rabin.  Mr. Morris said he received a private message on Twitter on Thursday from someone who said he recognized the person in the CCTV picture.  “He was very apologetic; he said he wanted to hand it to me in person,” a clearly relieved Mr. Morris told the BBC.  Both the violin and the bows were “in tune,” when they were returned to him Friday night at a supermarket parking lot in Beckenham, in southeastern London, the BBC reported.  “Struggling for words here,” a grinning Mr. Morris told the BBC on Sunday. “I’m still getting over the shock of it coming back.” Before asking him to play the violin, a BBC interviewer asked him if next time he may chain the instrument to his wrist. Mr. Morris laughed — then played “Amazing Grace.” Mr. Morris is not the first professional musician to leave a valuable instrument behind — and get it back.  In 1999, Yo-Yo Ma left his 18th-century cello in the trunk of a taxi after a concert at Carnegie Hall. Philippe Quint played a thank-you concert at Newark Liberty International Airport in 2008 after a cabdriver there returned his $4 million violin. And an American violinist left her $2.6 million Stradivarius on a train in western Germany in 2016, retrieving it only moments before the train left the station. Neither Mr. Morris nor the British Transport Police could be reached for comment on Sunday, but British news outlets reported that the police had said no further action would be taken because the violin had been returned.']"," The musician Stephen Morris said, “I’m still getting over the shock” at the unlikely recovery of his instrument.

Threats and Abuse Prompt Female Lawmakers to Leave U.K. Parliament,2019-11-01,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Threats of sexual violence. Death threats. Racist abuse.  Female members of Britain’s Parliament have long said that this type of vitriolic abuse, both online and off, is increasingly common. Now, several women who have decided not to run for re-election when British voters go to the polls next month say that abuse, threats and a culture of intimidation are a significant reason they are leaving Parliament. “I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace,” Heidi Allen, a member of Parliament, wrote in a detailed letter to her constituents explaining why she will not be on the ballot. “Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.”  Ms. Allen is among more than 50 members of Parliament, including 18 women, who have said they will not stand in the Dec. 12 election. And while that ratio roughly mirrors Parliament’s overall gender breakdown, women’s rights activists worry that this climate could deter other women from entering national politics, reversing a trend that had brought the proportion of female lawmakers in the House of Commons to an all-time high of 32 percent.  Rights groups also say that an increasingly bitter political climate surrounding Brexit has fueled the flames — as did recent remarks by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the treatment of female lawmakers. In a parliamentary debate in September, Mr. Johnson dismissed such threats as “humbug” and said that lawmakers had only themselves to blame for the hostile political climate. Many women in Parliament — both those who will be candidates in the election and those who will not — say they have been subject to online abuse, threats and intimidation.  “Sexually charged rhetoric has been prevalent in the online abuse of female MPs, with threats to rape us and referring to us by our genitalia,” Caroline Spelman, a Conservative lawmaker who is stepping down after 22 years in Parliament, wrote in an opinion piece in The Times of London. “It is therefore not surprising that so many good female colleagues have decided to stand down at this election.” The situation even prompted 72 female members of Parliament to sign a letter of solidarity to Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who has spoken about the difficulty of public life in Britain.  “Although we find ourselves being women in public life in a very different way to you,” the letter read, “we share understanding of the abuse and intimidation which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in public office from getting on with our very important work.”  Since her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, the duchess has been a target of racial abuse — a factor that a report by Amnesty International during Britain’s last general election, in 2017, found carried over to Parliament as well.  Women of color in Parliament were subjected to the highest levels of online abuse during that campaign, the report found. And nearly half of the tweets examined were directed at Diane Abbott, a Labour lawmaker who was the first black woman elected to Parliament.  Some male politicians have also experienced threats of violence, online abuse and attacks in recent years. A Labour member of Parliament had homophobic graffiti sprayed on his office last month and in 2010 another Labour lawmaker was stabbed by a constituent. Some in Britain worry that the vitriolic words against lawmakers could spill over into violence, with many citing the 2016 murder of Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament who was killed by a right-wing extremist a week before the Brexit referendum. Catherine Anderson, the chief executive of the Jo Cox Foundation, a community-building charity that was created after the murder, said the decision of so many women not to run for re-election to Parliament next month was a “tangible symbol of the worsening intimidation both online and offline” for women in the public sphere.  Broader concerns have been raised over the potential for violence over an election in which Brexit is such a bitterly divisive issue. A study last month from the University of Cardiff and Edinburgh University found that a majority of respondents who had voted to leave the European Union believed that violence against lawmakers was a “price worth paying” to achieve the country’s exit from the bloc.\xa0 It is a dynamic that, aside from posing a threat to individual lawmakers, risks damaging the country’s political system, Ms. Anderson said. “The immediate threat is to people’s physical safety, but the long-term damage to democracy and to our institutions is another level of worry,” she said.  After Ms. Cox’s murder, the government of Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, published a report on intimidation in public life that made recommendations for the government, social media companies, political parties, the police and the news media to help combat the threats.  But some say the divisive and vitriolic nature of language used in Parliament itself has helped fuel the abuse.  When leaders “normalize the language of misogyny, the language of racism,” it gives license to hatred, said Catherine Mayer, a founder of the Women’s Equality Party, which campaigns for better representation of women in Parliament. The targeting of women, she said — particularly women of color — “is directly related to bias, hatred, inequality that were already there but are being turbocharged by this irresponsible leadership.” Ms. Mayer cited Mr. Johnson’s dismissive comments in Parliament. “When that is the kind of example that you are getting from the supposed first among equals, you are very far from Parliament doing its job,” she said.  Yet despite the persistence of abuse, many female lawmakers are vowing to continue on. Rachel Reeves, a Labour lawmaker whose book, “Women of Westminster,” focuses on female lawmakers navigating the male-dominated world of Parliament, said that while Britain’s first female lawmakers a century ago had their own steep challenges, she believed they would be shocked by how women are treated today.  “But the way to respond to this,” said Ms. Reeves, who has been in Parliament for nearly a decade, is “to show angry people and that violent language isn’t going to stop us from standing up for what we believe in.” ']","Eighteen female members of Parliament are not seeking re-election. Many say a barrage of abuse, online and offline, factored into their decision."
Pakistani Train Inferno Was Decades in the Making,2019-11-01,By Maria Abi-Habib and Salman Masood,"['When a passenger train rammed a rickshaw in Pakistan in 2017, killing seven schoolchildren, Imran Khan rolled the tragedy into his campaign to become prime minister, holding up the accident as a hallmark of government incompetence and corruption that only he could fix. “The railway minister must resign,” he said at the time, insisting that it was the proper response to such a failure in a democracy. “Otherwise, he can influence the investigation.” But Mr. Khan, now the prime minister, took a very different stance when a train caught fire on Thursday, killing at least 75 people and injuring 43 — one of the worst railway accidents in Pakistan’s history. He stood by his railway minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who, in turn, blamed passengers who had used a prohibited gas stove. Mr. Khan’s promises to restore transparency and good governance helped catapult him to victory in the August, 2018 general election, but as the country mourns the train-inferno victims, there is a sense of resignation that Pakistan only seems to be getting worse. Its economy is stagnant, its infrastructure is decrepit, and its political class seeks to absolve itself of blame, regardless of who is in power. The government and Mr. Khan “have not done anything, there have been no improvements in our country,” said Ramzan Mohammed Azeem, a 33-year-old passenger who escaped the fire by jumping from the speeding train. “And I don’t expect the government will take any action after this accident.” The country’s train safety record has not improved under Mr. Khan, according to figures provided by the Standing Committee on Railways. In the year ended in July, there were 74 accidents, vs. 67 the year before. Neighboring India, with a vastly larger rail network, reported 73 accidents in 2018. On Friday morning, the train was still smoldering, and the sunlight peeping through broken windows revealed the charred remains of steel chairs and bunk beds, and pots and pans scattered across the ash-strewn floor. Inside, a photographer for The New York Times came across the blackened bones of what appeared to be a small child, and another set of bones underneath a bunk bed. Officials said it appeared that a portable stove had exploded as passengers used it to cook breakfast, the flames quickly sweeping from car to car. The train’s emergency brakes did not appear to work, and it kept barreling along at full speed, fanning the flames, while passengers risked their lives by leaping from the train. “It is not the fault of Pakistan Railways,” Mr. Ahmed said Thursday of the state-owned company his ministry runs. “The passengers are responsible for this.” Portable stoves are forbidden on Pakistani trains, specifically because their gas canisters are prone to such explosions, and Mr. Khan has ordered an investigation. By Friday, some families of the victims, along with television commentators and politicians, demanded to know why the rules had not been enforced and demanded that Mr. Ahmed resign. “I could smell the cooking gas the night before, and I told an attendant but nothing was done,” said Mr. Azeem, who suffered severe burns on his hands and legs, and multiple injuries from his jump from the train. Another passenger who escaped the inferno, Mohammed Asif, shook his head in disbelief. “Gas cylinders are not allowed,” he said. “The entire system is failing. It cannot and will not get any better.” When Mr. Ahmed was appointed the railway minister last year, he promised to turn the ministry around, vowing to increase revenue, improve safety, open new lines and halt the endemic corruption and inefficiency that he blamed on previous governments. A veteran politician, he tried to shake up the ministry, holding lengthy meetings and adopting a tough attitude that many said was barely disguised haughtiness. He lamented that the ministry’s bureaucracy — which lives in palatial, colonial-era bungalows — was out of touch with the needs of ordinary people. In many ways, Mr. Ahmed mirrored Mr. Khan, promising a flurry of reforms and governance that would take care of who they called “the common man.” But more than 14 months after they took office, Pakistan still suffers the same problems that afflicted previous governments. Pakistan’s rail service has been plagued by scandal and mismanagement, but it remains a popular mode of transport and vital link connecting the country’s cities and towns. Most of the infrastructure is colonial-era, built under British rule before it was handed over to Pakistan at independence in 1947. During a recent session in Parliament, Mr. Ahmed made a startling revelation: out of 3,000 railway crossings, 1,800 are unstaffed, the same flaw that led to the 2017 train accident Mr. Khan had said as a candidate that he would rectify. Mr. Khan’s government did boost Pakistan Railways’ revenue to 54.59 billion rupees, about $350 million, in 2018-19, from 49.5 billion rupees the year before. But two new lines Mr. Ahmed launched were quickly discontinued because of financial losses. When Mr. Ahmed first took over the ministry, he met with quick disapproval from its administrators. In August 2018, Muhammad Hanif Gul, the chief commercial manager of Pakistan Railways, said it was impossible to work with the minister, and sought leave of 730 days. “The attitude of the new minister is extremely nonprofessional and ill-mannered,” Mr. Gul wrote in a letter that went viral on social media at the time. Even if an investigation finds Pakistan Railways is at fault for the deadly fire, many Pakistanis doubt Mr. Ahmed will be held accountable. He is seen as close to the country’s powerful military, which was widely accused of having meddled in the 2018 election to guarantee Mr. Khan’s victory — an accusation it denies. Mr. Ahmed’s constituency is in Rawalpindi, home to the military’s headquarters, and he often goes out of his way to praise the armed forces. While he attributed the train fire to passengers, he lauded Pakistan’s army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, for having provided him a military plane to meet victims, and for having provided troops for the rescue effort. The railway ministry’s history of accidents and scandal spans both civilian and military rule. Under the government of Pervez Musharraf, an Army general who took power in a coup, prime real estate owned by the railways in Lahore was illegally leased out for a luxury country club. That case is still pending, nearly a decade and a half after news of it first broke.  Mustafa Hussain and Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting.']","The nation’s railway system has long been plagued by corruption and mismanagement, despite serving as the only link between many cities and towns.

U.K. Truck Deaths Lead Vietnam Police to Arrest 2 Suspects,2019-11-01,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The police in Vietnam arrested two people on Friday as part of the investigation into the deaths of 39 people whose bodies were found in a refrigerated tractor-trailer in southeastern England last week.  The arrests were made on the same day that an official from the Essex Police, which are conducting the main investigation into the case, urged two brothers to turn themselves in to the police in Northern Ireland for questioning in the case.  The developments came as officials in several countries, including Belgium, Britain, China, Ireland and Vietnam, were still trying to identify the victims found in Essex and to trace their path in a case with all the hallmarks of a human smuggling operation. Late Friday, Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of the Essex Police said the victims were believed to be Vietnamese nationals, and “we believe we have identified families for some of the victims.” But he said the police could not yet publicly identify any of the victims.  The Ha Tinh regional police in central Vietnam said in a statement that they had summoned several others for questioning on suspicion of helping people to travel abroad illegally.  A 23-year-old truck driver from Northern Ireland, Eamon Harrison, was also charged in Ireland on Friday with 39 counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses in connection to the case.  Mr. Harrison was detained last week on unrelated charges but was thought to be a person of interest in the truck deaths. The Irish authorities said on Friday that they had begun the process to extradite Mr. Harrison to Britain.  He is the second truck driver to be charged in the case. Maurice Robinson, 25, also of Northern Ireland, was charged on Saturday with 39 counts of manslaughter and a conspiracy to traffic people. Mr. Robinson made his first appearance in court on Monday, when a judge ordered him held in custody. Although little is known about the victims or how they died, the discovery of the bodies shed a grim light on global human smuggling networks and the dangerous journeys that many undertake to reach European countries in search of jobs and a better future.  [Update: U.K. police have identified all 39 people found dead in a truck in Essex.] The refrigerated container was found last week in an industrial park a few miles away from the ferry terminal at Purfleet, England, where the container had arrived by ship from Belgium.  The Essex Police said they initially believed the victims were from China, but grieving families in Northern Vietnam have said they feared that missing relatives were among the victims. The Vietnamese police began a criminal investigation after 10 families from Ha Tinh Province reported the disappearance of their relatives. Two other men and a woman were detained in the investigation by the British police and later released on bail. And although the connection among the suspects remains unclear, the case increasingly seems to have some roots in the border area between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. On Friday, Daniel Stoten, detective chief inspector with the Essex Police, urged two brothers from County Monaghan, just south of the Irish border, to turn themselves in to the police in Northern Ireland for questioning.  Mr. Stoten told reporters that Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, were wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. “Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves into the Police Service of Northern Ireland,” he said at a news briefing on Friday. “We need you both to come forward and assist us with this investigation.” In a startling twist, Mr. Stoten said that detectives had spoken to Ronan Hughes by phone, but that the police wanted to have a conversation with both brothers in person. It was not immediately clear what was said during the phone conversation. Though the Hughes brothers are believed to hail from County Monaghan, Christopher Hughes has a registered trucking company address just across the border in Northern Ireland, near the town where Mr. Robinson lived. Countries like Belgium, France and Britain have increased border security checks at some ports in recent years to prevent illegal smuggling, leading migrants to take greater risks when attempting to reach their destinations. On Wednesday, 12 men were found alive in the container of a truck in Belgium, a week after the deadly discovery in Essex. The driver, who was transporting a shipment of fruit and vegetables, called the police after he suspected that people were in the back of the vehicle.  The police found 11 men from Syria and one from Sudan in the truck. The driver was not charged.  On Sunday, eight people, including two children, were found in a refrigerated truck at the ferry terminal in Calais, in northern France, according to local news outlets.  Ed O’Loughlin contributed reporting from Dublin.']","The arrests, linked to the discovery of 39 bodies in England, came as the British authorities urged two men to turn themselves in to the police in Northern Ireland."
A Disgraced Ukrainian Oligarch’s Bizarre Ski Resort Plan,2019-11-03,By Andrew Higgins,"['CHORNA TYSA, Ukraine — With Ukraine besieged by questions about President Trump, mysterious goings-on along a dirt road through a mountain forest are raising what, for many Ukrainians, is a far more urgent and important question: Just what is one of the country’s most powerful and scandal-singed oligarchs up to? A sudden flurry of work to widen the near-impassable track in the Carpathian Mountains in the country’s southwest has added new fuel to growing alarm in Ukraine that Ihor Kolomoisky, a disgraced billionaire now seeking rehabilitation, is making a comeback and widening his already substantial influence. In 2017, Mr. Kolomoisky went into self-imposed exile in Switzerland and then Israel after the government seized his prize asset, Privatbank, and accused him of embezzling billions of dollars. He returned to Ukraine this year after the comic Volodymyr Zelensky, a former business partner of the oligarch, won the presidential election in April. Mr. Zelensky came to office promising an all-out assault on Ukraine’s chronic corruption and out-of-control oligarchs, so his relations with Mr. Kolomoisky are being treated as a sensitive barometer of his sincerity and capability in following through on his pledges. Mr. Zelensky, asked recently about Mr. Kolomoisky at a meeting with journalists in Kiev, the capital, said that the state was not going to return any seized assets. But he added that he was ready to hold talks about the future of Privatbank and other matters. Officials say the road work in the mountains is part of regular repairs. Opponents of a stalled ski resort project in the area, however, see the first concrete signs that, thanks to Mr. Kolomoisky’s revived clout, one of Europe’s most fragile, pristine and inaccessible wilderness areas is under threat. Enabled by corruption, illegal logging has ravaged the Carpathian forests. Conservationists say the proposed ski resort — whose plan includes 33 lifts, 142 miles of ski runs, scores of hotels and 120 restaurants — threatens to extend the damage to a particularly vulnerable high-altitude woodland zone known as the Svydovets massif. Mr. Zelensky’s spokeswoman, Iulia Mendel, said that the fate of a ski resort was not a matter for the president to concern himself with, but opponents of the resort proposal beg to differ. “Svydovets is a test for Ukraine’s new president of whether he is under the control of Kolomoisky or independent from him,” said Iris Del Sol, a Franco-Ukrainian environmental activist who grew up in the mountain region. Along with her father, she has helped spearhead a campaign inside Ukraine and abroad — known as Free Svydovets — to halt the resort project. The area proposed for the resort contains the source of the Tysa River, an important tributary of the Danube, as well as old growth forests, plant species that have mostly vanished elsewhere and endangered animals like the European brown bear. It also hosts part of a primeval beech forest that has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Why Mr. Kolomoisky, a shrewd businessman with holdings in some of Ukraine’s most profitable companies, would want to sink hundreds of millions of dollars into a risky project offering uncertain returns is a mystery. “A lot of what our oligarchs do does not make much sense under normal economic rules,” said Bohdan Prots, a botanist at Ukraine’s State Museum of Natural History and vocal opponent of the Svydovets project. Mr. Kolomoisky did not respond to interview requests. His longtime business partner in the region, Oleksandr Shevchenko, who runs a nearby ski resort, Bukovel, that was funded in its early years by the oligarch, insisted that Mr. Kolomoisky has never had any interest in building a bigger resort at Svydovets. Mr. Shevchenko, who travels around his own resort in a bulletproof Range Rover escorted by bodyguards, dismissed all talk about Mr. Kolomoisky’s role in the new resort as “rumor” and “fairy tales.” Corporate records, however, name Mr. Kolomoisky as co-owner of Skorzonera LLC, a company that official government documents have identified as the driving force behind “the development of a detailed plan of Svydovets tourist and recreational complex.” In a July 2016 letter to local authorities in the area, Mr. Kolomoisky’s company trumpeted the huge scale and economic advantages of the Svydovets project, saying Skorzonera “is convinced that we can realize an outstanding tourism project.” Conflicting accounts of Mr. Kolomoisky’s involvement are a measure of the confusion surrounding his broader role in Ukraine since Mr. Zelensky took office in May — and named the oligarch’s former lawyer as his chief of staff. Before his bank was seized by the government amid accusations of fraud, Mr. Kolomoisky enjoyed strong public support. Using his own money and influence, he rallied resistance in 2014 to pro-Russia separatists in his hometown, Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, preventing them from seizing control there. This favorable image crumbled after the debacle at Privatbank. But since his return to Ukraine just days before Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration, Mr. Kolomoisky has steadily reasserted himself on the public stage and as a skilled behind-the-scenes operator. With many of his assets still frozen, however, Mr. Kolomoisky’s spending is limited, and even some opponents of the Svydovets resort complex doubt he is ready to invest in a project expected to cost well over a billion dollars. What he really wants, said Oksana Stankevich-Volosyanchuk of the ecology group Ecosphere, is to gain control of Svydovets’s supplies of water, a scarce resource that Bukovel, once partly owned by Mr. Kolomoisky, needs to keep its snow machines running and dozens of hotels operating. Mr. Shevchenko denied this, insisting that Bukovel has plenty of water and has shed its ties to Mr. Kolomoisky. The Svydovets project was first announced in 2016 by the governor of the Trans-Carpathia region at the time, Gennady Moskel, who said the planned resort would accommodate as many as 28,000 visitors at once — an ambitious target in an area that currently has no asphalt roads, virtually no people and is five hours by car on often bone-bruising mountain tracks from the nearest airport in Ivano-Frankivsk. On a visit to southwestern Ukraine this summer, Mr. Zelensky made no public mention of the Svydovets project or the movement to halt it. But he did meet with Mr. Shevchenko to discuss rebuilding Ivano-Frankivsk’s ramshackle Soviet-era airport and spoke of the importance of lifting the area’s dim economic prospects. Mr. Kolomoisky’s company, Skorzonera, runs the airport under a concession from the government. While strongly supported by many local officials, the new resort project quickly ran into legal and other troubles. Some villagers, angry that they had not been consulted or informed about the governor’s plans, successfully sued in a regional court in 2017 to have the project shelved until more information was provided. A higher court reversed that decision and, after an appeal by the villagers, the matter is now before the nation’s Supreme Court. Valery Pavluk, the co-owner of a sawmill, who was among those who brought the case, said that his opposition to the resort brought immediate retaliation from the authorities: His business was suddenly in the sights of tax, health and other government inspectors. “They just wanted to frighten me,” he said at his home in Lopukhovo, a village to the west of the planned resort. He said he did not vote in the April presidential election won by Mr. Zelensky..“Elections never really change anything here,” Mr. Pavluk said. Real power in Ukraine, he added, has always rested with billionaires like Mr. Kolomoisky. The region’s current governor, Ihor Bondarenko, who was appointed this summer by Mr. Zelensky, said he understood opposition to tearing up a forest wilderness to make way for a giant resort. Nevertheless, he added, Trans-Carpathia, one of Ukraine’s poorest regions, desperately needs investment to fund development and provide jobs. “There are two sides to every coin,” he said. Fedin Shandor, a professor at Uzhgorod University and adviser to the government on tourist development, said he shared local officials’ interest in attracting investment but was “100 percent against” the new ski resort. “We know these people and know how it will end,” he said, referring to Mr. Kolomoisky, whom he described as “a leech who sucks our blood here and puts it in Switzerland.” Ivan Pavlyuchuk, the mayor of Chorna Tysa, a village in the foothills of the Svydovets massif, dismissed concerns about Mr. Kolomoisky, saying he did not know or care who was behind the project but was determined to see it get off the ground. “If this project does not happen,” he said, “nothing will get done here: no new roads, no new schools, no jobs. Nothing.” Mr. Prots, the Museum of Natural History scientist, said that he understood the mayor’s eagerness for better economic prospects, but that he and other mountain people were being sold a bill of goods. “For Kolomoisky, this is just a toy,” Mr. Prots said. “He is not really bothered about developing a ski resort. He just wants to show his influence.”']",
Boris Johnson Has Big Lead in U.K. Election. That Might Not Mean Much.,2019-11-02,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — It was shaping up as an ordinary day of campaigning in Britain’s extraordinary general election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a primary school in Suffolk where he showed children old pictures of London and told them about the days when rulers “used to stick the decapitated heads of the enemies on spikes.” His opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, promised a crowd in London that the Labour Party would never sell out Britain’s National Health Service to greedy American companies. Then, shortly after 6 p.m. on Thursday evening, Nigel Farage, the insurgent leader of the Brexit Party, welcomed a special guest to his national radio show: President Trump, calling in from Washington to disparage Mr. Corbyn and urge Mr. Johnson to forge a hard-line pro-Brexit alliance with Mr. Farage. In less than 30 minutes of drive-time banter, Mr. Trump had utterly scrambled the narrative, dominating the next day’s headlines, giving Mr. Farage and his fringe party much-needed oxygen and reminding analysts that nothing in this six-week campaign is likely to go as the soothsayers predict. “Looking at the polling as it is today, the Conservatives are going to win, and win big,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “But the polls looked like this in 2017, and it all evaporated for the Conservatives by the time people voted.” In that election, Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, set herself the goal of expanding her parliamentary majority. But she proved to be a poor campaigner, and by the time it was over, she was left with a minority government that hobbled her in Brexit negotiations with the European Union and ultimately doomed her withdrawal plan.  Mr. Johnson is viewed as a better campaigner than Mrs. May. He plans to run on a simple message: Get Brexit done quickly, under the agreement he negotiated with the European Union, so that Britain can embark on a shiny future of profitable trade deals with the United States and other countries. Yet he, too, is a hostage to fortune, facing the danger that the narrative may shift unpredictably and in ways that hurt the Conservative Party. Something like that occurred in Mr. Farage’s interview with Mr. Trump, when the president said that Mr. Johnson’s Brexit deal would foreclose the possibility of a trade agreement with the United States. That undercut Mr. Johnson, who has made such a deal a major selling point for his plan, and, indeed, the country’s future. Other dangers lurk, particularly in Britain’s winner-take-all electoral system, where the small Brexit Party could act as a spoiler, draining away just enough votes in enough closely contested districts to swing the balance of power in Parliament toward Labour. “Of course he’s popular,” Mr. Farage said of Mr. Johnson on Friday, “but he doesn’t own the Brexit vote.” Mr. Trump’s intervention on behalf of Mr. Farage is not likely to turn his party into a major player, but it has emboldened him to renew his demand that the Conservatives form an alliance with him and abandon the current Brexit deal.  And if Mr. Johnson does not agree, he said Friday, the Brexit Party will field 500 candidates in the election, which could split the pro-Brexit vote and cost the Tories several close seats. Mr. Farage could also hammer Mr. Johnson for failing to pull Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, as he promised, or for his deal with Brussels, which Mr. Farage claims will align Britain too closely with Europe and, as Mr. Trump said, impede a trade deal with the United States. “It’s all about control of the narrative,” said Timothy Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “If Johnson can keep the message on getting Brexit done, and if Corbyn can’t counter with his anti-austerity, populist message, the Conservatives will probably win.” Mr. Johnson is starting out with an undisputed advantage. A poll released Thursday by Ipsos Mori showed the Conservatives leading Labour by 41 percent to 24 percent nationally. That would translate into a 108-seat Conservative majority in Parliament, according to Mr. Travers. These are the kind of numbers that emboldened Mr. Johnson to call an election now. The Conservative Party is going after a swath of Labour seats in northern England and the Midlands, where people voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum and are frustrated that it has not happened. The party has identified a target voter, named “Workington Man,” for the coastal town of Workington, in northwest England, which is surrounded by the remnants of the coal and steel industries. He is older, white, not college-educated, a lover of the rugby league and a Labour voter who supported leaving the European Union and feels left behind by the Britain of today. These voters care more about economic security than individual liberty. They favor putting additional police on the streets and toughening immigration policies, according to a study by the right-wing think tank Onward, which coined the phrase Workington Man. The problem for Mr. Johnson is that he has staffed his Cabinet with politicians who favor deregulation and free trade, viewing Britain’s future less as a Tory welfare state than as an agile free agent in the global economy — Singapore-on-Thames, to use the popular shorthand. How Mr. Johnson reconciles Singapore-on-Thames with Workington Man will be one of the tensions of the election. Mr. Corbyn’s Labour Party is saddled with an even more muddled message on Brexit: It wants to negotiate a new deal with Brussels and then put that deal to the people in a second referendum, raising the possibility that the government could end up campaigning against its own agreement. Mr. Corbyn, for all his skills as a grass-roots campaigner, remains a deeply unpopular figure. Those dynamics could open the door to the smaller parties. The Liberal Democrats are campaigning on a platform of revoking Brexit altogether. That would seem to appeal to Conservative voters in London and the southeast of England who opposed Brexit, as well as some anti-Brexit Labour voters. In 2017, the Conservative and Labour parties got 82 percent of the popular vote and nine of every 10 Parliamentary seats. Analysts expect those numbers to fall this year, as the fragmentation of British politics accelerates. It is one of the great ironies of the Brexit odyssey, said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University, that “what you’re seeing is the Europeanization of British party politics. The two-party system is breaking down because of the pressures of Brexit.” The election is a gamble for Mr. Johnson in the most direct way. In his own parliamentary constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, on the outskirts of London, he has a narrow majority of 5,034 votes. A strong showing by a Brexit Party candidate could siphon off enough votes to tip the seat to Labour. Were Mr. Johnson to leap to a safer seat as has been rumored, he would risk looking like he was running scared. Mr. Johnson knows that his Brexit policy is likely to cost the Conservatives anti-Brexit voters in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party is strong; in London, a Labour stronghold; and in the south of England, where the Liberal Democrats hope to gain. His gamble is that he can more than make up those losses in the Midlands and the north, and in Wales, all of which voted to leave the European Union in 2016. But Mr. Farage is complicating the strategy by threatening to run candidates across the country unless Mr. Johnson agrees to scrap his Brexit deal and pursue what Mr. Farage calls a “clean break” from Brussels. In the 2015 election, Mr. Farage argued, the U.K. Independence Party, which he led before leaving to form the Brexit Party, helped the Conservatives gain power by taking critical votes from Labour. This time, most polling experts believe, the Tories will suffer more because the Brexit Party, by definition, appeals to Brexiteers — the very people who will be courted by Mr. Johnson. A skilled communicator — not unlike his radio show guest, Mr. Trump — Mr. Farage could doom Mr. Johnson’s chances if he can persuade enough pro-Brexit voters that the Tory plan is not enough of a clean break with the European Union, or that Mr. Johnson is untrustworthy on Brexit. “Frankly,” Mr. Farage said, “there is no point leaving if we accept this approach.”']","In Britain’s Brexit-scrambled politics, four parties are competing and the winning margins will be narrow. Nothing in this campaign is likely to go as the experts predict."
Nigerian Women Say ‘MeToo.’ Critics Say ‘Prove It.’,2019-11-02,By Julie Turkewitz,"['LAGOS, Nigeria — It was, she said, a secret that burned so badly she could no longer keep it inside. So at age 34, Busola Dakolo, a well-known Nigerian photographer, went on television and finally spoke. She said she had been raped twice as a teenager by her former pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo, a church leader whose services draw thousands, and whose fans, admiring his flashy lifestyle, have taken to calling him “the Gucci pastor.” He has denied the allegations. After years in which silence around rape and sexual harassment have been the norm, West Africa is seeing a wave of #MeToo proclamations.  Accusations have come from a Gambian beauty queen who said the former president raped her; a former presidential adviser in Sierra Leone who said she was sexually assaulted by a church leader; and a Nigerian journalist with the BBC who captured hidden camera footage of university professors soliciting sex in exchange for admission and grades.  The footage shook the region, drew outrage from political leaders and led to the suspension of at least four lecturers. But many women who have come forward in recent months have also experienced a fierce backlash, including attacks on their reputations and accusations that they’ve lied about the assaults. While their critics say they are merely applying appropriate skepticism to unproven allegations, their supporters say that the hostile reaction reveals just how difficult it is for women in the region to speak out about abuse. The backlash has hit women in many countries, including Europe and the United States. But survivors in West Africa say they feel a particularly immense fear — of shaming their families, of scaring off potential husbands, of taking on the region’s most powerful institutions. “Everything,” said Ms. Dakolo, “still revolves around protecting these men.” Ms. Dakolo’s allegation against the pastor prompted a visit from Nigerian police, who told her she was being investigated in a case of criminal conspiracy. A few weeks later, the pastor returned to his pulpit, amid cheers from his congregation and support from a group calling itself the Social Justice League. Mr. Fatoyinbo said on Instagram that many people have used similar accusations to try to extort him and the ministry. “I have never in my life raped anybody even as an unbeliever,” wrote Mr. Fatoyinbo, who declined multiple interview requests. In an interview at her home in Lagos, Ms. Dakolo said she had come forward after she and her husband, a well-known pop star, heard that the pastor had continued to assault other congregants.  But the personal cost, she added, had been high, and had included telephone threats, internet harassment and an extremely difficult discussion about rape with her three children. “You begin to ask yourself, "" she said, “did I do the right thing?” Religion is an overwhelming force in Nigeria, a country of nearly 200 million people that is roughly split between Christians and Muslims. Billboards for famous pastors dot the highways, an annual redemption camp attracts millions of people, and some preachers are more visible than political leaders.  In recent years, Mr. Fatoyinbo has grown his ministry, the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, into a five-city force among the country’s many Pentecostal megachurches.  Young and tech-savvy, he preaches an increasingly popular theology called prosperity gospel that posits that success can be achieved through faith and donations to church.  Congregants enter his sanctuary on a red carpet and follow his adventures — his birthday party on a yacht in Dubai, for example — in the news. But Ms. Dakolo met him nearly two decades ago, in the midsize city of Ilorin, when he was an up-and-coming star and she was still a teenager.  He soon became her spiritual mentor, complimenting her singing and visiting her home to counsel her. When she was 17, the pastor raped her, she said, once at her childhood home and once on a desolate roadside. Devastated, Ms. Dakolo said she soon told her sister and brother, and then confronted Mr. Fatoyinbo.   He apologized to her, she said, blaming his behavior on the devil. Ms. Dakolo’s video interview in June with journalist Chude Jideonwo, in which she first accused Mr. Fatoyinbo, has been viewed at least half a million times on YouTube. Her allegations inspired a protest outside the church and forced the pastor to take a temporary leave.  Strangers soon flooded her social media inboxes with their own stories of assault, and a second woman came forward and told Mr. Jideonwo that the pastor had raped her while she was caring for his children. (The woman chose to obscure her face in the video interview.) Esther Uzoma, a human rights lawyer in Abuja, said Ms. Dakolo quickly became an “icon” of every woman’s “secret pain.” But Ms. Dakolo soon found herself under heavy suspicion. Local newspapers carried a statement from the Social Justice League accusing Ms. Dakolo of being a tool of jealous church leaders eager to smear Mr. Fatoyinbo.  When Ms. Dakolo sued him for emotional distress, his legal team responded by demanding she pay him 50 million naira in damages, about $140,000, on the basis that her suit constitutes an abuse of judicial process. The case is pending. The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, an influential umbrella organization, promised a thorough investigation into the matter, but closed the inquiry when the pastor failed to appear for questioning.  A representative of the group, Simbo Olorunfemi, said that it “does not and will not condone” sexual assault, but that Mr. Fatoyinbo’s lack of cooperation had left the group with nothing else it could do. In about two dozen interviews across Lagos and Abuja, the country’s biggest cities, some people defended Ms. Dakolo.  “He has to be punished,” said Biba Bukola, 19. “Even if he’s a pastor. So that other people will learn the lesson.” But many doubted her account. Even some women who had experienced sexual assault had little sympathy.  Of three women who said in interviews that they had been raped, two of them sided with Mr. Fatoyinbo, saying that if she had been assaulted, she was at least partly to blame.  “She was old enough to know to fight back,” said one woman, a 25-year-old teacher who did not want to be named because she said she had also survived sexual abuse.  Many people trace Nigeria’s MeToo movement to February, when a young pharmacist in the country’s conservative north took to Twitter to describe an encounter in which she said her boyfriend nearly killed her.  Stories of abuse soon flew around the internet, many of them tagged #ArewaMeToo. (Arewa refers to the north in Hausa.) Ms. Dakolo came out a few months later. Then, in October, the BBC aired a report exposing sexual harassment by professors at prominent universities in Nigeria and Ghana. One professor was shown on video pledging to help a young woman gain admission to the University of Lagos, unaware she was a reporter under cover. He then locked the door to his office, turned out the lights and groped her. He also told her that women students are accustomed to “paying for it” with their bodies.  The footage prompted social media outrage (#sexforgrades) and a swift political response. Within days, the Nigerian legislature had introduced a bill outlawing sexual advances by professors, and the president had pledged his support.  Kiki Mordi, the BBC journalist, said that the report was so effective because, for the first time, people could see abuse “through the eyes of the victim.” Ms. Dakolo said she was glad to see the BBC investigation receive so much attention. But she was frustrated that people seemed to need to see a man caught on video to take an allegation seriously. Most women don’t have that kind of evidence, she said.  Pastor Busola Olotu, the leader of a woman’s ministry in Ilorin who was once a mentor to Mr. Fatoyinbo, said that she had spoken with three other women who told her they had been sexually assaulted by Mr. Fatoyinbo. None have spoken publicly; all declined requests to be interviewed.  On a recent Sunday, congregants streamed into Mr. Fatoyinbo’s church in Abuja, passing the red carpet, the velvet stanchions, the police officers in khaki and the greeters in pencil skirts.  The pastor had recently returned from leave. “Celebrate you,” the greeters told churchgoers, smiling as everyone took their seats.  Thousands, watched as Mr. Fatoyinbo took the stage. He wore a blue three-piece suit and preached about the importance of resisting “anything the enemy is dangling before you.” Even sinners, he said, can later decide to walk through the right doors.  Outside, as afternoon clouds rolled in, some said the pastor could do no wrong. “He didn’t do it,” said Georgina Inah, 27, who was just finishing her time in Nigeria’s youth service corps. Of Ms. Dakolo, she said, “she’s confused.” “The lady is a liar,” said John Amodu, 44, a security guard. Others conceded that a sexual encounter might have happened, but urged Ms. Dakolo to move on. After all, they said, the pastor had gone on to do so much good. “Forgive and forget,” said Stephen Yakubu, 52, “Is that not what God says?” Pius Samuel contributed reporting from Abuja. Susan C. Beachy contributed research from New York.']","Women in West Africa who accuse men of sexual abuse have recently seen some change, but also an intense backlash — including threats and even a police investigation.

Turkey Wants Refugees to Move to a ‘Safe Zone.’ It’s a Tough Sell.,2019-11-01,By Carlotta Gall,"['AKCAKALE, Turkey — Syrian refugees in this Turkish border town have been celebrating. Every day, news trickles of advances by Turkish-backed troops in carving out a safe zone in northeastern Syria and opening the way for the refugees to return home. Syrians like Hassan Khalil, 37, one of eight brothers and several cousins who rent a cluster of houses on the edge of Akcakale and survive by working on nearby farms, are impatient to reclaim their homes. “We have been away for five years,” he said. Yet their excitement is tempered with anxiety. In seizing the enclave in Syria, Turkey wrested a piece of territory along its southern border from the Kurds, who had taken control of the area amid the chaos of the war in Syria. But Turkey’s invasion resulted in a new problem: Syrian forces — deployed by the very government that had sent refugees fleeing for safety in the first place — promptly moved back into the surrounding area, alarming many of the displaced people desperate to go home. “We were surprised the regime entered these areas,” said Mustafa Hamida, a Syrian lawyer and rights activist who opposes the government of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. “If the regime comes in, we will see a massive campaign of arrests in the region.” For Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sending troops across the border was not just a matter of repelling the Kurds, whom the Turks view as a threat to their stability. Under political pressure to resolve the refugee crisis, he has insisted on the need for a safe zone to start repatriating some of the 3.6 million Syrians who fled to Turkey. But with Mr. al-Assad’s forces on the move, and supported by Russian troops, few refugees are likely to go back willingly. Much of the recent tumult stems from President Trump’s decision to withdraw American forces from northeastern Syria, where they had been allied with the Kurds to fight the Islamic State. The United States is hostile to the Assad government, and its forces also helped keep the Syrian military at bay. In a sign of continuing conflict in a newly upended northeastern Syria, Turkish forces recently clashed with Syrian soldiers, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights  — the first time that had happened since they crossed the border. At least five Syrian government soldiers were killed on Tuesday by Turkish artillery fire, the conflict monitor based in Britain reported.  Turkish-backed Syrian units posted video on social media showing the capture of two Syrian military trucks and three government soldiers in army fatigues. The clashes occurred on the limits of the Turkish-controlled area. The flood of refugees followed an uprising against the government of President Assad that began in 2011, as the Arab Spring spread across the Middle East. The government’s brutal crackdown on the population led to nationwide calls for his ouster. In the war that followed, more than 100,000 civilians have been killed, and the Assad regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against its own people. But it was not only the Assad government that sent civilians fleeing. Mr. Khalil, the refugee in Akcakale, said most of his village had been abandoned since Kurdish forces ordered families to leave nearly five years ago, forcing them to take refuge in Turkey. Even Kurdish families were ordered out of the village, Abdi Koy, as part of a campaign of deliberate displacement of the population and the razing of villages by the Kurdish militia in 2015, according to a report by Amnesty International. Mr. Khalil accused the Kurdish militia of detaining one of his relatives and using extortion against another. Mustafa Bali, head of the media office for the Syrian Democratic Forces, as the Kurdish-led force is now named, dismissed allegations of abuse by the militia as “fabrication and lies.” He also denied the accusations made by Amnesty International.  But such accounts are common among Syrian refugees in Turkey and the men fighting alongside Turkish forces, and have stoked refugees’ demands for Turkey to help them regain their homes.  Last week, Mr. Khalil said, Kurdish forces left his village and Syrian forces allied with Turkey took control of it without a fight. His sister, who was hiding for three days inside her house, called him when she saw the soldiers in the street of the village, 10 miles west of Tel Abyad, Syria. With the Kurdish forces gone, there is growing anger about car bombs and land mines they are said to have left behind, which have caused civilian casualties in the towns and villages taken over by Turkish-backed forces. A recent explosion from a car bomb in Tel Abyad was so powerful that it shook buildings across the border in Akcakale. The continuing violence is one reason refugees say they are not willing to return to Syria immediately. But many also wonder what life might look like in the relatively small area Mr. Erdogan has been able to secure for a safe zone. It is roughly 2,000 square miles between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tel Abyad, and many refugees wonder how they will survive. “We will be in a prison,” Mr. Khalil said. “Our hope was they would control the whole border line.” Mr. Erdogan has proposed building 10 towns in the safe zone, with hospitals, schools and industrial sites to accommodate a million people. Printed handouts given to foreign journalists at a news briefing last week declared that Turkey would use international money to cover the cost, which is estimated at $26 billion. It was not clear where that money would come from. Nor is it clear how Mr. Erdogan’s plan will resonate with the United Nations, which regards the Syria refugee crisis as one of its biggest challenges and has consistently emphasized that under international law, refugees cannot be forced to return to their country of origin.  In a meeting on Friday with Mr. Erdogan in Turkey, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, “stressed the basic principles relating to the voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees,” the organization said in a statement.  Even if it gives refugees from near the border a chance to return to their lands, the zone offers little to those driven from elsewhere in Syria. “I don’t think it was meaningful for a resident of Raqqa or Deir al-Zour,” said Fuad Muhammad, a refugee living near the border in Akcakale. A former employee of the Syrian water ministry in Deir al-Zour, Mr. Muhammad, 32, is blind, and is clinging to the hope of a passage with his family to Western Europe for an eye operation. He said there was little hope for the future in Syria without a change of leadership. He said that because of his eyesight, he did not join the popular uprising against the Assad government, but that he had supported those who did. “Even a child knows the solution,” Mr. Muhammad said. “First you have to change the government, and then amend the Constitution. Because all our problems stem from those two things.” His home city remains divided and dangerous, he said. Iranian and Russian forces occupy the west bank of the Euphrates River, which runs through the city, and the east bank is occupied by a mix of “gangs, the S.D.F. and ISIS,” he said. Residents worry equally about a return of the Assad government and of the Islamic State, he said. “Everybody fears everybody,” he said. “The only victims are the people, and they lack medical services, foodstuffs, jobs, water — everything you can imagine.” Members of the Turkish-backed militias, who have joined forces for the campaign under the banner of the Syrian National Army, remain set on taking the fight far beyond Turkey’s small protected zone. In a rented apartment in Akcakale, three wounded Syrian fighters predicted that the Syrian government would not be able to maintain control of the northeastern part of the country in the long term. “There will be more stability if we go as deep as we can,” said one of them, Abu Khalil Sharqiya, 30. Mr. Sharqiya said he was determined to get home to Deir al-Zour. “We will not stop,” he said.

"U.K. Halts Fracking in England, Citing Quake Concerns",2019-11-02,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson once hailed fracking as “glorious news for humanity,” and said the British government should “leave no stone unturned, or unfracked.” But in a major U-turn, Mr. Johnson’s government announced on Saturday that it would temporarily halt fracking in the only active site in Britain, in northwestern England. The move came after a government agency, the Oil and Gas Authority, concluded this past week that it could not rule out “unacceptable” consequences for people living near fracking sites, including pollution risks and earthquake-related damage. It was a victory for environmental groups, and might deprive opposition parties of a potentially powerful campaign issue in a general election just weeks away.  Jonathan Bartley, a leader of the Green Party, described the move as “very, very welcome.” But he told the BBC that the group wanted an absolute commitment from the government to ban the practice outright.  On Twitter, his co-leader, Sian Berry, wrote: “Banning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas.” The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted on Saturday that the government moratorium was only a “temporary pause” and “an election stunt to try and win a few votes.” His party would ban fracking permanently, he said. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to fracture shale rock and recover natural gas from it. The practice has proved controversial and carries potential environmental and community costs.  In the Netherlands, hundreds of earthquakes linked to gas extraction have damaged thousands of homes and buildings. France and Germany have banned fracking, and Scotland and Wales have long had their own moratoriums on the technique. The extracting technique is a major source of oil and gas revenues in the United States, Canada and Argentina. It has been bitterly opposed by environmental activists and local groups in Britain, where a series of earthquakes, including one in August, have hit the only active fracking site in the country, near the seaside town Blackpool. Britain’s business and energy secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said on Saturday that shale gas had “huge potential” but that its exploration should be “carried out safely.” “After reviewing the O.G.A.’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community,” Ms. Leadsom said in a statement. Activities at the site near Blackpool, managed by the shale gas group Cuadrilla Resources, were suspended after the Aug. 26 earthquake, which measured 2.9 on the Richter scale.  In May 2011, shale gas drilling was suspended at the Blackpool site after small earthquakes were documented by the British Geological Survey. Last year, Cuadrilla halted fracking after a tremor measuring 0.8 magnitude was recorded. The company had no immediate reaction to the government’s moratorium on Saturday. Fracking has been views as a potentially toxic issue for the governing Conservative Party. Unlike in the United States, where shale gas can be extracted in remote areas, many potential fracking sites in densely populated Britain have been near residential areas, where residents have often angrily opposed it. According to the newspaper The Yorkshire Post, an event at the Conservative Party conference in September discussed the potential for fracking to affect up to 200 electoral districts, 40 of them marginal.  Protesters have camped for years near the Preston Road site and have fought the company in court. Three protesters were jailed in September 2018 for blocking the site and climbing on trucks there, and protesters once kept 24-hour vigils to monitor Cuadrilla’s activity.  “To contaminate a major food-growing area for a little bit of gas is insane,” a retired university professor, Celia Briar, told The New York Times in 2018. Governments in Britain, which has long valued its oil industry, have supported shale exploration for the major revenues the technique could bring. Yet, a government spending watchdog found last month that the government had invested 32 million pounds, or $41 million, in fracking activities since 2011, with little result so far.  The government said the new moratorium would be put in place with immediate effect and continue until “compelling new evidence” had shown that fracking did not put local populations at risk. ']","Boris Johnson’s government, which is preparing for a general election, said the ban would be in place until there was “compelling new evidence” that it could be carried out safely."
"Fighting Social Injustice Through Graffiti, and Making a Business of It",2019-11-01,By Perry Garfinkel,"['BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Camilo Fidel López eats, drinks, thinks, sleeps and breathes graffiti. Where the average eye sees empty and drab building walls, Mr. López, the founder of the graffiti artists crew Vértigo Graffiti, sees blank canvases, opportunities to colorfully further the cause of social justice, whether in his home city — the Colombian capital, Bogotá — or the rest of the world. Looking younger than his 38 years, sporting a scruffy beard, wearing jeans and an untucked casual shirt, he was constantly on the move recently crisscrossing Bogotá, which has become one of the world’s top graffiti destinations. A few days later he was wandering the cobblestoned back alleys of Cartagena, a historic coastal Colombian city that is also famous for its graffiti art. And several months later he was still on the go — this time in Turkey with his crew. Not a graffiti artist himself, Mr. López plays multiple roles: art director, business manager, promoter, negotiator, lawyer, entrepreneur, festival producer, even tour guide. He is, in addition, a professor of entertainment law and cultural industries at the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá. He refused to give himself a job title. “My job is to start conversations,” he said succinctly, in one of the few times he was succinct. He now plays a key role at the forefront of a street art revolution that reflects his nation’s new face of pride and self-expression. He sprinkles his nonstop passionate discourses on the importance of graffiti with references to great thinkers and authors — John Cheever, Umberto Eco and Aristotle, in one recent disquisition. But his most frequent references are to the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, whom Mr. López refers to by his nickname, Gabo. “This line from Gabo’s 2004 novella “Memories of My Melancholy Whores” defines my philosophy: ‘It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.” Mr. López is the son of two academics and staunch socialists, whose beliefs are reflected in his name: Fidel, for the former Cuban leader, Fidel Castro; and Camilo, after Camilo Cienfuegos, a close comrade in Castro’s guerrilla army who died in a plane crash shortly after the Cuban revolutionaries ousted the dictator Fulgencio Batista. But Mr. López’s path to a passion that arguably has revolutionary impact — and that satisfied his parents — was often circuitous. Urged by his parents to gain the best education and then turn it into a fight for social justice, he decided to become a lawyer. Having graduated from one of Bogotá’s top law schools, Mr. López turned his sights to Harvard Law School, and was shattered when he was rejected. That Harvard rejection, however, inadvertently led to his current occupation. “I was 28, my life was turned upside down,” Mr. López said. “So I went from Cambridge, Mass., to Manhattan to bury my sorrows and blow off steam.” “In SoHo, I stumbled across such a vibrant graffiti art scene that spoke of social injustice. It was even being sold at galleries,” he said. “That was when a light bulb went on. I thought, ‘Maybe one could do both: spark a social revolution and make a business out of it.’” Mr. López went home and in 2009 founded Vértigo Graffiti. “Those first years were difficult,” he said. “We started doing demos for free in private homes to build a portfolio. There was a lot of trial and error as I learned what could be possible. Even though painting on public walls was illegal at that time, there was early interest from some companies. We created a huge campaign with Coca-Cola and Sprite in 2011.” In the aftermath of a police killing of a 16-year-old graffiti artist that was widely condemned, he helped persuade the city government in 2012 to decriminalize graffiti painting in certain areas. He often fields questions about an artistic endeavor that largely defies definition. Are the artists independent anarchists or opportunistic capitalists selling out to commercial interests? Is it vandalism or an exercise in freedom of expression? The answers are less important, said Mr. López, than the way graffiti is changing people’s perception of his country. It’s a shift that others have noticed, too. “Before I moved here three years ago, I had the same misconception as many people — Colombia was a country of mustachioed coffee farmers and drug lords,” said Mark Bingle, the general manager of the Four Seasons Casa Medina in Bogotá, for which Mr. Lopez now leads graffiti tours. “Camilo opened my eyes to the new Colombia,” Mr. Bingle said. “Going around, one sees that Bogotá’s walls are like a living, breathing museum of modern history.” On a recent day, Mr. López dashed from meeting to meeting in Bogotá: working with Digitalistic Ad Agency’s Pablo Cebellos, whose company represents the major spray paint makers Montana and Pintuco; sprinting to a session trying to convince a conservative textile manufacturer that edgy graffiti murals in its retail outlets would appeal to millennials; then back to Vértigo Graffiti’s studio to check on works in progress. The studio, a second-floor walk-up with no signage from the street in a nondescript neighborhood, is a jumble of the works in progress, preliminary sketches for walls that the crew will paint, commissioned pieces for private residences and fine art projects they are working on for themselves. Canvases, cans of paint, spray paint and smelly rags are strewn all over. Mr. López’s office, if you can call it that, is a makeshift tabletop in one corner. He makes calls and sends texts standing up from wherever he can. “A lot of people have wanted to represent us, but we trusted only Camilo,” said Sebastián García (nickname Ecks), who along with Santiago Castro (Cazdos), Ricardo Vasquez (Yurika) and Estefany Fajardo (Zas), the only female member, make up Vértigo Graffiti. The crew’s tag — those characteristic artist signatures found in a corner of a painting — is M.D.C., which stands for Mientras Duermen Crew (in Spanish, the While They Sleep Crew). They’ve entrusted Mr. López to sell them, but not to sell them out. “These folks are a peculiar mix of tough guy and sensitive guy,” Mr. López said. “We’re on the same page about what we’ll do and what we won’t do for money.” On his way to yet another meet-up, he stopped at “The Kiss of the Invisibles,” a 10-story-tall mural that Vértigo Graffiti created in 2013, based on a famous photograph of two homeless people kissing. “It generated a lot of attention,” Mr. López said. “But for me it meant a lot more, because when my father saw it, it was the first time he said he respected what I was trying to do with this medium of expression, to make a valuable social statement.” The next stop was Bogotá’s Graffiti District, which Vértigo Graffiti and more than 50 prominent artists from around the world painted in 2017. It stretches on both sides of two blocks, covering the exterior walls of several companies — all with permission and subsidy from the city. “This was one of the dirtiest and most polluted areas of Bogotá,” he said, strolling down the corridor in the industrial neighborhood, Puente Aranda. “Now it’s cleaned up and attracts tourists and aficionados from everywhere.” In the last year or so, Mr. López has taken Vértigo Graffiti on the road to Ottawa, Miami and Amman, Jordan, among other places. In September they traveled to Turkey, where they painted a wall of the Halis Kurtca children’s cultural center in Kadikoy, a suburb of Istanbul, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Colombia and Turkey. The image depicts a Colombian girl dressed in the traditional garb of a coffee farmer, holding a basket of fresh-picked beans, a bird floating on her black skirt. Mr. López said he could not have imagined a decade ago that graffiti, which began as a protest against all things establishment, would now be used to symbolize links between two governments. But he has still loftier ambitions for graffiti. “I want it to become recognized as a high art,” he said, “like opera, ballet and theater.”']",
The Money Farmers: How Oligarchs and Populists Milk the E.U. for Millions,2019-11-03,"By Selam Gebrekidan, Matt Apuzzo and Benjamin Novak","['CSAKVAR, Hungary — Under Communism, farmers labored in the fields that stretch for miles around this town west of Budapest, reaping wheat and corn for a government that had stolen their land. Today, their children toil for new overlords, a group of oligarchs and political patrons who have annexed the land through opaque deals with the Hungarian government. They have created a modern twist on a feudal system, giving jobs and aid to the compliant, and punishing the mutinous. These land barons, as it turns out, are financed and emboldened by the European Union. Every year, the 28-country bloc pays out $65 billion in farm subsidies intended to support farmers around the Continent and keep rural communities alive. But across Hungary and much of Central and Eastern Europe, the bulk goes to a connected and powerful few. The prime minister of the Czech Republic collected tens of millions of dollars in subsidies just last year. Subsidies have underwritten Mafia-style land grabs in Slovakia and Bulgaria. Europe’s farm program, a system that was instrumental in forming the European Union, is now being exploited by the same antidemocratic forces that threaten the bloc from within. This is because governments in Central and Eastern Europe, several led by populists, have wide latitude in how the subsidies, funded by taxpayers across Europe, are distributed — even as the entire system is shrouded in secrecy. A New York Times investigation, conducted in nine countries for much of 2019, uncovered a subsidy system that is deliberately opaque, grossly undermines the European Union’s environmental goals and is warped by corruption and self-dealing. Europe’s machinery in Brussels enables this rough-hewed corruption because confronting it would mean changing a program that helps hold a precarious union together. European leaders disagree about many things, but they all count on generous subsidies and wide discretion in spending them. Bucking that system to rein in abuses in newer member states would disrupt political and economic fortunes across the Continent. This is why, with the farm bill up for renewal this year, the focus in Brussels isn’t on rooting out corruption or tightening controls. Instead, lawmakers are moving to give national leaders more authority on how they spend money — over the objections of internal auditors. The program is the biggest item in the European Union’s central budget, accounting for 40 percent of expenditures. It’s one of the largest subsidy programs in the world. Yet some lawmakers in Brussels who write and vote on farm policy admit they often have no idea where the money goes. One place it goes is here in Fejer County, home to Hungary’s populist prime minister, Viktor Orban. An icon to Europe’s far right and a harsh critic of Brussels and European elites, Mr. Orban is happy to accept European Union money. The Times investigation found that he uses European subsidies as a patronage system that enriches his friends and family, protects his political interests and punishes his rivals. Mr. Orban’s government has auctioned off thousands of acres of state land to his family members and close associates, including one childhood friend who has become one of the richest men in the country, the Times investigation found. Those who control the land, in turn, qualify for millions in subsidies from the European Union. “It’s an absolutely corrupt system,” said Jozsef Angyan, who once served as Mr. Orban’s under secretary for rural development. The brazen patronage in Fejer County was not supposed to happen. Since the earliest days of the European Union, farm policy has had outsized importance as an immutable system of public welfare. In the United States, Social Security or Medicare are perhaps the closest equivalents, but neither of them is a sacrosanct provision written into the nation’s founding documents. The European Union spends three times as much as the United States on farm subsidies each year, but as the system has expanded, accountability has not kept up. National governments publish some information on recipients, but the largest beneficiaries hide behind complex ownership structures. And although farmers are paid, in part, based on their acreage, property data is kept secret, making it harder to track land grabs and corruption. The European Union maintains a master database but, citing the difficulty of downloading the requested information, refused to provide The Times a copy. In response, the Times compiled its own database that, while incomplete, supplemented publicly available information on subsidy payments. This included corporate and government records; data on land sales and leases; and leaked documents and nonpublic land records received from whistle-blowers and researchers.  The Times confirmed land deals that benefited a select group of political insiders, visited farms in several countries, and used government records to determine subsidy payments received by some of the largest of these beneficiaries. The Times investigation also built on the work done by Hungarian journalists and others who have investigated land abuses despite a media crackdown by Mr. Orban’s government. Even as the European Union champions the subsidy program as an essential safety net for hardworking farmers, studies have repeatedly shown that 80 percent of the money goes to the biggest 20 percent of recipients. And some of those at the top have used that money to amass political power. In the Czech Republic, the highest-profile subsidy recipient is Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist who is also the prime minister. The Times analysis found his companies in the Czech Republic collected at least $42 million in agricultural subsidies last year. Mr. Babis, who denied any wrongdoing, is the subject of two conflict-of-interest audits this year. The Czech government has, in recent years, ushered in rules that make it easier for big companies — his is the biggest — to receive more subsidies. “The European Union is paying so much money to an oligarch who’s also a politician,” said Lukas Wagenknecht, a Czech senator and economist who used to work for Mr. Babis. “And what’s the result? You have the most powerful politician in the Czech Republic, and he’s completely supported by the European Union.” In Bulgaria, the subsidies have become welfare for the farming elite. The Bulgarian Academy of Science has found that 75 percent of the main type of European agricultural subsidy in the country ends up in the hands of about 100 entities. This spring, the authorities carried out raids across the country that exposed corrupt ties between government officials and agricultural businessmen. One of the largest flour producers in the country was charged with fraud in connection with the subsidies and is awaiting trial. In Slovakia, the top prosecutor has acknowledged the existence of an “agricultural Mafia.” Small farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for land that is valuable for the subsidies it receives. A journalist, Jan Kuciak, was murdered last year while investigating Italian mobsters who had infiltrated the farm industry, profited from subsidies and built relationships with powerful politicians. Despite this, proposed reforms are often watered down or brushed aside in Brussels and many other European capitals. European Union officials dismissed a 2015 report that recommended tightening farm-subsidy rules as a safeguard against Central and Eastern European land grabbing. The European Parliament rejected a bill that would have banned politicians from benefiting from the subsidies they administer. And top officials swat away suggestions of fraud. “We have an almost watertight system,” Rudolf Mögele, one of Europe’s top agricultural officials, said in an interview earlier this year. Unstated is that, while audits can catch incidents of outright fraud, rooting out self-dealing and legalized corruption is far more difficult. The European Union seldom interferes with national affairs, giving deference to elected leaders. Few leaders have attempted such widespread, brazen exploitation of the subsidy system as Mr. Orban in Hungary. At rallies, he deploys a false narrative that Brussels wants to strip away farm aid and use it to bring in migrants, and that he alone can stop it. Farmers who criticize the government or the patronage system say they have been denied grants or faced surprise audits and unusual environmental inspections, in what amounts to a sophisticated intimidation campaign that harkens to the Communist era. “It’s not like when a car comes for you at night and takes you away,” said Istvan Teichel, who farms a small plot in Mr. Orban’s home county. “This is deeper.” One man who did speak up was Mr. Angyan, the former under secretary for rural development. A jowly, gray-haired rural economist with a mischievous smile, Mr. Angyan became an unlikely crusader for small farmers. He served under Mr. Orban, initially thinking him a reformer, only to leave angry and disillusioned. He canvassed the countryside, documenting the government’s dubious land deals and mistreatment of small farmers. And then he disappeared from public life. To understand how leaders like Viktor Orban exploit Europe’s largest subsidy program requires going back 15 years, to when Hungary was spinning with optimism and change. In a moment that symbolized Western triumph in the Cold War, the European Union officially absorbed much of the breadbasket of Central and Eastern Europe on May 1, 2004. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia — all former Soviet satellites — were among 10 nations that joined the bloc that day (Romania and Bulgaria joined three years later). Amid the celebrations, Mr. Orban was in political purgatory. He had been the prime minister who helped guide Hungary into the union — only to see voters turn him and his party, Fidesz, out of office in 2002. Now he noticed one of the first protest groups to emerge in the new Hungary: farmers. Hungarian farmers clogged Budapest’s narrow streets in 2005 for a mass demonstration. They did not oppose European Union membership. Far from it. As new European citizens, they wanted the subsidies they were eligible for under the bloc’s Common Agricultural Policy, or C.A.P., but the payments hadn’t arrived. Hungary’s left-leaning government was too disorganized and unprepared. From the outset, the European subsidies represented a pot of money scarcely fathomable to farmers accustomed to Communist austerity. The program was designed after the Second World War to boost farming salaries and ramp up food production in countries laid waste by conflict. Over time, it became a critical foundation in creating the borderless economy that would grow into the modern European Union. European leaders understood that absorbing former Soviet satellites would bring challenges, but never fully grasped the potential for corruption in the subsidy program.  At its heart, the program is defined by a simple proposition: Farmers are mostly paid based on how many acres they harvest. Whoever controls the most land gets the most money. And Central and Eastern Europe had lots of land, much of it still state-owned, a legacy of the Communist era. European officials worked closely with incoming governments on issues such as meeting food testing standards, or controlling borders, yet only limited attention was paid to the subsidies. “They thought they would change us,” said Jana Polakova, a Czech agricultural scientist. “They were not prepared for us.” Mr. Orban showed hints of what was to come even before Hungary joined the bloc. Before he left office in 2002, Mr. Orban sold 12 state-owned farming companies, which became known as the “Dirty Dozen,” to a group of politically connected buyers. Buyers got cut-rate deals and exclusive rights to the land for 50 years, making them eligible for subsidies when Hungary became part of the system two years later. “This is a crony economy, where friends and political allies get special treatment,” said Gyorgy Rasko, a former Hungarian agriculture minister. “Orban didn’t invent the system. He’s just running it more efficiently.” Out of office, Mr. Orban watched the farmers’ protests in Budapest and saw the potential political and economic power of subsidies in the countryside. He also was intrigued by the man who negotiated successfully on behalf of the protesters: Jozsef Angyan. After the fall of Communism, Mr. Angyan made the case that small landholders could keep villages alive through sustainable practices. He founded an environmental program at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities and helped build an organic farm called Kishantos with 1,100 acres of wheat, corn and flowers. “He wanted to help the local farmers,” said Mr. Teichel, the farmer from Fejer County, who said Mr. Angyan was a rare champion of the small farmer in a countryside where corrupt politicians ran a “thief economy.” Eight years after losing office, Mr. Orban again ran for prime minister in 2010 and wanted to court the rural vote. Mr. Angyan was now a member of Parliament, and his ties to the farmers gave him political clout in the countryside. Mr. Orban summoned him to his modest home west of Budapest. It was a chilly February morning and Mr. Angyan had a cold. So Mr. Orban fixed tea over a wood-burning stove and, for two hours, the two men spoke about the future of Hungarian farms. Mr. Angyan envisioned a government that gave small farmers more political and economic clout. Mr. Orban made it clear that he wanted to implement Mr. Angyan’s ideas and offered to make him under secretary of rural development. “When Orban speaks, he speaks with such conviction,” Mr. Angyan said. “You believe him. I believed him.” After a landslide victory, Mr. Orban moved quickly, just not as Mr. Angyan had anticipated. Mr. Angyan’s proposal called on the government to carve up its massive plots and lease them to small and midsize farmers. But Mr. Orban instead wanted to lease whole swaths of land to a coterie of his allies, a move that Mr. Angyan predicted would make the countryside beholden to Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz, and its allies. He also knew that European subsidies would follow the land, widening the gap between rich and poor and making it easier for those at the top to wield power. “I had absolutely no chance to carry out what I wanted to do,” Mr. Angyan said. In 2011, Mr. Orban’s new government began leasing out public land. At first, officials said that only local, small-scale farmers would be eligible for leases. But the plots ultimately went to politically connected individuals who, in some cases, had been the sole bidders present at auctions. By 2015, hundreds of thousands of acres of public land were leased out and much of it went to people close to Fidesz, according to records obtained from the government and Mr. Angyan. New leaseholders paid low rates to the government, even as they became eligible for European subsidies. The deals drew sharp criticism in the local media, yet ordinary farmers stayed quiet, despite being left out. In one example, a powerful Fidesz lawmaker, Roland Mengyi, inserted himself into the leasing process in Borsod-Abauj Zemplen County, where one of his associates won leases for more than 1,200 acres. Mr. Mengyi is an outsized character, who referred to himself as “Lord Voldemort.” He was later convicted and sentenced to prison in a separate case for corruption related to European subsidies. Mr. Orban’s sudden change in policy left Mr. Angyan disillusioned, and feeling betrayed. He quit the government in 2012 but remained in Parliament, where he tried to push his vision, even as the government moved in the opposite direction. At a closed-door meeting in early 2013, Mr. Angyan confronted Mr. Orban in front of the prime minister’s most trusted allies in Parliament. “You’re going to destroy the countryside!” Mr. Angyan recalled saying.  “You are a well-poisoner,” Mr. Orban shot back, according to Mr. Angyan, startling the crowd with a blunt rebuke of a former member of his cabinet. “You have abandoned me.” As a shocked silence fell over the party faithful, Mr. Orban launched into a soliloquy comparing politics to a battlefield. Those who are loyal, he said, could count on their brothers in arms for protection. “But those who aren’t?” the prime minister asked. “We will also fire at them.” In 2015, Mr. Orban started moving even faster. His government sold hundreds of thousands of acres of state farmland, much of it to politically connected allies. Technically, it was an auction. But many local farmers say they were told not to bother bidding because winners had been predetermined. Few could afford the large plots, anyway, and many more did not even know about the sales. One pensioner, Ferenc Horvath, 63, lives in a shack in Fejer County, and belatedly discovered that the government had sold all the state-owned land surrounding his tiny plot. “It happened so fast,” Mr. Horvath said. “We had no idea you could buy land here.” On nearly all sides, Mr. Horvath had a new neighbor, Lorinc Meszaros, a childhood friend of Mr. Orban and former pipe-fitter who is now a billionaire. Fences sprung up overnight, and the stench of pig manure fell over the area. Mr. Meszaros, along with his relatives, has bought more than 3,800 acres in Fejer County alone, according to a Times analysis of land data compiled by Mr. Angyan and other sources, and confirmed by visits to the farm. Mr. Orban’s son-in-law and another friend of the prime minister’s have also bought large estates a short drive away, The Times found. The prediction made by Mr. Angyan — that Mr. Orban’s policies would make the countryside beholden to Fidesz and his allies — was being realized. It is a type of modern feudalism, where small farmers live in the shadows of huge, politically powerful interests — and European Union subsidies help finance it. In recent years, according to a Times analysis of Hungarian payment data, the largest private recipients of farm subsidies were companies controlled by Mr. Meszaros and Sandor Csanyi, an influential businessman in Budapest. Last year alone, companies controlled by the two men received a total of $28 million in subsidies.  The two men have radically different relationships with Mr. Orban and his party. Mr. Csanyi is seen as someone Mr. Orban cannot afford to antagonize. He is chairman of OTP Bank, one of the nation’s most important financial institutions, and has a reputation for outlasting mercurial leaders. He has hired out-of-work politicians from all parties, and his farming conglomerate, led by his son, now controls two of the “Dirty Dozen” companies privatized by Mr. Orban. Mr. Meszaros’s fortune, by contrast, is tightly bound to the prime minister. He has built an empire by winning government contracts for projects largely financed by the European Union and has recently snapped up companies that once belonged to a business tycoon who had fallen out of favor with Mr. Orban. They are eligible for a range of subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, whether direct payments based on acreage, subsidies directed at livestock and dairy farming or rural development programs — all of which is distributed at the national level by the Fidesz government.  “I’m always accused, and I am very angry about it, that I got the biggest subsidies,” Mr. Csanyi said in an interview. The reason, he said, is not politics. It is pigs. “I produce about one-sixth of the Hungarian pig production.” On paper, landowners should face restrictions. The Hungarian government has capped subsidy payments to the biggest farms, a seemingly progressive policy advocated by reformers. But farmers say it is easy to skirt the rule by dividing plots and registering the land to different owners.  Rajmund Fekete, a spokesman for Mr. Orban, said that Hungarian subsidy procedures “fully satisfy” European regulations but declined to answer specific questions about Mr. Angyan, or about land sales that benefited Mr. Orban’s relatives and allies. “Hungary is also fully compliant in the sale of state land, which is regulated by law,” he said. In Brussels, European officials were specifically warned about problems in Hungary even before the auctions. A May 2015 report, commissioned by the European Parliament, investigated land grabbing and cited “dubious land deals” in Hungary. The report even cited Mr. Orban’s home of Fejer County. More broadly, the investigators found that wealthy, politically connected landowners had the power to annex land across Central and Eastern Europe. “This is particularly so when they conspire with government authorities,” the report said. In Bulgaria, for example, land brokers had pushed for laws allowing them to effectively annex small farms. Investigators pointed to the farm subsidy program as a major factor, saying it encouraged companies to acquire more and more land. “The C.A.P. in this sense has clearly failed to live up to its declared objectives,” said the report, which was prepared by the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute. In a written response, European agricultural officials denounced the findings as unreliable, and in bold letters declared that it was up to the countries’ leaders to set and enforce national land use policies. That deference to national governments is a hallmark of the European Union. But it has left the bloc unable or unwilling to confront leaders who try to undermine its efforts, said Tomás García Azcárate, a longtime European agriculture official who now trains the Continent’s policymakers. “The European Union has very limited instruments for dealing with gangster member states,” he said. “It’s true on policy, on agriculture, on immigration. It’s a real problem.” As Mr. Orban’s government began auctioning off thousands of acres to his allies, Mr. Angyan began his own project. Out of government, he meticulously studied the land sales, compiling a record that officials could not easily purge. He interviewed farmers who had been abandoned by the government and mapped political connections among the buyers — findings now supported by the Times analysis. Beyond the biggest oligarchs like Mr. Meszaros, other supporters and sympathizers of Mr. Orban got blocks of public land.  In Csongrad County, for example, family members and associates of Janos Lazar, a Fidesz lawmaker, were among the biggest buyers, obtaining about 1,300 acres. In Bacs-Kiskun County, associates and family members of a former business partner of Mr. Meszaros bought big chunks of land. And in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok County, associates and relatives of current and former Orban government officials were among the biggest winners in the land auctions. Many have since leased the plots, with a markup, to big agricultural firms that receive European subsidies. “This is what the European Union resources do, and the revenues from the land do,” said Mihaly Borbiro, a former mayor of Obarok, a tiny village in Fejer County, a short drive from Mr. Orban’s hometown. While political patrons get rich, many small farmers count on the subsidies to survive. That discourages them from criticizing the system too loudly, many of the farmers said, especially in the face of retribution. Ferenc Gal, who raises cows, alfalfa and a few pigs on his family farm, said he applied to lease about 320 acres because the European subsidies alone would have made it profitable before he even planted anything. Local farmers were supposed to get preference, but the land went to wealthy out-of-town investors. When he complained, he quickly found himself a pariah. He said government inspectors showed up at his farm, suddenly concerned about environmental and water quality. He said local officials told him not to bother applying for future rural grants. “Once you’re on a black list,” Mr. Gal said, “that’s it.” Retribution also found Jozsef Angyan. Months after he quit the cabinet, government officials retracted the lease on Kishantos, the organic farm he had helped operate for 20 years. They gave the land to political loyalists, who plowed over the fields and sprayed the cropland with chemicals. Then school officials shuttered Mr. Angyan’s department at Szent Istvan University, destroying his legacy. “Orban understands when to keep people in fear,” Mr. Angyan said.  In interviews in Hungary, some agricultural scientists and economists refused to discuss land ownership or asked to not be identified when discussing their research. Farmers, too, saw what happened to the man who spoke up for them. “If Angyan can’t do anything, what can I do?” said Mr. Teichel, the family farmer near Mr. Orban’s hometown. Mr. Orban’s control of the European subsidies helps prevent another rural uprising, Mr. Angyan said. As long as the government administers the grants, nobody can afford to speak up. “If you’re critical of the system,” he said, “you get nothing.” Besides, he added, there is no real opposition in the countryside. Mr. Angyan’s small farmers’ association forged an alliance with Mr. Orban’s far-right party to get the prime minister re-elected. That relationship has outlasted Mr. Angyan, and those in charge of the farming group now hold powerful government positions. Mr. Angyan has receded from public life. This year, he met twice with The Times, providing the data he had been compiling. After the second meeting, Mr. Angyan stopped returning phone calls. When Mr. Teichel saw him recently at a funeral, he looked defeated. “He’s given up the fight,” Mr. Teichel said. As usual, Mr. Angyan asked how the farmer and his family were doing. “I don’t matter,” Mr. Teichel replied. “I’m just a soldier. How are you doing?

The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in November,2019-11-01,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for November, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘American Son’ Starts streaming: Nov. 1 After a run on Broadway, Christopher Demos-Brown’s play comes to Netflix with few big-screen adornments, maintaining the chamber-piece intensity of an African-American mother trying desperately to figure out what the authorities have done with her son. Also ported over from the Broadway production are the director Kenny Leon and his star, Kerry Washington, who paces the waiting area of a Miami police station after her son, an incoming West Point student, didn’t return home after a night out with friends. As she and her estranged husband (Steven Pasquale) question an officer (Jeremy Jordan), they’re met with obfuscation and some coded language that reflects racial bias. ‘Fire in Paradise’ Starts streaming: Nov. 1 As the effects of climate change continue to bear down in California, the dry conditions have made wildfires a perpetual threat to vast swaths of land and populated areas. The 40-minute documentary “Fire in Paradise” focuses on the Camp Fire of 2018, the deadliest forest fire in the state’s history, and how it affected the small town of Paradise, where residents had to flee their homes on short notice. The film interviews survivors and emergency workers, but it’s the assemblage of firsthand video footage that best underlines the urgency and terror of the situation. ‘The King’ Starts streaming: Nov. 1 Inspired loosely by Shakespeare’s “Henriad” plays, David Michôd’s expensive historical epic is about the clash between nations, but it’s also about the clash between two young stars, Timothée Chalamet and Robert Pattinson, who are considered among the most talented of their generation. In a distinctly modern spin on the reluctant hero, Chalamet plays Hal, a hard-partying prince who’s slow to accept his ascendence to the throne as Henry V, but treachery from within and without forces him to mature quickly as a leader. Pattinson gets the smaller but showier role as the cackling Dauphin of France, who challenges the young king at the Battle of Agincourt. ‘Earthquake Bird’ Starts streaming: Nov. 15 The last time director Ridley Scott visited Japan, he came away with the 1989 Michael Douglas vehicle “Black Rain,” an action thriller full of yakuza violence and motorcycle chases. Now Scott has returned to that milieu as the producer of Wash Westmoreland’s “Earthquake Bird,” which also takes place in 1989 Japan, following Alicia Vikander as a Swedish translator who has to answer for the disappearance of an American friend (Riley Keough). Through flashbacks, the film delves into the mysteries of their relationship and the suspects who might be responsible for a deadly crime. Westmoreland’s last two films, “Colette” and “Still Alice,” featured strong performances from their lead actresses — Keira Knightley and Julianne Moore, respectively — and he has two more excellent talents here. ‘Klaus’ Starts streaming: Nov. 15 It’s a good thing that children are more interested in getting toys than looking for holes in the Santa Claus story, because the mythology is getting awfully jumbled. Featuring a wealth of comedic voice talent, the animated comedy “Klaus” traces Santa’s origins to the miserable Arctic Circle town of Smeerensburg, where an underachieving postal worker (Jason Schwartzman) discovers Klaus (J.K. Simmons), a reclusive carpenter with a cabin full of handcrafted toys. With encouragement from various townspeople and a little bit of magic, an annual tradition builds up around this rotund, apple-cheeked stranger. ‘The Irishman’ Starts streaming: Nov. 27 Budgeted at a reported $159 million and running around three-and-a-half hours, Martin Scorsese’s gangster epic “The Irishman” may be Netflix’s biggest swing for the fences — and, judging by the film’s reception at the New York Film Festival, it appears to have connected. Working with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci for the first time since 1995’s “Casino” — and with Al Pacino for the first time ever — Scorsese adapts Charles Brandt’s “I Heard You Paint Houses,” a memoir about Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a hit man who claimed to play a role in the disappearance of his friend, Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). In this decades-spanning tale, deploying controversial “de-aging” technology, Scorsese reflects on what it means to grow old. ‘Atlantics’ Starts streaming: Nov. 29 Among a highly competitive Cannes competition slate in May, Mati Diop’s directorial debut won the Grand Prix, the equivalent of second prize, as Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” took the Palme D’Or. Long known to cinephiles as an actress in French films like “35 Shots of Rum” and “Simon Killer,” Diop continues in the tradition of her legendary Senegalese uncle, Djibril Diop Mambéty, whose “Touki Bouki” is an avant-garde classic of African cinema. “Atlantics” takes place outside Senegal’s largest city, Dakar, where construction workers on a coastal tower haven’t been paid in months. The workers decide to leave by sea, and one of them comes back to find his lover engaged to another man. ‘I Lost My Body’ Starts streaming: Nov. 29 Another big winner at Cannes 2019, this one in the Critics’ Week selection, the animated oddity “I Lost My Body” tells the surreal story of a severed hand that embarks on a wayward journey to reunite with its owner. Though the premise sounds macabre, the approach is more a lush dreamlike mystery, with the voiceless hand searching for the young boy who lost it and flashing back to memories when it was still attached. From that high-concept hook, the film liberates itself to explore the life of an orphaned Moroccan child in Paris and the adolescent romance that changes his fortunes. ‘We Are the Wave’ Starts streaming: Nov. 1 In this six-episode limited series from Germany, a cadre of high-school students decide to take action against the rising tide of nationalism that’s gripped the country socially and politically. Led by a charismatic yet mysterious new student (Ludwig Simon), the group wants to use activist stunts to trigger a larger movement across the country, but the bigger and more dangerous their ambitions get, the more their mission drifts away from them. “We Are the Wave” deals with the tensions and fractious relationships within the group, but also looks at what happens when a wave becomes a “tsunami,” and the group loses control over the direction it takes. ‘The Devil Next Door’ Starts streaming: Nov. 4 The latest Netflix true-crime documentary series unearths the controversial case of John Demjanjuk, a Cleveland grandfather who was known as a good family man and neighbor until the late 1970s, when the authorities accused him of being “Ivan the Terrible,” a notoriously vicious guard at Treblinka, a Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. On the strength of powerful testimonials from survivors, Demjanjuk was convicted as a war criminal in both Israel and the United States, but his guilt wasn’t as clear-cut as it might have seemed. “The Devil Next Door” scrutinizes both sides of the case and the complicated forces that affected justice. ‘The End of the F***ing World: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Nov. 5 The darkest of dark comedies, “The End of the F***ing World” never suggested a second season because the first — about the relationship between a 17-year-old self-proclaimed psychopath and the disaffected classmate he intends to murder — didn’t seem that open-ended. Yet the story of James (Alex Lawther) and Alyssa (Jessica Barden) left a loose end to tie up in season two, which brings in a homicidal new character named Bonnie (Naomi Ackie). It’s hard to guess where the series will go, since it’s run out of source material, but the creator Charlie Covell will try to pick up where Charles Forsman’s comic book left off and justify the extension. ‘Green Eggs and Ham’ Starts streaming: Nov. 8 How do you turn a Dr. Seuss book with 50 different words total into a 13-episode animated series? And does this mean a gritty live-action “Hop On Pop” is far behind? Dr. Seuss maintained tight control over the rights to his work while he was alive, but it’s been open season in the decades since, and “Green Eggs and Ham” happens to be a mostly untouched property. Netflix has invested heavily in the series, however, with Michael Douglas, Diane Keaton, Eddie Izzard, Tracy Morgan, Keegan-Michael Key, Daveed Diggs, John Turturro, Jeffrey Wright and Ilana Glazer all contributing voice work. Adam DeVine stars as Sam-I-Am, who embarks on a road trip to save an endangered animal. ‘I’m With the Band: Nasty Cherry’ Starts streaming: Nov. 15 Starting in 2000 on ABC with the boy-band producer (and later convicted scam artist) Lou Pearlman and continuing through three more seasons under P. Diddy’s watch on MTV, “Making the Band” used the music industry’s star-making machinery to produce ready-made pop groups like O-Town and Danity Kane. Now the wildly talented British singer Charli XCX is fronting a similar series called “I’m With the Band,” which chronicles the creation of the all-girl pop-punk quartet Nasty Cherry. Over six episodes, the show will document their origins, their time living together and the lead-up to their first performance, all unfolding before an eager fan base on Instagram. ‘The Crown: Season 3’ Starts streaming: Nov. 17 For the third season of Netflix’s hit show about Queen Elizabeth II and the drama behind the impeccable silken curtains, the estimable Olivia Colman takes over the role from Claire Foy, covering a challenging political era for the monarchy. Covering the period between 1963 and 1977, much of it ruled by Harold Wilson (Jason Watkins) as prime minister, “The Crown” will grapple with the disconnect between a country (and a world) undergoing radical change and a queen determined to hold it together through steadfast tradition. Elizabeth’s relationship to her sister Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter) takes on another dimension, too, when the princess’ marriage to Lord Snowdon breaks apart. ‘Mike Birbiglia: The New One’ Starts streaming: Nov. 26 After a successful run that lifted it from Off Broadway to Broadway proper, the humorist Mike Birbiglia’s one-man show “The New One” comes to Netflix, following his excellent 2017 special “Thank God for Jokes.” Birbiglia’s storytelling skills made him a fixture on “This American Life,” and “The New One” gives him the space to tell funny and touching anecdotes about his reluctance to become a father and the ambivalence that stayed with him now that he’s actually a parent. Also of interest: “Holiday in the Wild” (Nov. 1), “Queer Eye: We’re in Japan!” (Nov. 1), “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” (Nov. 1), “Zero Dark Thirty” (Nov. 1), “Seth Meyers: Lobby Baby” (Nov. 5), “Scams” (Nov. 6), “Let It Snow” (Nov. 6), “Patriot Act with Hassan Minhaj: Volume 5” (Nov. 10), “Jeff Garlin: Our Man in Chicago” (Nov. 12), “Maradona in Mexico” (Nov. 13), “The Knight Before Christmas” (Nov. 21), “Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings” (Nov. 22), “Holiday Rush” (Nov. 28)']","New additions include “The King,” staring Timothée Chalamet, Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” and “The Crown: Season 3”"
Hong Kong Protesters Call for U.S. Help. China Sees a Conspiracy.,2019-11-03,By Edward Wong,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong protests at times seem like love fests with the United States. Depending on the day, demonstrators wave American flags or Uncle Sam recruitment posters, and even dress as Captain America, complete with shield. The United States represents democracy, and the activists hope that maybe, just maybe, it will save Hong Kong. Five months in, they are trying harder than ever to draw the United States into their movement. The protesters are pressing Hong Kong officials and their overseers, the authoritarian Communist Party leaders of China, for greater democratic rights and rule-of-law in the autonomous territory. As they see it, the Trump administration might be able to make demands of Chinese leaders or Hong Kong officials, especially because members of elite political circles want to maintain access to the United States. Also, they note, the trade war with China, started by President Trump, is adding pressure over all on President Xi Jinping.  For the American government, the protests are more complicated — a potential policy dilemma but also a potential point of leverage with Beijing and a way to channel American values to the rest of the world.  “The United States should continue to deter Beijing from use of force, maintain an unblinking eye on Hong Kong, and make Beijing pay a heavy reputational cost for curtailing the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens,” said Ryan Hass, a former State Department and National Security Council official now at the Brookings Institution. Yet, he added, “I worry that the protesters in Hong Kong risk misinterpreting American sympathy and support of their cause for expectation that the United States will shield them from Beijing’s heavy hand.”  If the protesters are sending out a siren song, some American officials and lawmakers are answering it, eager to show their commitment to the cause. Members of Congress have appeared in Hong Kong in public displays of solidarity. Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, donned an all-black outfit, while Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, posted photographs from a protest.  In Washington, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has met with activists, pro-democracy politicians and Jimmy Lai, a publisher considered radioactive by Beijing. Vice President Mike Pence singled out Hong Kong as a beacon of liberty in a speech, saying, “We stand with you; we are inspired by you.”  And versions of a bill that would give support to the protesters are moving though Congress with bipartisan backing. The legislation, among other things, would allow the United States to impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses. “We hope this bill will pass,” said Selina Po, a 27-year-old protester wearing a mouth mask in the Admiralty neighborhood as she held up a sign with the bill’s name, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. “It’s our hope for winning this war. We’re trying all we can.” But American officials say the United States needs to weigh its moves carefully.  Greater involvement by Americans could give Beijing more ammunition in its propaganda effort to portray the pro-democracy movement as one stoked by foreign forces.  The Chinese government and state-run news organizations talk about “black hands” behind the unrest and spread conspiracy theories, including one centered on an American diplomat in Hong Kong who was photographed with activists in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel.  As the protests persist, American officials are watching for surges in violence and tracking the movement of People’s Liberation Army soldiers into Hong Kong. Some are beseeching demonstrators to stick to nonviolent tactics, even in the face of police crackdowns and attacks by people sympathetic to Beijing.  On Sunday, at least six people were injured when a man with a knife who is believed to be against the democracy movement attacked a family at a shopping mall. In the melee, the attacker bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy district council member, Andrew Chiu. “We’re telling everyone that we interact with, we don’t want violence,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. “We think there should be a political solution to the conflict that’s taking place there.” Two Democratic Congressmen, Tom Suozzi of New York and John Lewis of Georgia, the icon of the American civil rights movement, posted a video last month praising the activists for their “great work” and urging them to stick to nonviolence. Whether the United States takes greater action on Hong Kong hinges on the unpredictable Mr. Trump. Administration officials and American lawmakers talk openly about checking the authoritarian impulses of the Chinese Communist Party. But the president rarely, if ever, mentions human rights and democracy, and he has not made consistently strong statements on Hong Kong.  He is a transactional president. In June, he told Mr. Xi on a call that he would stay quiet on Hong Kong as long as Washington and Beijing were making progress on trade talks, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  In October, the Trump administration imposed some restrictions on Chinese companies and organizations for their roles in the mass repression of Muslims in mainland China, but Mr. Trump has held back from harsher actions for fear of upsetting the trade negotiations. If a Hong Kong bill reaches Mr. Trump’s desk, analysts say, the president might see it as merely a tool to wring concessions from China and could forego support if a trade agreement were close. “Strong American bipartisan support for the peaceful protesters is not enough to override President Trump’s transactional instincts,” Mr. Hass said. “He does not look at Hong Kong through a values-based lens. And as long as he remains president, this outlook will limit America’s responses to developments in Hong Kong.” Administration officials argue that Mr. Trump’s approach gives the United States a stronger hand in constraining Beijing on Hong Kong — even if it appears that Mr. Trump just wants to use the Chinese territory to his advantage. “America expects Beijing to honor its commitments,” Mr. Pence said, “and President Trump has repeatedly made it clear it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong.” In the eyes of Beijing, there has been no shortage of provocations by American politicians. On Oct. 22, Ms. Pelosi posted on Twitter a photograph of herself on Capitol Hill with three pro-democracy figures — Mr. Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang. “My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in nonviolent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong,” she wrote. On Wednesday, Ms Pelosi slammed the decision by Hong Kong officials to bar the activist Joshua Wong from running in local elections. She said it was “another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” referring to the foundation for the policy of autonomy that Britain and China agreed would be used to govern the territory.  Ms. Pelosi met Mr. Wong in Washington in September. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, lashed out, saying, “It is precisely because of the naked cover-up and connivance of external forces such as Pelosi that the violent anti-law forces are even more fearless.” “No matter how your eyes are blinded by prejudice, no matter how your heart is filled with evil, Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” the spokeswoman added. “Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs will not succeed.” Many demonstrators want American intervention and are focusing their attention on the legislation. The mere threat of American sanctions, they say, would give the movement greater voice with Beijing. On Oct. 14, the night before a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives, protesters held a rally in the Central district to call for its passage. Tens of thousands attended, many of them carrying American flags. “The power of Hong Kong people alone is limited, and we need other countries, such as the U.S., to help us counter China and keep ‘one country, two systems,’” said Eric Kwan, 32. “I doubt the act can be an ultimate game-changer, but I think it is enough to give pressure to China.”  Along with allowing for sanctions, the legislation requires the State Department to review each year whether Hong Kong is still autonomous enough to qualify for the benefits of the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which grants the city a trade and economic status different from that of mainland China. Some American officials say the bill could harm Hong Kong residents if the United States determines that the territory no longer qualifies as an autonomous entity. But the bill’s proponents defend its practical and symbolic value. “Standing in support of Hong Kongers and preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy should be a priority of the United States and democracies worldwide,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. The bill passed the House by unanimous vote last month. Though the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has not scheduled a vote yet, the measure is expected to pass that chamber easily, with a veto-proof majority. Then Mr. Trump would have to decide whether to sign it into law.

Turkey Hands Over 18 Captured Syrian Soldiers,2019-11-01,By Carlotta Gall,"['MARDIN, Turkey — Turkey has handed over 18 Syrian government soldiers captured this week in northeastern Syria in a deal negotiated by Russian forces, defusing growing tensions with the administration of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The Turkish Defense Ministry, which announced the handover on Twitter on Friday morning, did not say who took custody of the soldiers. They had been captured by Turkish-backed Syrian fighters south of the strategic town of Ras al-Ayn, Syria, on the limits of territory that Turkey has seized over the past three weeks to use as a buffer zone against Kurdish forces.  The announcement came as Russian and Turkish forces began their first joint patrol along the Turkish-Syrian border under an agreement to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish forces that Turkey regards as a security threat. Turkey controls one section of the border, while Russian and Syrian government forces have moved into other areas vacated by American troops after President Trump announced their departure last month. Mr. al-Assad said on Thursday that his government’s ultimate goal was to restore state authority over Kurdish areas of Syria after the departure of American forces, but he added that he expected it would happen gradually. Russia has become the main arbiter in northeastern Syria after President Vladimir V. Putin agreed to terms for policing the region with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Oct. 22. Under the deal, Turkey will control a safe zone of roughly 2,000 square miles, and Russia will ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the remaining border areas and conduct joint patrols with Turkey for verification. In an interview on state television, Mr. al-Assad described the deal between Russia and Turkey on policing the border as “temporary” and a “positive” step that would help Damascus achieve its goal.  “It might not achieve everything,” he said. “It paves the road to liberate this area in the near future, we hope.”  Syrian government forces have entered areas of northeastern Syria for the first time in years, after the departure of American forces, but Damascus has relied on the Kurdish militia, the Syrian Democratic Force and Russian troops for security. The Kurdish-led militia turned to the Assad government after its principal backer, the United States, announced its withdrawal. Mr. al-Assad said he did not see Turkey as an enemy. He also said that Mr. Trump’s decision to keep some American troops in southwestern Syria to maintain control of the oil fields in the area proved that the United States was a colonial power. Syria did not have the means to end the American presence soon, he said, but he predicted that one day they would have to leave. In their first patrol Friday, Russian troops met up with Turkish troops at the Syrian border town of Darbasiyah at midday. Turkish military vehicles entered Syria and the two forces drove in a joint convoy east along the border.']",The announcement came as Russian and Turkish forces began their first joint patrol along the Syrian border.
"Last Major Nuclear Arms Pact Could Expire With No Replacement, Russia Says",2019-11-01,"By Richard Pérez-Peña, Ivan Nechepurenko and David E. Sanger","['A Russian arms control official said for the first time on Friday that there was not enough time to replace the last and most important nuclear arms-limitation treaty with the United States before it expires early in 2021, raising the possibility that Washington and Moscow would then be free to expand their arsenals without limits. The fate of the New Start treaty has been in considerable doubt since President Trump pulled the United States out of another treaty, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, this year. But New Start is considered a far more critical agreement because it limits the number of strategic weapons — the most powerful weapons both sides can launch from submarines and bombers and on intercontinental ballistic missiles.  At the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States collectively possessed tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. After a series of arms-reduction treaties, New Start, which went into effect in 2011, limited the strategic arsenals to 1,550 each. (Smaller tactical weapons were not covered.) New Start expires in February 2021, just weeks after the next presidential inauguration in Washington. While it can be extended for five years by mutual agreement, President Trump and his aides have signaled repeatedly that he intends to let it expire unless it can be broadened to include other nations with strategic weapons, chiefly China.  But the Chinese are not interested — their arsenal is far smaller and they have shown no interest in negotiating a nuclear weapons deal. Mr. Trump’s insistence on including other nations, including China, in a renegotiation has largely been seen as a move to kill the treaty, which was negotiated by President Obama. President Vladimir V. Putin’s government has said that Russia hopes to renew or revise the treaty — but that the negotiations to revise it would have to begin immediately.  “It is already clear that within the remaining time — and the treaty expires on Feb. 5, 2021 — we won’t be able to come up with a full-scale document to replace it,” Vladimir Leontyev, the deputy director of the arms control department of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, said on Friday. “The prospects of extending the treaty are unclear, too,’’ he told a panel of experts in Moscow. “The U.S. administration is silent about it.’’ Mr. Leontyev appeared to be acknowledging what has been evident for months, but it was the latest in a sobering list of signals that the great powers appear headed for a new arms race. Revising the treaty, especially expanding it to other nations, would be extremely complex and, history suggests, would take years to complete. Most experts believe that even if talks started now, which the Trump administration is not prepared to do, negotiators could not complete a new accord before the treaty expires. A straight renewal would be far easier. But even if a new president were to take office in January 2021, that person would have mere days to extend the existing treaty.  Both nations are investing heavily in new weapons. When Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, or I.N.F., this year, accusing Russia of violating it with the deployment of a new weapon near Western Europe’s borders, Mr. Putin followed suit.  The United States is now testing a weapon that would have violated the I.N.F., and may deploy it in the Pacific to counter Chinese intermediate weapons, Pentagon officials say.  The Trump administration had expressed frustration that the I.N.F. treaty — like New Start — did not apply to China and hindered the development of new weapons to counter those being deployed by Beijing. Mr. Leontyev said that Washington and Moscow had barely discussed New Start. Trump administration officials have met with their Russian counterparts to talk about nuclear weapons only twice, he said, and a meeting planned for this month was canceled because of staff changes in the State Department. “The overall impression is that the current American administration is organically against any restrictions being imposed on the United States,” he said. Mr. Leontyev said talks on a new or revised treaty were in limbo because the State Department under secretary for arms control, Andrea Thompson, recently left the agency, leaving the Russians waiting to learn whom they will be talking with, and when. No replacement has been nominated, and the nominee would need to be confirmed by the Senate.  Veterans of the Cold War era see a rapid slipping back into old patterns. “The United States and Russia are now in a state of strategic instability,” wrote Ernest J. Moniz, a former energy secretary, and Sam Nunn, a former senator from Georgia who helped draft the legislation that financed the drastic reduction in former Soviet nuclear forces. “Not since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis has the risk of a U.S.-Russian confrontation involving the use of nuclear weapons been as high as it is today,” the two wrote in an article titled “Return to Doomsday” in Foreign Affairs this year.  “Yet unlike during the Cold War, both sides seem willfully blind to the peril.” New Start, signed by President Obama in 2010, requires each nation to have no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads, and no more than 700 “delivery vehicles” for them, meaning long-range missiles and bombers. It does not apply to tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller bombs intended for battlefield use. The I.N.F. treaty, signed in 1987 by President Reagan, prohibited land-based ballistic or cruise missiles with shorter ranges, from 310 miles to more than 3,400 miles. Short-range missiles are considered more destabilizing because they can, in some circumstances, hit their targets so quickly that an enemy has no time to respond.']","The treaty, disliked by President Trump, will run out in 14 months — and there is too little time to hammer out a new one, a Russian official said."
What Could Come Between These Two Allies? A $100 Jar of Honey,2019-11-02,By Jamie Tarabay,"['PAENGAROA, New Zealand — Australia and New Zealand are at war. Over honey.  Not just any honey, mind you — this stuff isn’t sold in plastic bear-shaped bottles. It’s manuka honey, a high-priced nectar ballyhooed by celebrities as a health and beauty elixir. (Scarlett Johansson smears it on her face; Laura Dern heals her children with it.) Manuka-branded honey is so valuable that New Zealand producers have gone to court to argue that they alone should have the right to sell it, in much the same way that only France can claim Champagne with a capital C. They say they are the only source of guaranteed authentic manuka honey, from a single species of bush; their Australian counterparts have marshaled a point-by-point rebuttal that stretches all the way back to the Cretaceous Period.  That has left these two neighbors, so closely bound that Australia’s Constitution still welcomes New Zealand to become one of its states, locked in a bitter dispute encompassing science, culture, history and, yes, cold, hard commerce. “For us, it’s a kick in the guts,” said Bert Seagrave, an Australian farmer with 4,200 beehives in the state of New South Wales. Losing the ability to brand his honey as manuka would cost him half a million dollars a year, he said.  Manuka honey sells for roughly $100 for 500 grams, or about 18 ounces, though higher grades can cost more. It has a nuttier taste than regular table honey, though at that price not many people are likely to be spreading it on their morning toast. Its promoters say it can soothe gastric inflammation and even help treat cuts and burns.  New Zealand makers of the honey have applied for trademarks in their own country as well as in Britain, the European Union, the United States and China — an especially lucrative market — among other places. Australian producers have filed papers in New Zealand and Britain opposing the applications. The New Zealanders say they have been compelled to take legal action in part because Australian producers are trying to get away with selling an inferior product.  The dispute revolves around the precise type of bush the honey is derived from. In New Zealand, manuka honey comes solely from the nectar of a plant known as Leptospermum scoparium, commonly called a manuka bush. The Australian honey, the New Zealanders argue, comes not only from that bush but also from dozens of other species in the same genus.  The Australians are “literally selling 80 different species as the same,” said Tony Wright, the general manager for market access at Comvita, one of New Zealand’s largest producers of manuka honey. That, he added, was a bit like “generalizing all the almonds and apricots and calling them plums.”  Producers in Australia, Mr. Wright said, are “glossing over the details, and the consumer is getting ripped off, because you can measure all those honeys and measure the antibacterial effect.” The elements of manuka honey are said to be so special that New Zealand makers have even created grading systems to rate its potency — one is called the Unique Manuka Factor.  But the Australians say their New Zealand counterparts are making a distinction without a difference. They say the Australian bushes in the genus Leptospermum are so closely related to the New Zealand bush as to be nearly indistinguishable, noting that until about 65 million years ago, Australia and New Zealand were part of the same landmass and shared the same species. Ben McKee, the chief executive of Capilano Honey, Australia’s biggest honey producer, has reams of scientific research to back his product’s health value, as well as Australian news clippings from the 1800s with references to the manuka bush, which until a few decades ago was considered by all parties to be little more than a weed. Beyond the argument over science, New Zealand producers make a cultural claim, based on the word manuka itself, which originated with the Maori, the country’s Indigenous people.  That adds a layer of sensitivity to the issue that cannot be ignored in any discussions with Australian producers, according to John Rawcliffe, a spokesman for the Unique Manuka Factor Honey Association in Auckland, New Zealand.  “If you want to come to the table and say manuka is not a Maori word, you will get nowhere,” he said of Australians who have made such assertions.  And then, of course, there’s the money. New Zealand’s manuka honey industry is worth about $220 million a year, and the producers have set a goal of increasing that to about $700 million within the next few years. Peter Brooks, a chemist in Australia whose laboratories have studied and tested manuka honey from both countries for years, said he believed that New Zealand wanted to achieve that growth by cornering the market. “They can’t produce more honey,” he said. “If they knock Australia out of the marketplace, they can increase the price of the product fourfold.” But it is not just about Australia, said Mr. Rawcliffe, the New Zealand honey association official.  He said that the trademark actions had been filed because manuka bushes were being planted and harvested in places like Spain, Serbia, Italy and China, and that inferior products could flood the market.  Still, the feud with Australia is “not nice,” Mr. Rawcliffe said. “Australia is Big Brother, and we have a very strong relationship, but this is Little Brother’s” product. The two siblings do indeed have strong trade and security ties. They have fought wars together and their leaders meet every year. But they do squabble, sometimes bitterly, most recently over Australia’s deportation of hundreds of New Zealanders, many on grounds of “character.”  One source of anger among Australians in the honey dispute is the fact that the New Zealand government recently stepped in to help fund the legal campaign. Australian beekeepers have struggled to get assistance from their government. But Australian producers may yet get help from an unlikely source. Tom Walters, the head of the Maori Research Institute, whose tribal lands in New Zealand are leased to honey producers, said he was so aghast at the actions of Mr. Rawcliffe and his fellow campaigners that he was reconsidering the terms of those deals. “I think it is absolutely ludicrous that two countries so blessed with such a wonderful product should be going to court and bastardizing the name manuka,” he said. “Rather, we should put those funds together, collaborate and put all that money into science and research to supply the world with more honey.”']","New Zealand producers, in the face of protests by their Australian counterparts, want to trademark manuka honey, a costly nectar beloved by celebrities."
Hong Kong Protests: Police Face Off With Demonstrators After Election Rally,2019-11-02,"By Amy Qin, Austin Ramzy and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — Police officers in Hong Kong on Saturday fired tear gas and clashed with protesters around the city, capping 21 weeks of antigovernment demonstrations that have convulsed this international financial hub and helped to sink it into a recession. In scenes throughout the night that have become part of the new normal in Hong Kong, the city’s central financial district and several dense commercial neighborhoods were enveloped in shrouds of tear gas as riot police battled with protesters, who wore masks in defiance of a ban on face coverings enacted last month. Earlier in the afternoon, police shut down two rallies in the Central district that had received official authorization, citing the clashes elsewhere. The day began when several thousand protesters turned out for a rally at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. It had been billed as a campaign event for Hong Kong’s upcoming district council elections, after the police rejected the organizers’ initial application to hold a demonstration. (Police permission is not always required for election events.) Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests. The mood was tense from the beginning, as police quickly declared the Victoria Park rally an unauthorized assembly and tried to disperse protesters using tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons. Later, as the police continued their dispersal efforts, some protesters responded by throwing petroleum bombs, vandalizing metro stations and shops seen as sympathetic to the Chinese government, spraying graffiti and building barricades on streets.For the first time, protesters also targeted the offices of Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. Dozens of protesters were detained, adding to the more than 2,800 who have been arrested since the movement began. Two pro-democracy election candidates, Osman Cheng and Richard Chan, were seen being taken away by the police.  A Hong Kong court on Friday granted a government request to temporarily bar anyone from “disseminating, circulating, publishing or republishing” information that “promotes, encourages or incites the use or threat of violence.” The order specifically cited Telegram, a messaging app, and LIHKG, a Reddit-like messaging forum. Both are widely used by demonstrators to organize protests. The ban came one week after another court barred the public from harassing police officers, including taking their photos while on duty or posting their personal details online. Chinese Communist Party leaders who met in Beijing during the past week signaled that they were exploring a tougher approach to the unrest in Hong Kong. Mainland officials renewed a call for “patriotic education” in the territory, aimed at fostering greater loyalty to China. Shen Chunyao, the head of a central government committee that oversees policy in Hong Kong, also indicated that Beijing might revise how the top official in Hong Kong, called the chief executive, is appointed. He confirmed that the Chinese government was considering new legal measures to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong. The demonstration on Saturday in Victoria Park was an unusual combination of protest and election rally. Candidates for district council carried banners and wore sashes bearing their names; they talked with potential voters as thousands of people dressed in black milled about. “There are many ways to struggle and fight back against the government, from inside the institutions and outside the institutions,” said Sam Cheung, 26, a university tutor and district council candidate from the Tuen Mun area in northern Hong Kong. The elections, scheduled for Nov. 24, will test the protest movement’s ability to take advantage of its momentum to gain institutional influence. That effort suffered a blow this past week when a government official barred Joshua Wong, a prominent activist, from running in the district council race.  Elaine Yu contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Christopher Buckley from Beijing.']","The event, which was billed as a campaign event for local elections, quickly descended into chaos around the city."
Beer With Bella: Benjamin Law,2019-11-01,By Isabella Kwai,"['You can learn a lot about someone from an interview. But can you learn more over a drink? The Australia Letter introduces a new series, “Beer with Bella,” in which one reporter in the Sydney bureau who hates beer but loves chatting (an unfortunate combination) meets interesting Australians over a drink of their choice.  Sign up to get the newsletter in your inbox. ________ The bar where I met author and journalist Benjamin Law is all open windows and classy lighting — what he calls a “bougie bar,” except he adds an Australian expletive we all know and love.  He used to be more of a beer person, he told me, but this place is close to his home in Sydney, has excellent wine and a good-looking sommelier called Anthony.  We settled into a table by the window. “I just think I reached the stage in my life where I was like, I’m ready for bougie wine.” Mr. Law said, grinning. “I’m leaning in, Sheryl Sandberg style, into my destiny.” An author, journalist and presenter, Benjamin is best known as the mind behind “The Family Law,” a television show based on his memoir of the same name about the lives of a Chinese Australian family in Australia’s Sunshine Coast. He recently hosted “Waltzing the Dragon,” a documentary exploring Chinese Australian history. For many people, his show was the first instance of seeing an Asian Australian story on a major television network. But before we had a chance to discuss all of that, our conversation derailed into our formative years, writing and multiculturalism.  ________ A Clare Valley Riesling that supposedly tastes like “dry mineral-y blocks in your mouth.” And some spicy cheese because, why not? ________ Because I grew up in an area with immigrants, I’ve always wondered how it is to grow up somewhere less diverse. Why did your parents decide to settle in Queensland? I had no idea how white my upbringing was. I went back to my hometown several years ago to help my mum pack up her house and there was like a hijabi woman in the car park and I wanted to race over to her and just like, ‘Are you sure you want to be here?’  There was one other Chinese Australian family there. When they were coming out from Hong Kong as newlyweds, Dad was like, oh there’s a work opportunity there. And they actually really loved what they saw. It was really clean versus Hong Kong; versus this megalopolis. But it was kind of dead. So Mum had mixed feelings. She was just, like, it’s really clean and beautiful. And it’s really boring and there’s no one to talk to and I have no friends. So it’s kind of like it’s a beautiful place where my soul will be crushed. ‘Let’s stay here and raise children!’ Completely. Happy primary school years, not so happy high school years — like my parents’ divorce coincided with the rise of Hanson-ism. It’s One Nation heartland where we grew up. Looking back I now realize what it was. Being a writer can be a structureless existence — how did you make it? Because I’m the son of entrepreneurial migrants and I’ve seen how hard both my parents have worked. I don’t need to have that lesson. You just see how it works.  I was a pretty anxious teenager. Mental health wasn’t necessarily great. And I remember having a really intense anxiety attack about a year into my creative writing degree thinking: What the hell am I doing? I just knew there and then after this panic attack, that I needed to carve my own path.  So I just picked up the phone and rang every Brisbane magazine for work experience. By the time I graduated, I was writing for The Courier Mail, and then making magazines with friends and finding work opportunities. I just remembered thinking, there is no job security; like you have to hustle. Was it easy to get “The Family Law” made? I had no plans to write the book “The Family Law.” And I had no plans to pitch it as a TV show. That’s how insanely lucky and lazy I am. I submitted two stories to an anthology called “Growing Up Asian in Australia,” edited by Alice Pung. It was the publisher Chris Feik who sent me an email saying: “Do you have a book idea? I obviously really like your essays.”  Internally I was like, no. But me being the son of entrepreneurial migrants I was like, give me three days and I’ll have a pitch to you. I was reading a lot of David Sedaris at the time. I pitched a collection. They said yes.   I was really lucky in that production companies for a while felt that there hadn’t been Asian-Australian stories onscreen, and in good faith had been looking for them. I was in the right place at the right time. So I think it’s a lot to do with timing and forming little Asian arts mafias. You’ve said Australia is behind: What do you think is holding us back? By and large, we do multiculturalism quite well in this country. And I think we pat ourselves on the back about that. We pride ourselves on our egalitarianism and therefore we’re complacent about it. Because that egalitarianism is mistaken for meritocracy. You don’t live in a meritocracy if all the gatekeepers are predominately, Anglo able-bodied heterosexual cisgender men. They might feel a little flinch-y at those labels but they’ve just never had to think of themselves as having labels. We have a real hand-wringing attitude toward tokenism and I’m like, ‘Guys, we have not even achieved tokenism yet.’ We really need to be less anxious about tokenism and more anxious about nepotism and exclusion. Those don’t seem to be worries about the workplace because those are kind of these invisible, tacitly accepted structures. I guess I’d describe you as fairly open on social media. How do you process that line between your public persona and who you are inside? Part of why I use social media a lot is because I have no colleagues and I’m isolated. I need to replicate human interaction — kind of that Tom Hanks in “Castaway” vibe. We all curate ourselves online. But I actually feel like part of my curating of what I put online is kind of coming at it from a professional way, which is, what’s the magazine I’d like to read? Can you give something of value to people? My social media feed is probably replicating the kind of conversation I’d want to have with a friend. My rules are either inform me or make me laugh. What’s your least favorite thing you’ve ever written? Anything that’s at least six months old. What’s that Zadie Smith quote? To read back on past work is to induce nausea. ________ “It’s unpredictable,” Ben said, “I’ve discovered I’m a dry mineral-y Riesling person which makes me sound like a wanker.” He thinks I might be a Riesling person too, he added.

The Reawakening of Quebec’s Nationalism,2019-11-01,,"['By Dan Bilefsky Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky, the Canada correspondent for The Times, based in Montreal. I am standing in for Ian Austen, who is smartly recovering from elections overload at his cottage near Algonquin Park. One of the biggest surprises of the recent Canadian elections was the resurgence of the Bloc Québécois, a nationalist party that advocates Quebec’s independence. It won 32 seats, making it the third largest party in the House of Commons. It has also revived a question: Is Quebec’s secessionist movement experiencing a comeback? At the beginning of the year, the bloc was in such disarray that Yves-François Blanchet, 54, a fiery former television commentator known as the Goon, became the leader of the party simply by virtue of being the only applicant. The bloc seemed once again destined for the political wilderness. So how did the party have such a renaissance? And what does it mean for the future of Canada? On the Saturday before the Oct. 21 elections, Mr. Blanchet, a former environment minister in a Parti Québécois government, made what appeared to be a rallying cry for Quebec’s independence, telling his supporters, “We can once again tell our Scottish and Catalan friends that in the struggle for self-determination, Quebec is back on Monday.” Meanwhile, both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, warned of the dire consequences to Canada if the bloc were to be emboldened and the old ghosts of separation reawakened. But the drive for independence isn’t what won the day. Quebec’s leading political analysts say Mr. Blanchet succeeded precisely because he put Quebec’s sovereignty on the back burner at a time when a younger generation of Quebecers aspires to be the next Québécois Bill Gates — not to foment revolution. Quebec’s secession is supported by about 30 percent of Quebecers, and he focused instead on safeguarding Quebec’s identity. While secessionist movements percolate around the world, from Catalonia to Kashmir, the independence issue was also sidelined in last year’s provincial elections in Quebec for the first time in four decades. Instead, the right-leaning Coalition Avenir Québec — led by François Legault, a businessman and once ardent champion of independence — won by focusing on upholding Quebec’s values, including pledging to impose a “values test” on newcomers. Taking a page from Mr. Legault’s playbook, Mr. Blanchet adroitly homed in on the insecurities of a majority French-speaking province surrounded by English-speaking North America. Concerns about protecting language and identity in an age of English-dominated Facebook and Netflix continue to exert a powerful hold on the Quebec psyche. During the Canadian election campaign, my Montreal neighborhood — Plateau Mont-Royal, a bourgeois-bohemian area peppered with hipster cafes and graffiti — was plastered with Bloc Québécois signs trumpeting populist slogans such as “Quebec is us” and “French is us.” Mr. Blanchet was also the only leader of a federal party to pledge to support Quebec’s controversial law barring teachers, judges and police officers from wearing religious symbols such as head scarves and turbans while at work. The religious symbol ban has been rebuked as an affront to Canadian values by many Canadians, and this week Toronto’s City Council followed Calgary’s example by calling for a national campaign to denounce the law. In Quebec, however, the law has become a powerful emblem of the province’s sovereignty over its own destiny. It is supported by about 66 percent of Quebecers. Gérard Bouchard, a historian and sociologist with the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi, observed that the Bloc Québécois’s election success had laid bare that, while the Quebec independence movement was flagging, the nationalism of the past was not. Professor Bouchard knows a thing or two about the bloc, as his brother Lucien Bouchard founded the party in June 1991, before becoming premier of Quebec. Professor Bouchard said that after the “non” camp won the referendums on Quebec’s separation in 1980 and 1995, English Canada had deluded itself into thinking that the challenge of a plucky, independent-minded Quebec was solved. The resurgence of the CAQ and the Bloc Quebecois, he said, showed otherwise.  “Both Blanchet and Legault are reaffirming a type of nationalism that had been dormant for decades but is coming back,” he said. Even with the remarkable success of the bloc, Jean-Marc Léger, the chief executive of the Léger polling firm, said that its power was likely to be circumscribed in Ottawa, because Mr. Trudeau’s minority government would be able to get the 170 votes it needed to pass legislation by teaming up with the left-leaning New Democratic Party of Jagmeet Singh. That outcome, he said, would deprive Mr. Blanchet of holding the balance of power. Nevertheless, Mr. Léger said the bloc’s surge reflected the extent to which Quebecers recoil when the rest of Canada tries to tell them what to do. “Identity politics are still fertile ground in Quebec,” he said. “A majority of Quebecers aren’t satisfied with Quebec’s constitutional relationship with Canada and they want more economic and provincial powers. But they don’t want independence.” Sidewalks automatically melting snow and cameras tracking pedestrians were part of plans for the redevelopment of Toronto’s eastern waterfront by Google’s sibling company, Sidewalk Labs. But following an outcry about privacy concerns, I wrote this week about how the plan has been scaled back sharply.  Is Canada the multicultural paradise it likes to imagine it is? In a recent searing opinion piece, Cheryl Thompson, an assistant professor at Ryerson University, argues emphatically that the answer is no. Canadians, she writes, confront the issue of racism under a cloak of “nice,” “polite” and “sugarcoated” responses. She argues that the election, buffeted by revelations that Justin Trudeau dressed in blackface two decades ago, has revealed the extent to which the country needs a national reckoning on race and discrimination. Pipelines are a polarizing issue in Canada, and this week, the Keystone pipeline system leaked about 383,000 gallons of crude oil in North Dakota, fewer than 50 miles from the Canadian border. The pipeline has generated protests for years amid concerns about its environmental implications. The planning that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world’s most wanted terrorist, was months in the making. It began last summer after the C.I.A. located roughly where he was hiding in a village deep inside northwestern Syria. That break came after the arrests and questioning one of his wives and a courier. Some of those details are recounted in this fascinating, cinematic timeline of the events written by three reporters in The Times’s Washington bureau. In his latest dispatch, Sebastian Modak travels to Tunis, the throbbing Tunisian capital where the Arab Spring began. Mr. Modak, a former editor at Condé Nast Traveler, encounters artists and intellectuals and finds a city suffused by cautious optimism, along with no little reveling. Mr. Modak is this year’s 52 Places Traveler, who was selected by The Times to report from all 52 places on the annual New York Times list featuring must-go destinations around the world. More than three months since India revoked the autonomy of the part of Kashmir it controls, the shuttering of government and private schools is affecting at least 1.5 million students.

"Macron Steps Into a Leadership Vacuum in Europe, and on Some Toes",2019-11-01,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — The German government is paralyzed, stuck in a divided “zombie” coalition unable to act and unwilling to die. The Italian government is an accident, another clumsy coalition built in fear of populism. The Spanish are about to have their fourth election in four years. And Britain’s navel-gazing continues more than three and a half years after it voted to leave the European Union. Into the vacuum, inevitably, has stepped France and its energetic 41-year-old president, Emmanuel Macron. But Mr. Macron, who loves to talk and spin off ideas no matter the follow-through, has overstepped himself lately, European officials, diplomats and analysts say.  He has annoyed his European colleagues, on whom he must depend to see his suggestions made policy, and has created a backlash among some member states and in the European Parliament. The most recent examples of Mr. Macron’s overreach have involved the difficult questions of European personnel, enlargement, Brexit and relations with Russia. In each case, and most tellingly in his veto of accession talks for North Macedonia, he has acted after little or no consultation among other leaders, vexing the rest. Northern European officials say they are concerned that given the absence of Britain and the weakness of Germany, France is pushing too hard for its concept of European integration and a stronger European defense that can act independently of the United States.  The fragmented European Parliament has rejected Mr. Macron’s handpicked commissioner for a grand French-designed job combining industrial and defense policy, Sylvie Goulard, in retaliation for Mr. Macron’s dismissal of the Parliament’s preferred path to a European Commission president. Instead of accepting the choice of the group that won the most votes in this year’s European Parliament elections, Mr. Macron fathered a deal that gave the position to the French-speaking former German defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, who had never even been considered as a candidate.  “The French think that they can act unilaterally without talking to everyone and get away with it, because they have a dynamic young leader with power and no one else does,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute.  The rejection of Ms. Goulard, herself a former European legislator, “is a reminder to Macron not to get too above himself,’’ he said. France has always seen itself as the policy leader of the European Union, noted Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House.  “Now with Britain distracted, Germany undergoing a protracted leadership transition, the U.S. undependable, it’s inevitable that France, with a clear foreign policy and aims, would argue that Europeans need to recalibrate their self-interest and act upon it,” Mr. Niblett said. “The problem is that since everyone else is weaker, people worry about being bulldozed, since Germany is not acting as a counterweight and Britain is out,” Mr. Niblett said. But Mr. Macron, he added, “is acting with too heavy a hand.” In some ways, through arrogance and ambition, Mr. Macron has made it harder for France to take the leadership role in Brussels that the circumstances may demand.  With external challenges from China, Russia, the United States, combined with internal ones over migration, rule of law, enlargement and its next seven-year budget, the European Union seems stuck. Even a new commission — a top team for the bloc’s executive arm — has been delayed in taking office by internal conflicts. On North Macedonia, Mr. Macron was isolated among the 28 member states in vetoing the start of accession talks, a shock to a small country that had done everything Brussels has asked of it, including changing its name to satisfy the Greeks.  But Mr. Macron suddenly argued that the entire enlargement procedure should be reviewed, calling it “bizarre.” Given the persisting problems of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the bloc in 2007 but still struggle with corruption, a rethink is not a mad idea.  But Mr. Macron’s veto is regarded by many analysts, like the French defense expert François Heisbourg, as a political move to shore up his position against France’s far-right party before the next presidential elections in 2022.  In North Macedonia, the government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has now collapsed, and the European Union’s continued enlargement is in question. The wider result has been to further destabilize the Western Balkans, a hole in the European Union where Russia and China have been meddling. Anna Wieslander, director of Northern Europe for the Atlantic Council, sees troubling unilateralism from France, especially toward Moscow. Since June, she noted, Mr. Macron has let Russia back into the Council of Europe, opened a new strategic dialogue, called for Russia to be invited back into the Group of 7, and called for “a new architecture of trust and security with Russia.” Then came Mr. Macron’s veto, “signaling that we don’t care about enlargement,” Ms. Wieslander said.  One reason may be Mr. Macron’s domestic political concerns, “but geopolitically, you can’t look at the Western Balkans and not realize that there’s a battle going on,” she said. “So either France doesn’t see it or finds it acceptable.”  French officials speak of trying to pull Russia away from its growing embrace of, or vassalage to, China; of trying to revive the stalled Minsk diplomatic process on Ukraine; of trying to get Russia to help Europe keep the 2015 Iran nuclear deal going, and even to entice President Trump to restart negotiations with Tehran. But on Russia, too, Mr. Macron’s efforts have produced little. “It doesn’t smell good, but policy hasn’t really changed,” Mr. Heisbourg said. The vacuum at the heart of Europe begins with Berlin, diplomats and analysts say. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made herself a lame duck, having announced last year that she will not run again when her term ends in 2021.  Her authority waning, she presides over a stagnant coalition. Yet neither her Christian Democrats nor their partners, the Social Democrats, dare call an early election, fearful of the rise of the Greens on the left and the Alternative for Germany on the right.  “Germany is now a complete void in everything,” said Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the German Parliament’s foreign relations committee and a member of Ms. Merkel’s party. “I can’t see a European policy, the foreign minister is a void, the chancellor knows everything but does nothing,” he said. “There is a breakdown of competence and energy.” The result is “a shift in the balance of power in Europe,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.  “As the euro crisis and refugee crisis subsided, Germany became much less central to the running of the European Union,” he said.  After waiting for support from Ms. Merkel for his reform plans in his first year, “now Macron’s not waiting for Germany or hiding from conflict with Berlin,” Mr. Leonard added.  Not everyone is happy about it. “There’s a lot of anxiety among Nordic and northern European countries content with German leadership, who are now having to work out a different approach to the E.U.,” Mr. Leonard noted. “And the Central Europeans see Macron as their biggest ideological critic.” On Brexit, too, Mr. Macron has been alone in pushing for a shorter extension to the deadline for Britain’s departure than the one requested by London, and accepted by other European Union members.  The French position has been consistent, wanting a clear reason from London for a longer extension, but Mr. Macron has annoyed his colleagues by complicating a simple decision and seeming to grandstand before giving in to the consensus. Even last March, when other leaders wanted to give Britain until the end of March 2020 as an extension, Mr. Macron argued for a much shorter one and compromised on Oct. 31 — a deadline that has now been extended again. Mr. Macron’s effort to push the line on Brexit is indicative of a man in a hurry, less willing to wait for others, suggested Josef Janning, who runs the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The drag that Brexit places on European matters will constitute precious time lost” for Mr. Macron, he said.  For Merkel, by contrast, he added, “It is likely valuable time won — time to show that Europe is still standing, time to cool the tempers of nationalists in E.U. governments, time to wait for a better moment to make progress on integration.”']","President Emmanuel Macron wants to lead, but his lone-wolf act has annoyed European colleagues, undermining his efforts."
"Iraq Demonstrations Grow, and Government Scrambles to Respond",2019-11-02,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — Tens of thousands of Iraqis, with support from Shiite religious authorities and the country’s president, gathered in the center of the capital on Friday in the largest of a month’s worth of antigovernment protests. Two demonstrators were killed, but pronouncements from religious and political leaders appear to have staved off a repeat of the violence of the early days of the demonstrations, when security forces killed nearly 150 protesters.  The religious authorities said Friday that the government should protect peaceful protesters who have called for an end to corruption and a change in leadership, a message that was echoed by President Barham Salih.  Although casualties were down and the security forces appear to have exercised restraint, the respite rests on a knife’s edge.  Behind the scenes, the security forces and civilian officials have discussed almost daily whether to use force to oust protesters from the Jumhuriya Bridge, which spans the Tigris River and leads to the Green Zone, a government and diplomatic center.  So far they have not, in order to avoid a repeat of the deadly, early-October violence that transformed what were initially small antigovernment protests into a nationwide movement. In addition to the deaths, thousands of protesters were wounded. Parliament and government officials are discussing ways to meet at least some of the protesters’ demands, and Mr. Salih seemed to put himself squarely on the side of the demonstrators. “The status quo is unsustainable. We are in need of big changes,” Mr. Salih said. “There is no security solution,” he added. “We reject repression and the use of force and violence. The solution is in reforms.”  Mr. Salih has proposed discarding the current electoral system, in which voters cast ballots for a list of candidates belonging to a particular political party. Instead, under his plan, they would vote for representatives by district, a move intended to make members of Parliament more accountable to constituents and to reduce the influence of the political parties.  Mr. Salih also said that Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi would resign, but only after the parties anoint a successor to avoid a power vacuum.  Opposition politicians and many protesters have called on Mr. Mahdi to resign, prompting him to offer to step down in a letter this week to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has been encouraging the protests.  The president’s repetition of Mr. Mahdi’s intentions seemed aimed at reassuring Iraqis that the offer was genuine. “The prime minister has expressed his willingness to submit his resignation, asking the political blocs to reach an acceptable alternative,” Mr. Salih said. Both the United States and Iran have weighed in on the protests, signaling that they view calm in Iraq as a priority. But while the United States has sided with the demonstrators, Iran has charged that the unrest has been fomented by Israel and the United States.  One of the victims on Friday, the first woman to lose her life in the demonstrations, was hit on the head by a tear-gas canister.  The tear gas used by Iraqi security forces is delivered in metal canisters that function like grenades, causing “gruesome wounds and death after the grenade embeds in the skull,” Amnesty International said in a report this week.  “The tear gas is not being used as a dispersal mechanism,” added Belkis Wille, the senior Iraq researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It’s being used in lieu of live ammunition.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.

Toronto’s City of Tomorrow Is Scaled Back Amid Privacy Concerns,2019-11-01,By Dan Bilefsky,"['It was supposed to be a sprawling “smart city” of tomorrow, with sensors tracking the speed of people crossing the streets and robots that could double as trash collectors. But the overhaul of Toronto’s eastern waterfront envisioned by a sibling company of Google, a plan that raised a chorus of privacy concerns, was severely scaled back on Thursday. Waterfront Toronto, the government agency responsible for development of the area, voted unanimously to limit the ambitions of the company, Sidewalk Labs, from its original 190-acre plan to 12 acres.  The plans have included neighborhoods made entirely of wood, automatic awnings that shield pedestrians from rain, and sidewalks that melt snow. The development has been lauded for innovations that could help expand the global profile of Canada’s largest city. Writing in The Toronto Star, Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s School of Cities, recently argued that the development would be a boon for the city, which he said was lagging “behind leading high-tech cities like San Francisco, New York, London and Shanghai.” But plans for Quayside, as the development is known, have also called for sensors and cameras to track the people who live, work or pass through the area. The resulting data, the company said, would be used to further shape the new community. That has spurred protests from local residents and privacy advocates. One group characterized the project as a “Google affiliate” trying to turn cities into “corporate surveillance states, modeled after Disney-style developments and sold to police services and corporate partners.” Waterfront Toronto moved Thursday to wrest greater control of any data, requiring that Sidewalk Labs treat information collected in the development as a public asset. The agreement reached with Sidewalk Labs also requires that the company join forces with other property developers. For one critic, that may not be enough. “The best way out of this mess would be for Waterfront Toronto to end any deal with Sidewalk as soon as possible” Julie Beddoes, a local resident and member of the group BlockSidewalk, said in a statement after the vote.  The debate over whether Toronto had given too much power to a technology company has exposed the challenges facing cities as they try to pursue technological innovation with private partners while ensuring the privacy of their residents. Keerthana Rang, a spokeswoman for Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google’s parent, Alphabet, said the company remained confident it could pursue its ambitions, albeit on a smaller scale.  Stressing that the project would help rejuvenate the area and create jobs, Ms. Rang said the company had planned, along with partners, to invest 1.3 billion Canadian dollars in the originally conceived development. It would now re-evaluate its overall investment, she said. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the head of Sidewalk, had cast the original plan as a manifesto for the city of tomorrow. “It is a guidebook to a completely new approach to urbanism,” he said. Waterfront Toronto said it will consult further with the public and conduct a formal evaluation of the plan, which will determine whether the project can go forward.']",The overhaul envisioned by a sibling company of Google has been lauded for its innovations. It’s also been called a “corporate surveillance state.”
"In the Amazon, Fires Steal Breath, but Smoke Smells of Money",2019-11-02,By Clifford Krauss,"['ALTAMIRA, Brazil — With thousands of intentionally set fires raging across its enormous expanse, Brazil’s Amazon rainforest has been a smoky mess in recent weeks: Roads and airports enveloped by a soupy fog. Local governments declaring emergencies and advising people to stay indoors. Many coughing and spitting, their lungs clogged with irritating particles of dust. For almost everyone who lives and works in the Amazon — as well for environmental activists around the globe — the fires are considered an unmitigated disaster, not only posing immediate health threats but also devastating huge swaths of a forest that plays an essential role in soaking up carbon dioxide and helping to keep global temperatures from rising further. For a very select few, however, the smoke is the smell of money: Many of the these fires were started by ranch owners, a powerful force in the Brazilian economy, as a way to clear land for more grazing for their gigantic cattle herds.  About 200 million heads of cattle are raised in Brazil, with an estimated 173,746 square miles of forest converted to cattle pasture over recent decades, according to the Yale School of Forestry.  Experts blame cattle ranching for up to 80 percent of the Amazon’s deforestation in recent years, which has led to international environmental campaigns to pressure meatpackers to forsake purchasing cattle from ranches involved in such burnings.  The fires are a fast, and illegal, way to transform dense jungles into fields fit for grazing. Limited enforcement — and fines that when levied are rarely paid — make the risk-reward calculation of setting a blaze an easy one for the owners of large ranches, who typically live in cities hundreds of miles away from the smoke. The owners of smaller spreads, who actually live on their farms, are less likely to engage in new acts of large-scale burning. Lenaldo Batista Oliveira, 63, a small ranch owner in Pará State, said he has seen many fires over the years from the kitchen porch of his wooden shack as he takes breaks from tending to his 100 head of cattle. But he said he is becoming increasingly disturbed by the number of blazes he now witnesses. “They think they can burn as much as they want,” he complained of his larger and more influential neighbors.  Among the cowboys and ranch hands who work the land for meager salaries, feelings about the fires are mixed, with some adamantly opposed to the practice, while others experience them as a necessary evil to stay employed. “We wake up without being able to breathe properly,” said Roberto Carlos da Silva, a 48-year-old worker at a carefully groomed ranch named Fazenda Nossa Senhora in Pará State. “Opening up more land for the cattle only helps the rich. The poor only suffer from putting up with the smoke while they work hard putting out the fires.” A half mile away, a blaze was spreading across a field. Workers at Fazenda Nossa Senhora insisted that the fire had spread from another ranch. Miguel Pereira, a 52-year-old cowhand on the ranch, said he did not like the smoke from such blazes either, but he had a different take from Mr. da Silva, his co-worker. “If you only protect the environment, then the farmers will go under from all the pressure of their expenses,” he said, while blue macaws shrieked as they fluttered around some shade trees. “If you can’t deforest a little, then there is no way you can raise more cattle. You need to create a situation where it’s good for both sides.” There are government regulations that monitor and regulate deforestation by cattlemen and others, but they are haphazardly administered at best, with attempts at enforcement strained by the vastness and remoteness of the Amazon rainforest. Policing the Amazon has become even less of a priority since the January inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who has put economic development ahead of environmental concerns. Many ranchers and farmers have viewed this stance as a green light to burn more rainforest.  That’s not to say there are no consequences for the ranchers who orchestrate these blazes. Brazil’s three largest meatpackers have all committed to not buying any cattle directly from farms using illegally deforested land. But there is an enormous loophole around this promise: Cattle are frequently “laundered” in the supply chain, often born on a farm where the forest was illegally cleared, and fattened on another ranch recently formed by a fire, before being sold to a final ranch that abides by Brazilian law and international environmental conventions.  Most of the beef produced is consumed domestically, although there are substantial exports, especially to China. While some laundering relies on middlemen to sell animals to the meatpackers, it can also take place within a single farming operation. Ranchers are known to move cows among their own properties and then submit paperwork to meatpackers listing only the name of the facility where their cattle are raised on permissible land. At the Fazenda Nossa Senhora, a large property with 1,000 head of cattle, on one side of fencing there is land where cattle raising is permitted under a 2009 agreement between the major meatpackers and Greenpeace to halt deforestation — but not on the other side of the fence because of burning there in recent years. Several people who live and work on the farm nonchalantly reported that cattle amble back and forth across the fence all the time. “The cattle need to change pasture,” said Mr. Pereira, the cowhand. “When the grass on one side gets used up, you have to take the cattle to the other side.’’ The ranch owners who say they do not burn new forest feel their profits are being pinched and are frustrated by the regulations against deforestation. “I’m losing money because they won’t let me clear more trees,” said Valdemar Gamba, whose family owns Fazenda Gramado II, a 370-acre ranch with 200 head of cattle. “They talk so much about conserving the Amazon, but I’ve never seen a producer earn any money from this conservation.” Whatever their stance on climate change and conservation, cattlemen are feeling the effects of a warming planet, and they worry about how all the burning is making life harder for them, and their animals.  “We live off the trees and the weather is getting hotter because there are fewer trees,” said Luis Rodriguez, a 53-year-old cowhand who looks after the 350-head herd at the Fazenda Universal ranch in Pará State. “Even the cattle are suffering because it’s getting dryer.” Mariana Simoes contributed reporting.']",
"Nigel Farage, Brexit Party Leader, Says He Won’t Run in Election",2019-11-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Nigel Farage, who has fared better in fighting for Brexit than in winning elections, has said he will not run for a seat in Parliament in Britain’s general election in December. But he vowed to lead his Brexit Party in a vigorous campaign that could threaten Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr. Farage said in a BBC interview broadcast on Sunday that he had concluded that he could advance the country’s exit from the European Union better by campaigning on behalf of his populist party’s other candidates than by contesting a seat himself. “I don’t want to be in politics for the rest of my life,” Mr. Farage said, adding that he had thought “very hard about this.” By giving up his own ambitions for Parliament, Mr. Farage, who has made much of his friendship with President Trump, could prove to be a bigger disruptive force in the election — and a bigger thorn in Mr. Johnson’s side — than if he were running himself. He said he planned to campaign aggressively across the country against Mr. Johnson’s Brexit agreement, which is a central plank of the prime minister’s election manifesto and that of his Conservative Party. Mr. Farage’s fierce criticism of Mr. Johnson’s deal, as well as his constant reminders that the prime minister broke his promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31, could weaken the Conservatives by splitting the pro-Brexit vote and tipping some close seats to the opposition Labour Party. “If Boris Johnson was going for a genuine Brexit, we wouldn’t need to fight against him in this election,” Mr. Farage said in the BBC interview. “If Boris is determined to stick to this new E.U. treaty, then that is not Brexit.” Mr. Johnson, in a separate interview, apologized on Sunday for failing to achieve Brexit by the deadline of Oct. 31, as he had promised again and again that he would.  “It’s a matter of deep regret,” the prime minister told  the British broadcaster Sky News. But he blamed Parliament for not approving the agreement he had negotiated with the European Union, which approved a Brexit extension to Jan. 31. Some political commentators said Mr. Farage, who spent two decades promoting Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and has been one of the loudest pro-Brexit voices since the 2016 referendum, was declining to run in the December election because he could not win.  Mr. Farage ran unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times as a candidate for the U.K. Independence Party. He resigned as leader in 2016, left the party altogether in 2018 and has been leader of the Brexit Party since last March. He has been elected to the European Parliament four times as a representative from Southeast England. After mostly lying low during Britain’s recent political upheaval, Mr. Farage has suddenly re-emerged as a noisy presence in British politics. Last Thursday, he welcomed a call from Mr. Trump to his London radio show, during which Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Johnson’s deal with Brussels would make it impossible for Britain to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States — one of the prime selling points of Mr. Johnson’s Brexit policy. “I don’t wish to cast any aspersions on the president of the United States,” Mr. Johnson said in his Sky interview. “But in that respect, he is patently in error.” The president also urged Mr. Johnson to ally with Mr. Farage in a pro-Brexit coalition. Four parties are competing in the Dec. 12 election, with the Conservatives leading the Labour Party in most polls — by double digits in some. But the winning margins are likely to be narrow. But Mr. Johnson has rebuffed Mr. Farage’s proposal of an alliance between the Brexit and Conservative parties because Mr. Farage has made it contingent on the prime minister’s dropping his Brexit agreement. Abandoning the agreement, Mr. Johnson said, would put the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in 10 Downing Street. Without an alliance, Mr. Farage has said, the party will field 600 candidates, several of whom could jeopardize Conservative-held seats in closely fought districts.']",Mr. Farage said he planned instead to campaign aggressively against Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit agreement.
2 Cabinet Ministers Resigned in Japan. Their Downfall? Melons and Potatoes.,2019-11-01,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — Japan has a low tolerance for anything with a whiff of political bribery. But a pair of recent scandals prove that stacks of cash need not be involved. The line can be crossed even with fruits and vegetables. Two ministers in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have resigned in the last week, less than two months into their tenures, after they were accused of the less-than-monumental offense of giving produce to voters.  The first to go was Isshu Sugawara, the trade minister, who was accused of sending cantaloupes and crab — luxury items that can be quite expensive in Japan — to constituents, as well as improperly paying about $185 as a funeral condolence gift to a voter.  Six days later, the justice minister, Katsuyuki Kawai, stepped down after a report that he had re-gifted potatoes to some constituents that he had received from a fellow politician. His wife, Anri Kawai, a candidate for Parliament, was also accused of paying double the legal limit of about $140 a day to staff members who travel in vans shouting campaign slogans. Both revelations came in the Weekly Bunshun, a newsmagazine. The two ministers have not acknowledged any wrongdoing, but both stepped down quickly, they said, because they did not want investigations interfering with governing.  The swift exits indicated that Mr. Abe is keeping a tight rein on anything that could destabilize his government as he is poised later this month to become the longest-serving prime minister in Japan’s history. But the departures also reflect the country’s by-the-book approach to following rules. In Japan, political gift-giving is simply not allowed. “It is not a matter of whether it is 10,000 yen or 1 million yen,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo. “Even if it is 10 yen or 100 yen, it is a bit problematic for politicians to step over the rules.” “In a sense,” Mr. Shiratori said, “we are a very serious nation.” Not only are the Japanese serious about avoiding graft, they are serious too about giving gifts. That may have been a factor in the undoing of the two ministers. Bestowing gifts is an important part of Japanese culture.  Any time employees or family members go on a trip, no matter how brief, they are expected to bring back souvenirs known as omiyage. Guests never arrive empty-handed. Companies give midyear and year-end gifts (ochugen and oseibo) to clients. And the custom of bringing money to a funeral helps families defray costs; small tokens like tea or dried seaweed are usually offered in return. Japan’s establishment has enforced the strict rules on political gift-giving ever since notorious multimillion-dollar scandals rocked Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. The rules, which include precise limits on compensation for campaign staff members, are intended to prevent the wealthy from gaining an unfair advantage in politics. Decades ago, though, the scandals were more about companies making huge payments to politicians. The former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was found guilty in 1983 of accepting bribes then worth about $2.1 million to arrange the purchase of Lockheed aircraft by All Nippon Airways.  Another scandal involving corruption by political and business leaders and a real estate firm called Recruit Cosmo shook the establishment in the early 1990s. But some wonder if the cut-and-dried approach of today misses the point.  “I think this has to do with the Japanese way of obsessively following the rules while refusing to see the bigger picture and problems behind them,” said Yujin Yaguchi, a professor of American studies at the University of Tokyo.  Still, others said the strict adherence to campaign finance laws was a positive contrast to places like the United States. “I think it’s a healthy sign for Japanese democracy that the government feels that even what we might see as relatively minor infractions of campaign finance rules is taken very seriously and results in the resignation of top ministers,” said Phillip Y. Lipscy, director of the Center for the Study of Global Japan at the University of Toronto. “It’s very different from the U.S., where government officials are able to dig in and get through what appear to be much more serious accusations of influence peddling and corruption,” he added.  Not every Japanese politician hits the exit at the first suggestion of wrongdoing, though. Mr. Abe himself has hung on to power through several influence-peddling scandals that threatened his political standing last year. After a brief, scandal-ridden stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007, he returned to power in 2012. Analysts said he may have learned from his first shot at power how to cut his losses. “Deprive the scandal of oxygen,” said Tobias Harris, an expert on Japanese politics at Teneo Intelligence in Washington, and “don’t give the opposition the opportunity to hijack the proceedings.” This week’s resignations have a precedent under Mr. Abe. In 2014, Yuko Obuchi, then the economics minister, resigned after giving voters wine and discounted tickets to Kabuki theater performances. (She was also found guilty of failing to report about $241,000 in fund-raising.) Also that year, Midori Matsushima, then the justice minister, resigned after handing out to voters paper fans embossed with her name. There have been second acts, however. Itsunori Onodera resigned as a member of Parliament in 2000 after he was found guilty of violating the public election law when his secretary offered voters boxes of incense with his name on them. After Mr. Onodera won back his seat, Mr. Abe appointed him defense minister both in 2012 and again in 2017. “Voters forgive candidates after they make an apology,” said Yukiko Miki, chair of the nonprofit organization Access-Info Clearing House Japan, which advocates more transparency in government. “They rather put a priority on what a candidate would do for them.” Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']",The undoing of top officials showed the country’s low tolerance for anything with even a hint of political bribery.
"She Was Daddy’s Little Girl. At 3, She Watched Him Shot Dead.",2019-11-02,By Taimoor Shah and Mujib Mashal,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — It was a daddy-daughter moment. It turned into a reminder of the lasting trauma of the intensifying conflict in Afghanistan. Amanullah Watandost, 42, who was employed by an Afghan security unit that works closely with the C.I.A., was behind the wheel of his Toyota Corolla on Thursday afternoon. His 3-year-old daughter, Madina, wearing a dress with a pink bottom and two pink bows, was in the seat next to him. They were out shopping for groceries in Arghandab, a district in the south that has long been a hotbed of Taliban militants.  Mr. Watandost was particularly close to his daughter, often bringing her along wherever he went. He and his wife had adopted Madina after not being able to have a child of their own in 20 years of marriage, according to family members. Mr. Watandost had lost four of his brothers to the war; like him, they all worked for the security forces.  Madina was his distraction from the sorrow weighing down the family. On a quiet stretch of the road, an assassin pulled up and emptied three rounds into Mr. Watandost through the car window. No one else was close enough to hear the gunshots.  When other cars and passers-by saw the vehicle in the middle of the road, they noticed Mr. Watandost’s body collapsed to the side. Madina was standing in her seat, looking over her father’s closed eyes.  “We did not hear any shooting; nobody heard any shooting,” said Haji Shah Aka, a neighbor. “He was dead in his seat, and his little daughter was in the front seat traumatized.” In the photos of the assassination that spread on social media, he is slumped back, the wound on his shoulder visible — one of the three spots where Mr. Watandost had been hit.  In all of the photos, Madina seems shellshocked. No tears. In one, she’s staring at the distance. In another, she is glancing at her father’s closed eyes, her arms clasped around her stomach. “After I saw the photo, I got such a headache that I couldn’t fall asleep until 1 a.m.,” said Iqbal Khyber, the leader of the People’s Peace Movement, which has traveled around the country trying to raise the collective consciousness about the daily violence. “Both sides have picked up guns against each other and have said they will kill each other.” “But what about this child? What say did she have in her father’s decision?” he said. “She is traumatized for the rest of her life.” The war has dragged on so long, and has spread so far, that any conventions of conflict — or local traditions of chivalry to protect women and children — seem forgotten, broken by both sides.  The militants carry out suicide bombings in mosques and wedding halls, boundaries rarely crossed before. In places like Kandahar, they have repeatedly assassinated female government employees, often with their young children at their side.  Government soldiers barge into homes in the middle of the night, accused of shooting and killing as women and children watch. Both the American and Afghan militaries carry out frequent airstrikes, sometimes resulting in civilian casualties. No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination of Mr. Watandost, which the government blamed on the Taliban. Within 24 hours, the Kandahar governor’s office said the assassin had been killed in a raid by intelligence forces.  For more than a decade, Mr. Watandost had worked for a C.I.A.-backed strike force that operates out of Kandahar. Such units have been repeatedly accused of abuses, including summary executions. A Human Rights Watch report recently detailed more than a dozen such cases for which the units have not been held accountable. Last May, one of the C.I.A.-backed units barged into a home in the middle of the night, killing a father, his two adult sons and one grandson. The grandson, Adel Shah, 10, received a shrapnel wound from the initial blast when the forces detonated the gate with explosives to create an entry.  Adel’s father was sleeping in the yard. In warm weather, many Afghans bring charpoy beds outside. “My father was shot in his bed,” Adel, his eyes bloodshot and his wounded head patched up, said the day after the raid. The women and children in the family were all put in one room and told not come out until an hour after the forces had left the house — or helicopters would shoot them.  In that period, Adel’s father bled to death in the yard. Civilians — along with children who become both witnesses and victims — are often caught in the increasingly ruthless violence carried out by both sides. In the Darqad district of northern Takhar Province on Saturday, a roadside bomb killed at least five children on their way to school and wounded three. Mr. Khyber, the peace activist, said what troubled him the most was that the frequency of violence had desensitized Afghans so much that gruesome episodes like Madina’s watching her father’s death only briefly captured the national attention.  Then people move on, shocked by something more extreme. He likened it to the example of the homeless people who sleep in a train station, their slumber undisturbed by the loud noise of the trains. “The biggest misfortune is that we are used to this daily killing,” Mr. Khyber said. “Today the people paused, but tomorrow they forget about it. The next incident needs to be even more cruel than this to be noticed.” Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan.']",The assassination of an Afghan government employee while his  daughter was next to him has underscored the lasting trauma of the intensifying war. 
"39 Vietnamese Died in a U.K. Truck. 18,000 More Endure This Perilous Trip.",2019-11-01,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Vietnamese smugglers call it the “CO2” route: a poorly ventilated, oxygen-deficient trip across the English Channel in shipping containers or trailers piled high with pallets of merchandise, the last leg of a perilous, 6,000-mile trek across Asia and into Western Europe. Compared to the other path — the “V.I.P. route,” with its brief hotel stay and seat in a truck driver’s cab — the trip in a stuffy container can be brutal for what some Vietnamese refer to as “box people,” successors to the “boat people” who left after the Vietnam War ended in 1975.  Vietnamese migrants often wait for months in roadside camps in northern France before being sneaked into a truck trailer. Snakeheads, as the smugglers are known, beat men and sexually assault women, aid groups, lawyers and the migrants themselves say. People cocoon themselves in aluminum bags and endure hours in refrigerated units to reduce the risk of detection. That journey proved fatal last week for 39 people, who were found dead in a refrigerated truck container in Essex, southeastern England. The Essex police said Friday that they were believed to be Vietnamese. As dangerous as the last leg of the migrant journey to Britain often is, those petrifying hours in a trailer are sometimes only a sliver of months if not years of harsh treatment — first at the hands of organized trafficking gangs, and then under imperious bosses at nail salons and cannabis factories in Britain. But still they come, an estimated 18,000 Vietnamese paying smugglers for the journey to Europe every year at prices between 8,000 and 40,000 pounds, around $10,000 to $50,000. In Britain, where Brexit has discouraged the flow of labor from Eastern Europe, migrants see a country thirsty for low-wage workers, paying easily five times what they could earn at home and free of the onerous identity checks that make other European countries inhospitable. Vietnamese smugglers, for the most part, get their clients across to France and the Netherlands, where other gangs, often Kurdish and Albanian, or, as in the recent case, apparently Irish or Northern Irish, finish the job. Many come from Ha Tinh and Nghe An, two impoverished provinces in north-central Vietnam, and leave for Britain with their eyes wide open to the risks, analysts say. Having watched their neighbors suddenly refurbish their homes with pricier materials, or buy better cars, they crave the same sense of security for their family, whatever it might cost them. But when Britain fails to deliver on that promise, migrants can end up in a dreadful limbo, kept from seeking help by the country’s harsh immigration system and living in the grip of a shadowy system of traffickers and the employers who rely on them. “I always encourage them, ‘Stay at home,’” Father Simon Thang Duc Nguyen, the parish priest at a Catholic church in East London attended by many migrant parishioners, said this week. “Even though you are poor, you have your life. Here, you have money, but you lose your life.” Not all the 20,000 to 35,000 undocumented Vietnamese migrants estimated to be living in Britain have horror stories to tell. Many migrants, some experts say, put up with the travails of working in Britain for the real chance of a payday. “My research has shown stories of migrants are not all about exploitation and not all about being trafficked,” said Tamsin Barber, a lecturer at Oxford Brookes University. “People are usually coming here agreeing to take high risks to work illegally and potentially earn large amounts of money in the cannabis trade.” But more vulnerable Vietnamese are also being trafficked to Britain, with the authorities receiving five times as many referrals last year as in 2012. Once family and friends have scraped together enough money, the odyssey may begin with a trip to China to pick up forged travel documents. That is how many of the dozens of people who died in the truck began their journey, said Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest serving a church in the town of Yen Thanh, where he said dozens of the victims were from. On the way from China to Russia to Western Europe, one of the most punishing stretches is the walk through Belarusian forests to the Polish border. In a 2017 French survey of Vietnamese migrants, a man identified as Anh, 24, told researchers that he and five other men, led by a smuggler, were repeatedly arrested in Belarus, only to be released at the Russian border to try again. When they finally succeeded, they were met by a truck waiting on the Polish side. “We were cold,” the survey quoted him as saying. “We didn’t eat anything for two days. We drank water from melted snow.” Other routes, choreographed down to the minute, land migrants in European airports with recycled visas and travel documents, according to “Precarious Journeys,” a recent report from ECPAT, an anti-child-trafficking organization, and other groups. As a precaution, smugglers in Vietnam often tell people to arrive at airport check-in desks 10 minutes before they close, for instance, so agents do not have enough time to inspect paperwork. The trip can take months, even years. Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, one of the migrants believed to have died last week, wanted to go to France to find work and support his siblings, seven of them in all, his father, Nguyen Dinh Gia, said. But in Russia, he overstayed his tourist visa and was confined to his house for six months. Then he moved to Ukraine and France, where he found a job as a waiter, before deciding to go to Britain for work in a nail salon. Trips are frequently interrupted when migrants are detained or run out of money. Some migrants are forced to work along the way, in garment factories in Russia or in restaurants across Europe. Some women sell sex, researchers say. Smugglers often keep people in the dark about where they are as a way of exerting total control. In a 2017 case, 16 Vietnamese people picked up by the Ukrainian authorities in Odessa thought they were in France. When migrants disobey their smugglers, the blowback can be fierce. “They cannot be discovered by the police, so they have to keep the discipline,” Father Simon said. “If you do not behave, you can be punished by beatings, or for women be abused sexually.” And once they arrive in Britain, they are often in for a rude awakening. Sulaiha Ali, a human rights lawyer, said migrants were sometimes promised legitimate work in a restaurant or on a construction site, only to be forced to work as “gardeners” in a house converted into illegal cannabis growing operations. Locked inside the house for days at a time and often living 15 to a room, workers face the risk of fire from tampered electrical wiring and health problems from noxious chemicals. In the nail salons where many Vietnamese find work, salon bosses can control every aspect of workers’ lives, a power that can breed exploitation, though researchers said some bosses also become migrants’ surrogate parents, cooking for them and providing a place to stay. When the police raid places housing migrants, they can often ignore signs of forced work or human trafficking and send migrants into deportation proceedings instead, migrant advocates say. “The emphasis, as soon as it’s established someone doesn’t have any identification documents, is not trying to establish whether they’ve been exploited,” Ms. Ali said. “It’s on, ‘Can we justify detention? Can we get them removed back to their countries?’” That threat of deportation, whatever someone’s circumstances, is a cudgel for trafficking gangs to keep migrants under their sway. “There’s a serious distrust of authorities, a lot of the time because traffickers have embedded that in victims’ minds: ‘You don’t have official documents,’ or, ‘You’re going to be deported or imprisoned,’” said Firoza Saiyed, a human rights lawyer. “It’s another thing that makes disclosure really difficult.” Older Vietnamese migrants in Britain, many of whom arrived after the Vietnam War, are separated by a wide cultural gulf from the newer arrivals, but they have still proved to be a crucial support, ever more so in the last week. Father Simon, who left Vietnam in 1984, said he had been fielding calls from families in Vietnam, wanting to know if he could tell them whether their children were in the trailer. “The mother, the father, all called me in tears,” he said. “I couldn’t bear hearing the words. You have to borrow a lot of money for this journey, and now you had hoped your daughter, your son can be successful, and that you can have some money to pay the debt. Now, it’s hopeless — nothing.” He went on, “Nothing is O.K., as long as they are arrested or in prison. It’s O.K., they survived. But now they lost two things. They lost hope and they lost their lives. Nothing.” Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Ye Thanh, Vietnam.']",Thousands of people from Vietnam are smuggled to Europe every year on a route filled with violence and hardship.

"Israel to Expel Human Rights Worker, Citing Anti-Boycott Law",2019-11-05,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Israel’s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a senior official of the advocacy group Human Rights Watch must leave the country within 20 days, invoking a contentious law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel or its settlements in the occupied West Bank. The ruling upheld a 2018 decision by Israel’s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, itself upheld in April by a lower court, to bar Omar Shakir, an American citizen and the organization’s Israel and Palestine director, from staying and working in the country. The case has shone a spotlight on the limits of what Israel views as legitimate criticism and human rights activity, as well as of its commitment to liberal democratic values.  Rejecting Mr. Shakir’s appeal, the judges wrote that the decision not to renew his visa had stemmed from “a real concern” that Mr. Shakir, through his activities, was “exploiting” his stay to delegitimize Israel and to promote the boycott movement against it. The judges said that the ruling against Mr. Shakir as an individual had no bearing on the work of other rights advocates and did not mean that Israel was “closing its gates” to other representatives of Human Rights Watch, a prominent New York-based organization, or to similar groups.  But critics described the decision as a chilling signal meant to intimidate rights workers and, more broadly, add to a growing Israeli clampdown on peaceful protest against the settlements and the treatment of Palestinians under the conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  “Who will they throw out next?” Mr. Shakir asked in an interview after the ruling. “The Supreme Court has put a veneer of legality on the Netanyahu government’s clampdown on human rights activities.”  Neither he nor Human Rights Watch had called for a wholesale consumer boycott of Israel or its settlements, he said. Michael Sfard, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Shakir, wrote on Twitter: “The ruling gives the Israeli government a dangerous and antidemocratic veto over the identity of representatives of international organizations operating in Israel and the territories,” referring to the areas occupied by Israel since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. “Today, Omar is being expelled,” Mr. Sfard wrote. “Tomorrow they’ll expel representatives from other organizations, foreign journalists and basically anyone who criticizes government policy in the territories.” Israel has stepped up its fight in recent years against the international movement to boycott it, saying that the movement delegitimizes the country and is anti-Semitic because it singles out Israel and ultimately aims to undermine its existence as a Jewish state. In 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment to the Entry Law barring foreigners who have publicly called for boycotts against Israel or its West Bank settlements. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s minister for strategic affairs, who heads the fight against the boycott movement, applauded the court decision. Arguing that Mr. Shakir “took advantage of his stay in Israel to harm it, something no sane country would allow,” Mr. Erdan said that Human Rights Watch was “welcome to appoint another representative in Israel in place of Shakir.”  Activists say that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is a nonviolent means to protest Israel and its policies toward Palestinians, along with its settlements, which most of the world considers to be a violation of international law. In August, under pressure from President Trump, Mr. Netanyahu’s government barred two members of the United States Congress from entering Israel for an official visit, citing their support for boycotting Israel. Israel initially denied Mr. Shakir a work visa in 2017. At the time, Israel’s Foreign Ministry accused Human Rights Watch of engaging in “Palestinian propaganda” and said it was “systematically biased against Israel.” That led rights activists to draw unflattering parallels between Israel and other countries that have denied the group access, such as Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Israel relented. But last year Mr. Deri, the interior minister, decided that Mr. Shakir’s visa should not be renewed, and the case moved to the courts.  The Israeli authorities compiled a dossier on Mr. Shakir documenting his activities in support of a boycott, mostly from before he joined the advocacy group. Like the dossier, the courts also pointed to reports and advocacy by Human Rights Watch that called on businesses to cease activities that benefit Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Tuesday’s judgment cited more recent Twitter posts written by Mr. Shakir, including some promoting a decision by Airbnb to stop listing properties in West Bank settlements — a decision that Airbnb has since frozen.  In February, Mr. Shakir wrote a post praising a Spanish company’s rejection of a tender for Jerusalem’s light rail project, saying that a section would be built on confiscated Palestinian land. “Other companies should follow its lead,” he wrote. Eugene Kontorovich, the director of international law at the right-leaning Kohelet Policy Forum in Jerusalem, said in a statement that the ruling against Mr. Shakir was “entirely unexceptional.”  “Western countries typically have legal provisions barring entry to people that seek to undermine the country,” Mr. Kontorovich said. But Human Rights Watch said in a statement that it had been calling on businesses to stop operating in Israeli settlements “as part of their duty to avoid complicity in human rights abuses,” and that it called on businesses to comply with this duty in many parts of the world. “The Supreme Court has effectively declared that free expression in Israel does not include completely mainstream advocacy for Palestinian rights,” the group’s executive director, Kenneth Roth, said in the statement. After a protracted court battle, Tuesday’s ruling appeared to have all but exhausted Mr. Shakir’s legal options. He said the decision on whether to expel him now reverted to the government.  “Our ask now is for the government to reverse its decision,” Mr. Shakir said. “I hope the government will see what’s at stake here. Regardless of what they say, it is not about one person or one organization. It’s about what kind of country Israel wants to be.”']","Rejecting an appeal by a United States citizen, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that his visa should not be renewed."
He Left His 310-Year-Old Violin on a Train. He Retrieved It in a Parking Lot.,2019-11-03,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Stephen Morris, a professional musician, was so exhausted after a long day in the recording studio that when he got off a train in southeastern London on Oct. 22, he did not realize he had left his 310-year-old violin behind.  “Devastated” once he realized his mistake the following morning, Mr. Morris  started a treasure hunt for his missing instrument — one of the few made by the master craftsman David Tecchler in 1709. It is said to be worth about 250,000 pounds, or more than $320,000. He wrote to Southeastern Railway, which operated the train he had taken that night, and made public appeals on social media for its return. The British Transport Police later released an image taken from CCTV of a man who might have taken the violin, asking him to get in touch, British news outlets reported.  As time passed, the possibility of its return seemed increasingly bleak. But on Saturday, Mr. Morris announced a surprise breakthrough: His antique instrument was back.  “My violin is home safe and sound,” Mr. Morris wrote on Twitter, before posting a photograph showing him kissing its side.  His joy was understandable. Mr. Morris told the BBC last week that he had been playing the same violin for 15 years. He is a soloist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, has worked with musicians such as Stevie Wonder and U2, and has performed as a leader of the ensemble of the popular composer Max Richter.  Mr. Morris told the BBC that the violin was in a “white glossy case” when he boarded the train from London Victoria to Orpington. Also inside were two “quite historic” bows, one of which had belonged to the American violinist Michael Rabin.  Mr. Morris said he received a private message on Twitter on Thursday from someone who said he recognized the person in the CCTV picture.  “He was very apologetic; he said he wanted to hand it to me in person,” a clearly relieved Mr. Morris told the BBC.  Both the violin and the bows were “in tune,” when they were returned to him Friday night at a supermarket parking lot in Beckenham, in southeastern London, the BBC reported.  “Struggling for words here,” a grinning Mr. Morris told the BBC on Sunday. “I’m still getting over the shock of it coming back.” Before asking him to play the violin, a BBC interviewer asked him if next time he may chain the instrument to his wrist. Mr. Morris laughed — then played “Amazing Grace.” Mr. Morris is not the first professional musician to leave a valuable instrument behind — and get it back.  In 1999, Yo-Yo Ma left his 18th-century cello in the trunk of a taxi after a concert at Carnegie Hall. Philippe Quint played a thank-you concert at Newark Liberty International Airport in 2008 after a cabdriver there returned his $4 million violin. And an American violinist left her $2.6 million Stradivarius on a train in western Germany in 2016, retrieving it only moments before the train left the station. Neither Mr. Morris nor the British Transport Police could be reached for comment on Sunday, but British news outlets reported that the police had said no further action would be taken because the violin had been returned.']"," The musician Stephen Morris said, “I’m still getting over the shock” at the unlikely recovery of his instrument.

9 Members of Mormon Family in Mexico Are Killed in Ambush,2019-11-05,"By Azam Ahmed, Elisabeth Malkin and Daniel Victor","['MEXICO CITY — Three women and six children from a prominent local Mormon family were killed on Monday in northern Mexico, family members said, when gunmen believed to be members of organized crime ambushed their vehicles on a desolate road.  The attack alarmed a nation already reeling from record violence this year, and though its details remained murky it fueled criticism of the government’s strategy against the power of criminal groups.  [Update: In Mormon family’s 12 hours of terror in Mexico, a message emerges: No one is safe.] Members of the LeBarón family, dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived in a fundamentalist Mormon community in the border region for decades, were traveling in three separate vehicles when the gunmen attacked, several family members said. They described a terrifying scene in which one child was gunned down while running away, while others were trapped inside a burning car. Two of the children killed were less than a year old, the family members said. The car they were in with their mother was set ablaze.   David Langford, whose sister Christina died in the attack, said that eight children had survived, including his sister’s 7-month-old infant. Several of the children survived after hiding by a tree, and one, about 12 years old, hiked several miles to get help, Mr. Langford said. One of the children who got away had been shot in the leg and the face and was in critical condition, Mr. Langford said. He blamed cartels in the area for the attack, calling their members “some of the most wicked men on the face of the planet.” Mexico has suffered a string of violent episodes in the past month, each as devastating and infuriating for citizens as the last.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said during a news conference on Tuesday that the region where the attack took place “has been a very violent area for many years.” Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister, said Tuesday that “there were serious advances in the investigation” and that the women’s sport utility vehicles could have been confused by criminal groups operating  in the area. Among those groups is a cell linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, which was led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo. When security forces tried to arrest one of his sons last month in Culiacán, in Sinaloa State, almost 400 gunmen swarmed the city and forced the government to withdraw.  Other groups are trying to seize the region where the attack took place, Mr. Durazo said.  Fourteen police officers were killed in Michoacán State last month, in an ambush stemming from violent clashes there. Days later, cartel gunmen laid siege to Culiacán. In both cases, the stark challenges of public security were revealed, raising questions about the government’s capacity to combat the spiraling violence. On Tuesday, President López Obrador defended his security strategy in the face of the drumbeat of violence, saying, “You cannot put out fire with fire.”  He said “there will be intelligence, which has been lacking, more than force,” and promised “prosecution, punishment.”  But Monday’s killings seem to have hit a new low, with infants, children and their mothers massacred in the road. It threatened to become a galvanizing moment for citizens frustrated with violence and the government’s efforts to stop it. President Trump offered on Tuesday to help Mexico eradicate the cartels, saying on Twitter that the Americans could “wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” He said that the United States was only waiting for a call from Mr. López Obrador, adding, “The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” Mr. López Obrador said it was up to Mexico to deal with the matter. “We appreciate and thank very much President Trump and any foreign government that wants to help, but in these cases we have to act with independence,” he said. Later Tuesday, a White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said the presidents had discussed violence and cooperation in the border region. Mr. Trump offered assistance “to ensure the perpetrators face justice,” Mr. Gidley said.  At least publicly, many details of the attack remained unclear Tuesday, as the state and local authorities struggled to piece together what happened and why. At the heart of the mystery was motive. It was unknown whether the attackers deliberately targeted the family, which has historically spoken out about the criminal groups near the American border, or whether it was a case of mistaken identity. Julian LeBarón, a cousin of the women who were driving, said that they and their children had been traveling from La Mora, in Sonora State, to Colonia LeBarón, in Chihuahua State. One of his cousins, Rhonita LeBarón, was traveling to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary. Her car broke down, Mr. LeBarón said, and the gunmen started shooting, causing the vehicle to explode. He said she was killed with her four children: an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and twins who were less than a year old. About eight miles ahead, the two other cars were also attacked, and the two other women, Christina Langford and Dawna Langford, were killed. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, Mr. LeBarón said.   The children were taken to hospitals, and several or all of them were airlifted to the United States, David Langford said.   Family members expressed bewilderment over what could have precipitated the attack. “They intentionally murdered those people,” Mr. LeBarón said. “We don’t know what their motives were.” One of the women even got out of her car, he said, and put up her hands. “They shot her point blank in the chest,” he said. Mr. LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel. The massacre came a decade after two other members of the LeBarón family were kidnapped and murdered after they confronted the drug gangs that exercise de facto control over  the borderlands south of Arizona.  The family’s religious community is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the mainstream church with 16 million adherents that is headquartered in Utah. Their community began in the early 20th century, when members of the LeBarón family moved to Mexico and practiced polygamy, which was forbidden by the Latter-day Saints. Polygamy has largely faded from the community. Religious communities that date themselves to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often call themselves Mormon. The mainstream church has abandoned the moniker.  It was not immediately clear if their religious beliefs were a factor in their deaths. Family members on social media implored the governments of Mexico and the United States to do something about the intensifying violence in Mexico, in particular in the areas along the  northern border, where Mormons and Mennonites have lived for decades despite the threat from organized crime.  Azam Ahmed, Elisabeth Malkin and Elda Cantú reported from Mexico City, and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong. Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting from Washington, and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.']","Six children were among the victims of a massacre attributed to organized crime, relatives said.

Jacob Rees-Mogg Suggests Grenfell Victims Lacked ‘Common Sense’,2019-11-05,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of Britain’s House of Commons and a prominent ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, suggested this week that victims of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire lacked the common sense to defy firefighters’ orders and flee the building, costing them their lives. The comments, appearing to lay some blame for the 72 deaths on the people trapped in the flames, angered other lawmakers and shocked even critics who have grown used to Mr. Rees-Mogg’s flashes of aristocratic obliviousness. They also threatened to undercut the Conservative Party’s main election pitch — that it’s a party for working-class voters alienated from the Labour Party over Brexit  — just as campaigning for the Dec. 12 vote gets underway. Nicknamed “the honorable gentleman from the 18th century,” Mr. Rees-Mogg was recently seen reclining on the front bench of the House of Commons, making clear his boredom during a fierce Brexit debate. And lawmakers said that a speech he gave in the run-up to a crunch vote was so arrogant that it persuaded members of his own Conservative Party to change their minds and rebuff the government’s Brexit plans. Mr. Johnson, who is about to formally launch the Conservative campaign, is already saddled with a reputation for being haughty and occasionally out of touch. For a government trying to dispel an image of being a bunch of smug, entitled private-school types sleepwalking into national crisis, Mr. Rees-Mogg’s air of condescension and disdain has not been helpful. But his comments this week threatened to be even more damaging, casting a fire widely seen as a failure of government oversight as, instead, the fault of the public housing residents who lost their lives in it. A 900-page, government-commissioned report on the fire last week found that more people would have survived if firefighters had not told them to stay inside their apartments. Emergency operators also told residents to shelter in place, because the building was designed to stop the spread of fire. Some tried to escape but were turned back by choking smoke, and others, not knowing where the fire was, feared that they would be walking into even more peril. Still others were physically unable to flee. “If you just ignore what you’re told and leave, you are so much safer,” Mr. Rees-Mogg said on Monday in an interview with Nick Ferrari, the host of a show on LBC, a radio station. “And I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do. And it is such a tragedy that didn’t happen.” Late Tuesday morning, Mr. Rees-Mogg apologized, saying, “I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments.” But some colleagues doubled down, with a Conservative lawmaker, Andrew Bridgen, suggesting that residents of Grenfell Tower exhibited a kind of deference common in people who were not fit, as Mr. Rees-Mogg was, to run the country. “Jacob is a leader, he’s an authority figure,” Mr. Bridgen said in a radio interview, describing why Mr. Rees-Mogg would have made it out of the Grenfell fire alive. “We want very clever people running the country, don’t we?” Opposition lawmakers and Grenfell survivors reacted furiously to Mr. Rees-Mogg’s remarks. Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour leader, called them “crass” and “insensitive.” “What possesses someone to react to an entirely avoidable tragedy like Grenfell by saying the victims lacked common sense?” Mr. Corbyn wrote on Twitter. “People were terrified, many died trying to escape.” Ahmed Chellat, who lost five relatives in the fire, told the newspaper the Mirror: “What common sense is he talking about? People died on the stairs trying to leave, they couldn’t breathe. People needed help and directions, they tried to open doors and there was smoke everywhere.” Mr. Rees-Mogg had been responding to a question about whether racist or classist policies had anything to do with the 2017 blaze, the deadliest in Britain in generations. The fire was fed by flammable cladding on the facade of the building that survivors have charged was installed to beautify their public housing project for the benefit of wealthy neighbors in west London. Mr. Rees-Mogg’s double-breasted suits, antique diction and penchant for polysyllabic words have long endeared him to a nostalgic set of Conservatives pining for the return of a different Britain. He has opposed climate change legislation, same-sex marriage, large-scale immigration and increased spending on social services, while supporting corporate tax cuts. As a lawmaker with impeccable pro-Brexit bona fides and a wide following on the right wing of the party, he is among the most prominent cabinet ministers in Mr. Johnson’s government. But Mr. Rees-Mogg’s unabashed elitism and past support for a no-deal Brexit that economists say would do serious harm have made him a frequent target of critics who would like to make him, not Mr. Johnson, the emblem of the government.  An Oxford graduate who named his sixth child Sixtus, Mr. Rees-Mogg recently had his wife’s ancestral home benefit from a state-funded restoration at a cost of 7.6 million pounds, about $9.8 million. He is a partner in an investment firm that has been criticized for operating in overseas tax havens. His remarks on Grenfell were the second time in days that his party found itself in hot water over the disaster. Last week, during a debate in the House of Commons over the release of the government report, Mr. Corbyn wore a bright green tie, a color long used to honor victims of the fire. Conservative lawmakers treated it as a fashion blunder and laughed at Mr. Corbyn, eliciting an angry response from Theresa May, Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, who had to remind her colleagues that it was for Grenfell. ']","Heading into an election campaign in Britain, the comment by one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s most well-known cabinet ministers could complicate matters for his Conservative Party."
Lindsay Hoyle to Replace John Bercow as U.K. Speaker,2019-11-04,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — In earlier times, the position of speaker of the House of Commons was one of the country’s most perilous. Two of its former incumbents were beheaded on the same day, for doing something or another that upset the monarch. On Monday, more than five centuries after that bloodletting, Lindsay Hoyle, an opposition Labour lawmaker, took on the daunting but less life-threatening challenge of succeeding John Bercow, who battled to keep order during one of the most turbulent periods of recent parliamentary history — becoming a celebrity in the process. As tradition dictates, the new speaker was dragged to the chair in a ceremony designed to display his reluctance to assume the position. In fact, he had waged a long, hard battle for one of the most coveted posts in British politics, which comes with prestige, perks and a salary higher than the prime minister’s. From the north of England, Mr. Hoyle, 62, has a wealth of experience as the deputy speaker. He presented himself as a stable and neutral force in a Parliament that was first divided, then paralyzed, by Brexit. “I will be neutral, I will be transparent ” Mr. Hoyle said after his election on Monday. “This House will change, but it will change for the better. ” Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated the new speaker, predicting he would bring his “signature kindliness and reasonableness to our proceedings.” In the coming months Brexit is likely to thrust Mr. Hoyle into the spotlight, but most analysts expect him to be a lower-key figure than his flamboyant predecessor. During a decade in the job, Mr. Bercow shouted “order” with his trademark, gravelly-voiced cry almost 14,000 times, according to one analysis, and chided politicians in famously antiquated language. Those talking out of turn and while seated were admonished for “chuntering from a sedentary position.” One lawmaker was told: “Be a good boy, young man!” But Mr. Bercow was also divisive.  With his love of the limelight and willingness to bend the rules of Britain’s unwritten constitution, he has been one of the political stars of the Brexit saga.  Not only does the speaker preside over debates, he or she is charged with interpreting the arcane rules of Parliament. It was in that interpretive role that Mr. Bercow played a critical part in the events of the last few months by allowing lawmakers to legislate to stop Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement. That prompted claims from critics that he aided opponents of Brexit. Mr. Bercow said he was simply standing up for the rights of lawmakers.  In his campaign for the job, Mr. Hoyle stressed his impartiality and, answering questions last month, carefully refused to say how he had voted in the 2016 referendum on British withdrawal from the European Union.  “This is about making sure, whoever is in power, that those on these benches have the right to question and hold to account,” Mr. Hoyle said in his pitch, referring to the green leather seating for lawmakers in the House of Commons. He takes over at a time when faith in Parliament is at a low ebb, with British politics fractured by divisions over Brexit and lawmakers on the receiving end of abuse and threats, particularly over social media. In a sign of the growing worries about safety, Mr. Hoyle on Monday said he would work to further improve security for members of Parliament.  “I promise that I will continue to fight to make sure that we are safe, our families are safe, our staff are safe and the House is safe,” he said. Mr. Hoyle, whose father was also a Labour member of Parliament, was elected by his peers in a series of ballots that whittled down seven candidates. But the timing of the election was unusual, coming just a day before legislators are scheduled to break for a general election campaign to elect a new House of Commons. Dating back more than 600 years, the job of speaker comes with an illustrious history, though Mr. Bercow prided himself on modernizing Parliament and casting off some of the most hidebound traditions surrounding the speaker’s position. However, he has been criticized for failing to tackle a culture of harassment, sexual and otherwise, in Parliament, and he himself has faced accusations of bullying, which he denies. Past speakers have traditionally been offered a place in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament, though that is determined by the prime minister. As Mr. Bercow has angered many within the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that honor cannot be taken for granted.  Since this is the British Parliament, Mr. Bercow could not simply hand in his notice to vacate his parliamentary seat. Instead, Mr. Bercow did what is normally referred to as “taking the Chiltern Hundreds,” by accepting a purely symbolic appointment that provides a legally watertight escape route from the House of Commons.  So, a few hours before his replacement was dragged to the speaker’s chair, Mr. Bercow was on Monday given another position: Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, a symbolic post with no actual duties.  ']","Mr. Hoyle, an opposition lawmaker, will take on the daunting task of replacing the former speaker of the House of Commons, who rode the position to global celebrity. "
What India Looks Like When the Air Turns to Poison,2019-11-04,By Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — Air pollution in India’s capital climbed to poisonous extremes over the weekend and into Monday, blanketing streets in an opaque haze, delaying flights and prompting fights between politicians over who was to blame. Every winter, farmers in northern India burn crop stubble to make room for a new harvest. The fumes drift toward New Delhi and its suburbs, mixing with construction dust, vehicle emissions and smoke from fireworks displays during Diwali, the Hindu festival of light. A toxic cloud can linger for weeks, causing coughs, headaches and even highway pileups. This year, the pollution has become so dire that the Indian government declared a public health emergency on Friday, shutting all primary schools for days and halting construction projects. NASA satellite imagery showed large swathes of India’s northern plains smothered by haze.  In many areas over the weekend, levels of deadly particulate matter reached around 60 times the global safety threshold, or the equivalent of smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day. People huddled around air purifiers, sealed door cracks with towels and prayed for rain. To try to curtail the pollution, officials in New Delhi on Monday started restricting the use of private vehicles on alternating days, allowing only cars with odd-number license plates to drive on odd dates and cars with even-numbered plates on even-numbered dates. The air quality index remained in the 400 range in much of the city on Monday, a level considered very poor. On Tuesday, it had gone down a bit and was pushing 300, still considered quite unhealthy. ']","The toxic New Delhi skies are caused in part by the burning of fields, and officials have begun restricting car use, shutting primary schools and halting construction projects. "
A Lake With Stingless Jellyfish and Hints of Hotter Seas,2019-11-04,By Richard C. Paddock and Adam Dean,"['KAKABAN ISLAND, Indonesia — Bracing for death, a swimmer takes a breath, slips into the lake and is soon surrounded by hundreds of pulsing, orange jellyfish. He must be very careful: His next move in the water could prove fatal. But it’s not the swimmer whose life is at risk. It’s the jellyfish. A bump from the swimmer could mean a death sentence. In a rare marine lake on a hatchet-shaped atoll in Indonesia, four species of jellyfish have evolved in isolation and lost their ability to sting humans. There are believed to be millions of these benign jellyfish in Kakaban Lake, which has become a popular spot for tourists intrepid enough to reach the remote archipelago known as the Derawan Islands. But it’s a fragile ecosystem, and these animals are vulnerable both to climate change and the growing numbers of visitors who casually invade their space. Colliding with one of these delicate, easily injured jellyfish can spell its doom, as a wounded jellie is far more susceptible to being nibbled to death by the small fish also inhabiting the lake. For that reason, swimmers here are not allowed to use flippers and are urged to swim as slowly and gently as they can. But the jellyfish are so numerous, it can be hard to avoid harming them. And as more tourists arrive, the dangers to the jellyfish are escalating. At times, the wooden dock at Kakaban Lake gets so crowded with divers in their black wet suits that they resemble the sea lions basking in the sun at San Francisco’s Pier 39. Not all of the divers arrive with an environmentally sensitive mind-set, either. A group of more than 80 employees of the Indonesian tax collector’s office recently came to the lake on a team-building exercise, traveling from the city of Tarakan in North Kalimantan Province, about three hours away by boat. The tax workers, many of them wearing life jackets, formed a giant circle in the lake, kicking and treading water, oblivious to the creatures around them. Their leader shouted instructions over a bullhorn and someone unfurled a banner that floated on the water. A drone hovered overhead and snapped their picture. A dive guide who watched the scene unfold figured the photo cost the lives of hundreds of jellyfish. There are about 200 marine lakes in the world, part salt water and part fresh, and so-called stingless jellyfish have evolved in several of them. Without any ocean predators around, the jellyfish no longer needed its natural defense system and its sting evolved into one so weak that people don’t feel it. For scientists, these lakes serve as proxies to explore what may come as ocean waters heat up because of climate change. “The lakes have environmental conditions that are warmer, more acidic and less oxygenated — in a way, a projection of our future climate,” said Intan Suci Nurhati, a climate and ocean researcher at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. Many thousands of years ago, Kakaban Lake was a lagoon connected to the sea. But the island was elevated during a period of geologic uplift, creating a 92-acre lake that today is surrounded by a ridge more than 130 feet high. The lake, a mix of salt water and rainwater and noticeably warmer than the surrounding sea, is still connected to the ocean through underground fissures, but the openings are too small for an exchange of any but the smallest life-forms. Kakaban Lake is the main attraction of Kakaban Island, one of about 30 islands, nearly all uninhabited, in the Derawan Archipelago, which lies some 35 miles off Borneo. The archipelago, located in the Sulawesi Sea, is known as one of the world’s best diving spots, offering crystal-clear waters, manta rays, sea turtles and whale sharks. Kakaban Lake, though, is not the only place in Indonesia to swim, pain free, with jellyfish. Researchers have found at least half a dozen marine lakes where jellyfish have evolved in similar ways. At least two can be found in the Raja Ampat islands of Indonesia, more than 600 miles southeast of Kakaban Lake.  The world’s best-known jellyfish lake, in the nation of Palau, suffered a dramatic population crash in 2016, most likely because of drought and increased salinity caused by an El Niño weather condition. The deaths underscored how vulnerable the animals are to fluctuations in their environment. While the jellyfish continue to thrive on Kakaban, the island has just two human inhabitants, Suari, 28, and his uncle, Jumadi, 48. Their extended family owns the strip of land where visitors can dock and hike over a wooden walkway to the lake. On some days, hundreds of tourists arrive. But after all the visitors leave, life on Kakaban is lonely. “It is really quiet here,” Mr. Suari said. “It is only the two of us.” About 4,000 people, mostly Muslim, live on nearby Maratua, the largest of the Derawan islands. Most are Bajau people, renowned as deep sea divers, whose ancestors arrived here from the Philippines eight generations ago. Darmansyah, a former chief of Bohesilian village on Maratua, said residents of the atoll were still mainly fishermen. “Bajau people are not interested in farming,” he said. “We always run to the sea.” But he is no longer fishing for a living, he said. Instead, like most other residents, he is happy to see a growing investment in tourism, including the recent construction of an airport and several new dive resorts Residents are building dozens of homestay units — holiday lodging in a family’s home — in anticipation of a tourist boom. Mr. Darmansyah, 60, has built two such units. Maratua has at least two marine lakes. One, Haji Buang, once had jellyfish to rival Kakaban Lake. But about five years ago, its owner, Hartono, thought he could make some quick cash by raising more than 30 hawksbill sea turtles in the lake. Only after he put the turtles in the water did he discover that it would be illegal to sell their shells because the species is critically endangered. The hawksbills, which feed on jellyfish, have nearly exterminated the lake’s population. “Now I regret it,” said Mr. Hartono, 62. “There used to be more jellyfish than in Kakaban Lake, but we didn’t realize this could be a tourist area.” Mr. Hartono said he was contemplating how to catch the turtles so he could return them to the sea — with the hope that the jellyfish population would recover. The local tourism agency at Haji Buang is spending more than $40,000 to build facilities there, including a wooden bridge, dock and covered seating area. Mr. Hartono said he had no interest in preserving nature for nature’s sake, but appreciated the government’s investment in his property. He said he would abide by the wishes of tourism officials and not cut down trees or build houses on the lake’s edge. “I would rather build and develop this,” he said as he tossed his cigarette butt into the lake. “If you leave it like this, it will only stay like this.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']","For divers, the millions of harmless jellyfish in an Indonesian lake are must-see novelties.

A Disgraced Ukrainian Oligarch’s Bizarre Ski Resort Plan,2019-11-03,By Andrew Higgins,"['CHORNA TYSA, Ukraine — With Ukraine besieged by questions about President Trump, mysterious goings-on along a dirt road through a mountain forest are raising what, for many Ukrainians, is a far more urgent and important question: Just what is one of the country’s most powerful and scandal-singed oligarchs up to? A sudden flurry of work to widen the near-impassable track in the Carpathian Mountains in the country’s southwest has added new fuel to growing alarm in Ukraine that Ihor Kolomoisky, a disgraced billionaire now seeking rehabilitation, is making a comeback and widening his already substantial influence. In 2017, Mr. Kolomoisky went into self-imposed exile in Switzerland and then Israel after the government seized his prize asset, Privatbank, and accused him of embezzling billions of dollars. He returned to Ukraine this year after the comic Volodymyr Zelensky, a former business partner of the oligarch, won the presidential election in April. Mr. Zelensky came to office promising an all-out assault on Ukraine’s chronic corruption and out-of-control oligarchs, so his relations with Mr. Kolomoisky are being treated as a sensitive barometer of his sincerity and capability in following through on his pledges. Mr. Zelensky, asked recently about Mr. Kolomoisky at a meeting with journalists in Kiev, the capital, said that the state was not going to return any seized assets. But he added that he was ready to hold talks about the future of Privatbank and other matters. Officials say the road work in the mountains is part of regular repairs. Opponents of a stalled ski resort project in the area, however, see the first concrete signs that, thanks to Mr. Kolomoisky’s revived clout, one of Europe’s most fragile, pristine and inaccessible wilderness areas is under threat. Enabled by corruption, illegal logging has ravaged the Carpathian forests. Conservationists say the proposed ski resort — whose plan includes 33 lifts, 142 miles of ski runs, scores of hotels and 120 restaurants — threatens to extend the damage to a particularly vulnerable high-altitude woodland zone known as the Svydovets massif. Mr. Zelensky’s spokeswoman, Iulia Mendel, said that the fate of a ski resort was not a matter for the president to concern himself with, but opponents of the resort proposal beg to differ. “Svydovets is a test for Ukraine’s new president of whether he is under the control of Kolomoisky or independent from him,” said Iris Del Sol, a Franco-Ukrainian environmental activist who grew up in the mountain region. Along with her father, she has helped spearhead a campaign inside Ukraine and abroad — known as Free Svydovets — to halt the resort project. The area proposed for the resort contains the source of the Tysa River, an important tributary of the Danube, as well as old growth forests, plant species that have mostly vanished elsewhere and endangered animals like the European brown bear. It also hosts part of a primeval beech forest that has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Why Mr. Kolomoisky, a shrewd businessman with holdings in some of Ukraine’s most profitable companies, would want to sink hundreds of millions of dollars into a risky project offering uncertain returns is a mystery. “A lot of what our oligarchs do does not make much sense under normal economic rules,” said Bohdan Prots, a botanist at Ukraine’s State Museum of Natural History and vocal opponent of the Svydovets project. Mr. Kolomoisky did not respond to interview requests. His longtime business partner in the region, Oleksandr Shevchenko, who runs a nearby ski resort, Bukovel, that was funded in its early years by the oligarch, insisted that Mr. Kolomoisky has never had any interest in building a bigger resort at Svydovets. Mr. Shevchenko, who travels around his own resort in a bulletproof Range Rover escorted by bodyguards, dismissed all talk about Mr. Kolomoisky’s role in the new resort as “rumor” and “fairy tales.” Corporate records, however, name Mr. Kolomoisky as co-owner of Skorzonera LLC, a company that official government documents have identified as the driving force behind “the development of a detailed plan of Svydovets tourist and recreational complex.” In a July 2016 letter to local authorities in the area, Mr. Kolomoisky’s company trumpeted the huge scale and economic advantages of the Svydovets project, saying Skorzonera “is convinced that we can realize an outstanding tourism project.” Conflicting accounts of Mr. Kolomoisky’s involvement are a measure of the confusion surrounding his broader role in Ukraine since Mr. Zelensky took office in May — and named the oligarch’s former lawyer as his chief of staff. Before his bank was seized by the government amid accusations of fraud, Mr. Kolomoisky enjoyed strong public support. Using his own money and influence, he rallied resistance in 2014 to pro-Russia separatists in his hometown, Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, preventing them from seizing control there. This favorable image crumbled after the debacle at Privatbank. But since his return to Ukraine just days before Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration, Mr. Kolomoisky has steadily reasserted himself on the public stage and as a skilled behind-the-scenes operator. With many of his assets still frozen, however, Mr. Kolomoisky’s spending is limited, and even some opponents of the Svydovets resort complex doubt he is ready to invest in a project expected to cost well over a billion dollars. What he really wants, said Oksana Stankevich-Volosyanchuk of the ecology group Ecosphere, is to gain control of Svydovets’s supplies of water, a scarce resource that Bukovel, once partly owned by Mr. Kolomoisky, needs to keep its snow machines running and dozens of hotels operating. Mr. Shevchenko denied this, insisting that Bukovel has plenty of water and has shed its ties to Mr. Kolomoisky. The Svydovets project was first announced in 2016 by the governor of the Trans-Carpathia region at the time, Gennady Moskel, who said the planned resort would accommodate as many as 28,000 visitors at once — an ambitious target in an area that currently has no asphalt roads, virtually no people and is five hours by car on often bone-bruising mountain tracks from the nearest airport in Ivano-Frankivsk. On a visit to southwestern Ukraine this summer, Mr. Zelensky made no public mention of the Svydovets project or the movement to halt it. But he did meet with Mr. Shevchenko to discuss rebuilding Ivano-Frankivsk’s ramshackle Soviet-era airport and spoke of the importance of lifting the area’s dim economic prospects. Mr. Kolomoisky’s company, Skorzonera, runs the airport under a concession from the government. While strongly supported by many local officials, the new resort project quickly ran into legal and other troubles. Some villagers, angry that they had not been consulted or informed about the governor’s plans, successfully sued in a regional court in 2017 to have the project shelved until more information was provided. A higher court reversed that decision and, after an appeal by the villagers, the matter is now before the nation’s Supreme Court. Valery Pavluk, the co-owner of a sawmill, who was among those who brought the case, said that his opposition to the resort brought immediate retaliation from the authorities: His business was suddenly in the sights of tax, health and other government inspectors. “They just wanted to frighten me,” he said at his home in Lopukhovo, a village to the west of the planned resort. He said he did not vote in the April presidential election won by Mr. Zelensky..“Elections never really change anything here,” Mr. Pavluk said. Real power in Ukraine, he added, has always rested with billionaires like Mr. Kolomoisky. The region’s current governor, Ihor Bondarenko, who was appointed this summer by Mr. Zelensky, said he understood opposition to tearing up a forest wilderness to make way for a giant resort. Nevertheless, he added, Trans-Carpathia, one of Ukraine’s poorest regions, desperately needs investment to fund development and provide jobs. “There are two sides to every coin,” he said. Fedin Shandor, a professor at Uzhgorod University and adviser to the government on tourist development, said he shared local officials’ interest in attracting investment but was “100 percent against” the new ski resort. “We know these people and know how it will end,” he said, referring to Mr. Kolomoisky, whom he described as “a leech who sucks our blood here and puts it in Switzerland.” Ivan Pavlyuchuk, the mayor of Chorna Tysa, a village in the foothills of the Svydovets massif, dismissed concerns about Mr. Kolomoisky, saying he did not know or care who was behind the project but was determined to see it get off the ground. “If this project does not happen,” he said, “nothing will get done here: no new roads, no new schools, no jobs. Nothing.” Mr. Prots, the Museum of Natural History scientist, said that he understood the mayor’s eagerness for better economic prospects, but that he and other mountain people were being sold a bill of goods. “For Kolomoisky, this is just a toy,” Mr. Prots said. “He is not really bothered about developing a ski resort. He just wants to show his influence.”']",
What We Know About the Killing of 9 Mormon Family Members in Mexico,2019-11-05,By Kelly Virella,"['At least nine members of a Mormon family that has in the past spoken up against Mexican drug cartels were killed on Monday when their vehicles were ambushed by gunmen in a violent region of northern Mexico, family members said.  The victims included six children and their mothers. One of the vehicles caught fire, burning the bodies of one mother and her four children beyond recognition. Eight children survived the attack, although six of them were injured, one of them critically, according to David Langford, a relative of the victims. Family members said that one of the surviving children was shot in the back. One of the women was shot in the chest at point-blank range, said Julian LeBarón, a cousin of some of the victims.  Some of the children hid by the roadside to escape, Mr. LeBarón said. Family members said that the surviving children included a 7-month-old infant and a child about 12 years old who hiked for miles to seek help.   Initial accounts of the violence came from the family of the victims. As Mexican officials tried to determine how it unfolded, details of the attack remained murky on Tuesday.  Here’s what we know so far. The nine victims were members of the LeBarón family, a group of dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived in a fundamentalist Mormon community in the border region since the 1940s.  Much of the LeBarón family now lives in North Dakota, where they work in the oil fields and run businesses, but they frequently travel to the border area for holidays, vacations and other special events, said Kenny LeBarón, a cousin of the three slain women.  David Langford, the brother of one of the victims, said the three women who died were his sister Christina Langford; Dawna Langford and Rhonita LeBarón.  The family is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the mainstream church with 16 million adherents that is headquartered in Utah. When the LeBaróns first arrived in Mexico, they practiced polygamy, but that has now largely faded from the community, the family says. The Church of Latter-day Saints prohibits the practice. It has also abandoned the name Mormon, while the LeBaróns continue to use it. The family was traveling in three separate vehicles from La Mora, in the state of Sonora, to Colonia LeBarón, in the state of Chihuahua, when they were set upon by gunmen.  One of the victims, Rhonita LeBarón, was headed to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary. Her car broke down, Julian LeBarón said, and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car.” She was killed, along with her four children, he said: an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and twins who were less than a year old. About eight miles ahead, the two other cars were also attacked, and the two other women were killed, he said. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, he said. No suspects have been named, but Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister, said Tuesday that “there were serious advances in the investigation.” The family suspects that the gunmen were members of an organized crime group. The Sinaloa Cartel, which was once led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, is active in the area; so are other groups trying to take control. The massacre came a decade after two members of the LeBarón family who confronted local drug cartels were kidnapped and murdered. But things had been peaceful in recent years and there seemed to be a sort of truce, said Ruth Wariner, Rhonita LeBarón’s aunt. It’s unclear whether the attackers intentionally targeted the family on Tuesday or whether it was a case of mistaken identity. [Update: In Mormon family’s 12 hours of terror in Mexico, a message emerges: No one is safe.] Julian LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel. Ms. Wariner said she suspected that drug traffickers had mistaken the women’s caravan of  sport utility vehicles as being from a rival trafficking group. Mr. Durazo offered the same theory on Tuesday. Mexico deployed its newly formed National Guard and its military to the region. President Trump offered to help Mexico eradicate its drug cartels. “This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,” he said on Twitter. “We merely await a call from your great new president!”  He added, “The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said that it was up to Mexico to deal with the matter. “We appreciate and thank very much President Trump and any foreign government that wants to help, but in these cases we have to act with independence, according to our Constitution and our tradition of independence and sovereignty,” he said. Large Mexican criminal groups have launched a string of violent attacks in recent weeks. Fourteen police officers were killed in an ambush last month in the state of Michoacán and, days later, cartel gunmen laid siege to the city of Culiacán, in Sinaloa State, forcing the government to release one of El Chapo’s sons, whom it had just arrested.']",The family has deep roots in Mexico and a history of speaking out about the criminal groups that plague their region.
The Money Farmers: How Oligarchs and Populists Milk the E.U. for Millions,2019-11-03,"By Selam Gebrekidan, Matt Apuzzo and Benjamin Novak","['CSAKVAR, Hungary — Under Communism, farmers labored in the fields that stretch for miles around this town west of Budapest, reaping wheat and corn for a government that had stolen their land. Today, their children toil for new overlords, a group of oligarchs and political patrons who have annexed the land through opaque deals with the Hungarian government. They have created a modern twist on a feudal system, giving jobs and aid to the compliant, and punishing the mutinous. These land barons, as it turns out, are financed and emboldened by the European Union. Every year, the 28-country bloc pays out $65 billion in farm subsidies intended to support farmers around the Continent and keep rural communities alive. But across Hungary and much of Central and Eastern Europe, the bulk goes to a connected and powerful few. The prime minister of the Czech Republic collected tens of millions of dollars in subsidies just last year. Subsidies have underwritten Mafia-style land grabs in Slovakia and Bulgaria. Europe’s farm program, a system that was instrumental in forming the European Union, is now being exploited by the same antidemocratic forces that threaten the bloc from within. This is because governments in Central and Eastern Europe, several led by populists, have wide latitude in how the subsidies, funded by taxpayers across Europe, are distributed — even as the entire system is shrouded in secrecy. A New York Times investigation, conducted in nine countries for much of 2019, uncovered a subsidy system that is deliberately opaque, grossly undermines the European Union’s environmental goals and is warped by corruption and self-dealing. Europe’s machinery in Brussels enables this rough-hewed corruption because confronting it would mean changing a program that helps hold a precarious union together. European leaders disagree about many things, but they all count on generous subsidies and wide discretion in spending them. Bucking that system to rein in abuses in newer member states would disrupt political and economic fortunes across the Continent. This is why, with the farm bill up for renewal this year, the focus in Brussels isn’t on rooting out corruption or tightening controls. Instead, lawmakers are moving to give national leaders more authority on how they spend money — over the objections of internal auditors. The program is the biggest item in the European Union’s central budget, accounting for 40 percent of expenditures. It’s one of the largest subsidy programs in the world. Yet some lawmakers in Brussels who write and vote on farm policy admit they often have no idea where the money goes. One place it goes is here in Fejer County, home to Hungary’s populist prime minister, Viktor Orban. An icon to Europe’s far right and a harsh critic of Brussels and European elites, Mr. Orban is happy to accept European Union money. The Times investigation found that he uses European subsidies as a patronage system that enriches his friends and family, protects his political interests and punishes his rivals. Mr. Orban’s government has auctioned off thousands of acres of state land to his family members and close associates, including one childhood friend who has become one of the richest men in the country, the Times investigation found. Those who control the land, in turn, qualify for millions in subsidies from the European Union. “It’s an absolutely corrupt system,” said Jozsef Angyan, who once served as Mr. Orban’s under secretary for rural development. The brazen patronage in Fejer County was not supposed to happen. Since the earliest days of the European Union, farm policy has had outsized importance as an immutable system of public welfare. In the United States, Social Security or Medicare are perhaps the closest equivalents, but neither of them is a sacrosanct provision written into the nation’s founding documents. The European Union spends three times as much as the United States on farm subsidies each year, but as the system has expanded, accountability has not kept up. National governments publish some information on recipients, but the largest beneficiaries hide behind complex ownership structures. And although farmers are paid, in part, based on their acreage, property data is kept secret, making it harder to track land grabs and corruption. The European Union maintains a master database but, citing the difficulty of downloading the requested information, refused to provide The Times a copy. In response, the Times compiled its own database that, while incomplete, supplemented publicly available information on subsidy payments. This included corporate and government records; data on land sales and leases; and leaked documents and nonpublic land records received from whistle-blowers and researchers.  The Times confirmed land deals that benefited a select group of political insiders, visited farms in several countries, and used government records to determine subsidy payments received by some of the largest of these beneficiaries. The Times investigation also built on the work done by Hungarian journalists and others who have investigated land abuses despite a media crackdown by Mr. Orban’s government. Even as the European Union champions the subsidy program as an essential safety net for hardworking farmers, studies have repeatedly shown that 80 percent of the money goes to the biggest 20 percent of recipients. And some of those at the top have used that money to amass political power. In the Czech Republic, the highest-profile subsidy recipient is Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist who is also the prime minister. The Times analysis found his companies in the Czech Republic collected at least $42 million in agricultural subsidies last year. Mr. Babis, who denied any wrongdoing, is the subject of two conflict-of-interest audits this year. The Czech government has, in recent years, ushered in rules that make it easier for big companies — his is the biggest — to receive more subsidies. “The European Union is paying so much money to an oligarch who’s also a politician,” said Lukas Wagenknecht, a Czech senator and economist who used to work for Mr. Babis. “And what’s the result? You have the most powerful politician in the Czech Republic, and he’s completely supported by the European Union.” In Bulgaria, the subsidies have become welfare for the farming elite. The Bulgarian Academy of Science has found that 75 percent of the main type of European agricultural subsidy in the country ends up in the hands of about 100 entities. This spring, the authorities carried out raids across the country that exposed corrupt ties between government officials and agricultural businessmen. One of the largest flour producers in the country was charged with fraud in connection with the subsidies and is awaiting trial. In Slovakia, the top prosecutor has acknowledged the existence of an “agricultural Mafia.” Small farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for land that is valuable for the subsidies it receives. A journalist, Jan Kuciak, was murdered last year while investigating Italian mobsters who had infiltrated the farm industry, profited from subsidies and built relationships with powerful politicians. Despite this, proposed reforms are often watered down or brushed aside in Brussels and many other European capitals. European Union officials dismissed a 2015 report that recommended tightening farm-subsidy rules as a safeguard against Central and Eastern European land grabbing. The European Parliament rejected a bill that would have banned politicians from benefiting from the subsidies they administer. And top officials swat away suggestions of fraud. “We have an almost watertight system,” Rudolf Mögele, one of Europe’s top agricultural officials, said in an interview earlier this year. Unstated is that, while audits can catch incidents of outright fraud, rooting out self-dealing and legalized corruption is far more difficult. The European Union seldom interferes with national affairs, giving deference to elected leaders. Few leaders have attempted such widespread, brazen exploitation of the subsidy system as Mr. Orban in Hungary. At rallies, he deploys a false narrative that Brussels wants to strip away farm aid and use it to bring in migrants, and that he alone can stop it. Farmers who criticize the government or the patronage system say they have been denied grants or faced surprise audits and unusual environmental inspections, in what amounts to a sophisticated intimidation campaign that harkens to the Communist era. “It’s not like when a car comes for you at night and takes you away,” said Istvan Teichel, who farms a small plot in Mr. Orban’s home county. “This is deeper.” One man who did speak up was Mr. Angyan, the former under secretary for rural development. A jowly, gray-haired rural economist with a mischievous smile, Mr. Angyan became an unlikely crusader for small farmers. He served under Mr. Orban, initially thinking him a reformer, only to leave angry and disillusioned. He canvassed the countryside, documenting the government’s dubious land deals and mistreatment of small farmers. And then he disappeared from public life. To understand how leaders like Viktor Orban exploit Europe’s largest subsidy program requires going back 15 years, to when Hungary was spinning with optimism and change. In a moment that symbolized Western triumph in the Cold War, the European Union officially absorbed much of the breadbasket of Central and Eastern Europe on May 1, 2004. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia — all former Soviet satellites — were among 10 nations that joined the bloc that day (Romania and Bulgaria joined three years later). Amid the celebrations, Mr. Orban was in political purgatory. He had been the prime minister who helped guide Hungary into the union — only to see voters turn him and his party, Fidesz, out of office in 2002. Now he noticed one of the first protest groups to emerge in the new Hungary: farmers. Hungarian farmers clogged Budapest’s narrow streets in 2005 for a mass demonstration. They did not oppose European Union membership. Far from it. As new European citizens, they wanted the subsidies they were eligible for under the bloc’s Common Agricultural Policy, or C.A.P., but the payments hadn’t arrived. Hungary’s left-leaning government was too disorganized and unprepared. From the outset, the European subsidies represented a pot of money scarcely fathomable to farmers accustomed to Communist austerity. The program was designed after the Second World War to boost farming salaries and ramp up food production in countries laid waste by conflict. Over time, it became a critical foundation in creating the borderless economy that would grow into the modern European Union. European leaders understood that absorbing former Soviet satellites would bring challenges, but never fully grasped the potential for corruption in the subsidy program.  At its heart, the program is defined by a simple proposition: Farmers are mostly paid based on how many acres they harvest. Whoever controls the most land gets the most money. And Central and Eastern Europe had lots of land, much of it still state-owned, a legacy of the Communist era. European officials worked closely with incoming governments on issues such as meeting food testing standards, or controlling borders, yet only limited attention was paid to the subsidies. “They thought they would change us,” said Jana Polakova, a Czech agricultural scientist. “They were not prepared for us.” Mr. Orban showed hints of what was to come even before Hungary joined the bloc. Before he left office in 2002, Mr. Orban sold 12 state-owned farming companies, which became known as the “Dirty Dozen,” to a group of politically connected buyers. Buyers got cut-rate deals and exclusive rights to the land for 50 years, making them eligible for subsidies when Hungary became part of the system two years later. “This is a crony economy, where friends and political allies get special treatment,” said Gyorgy Rasko, a former Hungarian agriculture minister. “Orban didn’t invent the system. He’s just running it more efficiently.” Out of office, Mr. Orban watched the farmers’ protests in Budapest and saw the potential political and economic power of subsidies in the countryside. He also was intrigued by the man who negotiated successfully on behalf of the protesters: Jozsef Angyan. After the fall of Communism, Mr. Angyan made the case that small landholders could keep villages alive through sustainable practices. He founded an environmental program at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities and helped build an organic farm called Kishantos with 1,100 acres of wheat, corn and flowers. “He wanted to help the local farmers,” said Mr. Teichel, the farmer from Fejer County, who said Mr. Angyan was a rare champion of the small farmer in a countryside where corrupt politicians ran a “thief economy.” Eight years after losing office, Mr. Orban again ran for prime minister in 2010 and wanted to court the rural vote. Mr. Angyan was now a member of Parliament, and his ties to the farmers gave him political clout in the countryside. Mr. Orban summoned him to his modest home west of Budapest. It was a chilly February morning and Mr. Angyan had a cold. So Mr. Orban fixed tea over a wood-burning stove and, for two hours, the two men spoke about the future of Hungarian farms. Mr. Angyan envisioned a government that gave small farmers more political and economic clout. Mr. Orban made it clear that he wanted to implement Mr. Angyan’s ideas and offered to make him under secretary of rural development. “When Orban speaks, he speaks with such conviction,” Mr. Angyan said. “You believe him. I believed him.” After a landslide victory, Mr. Orban moved quickly, just not as Mr. Angyan had anticipated. Mr. Angyan’s proposal called on the government to carve up its massive plots and lease them to small and midsize farmers. But Mr. Orban instead wanted to lease whole swaths of land to a coterie of his allies, a move that Mr. Angyan predicted would make the countryside beholden to Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz, and its allies. He also knew that European subsidies would follow the land, widening the gap between rich and poor and making it easier for those at the top to wield power. “I had absolutely no chance to carry out what I wanted to do,” Mr. Angyan said. In 2011, Mr. Orban’s new government began leasing out public land. At first, officials said that only local, small-scale farmers would be eligible for leases. But the plots ultimately went to politically connected individuals who, in some cases, had been the sole bidders present at auctions. By 2015, hundreds of thousands of acres of public land were leased out and much of it went to people close to Fidesz, according to records obtained from the government and Mr. Angyan. New leaseholders paid low rates to the government, even as they became eligible for European subsidies. The deals drew sharp criticism in the local media, yet ordinary farmers stayed quiet, despite being left out. In one example, a powerful Fidesz lawmaker, Roland Mengyi, inserted himself into the leasing process in Borsod-Abauj Zemplen County, where one of his associates won leases for more than 1,200 acres. Mr. Mengyi is an outsized character, who referred to himself as “Lord Voldemort.” He was later convicted and sentenced to prison in a separate case for corruption related to European subsidies. Mr. Orban’s sudden change in policy left Mr. Angyan disillusioned, and feeling betrayed. He quit the government in 2012 but remained in Parliament, where he tried to push his vision, even as the government moved in the opposite direction. At a closed-door meeting in early 2013, Mr. Angyan confronted Mr. Orban in front of the prime minister’s most trusted allies in Parliament. “You’re going to destroy the countryside!” Mr. Angyan recalled saying.  “You are a well-poisoner,” Mr. Orban shot back, according to Mr. Angyan, startling the crowd with a blunt rebuke of a former member of his cabinet. “You have abandoned me.” As a shocked silence fell over the party faithful, Mr. Orban launched into a soliloquy comparing politics to a battlefield. Those who are loyal, he said, could count on their brothers in arms for protection. “But those who aren’t?” the prime minister asked. “We will also fire at them.” In 2015, Mr. Orban started moving even faster. His government sold hundreds of thousands of acres of state farmland, much of it to politically connected allies. Technically, it was an auction. But many local farmers say they were told not to bother bidding because winners had been predetermined. Few could afford the large plots, anyway, and many more did not even know about the sales. One pensioner, Ferenc Horvath, 63, lives in a shack in Fejer County, and belatedly discovered that the government had sold all the state-owned land surrounding his tiny plot. “It happened so fast,” Mr. Horvath said. “We had no idea you could buy land here.” On nearly all sides, Mr. Horvath had a new neighbor, Lorinc Meszaros, a childhood friend of Mr. Orban and former pipe-fitter who is now a billionaire. Fences sprung up overnight, and the stench of pig manure fell over the area. Mr. Meszaros, along with his relatives, has bought more than 3,800 acres in Fejer County alone, according to a Times analysis of land data compiled by Mr. Angyan and other sources, and confirmed by visits to the farm. Mr. Orban’s son-in-law and another friend of the prime minister’s have also bought large estates a short drive away, The Times found. The prediction made by Mr. Angyan — that Mr. Orban’s policies would make the countryside beholden to Fidesz and his allies — was being realized. It is a type of modern feudalism, where small farmers live in the shadows of huge, politically powerful interests — and European Union subsidies help finance it. In recent years, according to a Times analysis of Hungarian payment data, the largest private recipients of farm subsidies were companies controlled by Mr. Meszaros and Sandor Csanyi, an influential businessman in Budapest. Last year alone, companies controlled by the two men received a total of $28 million in subsidies.  The two men have radically different relationships with Mr. Orban and his party. Mr. Csanyi is seen as someone Mr. Orban cannot afford to antagonize. He is chairman of OTP Bank, one of the nation’s most important financial institutions, and has a reputation for outlasting mercurial leaders. He has hired out-of-work politicians from all parties, and his farming conglomerate, led by his son, now controls two of the “Dirty Dozen” companies privatized by Mr. Orban. Mr. Meszaros’s fortune, by contrast, is tightly bound to the prime minister. He has built an empire by winning government contracts for projects largely financed by the European Union and has recently snapped up companies that once belonged to a business tycoon who had fallen out of favor with Mr. Orban. They are eligible for a range of subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, whether direct payments based on acreage, subsidies directed at livestock and dairy farming or rural development programs — all of which is distributed at the national level by the Fidesz government.  “I’m always accused, and I am very angry about it, that I got the biggest subsidies,” Mr. Csanyi said in an interview. The reason, he said, is not politics. It is pigs. “I produce about one-sixth of the Hungarian pig production.” On paper, landowners should face restrictions. The Hungarian government has capped subsidy payments to the biggest farms, a seemingly progressive policy advocated by reformers. But farmers say it is easy to skirt the rule by dividing plots and registering the land to different owners.  Rajmund Fekete, a spokesman for Mr. Orban, said that Hungarian subsidy procedures “fully satisfy” European regulations but declined to answer specific questions about Mr. Angyan, or about land sales that benefited Mr. Orban’s relatives and allies. “Hungary is also fully compliant in the sale of state land, which is regulated by law,” he said. In Brussels, European officials were specifically warned about problems in Hungary even before the auctions. A May 2015 report, commissioned by the European Parliament, investigated land grabbing and cited “dubious land deals” in Hungary. The report even cited Mr. Orban’s home of Fejer County. More broadly, the investigators found that wealthy, politically connected landowners had the power to annex land across Central and Eastern Europe. “This is particularly so when they conspire with government authorities,” the report said. In Bulgaria, for example, land brokers had pushed for laws allowing them to effectively annex small farms. Investigators pointed to the farm subsidy program as a major factor, saying it encouraged companies to acquire more and more land. “The C.A.P. in this sense has clearly failed to live up to its declared objectives,” said the report, which was prepared by the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute. In a written response, European agricultural officials denounced the findings as unreliable, and in bold letters declared that it was up to the countries’ leaders to set and enforce national land use policies. That deference to national governments is a hallmark of the European Union. But it has left the bloc unable or unwilling to confront leaders who try to undermine its efforts, said Tomás García Azcárate, a longtime European agriculture official who now trains the Continent’s policymakers. “The European Union has very limited instruments for dealing with gangster member states,” he said. “It’s true on policy, on agriculture, on immigration. It’s a real problem.” As Mr. Orban’s government began auctioning off thousands of acres to his allies, Mr. Angyan began his own project. Out of government, he meticulously studied the land sales, compiling a record that officials could not easily purge. He interviewed farmers who had been abandoned by the government and mapped political connections among the buyers — findings now supported by the Times analysis. Beyond the biggest oligarchs like Mr. Meszaros, other supporters and sympathizers of Mr. Orban got blocks of public land.  In Csongrad County, for example, family members and associates of Janos Lazar, a Fidesz lawmaker, were among the biggest buyers, obtaining about 1,300 acres. In Bacs-Kiskun County, associates and family members of a former business partner of Mr. Meszaros bought big chunks of land. And in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok County, associates and relatives of current and former Orban government officials were among the biggest winners in the land auctions. Many have since leased the plots, with a markup, to big agricultural firms that receive European subsidies. “This is what the European Union resources do, and the revenues from the land do,” said Mihaly Borbiro, a former mayor of Obarok, a tiny village in Fejer County, a short drive from Mr. Orban’s hometown. While political patrons get rich, many small farmers count on the subsidies to survive. That discourages them from criticizing the system too loudly, many of the farmers said, especially in the face of retribution. Ferenc Gal, who raises cows, alfalfa and a few pigs on his family farm, said he applied to lease about 320 acres because the European subsidies alone would have made it profitable before he even planted anything. Local farmers were supposed to get preference, but the land went to wealthy out-of-town investors. When he complained, he quickly found himself a pariah. He said government inspectors showed up at his farm, suddenly concerned about environmental and water quality. He said local officials told him not to bother applying for future rural grants. “Once you’re on a black list,” Mr. Gal said, “that’s it.” Retribution also found Jozsef Angyan. Months after he quit the cabinet, government officials retracted the lease on Kishantos, the organic farm he had helped operate for 20 years. They gave the land to political loyalists, who plowed over the fields and sprayed the cropland with chemicals. Then school officials shuttered Mr. Angyan’s department at Szent Istvan University, destroying his legacy. “Orban understands when to keep people in fear,” Mr. Angyan said.  In interviews in Hungary, some agricultural scientists and economists refused to discuss land ownership or asked to not be identified when discussing their research. Farmers, too, saw what happened to the man who spoke up for them. “If Angyan can’t do anything, what can I do?” said Mr. Teichel, the family farmer near Mr. Orban’s hometown. Mr. Orban’s control of the European subsidies helps prevent another rural uprising, Mr. Angyan said. As long as the government administers the grants, nobody can afford to speak up. “If you’re critical of the system,” he said, “you get nothing.” Besides, he added, there is no real opposition in the countryside. Mr. Angyan’s small farmers’ association forged an alliance with Mr. Orban’s far-right party to get the prime minister re-elected. That relationship has outlasted Mr. Angyan, and those in charge of the farming group now hold powerful government positions. Mr. Angyan has receded from public life. This year, he met twice with The Times, providing the data he had been compiling. After the second meeting, Mr. Angyan stopped returning phone calls. When Mr. Teichel saw him recently at a funeral, he looked defeated. “He’s given up the fight,” Mr. Teichel said. As usual, Mr. Angyan asked how the farmer and his family were doing. “I don’t matter,” Mr. Teichel replied. “I’m just a soldier. How are you doing? You are the general.” Mr. Angyan replied: “How should I continue when nobody is behind me?” Reporting was contributed by Agustin Armendariz in London, Hana de Goeij in Prague, Milan Schreuer in Brussels, Akos Stiller in Budapest and Boryana Dzhambazova in Sofia, Bulgaria.']",
‘Guardian’ of the Amazon Killed in Brazil by Illegal Loggers,2019-11-04,By Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado,"['In the months before an Indigenous leader was killed with a gunshot in the face in the Amazon reserve he had spent much of his life protecting, at least two efforts were made to warn Brazil’s government of the risks posed by illegal loggers in the region.  In April, members of the Guajajara Indigenous group went to the capital, Brasília, to plead for protection from loggers invading their land in the state of Maranhão. In August, the state’s head of human rights wrote to the federal police to say loggers were threatening the Guajajara in the Araribóia Indigenous Land.  But those warnings didn’t help Paulo Paulino Guajajara during a hunting trip with a friend  in the Araribóia reserve on Friday, when they were ambushed by a group of five loggers working illegally in the area.  Laércio Guajajara, the friend, who was wounded has been released from the hospital. A logger was reported missing. The murder is one of a string of losses for Brazil’s indigenous communities, as miners and loggers make more and bolder incursions into Indigenous territories and other protected areas. Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said that Brazil’s Indigenous reserves should be opened up to commercial exploration.  “The Brazilian government is not following its constitutional duty of protecting them,” said Gilberto Vieira, an associate secretary at Brazil’s \u202aIndigenous Missionary Council, which is connected to the Catholic Church. In June, several dozen illegal miners had invaded the Wajapi Indigenous community, in the Brazilian Amazon, and stabbed and killed one of its leaders. Mr. Guajajara, 26, left one child. He and Laércio Guajajara were members of the forest guardians, a group the Guajajara created to defend themselves and their land against miners, loggers and others interested in illegally taking resources from the reserve.  In a searing statement lamenting Mr. Guajajara’s death, the association of Brazilian Indigenous peoples said the Bolsonaro administration had “Indigenous blood” on its hands. “The increased violence in indigenous territories is a direct reflection of their hate speech, as well as their measures against Indigenous peoples in Brazil,” they said in a statement posted on their website on Saturday. “Our lands are being invaded, our leaders murdered, attacked and criminalized, and the Brazilian state is abandoning Indigenous peoples to their fate with the ongoing dismantling of environmental and indigenous policies.” Brazil’s minister of justice, Sérgio Moro, promised a thorough investigation of Mr. Guajajara’s death by the country’s federal police. “We will spare no efforts to take those responsible for this serious crime to justice,” he said in a tweet. The Indigenous Missionary Council had warned in a report published on Sept. 24 that the number of invasions of Indigenous lands by loggers, miners  and land grabbers was rising. They documented 160 incursions through September of this year, compared to 109 during the whole of 2018.  The Guajajara people of the state of Maranhão knew they were in danger. “All indigenous lands in Maranhão are under threat of invasion,” Indigenous leader Rosilene Guajajara said in an interview in April, when several of her community went to Brasília to ask the federal government for protection. In September, Mr. Moro was warned by the government of Maranhão state of threats to Indigenous land near Araribóia, where Mr. Guajajara was killed, but no measures were taken to protect it or those living there,  state officials said. “In the face of the evident difficulty of federal government bodies to protect Indigenous lands, we will try to help,” Maranhão’s leftist governor, Flávio Dino, wrote on Twitter as he announced a statewide task force to protect Indigenous people. The murder of Mr. Guajajara comes at a time when a spike in rainforest fires in the Brazilian Amazon drew a global outcry. As deforestation increases, the forest is approaching a tipping point at which it would begin to self-destruct, instead of self-sustain, which could frustrate worldwide efforts to fight climate change. While a task force that included Brazilian military was able to reduce the number of fires in October to a record low, research shows Indigenous people are some of the most important agents of environmental protection in the forest. Paulo Moutinho, a senior scientist at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said that historically Indigenous lands have some of the lowest deforestation levels among conservation units in Brazil. “If we want to preserve the great benefits the Amazon forest offers us, it is fundamental that we recognize these peoples’ right to land,” he said. “They are providing an invaluable service.” Manuela reported from Rio de Janeiro and Letícia Casado reported from Recife. ']","His death comes as illegal miners, loggers and land grabbers are making more, and bolder, incursions into Indigenous land under the far-right Bolsonaro administration. "
"Iran Adds Advanced Centrifuges, Further Weakening Nuclear Deal",2019-11-04,By David E. Sanger and Richard Pérez-Peña,"['WASHINGTON — Iran said Monday that it had begun running a significant number of new, advanced uranium centrifuges, accelerating its ability to produce enough nuclear material to make a bomb and throwing its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers into further disarray. The big question now is how quickly Iran, with its new capacity, could produce the fuel needed for a single bomb. Some analysts say that it might be able to do so in under a year. The announcement was Tehran’s third move in six months to ratchet up pressure on the West in response to President Trump\'s decision to exit the nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions on Iran. It came the same day that the White House imposed a new set of sanctions aimed directly at top aides to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation’s supreme leader. The sanctions were timed to mark the 40th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover in Tehran.  Ever since Mr. Trump announced in May 2018 that he was withdrawing the United States from the Obama-era nuclear deal that also includes Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, Iran has walked step by step away from the commitments it made under the agreement. It says it can no longer abide by the deal if the United States violates it by unilaterally reimposing sanctions. The agreement’s restrictions on centrifuges was a major restraint. It limited Iran to using about 5,000 older centrifuges at its main nuclear development facility for 10 years.  But in April, with the United States having pulled out of the deal, Tehran announced plans to use newer, more efficient centrifuges.  Then on Monday, it said it had doubled them. Ali Akbar Salehi, chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state news media that 30 more advanced centrifuges had been put into use, bringing the total to 60. And he said Iran was to making plans to install more advanced centrifuges in the future.  It was the goal of the nuclear deal to keep Iran from being able to produce enough fuel for a bomb within a year — and give the international community time to respond if there was evidence Tehran was actually seeking a bomb. Iran has always said that it is not seeking a bomb, and on Monday reiterated that it was prepared to save the nuclear agreement. “Our final goal is full implementation of the nuclear deal,” said Ali Rabiei, a government spokesman. Iran’s actions, he said, “are aimed at bringing the other side back to compliance.” The new Treasury Department sanctions announced Monday target the general staff of Iran’s armed forces and nine associates of the ayatollah, who himself was the target of previous sanctions. Among the new targets were the ayatollah’s chief of staff, one of his sons and the head of Iran’s judiciary.  “This action further constricts the supreme leader’s ability to execute his agenda of terror and oppression,” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement. The administration also increased to $20 million from $5 million the reward for information leading to the recovery of Robert A. Levinson, an American who disappeared in Iran in 2007. Mr. Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent who worked as a private investigator and part-time consultant for the C.I.A., vanished while on a mission to recruit an intelligence source for the C.I.A. The administration’s settling of old scores — it was in 1979 that Iranians seized 52 Americans at the embassy, holding them for 444 days and dominating the last year and a half of Jimmy Carter’s presidency — and the escalation by Tehran of its nuclear fuel production capabilities  underscored how poisonous the relationship between the countries remains. A brief effort by France to begin a dialogue between President Hassan Rouhani and Mr. Trump at the United Nations in September fizzled: Mr. Rouhani declined an invitation to enter a room where Mr. Trump would be available on an open speakerphone, The New Yorker reported.  The Trump administration argues that its strategy is working: The sanctions have dramatically cut Iran’s oil revenues, and Mr. Trump often maintains Iran is now a “different country” because of the pain imposed. But that pain has not resulted in changed political decisions, at least not yet.  Rob Malley, who took part the nuclear deal negotiations as a senior official in the Obama administration, said Monday that the Iranian centrifuge action “will come as a surprise only to those who believed in the fantasy that the Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign somehow would lead Tehran to agree to more stringent measures."" Mr. Malley said: “The good news is that the steps announced today are reversible. The bad news is that there is as of yet no indication the administration is prepared to reverse course.”  The moment is coming, said Mr. Malley, now president of the International Crisis Group, when the accord “completely falls apart.”   Even as it escalates, however, the Iranian government says it is prepared to reverse each step if the European powers that signed the agreement find a way to ease the impact of United States sanctions.  Led by France, Europe has now proposed two different ways to alleviate the pressure, but so far neither has gone into effect. The most recent was a proposal for a $15 billion line of credit, secured by Iran’s future oil shipments, that would allow it to re-engage in Western markets. But eventually France said that deal, too, would require Washington’s acquiescence. At a news conference in Tehran on Monday, Mr. Rabiei, the government spokesman, said that if the European commitments “are fully implemented, we will come close to what we had in the nuclear deal, too,” according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency. The centrifuges are used to separate the rare, highly radioactive isotope, uranium 235, from uranium 238. Increasing the proportion of uranium 235 is known as enrichment. At low enrichment levels, that produces fuel for nuclear power. At 90 percent enrichment, it provides fuel for a bomb.  Under the nuclear deal, Iran gave up about 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile, agreeing to keep no more than 660 pounds for 15 years. It also agreed to limit its enrichment to less than 4 percent uranium 235. In recent months, Iran has gone beyond both the total amount and the level of enrichment that were allowed under the agreement. But its stockpile is still too small to make a single bomb.

Hong Kong Protesters Call for U.S. Help. China Sees a Conspiracy.,2019-11-03,By Edward Wong,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong protests at times seem like love fests with the United States. Depending on the day, demonstrators wave American flags or Uncle Sam recruitment posters, and even dress as Captain America, complete with shield. The United States represents democracy, and the activists hope that maybe, just maybe, it will save Hong Kong. Five months in, they are trying harder than ever to draw the United States into their movement. The protesters are pressing Hong Kong officials and their overseers, the authoritarian Communist Party leaders of China, for greater democratic rights and rule-of-law in the autonomous territory. As they see it, the Trump administration might be able to make demands of Chinese leaders or Hong Kong officials, especially because members of elite political circles want to maintain access to the United States. Also, they note, the trade war with China, started by President Trump, is adding pressure over all on President Xi Jinping.  For the American government, the protests are more complicated — a potential policy dilemma but also a potential point of leverage with Beijing and a way to channel American values to the rest of the world.  “The United States should continue to deter Beijing from use of force, maintain an unblinking eye on Hong Kong, and make Beijing pay a heavy reputational cost for curtailing the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens,” said Ryan Hass, a former State Department and National Security Council official now at the Brookings Institution. Yet, he added, “I worry that the protesters in Hong Kong risk misinterpreting American sympathy and support of their cause for expectation that the United States will shield them from Beijing’s heavy hand.”  If the protesters are sending out a siren song, some American officials and lawmakers are answering it, eager to show their commitment to the cause. Members of Congress have appeared in Hong Kong in public displays of solidarity. Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, donned an all-black outfit, while Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, posted photographs from a protest.  In Washington, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has met with activists, pro-democracy politicians and Jimmy Lai, a publisher considered radioactive by Beijing. Vice President Mike Pence singled out Hong Kong as a beacon of liberty in a speech, saying, “We stand with you; we are inspired by you.”  And versions of a bill that would give support to the protesters are moving though Congress with bipartisan backing. The legislation, among other things, would allow the United States to impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses. “We hope this bill will pass,” said Selina Po, a 27-year-old protester wearing a mouth mask in the Admiralty neighborhood as she held up a sign with the bill’s name, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. “It’s our hope for winning this war. We’re trying all we can.” But American officials say the United States needs to weigh its moves carefully.  Greater involvement by Americans could give Beijing more ammunition in its propaganda effort to portray the pro-democracy movement as one stoked by foreign forces.  The Chinese government and state-run news organizations talk about “black hands” behind the unrest and spread conspiracy theories, including one centered on an American diplomat in Hong Kong who was photographed with activists in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel.  As the protests persist, American officials are watching for surges in violence and tracking the movement of People’s Liberation Army soldiers into Hong Kong. Some are beseeching demonstrators to stick to nonviolent tactics, even in the face of police crackdowns and attacks by people sympathetic to Beijing.  On Sunday, at least six people were injured when a man with a knife who is believed to be against the democracy movement attacked a family at a shopping mall. In the melee, the attacker bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy district council member, Andrew Chiu. “We’re telling everyone that we interact with, we don’t want violence,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. “We think there should be a political solution to the conflict that’s taking place there.” Two Democratic Congressmen, Tom Suozzi of New York and John Lewis of Georgia, the icon of the American civil rights movement, posted a video last month praising the activists for their “great work” and urging them to stick to nonviolence. Whether the United States takes greater action on Hong Kong hinges on the unpredictable Mr. Trump. Administration officials and American lawmakers talk openly about checking the authoritarian impulses of the Chinese Communist Party. But the president rarely, if ever, mentions human rights and democracy, and he has not made consistently strong statements on Hong Kong.  He is a transactional president. In June, he told Mr. Xi on a call that he would stay quiet on Hong Kong as long as Washington and Beijing were making progress on trade talks, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  In October, the Trump administration imposed some restrictions on Chinese companies and organizations for their roles in the mass repression of Muslims in mainland China, but Mr. Trump has held back from harsher actions for fear of upsetting the trade negotiations. If a Hong Kong bill reaches Mr. Trump’s desk, analysts say, the president might see it as merely a tool to wring concessions from China and could forego support if a trade agreement were close. “Strong American bipartisan support for the peaceful protesters is not enough to override President Trump’s transactional instincts,” Mr. Hass said. “He does not look at Hong Kong through a values-based lens. And as long as he remains president, this outlook will limit America’s responses to developments in Hong Kong.” Administration officials argue that Mr. Trump’s approach gives the United States a stronger hand in constraining Beijing on Hong Kong — even if it appears that Mr. Trump just wants to use the Chinese territory to his advantage. “America expects Beijing to honor its commitments,” Mr. Pence said, “and President Trump has repeatedly made it clear it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong.” In the eyes of Beijing, there has been no shortage of provocations by American politicians. On Oct. 22, Ms. Pelosi posted on Twitter a photograph of herself on Capitol Hill with three pro-democracy figures — Mr. Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang. “My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in nonviolent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong,” she wrote. On Wednesday, Ms Pelosi slammed the decision by Hong Kong officials to bar the activist Joshua Wong from running in local elections. She said it was “another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” referring to the foundation for the policy of autonomy that Britain and China agreed would be used to govern the territory.  Ms. Pelosi met Mr. Wong in Washington in September. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, lashed out, saying, “It is precisely because of the naked cover-up and connivance of external forces such as Pelosi that the violent anti-law forces are even more fearless.” “No matter how your eyes are blinded by prejudice, no matter how your heart is filled with evil, Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” the spokeswoman added. “Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs will not succeed.” Many demonstrators want American intervention and are focusing their attention on the legislation. The mere threat of American sanctions, they say, would give the movement greater voice with Beijing. On Oct. 14, the night before a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives, protesters held a rally in the Central district to call for its passage. Tens of thousands attended, many of them carrying American flags. “The power of Hong Kong people alone is limited, and we need other countries, such as the U.S., to help us counter China and keep ‘one country, two systems,’” said Eric Kwan, 32. “I doubt the act can be an ultimate game-changer, but I think it is enough to give pressure to China.”  Along with allowing for sanctions, the legislation requires the State Department to review each year whether Hong Kong is still autonomous enough to qualify for the benefits of the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which grants the city a trade and economic status different from that of mainland China. Some American officials say the bill could harm Hong Kong residents if the United States determines that the territory no longer qualifies as an autonomous entity. But the bill’s proponents defend its practical and symbolic value. “Standing in support of Hong Kongers and preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy should be a priority of the United States and democracies worldwide,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. The bill passed the House by unanimous vote last month. Though the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has not scheduled a vote yet, the measure is expected to pass that chamber easily, with a veto-proof majority. Then Mr. Trump would have to decide whether to sign it into law.

E.U. Defends Farm Subsidy Program Exploited by Autocrats,2019-11-04,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — European Union officials, questioned about new revelations of corruption and exploitation of the bloc’s farm subsidies, said Monday that outright fraud was very rare and that auditors swiftly rooted it out. But they also acknowledged that law enforcement often fell to the same national leaders who warp the system — and benefit from it. “We are not here to replace national governments,” said Mina Andreeva, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the administrative arm of the 28-nation European Union. The responses at a daily news briefing came after a lengthy New York Times investigation that showed how oligarchs, populist leaders and their families had made millions of dollars from European farm subsidies, often based on dubious land deals or outright corruption. European subsidies have helped underwrite Mafia-style tactics in Slovakia and enrich a cadre of politically powerful land barons in Bulgaria. The Times tracked at least $42 million in subsidies last year to companies owned by the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Andrej Babis. The Times report showed how, under the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, farmland had been auctioned off to political patrons and to members of Mr. Orban’s own family. Since farm subsidies are linked to the land, the government auctions immediately made the new owners eligible for huge amounts of European subsidies each year. Ms. Andreeva noted that European authorities were auditing Mr. Babis’ companies and that, in response, Czech authorities had frozen some subsidies. She also pointed out that a European public prosecutor, a newly created position, was scheduled to begin work at the end of next year.  That prosecutor will have authority to investigate crimes against the European Union’s budget. Hungary is among six countries, however, that refuse to participate in that project. Despite pressure to join, Mr. Orban says prosecutions must be left to the national governments. The Commission has proposed new rules that would require countries to uphold rule-of-law standards to qualify for money. Hungarian politicians strongly oppose that effort. In response to the Times report, journalists from several European countries pressed officials about whether subsidy manipulation, when overseen by national governments, enabled fraud to fall through the cracks. “Obviously there is a no-man’s land between the national responsibility for such malpractices and the lack of oversight on behalf of the European Union,” said Georgi Gotev, the publisher of the news site Euractiv’s publication in Bulgaria. The Times report showed how the subsidies were channeled to that country’s politically connected elite. Mr. Gotev said he tried to get answers from European officials a year ago about this problem and was referred to local officials, who refused to answer questions.  For years, populist politicians across the continent, including national leaders like Mr. Orban, have condemned the European Union for domestic political gain. They denounce Brussels as an intrusive force, a threat to their national sovereignty, even as they eagerly accept its largess. The European Union is not a country and does not have a government, per se. The administration of most of the bloc’s budget is governed by what is known as “shared management” — meaning that the European Commission supervises the spending but national governments carry it out. “We’re acting precisely within our powers,” Ms. Andreeva said. But the weakness revealed by the Times investigation is not that the European Union fails to follow its own rules, but that those rules are not enough to restrain abuses. Europe’s $65 billion annual farm fund is one of the biggest subsidy programs in the world, accounting for 40 percent of the European Union’s budget. The bloc spends three times as much on agricultural subsidies as the United States, and the money is widely seen as sacrosanct.  The farm program dates to the foundation of the European Union itself, and it is one of the key elements that hold the bloc together. European Commission officials have in years past proposed restrictions like capping how much any one farmer can receive. Such a cap could help narrow the chasm between small farmers and the wealthiest agriculturalists who receive the bulk of the public assistance. But such proposals have never survived the legislative process. A subsidy cap is once again up for debate as lawmakers discuss the next version of the subsidy bill.

A Times investigation found that the program helped underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists."
Iran Steps Further From Nuclear Deal With Move on Centrifuges,2019-11-05,By Michael Wolgelenter and David E. Sanger,"['Iran announced plans on Wednesday to reactivate its most sensitive nuclear production site, a deep, underground uranium enrichment center, in a step that dismantles more of the last major restrictions on the country under the 2015 nuclear deal. The facility, known as Fordow, buried under a mountain to protect against bunker-busting weapons, lay hidden from inspectors for years. The revelation of its existence a decade ago touched off a crisis with the West that led to threats from Israel to destroy the facility. The atmosphere created by the revelation led, six years later, to the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. Under that deal, in exchange for the lifting of Western economic sanctions, Iran agreed that no fissile material — the makings of bomb fuel — would be put in the centrifuges spinning at the site.  In a speech on Tuesday, however, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said that his patience had run out, and that Iran would begin to inject uranium gas into the more than 1,000 centrifuges that remained inside the mountain. But he made it clear that this step was part of a pressure campaign to force Europe to make good on its promises to compensate Iran for the cost of harsh sanctions that the United States imposed on Iran after President Trump abandoned the 2015 deal. Mr. Rouhani said Iran was reactivating Fordow, which is adjacent to an Iranian military base, precisely because it was considered such a hard military target. Its renewal as a nuclear production site, he suggested, could be easily reversed — part of the carefully calibrated strategy Iran is pursuing to pressure the United States and its allies just as the American-led sanctions on Iran’s oil shipments are intended to pressure Tehran. “We know how sensitive they are to the Fordow facility,” Mr. Rouhani told the country in a speech about why Iran would no longer abide by an agreement that Mr. Trump has abandoned. But he made clear that he regarded Fordow as a mere bargaining chip, saying that when the United States begins “living up to their commitments” to suspend sanctions while Iran was in compliance with the deal, “then we will stop feeding gas to the centrifuges.” The State Department criticized Mr. Rouhani’s actions on Tuesday. “Iran has no credible reason to expand its uranium enrichment program, at the Fordow facility or elsewhere,” it said in a statement, “other than a clear attempt at nuclear extortion that will only deepen its political and economic isolation.” It was the third time in six months that Mr. Rouhani had announced a careful series of escalations of Iran’s nuclear capacity. On Monday Iran said it was already producing enriched uranium at an ever-faster pace at its primary nuclear enrichment center at Natanz. In recent weeks it has also discussed rebuilding a plutonium reactor that was disabled under the agreement before it ever went into operation. That process is likely to take years.  None of these steps immediately gets Iran the makings of a bomb. But taken together, they create the condition that the three-year-long negotiating process was intended to stop, at least for a while: Iran’s ability to develop the material for a bomb in a year. President Trump’s complaint with the Iran accord was that key restrictions expired by 2030, but the net result of the recent announcements is that those restrictions are largely being thrown out now.  The potential for an Iranian “breakout,” producing fuel for a nuclear weapon within three months, was why Mr. Trump’s top advisers in his first year in office — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis — all urged him to remain in the deal, but press to extend its duration and expand its scope to include Iran’s missile production. Mr. Trump eventually discarded that advice and, over time, all three of those advisers.  The exact details of Iran’s move were difficult to discern. Mr. Rouhani talked about injecting the gas into 1,044 centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility, a major step toward uranium enrichment. The 2015 agreement had restricted the centrifuges to non-nuclear uses.  But Mr. Rouhani stopped short of saying that actual enrichment would follow at Fordow, though it is already underway at the larger Natanz facility. Enrichment moves Iran closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon, though it has denied harboring such ambitions. The announcement came a day after Iran said it had doubled the number of more advanced centrifuges operating at Natanz, and planned to install even more efficient centrifuges. While Mr. Rouhani portrayed the announcement on Tuesday — as well as three previous steps it had taken beyond the deal’s limits — as reversible, Iran has made clear that it would step back only if the European signatories to the deal find a way to relieve the economic pressure caused by the American sanctions. “Resistance lays the ground for negotiation, and negotiation takes advantage of resistance,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Fordow was of deep concern to the United States and Israel because it was unclear they could destroy it in a conflict with Iran. The United States conducted secret operations to simulate what it would take to collapse the mountain outside the holy city of Qum, using the largest bunker-busting bomb in its arsenal. The commanders concluded that they could destroy it but that the site would have to be attacked repeatedly.  In the negotiations in 2015, the Obama administration sought, and failed, to close the facility entirely. One American negotiator conceded that leaving it in place was a “bitter pill.” An eventual compromise allowed the centrifuges at the facility to remain in use on the condition that gas was not injected into them.  With the steps taken in recent weeks, Iran might be able to produce enough fuel for a single nuclear bomb in under a year, according to some analysts, but it was not immediately clear how the announcement on Tuesday would change the equation. Sanam Vakil, a research fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program, said that the Iranian authorities had remained “relatively calibrated” with the announcement on Tuesday. “Iran is pushing the red lines, as part of its own maximum pressure campaign to reverse Europe’s position,” she said. “But Iran could have done more and they’re not. This is still one of those steps that Iran can reverse.” The American sanctions, which Mr. Rouhani described Monday as “wrong, cruel and illegal,” delivered a blow to an already fragile Iranian economy, and the Iranian government has responded with what is effectively a two-track strategy — rebuilding its capability while insisting that Europe make up for the economic losses caused by American sanctions.  Mr. Rouhani, who said the work at Fordow would be carried out under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, expressed a willingness to restart nuclear talks if Washington returns to the deal and removes the sanctions. “We should be able to sell our oil,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to The Associated Press. “We should be able to bring our money” into the country. Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, said the union was “concerned” about the announcement, urging Iran to reverse earlier breaches of the nuclear deal and to refrain from any further moves that would undermine it. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that Russia would like to see the nuclear deal remain in force, but he also expressed sympathy for Iran, citing the “unprecedented and illegitimate sanctions” against it. The United States recently extended a waiver from sanctions for foreign companies, including Russia’s state-run nuclear company, Rosatom, to continue work at the Fordow site, but Moscow does not expect the developments on Tuesday to affect its role there.

"Teenage Rescuer, Now 92, Meets Family She Saved From Nazis",2019-11-05,By Iliana Magra,"['Sarah Yanai, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, clutched the handle of her wheelchair as she closed her eyes, and then opened her arms to embrace the woman who helped save her and most of her family from the Nazis more than 75 years ago.  “How are you, how are you Melpo?” Ms. Yanai asked in Greek while stroking the cheek and silver hair of Melpomeni Dina, the 92-year-old Greek woman who, along with her two sisters, provided a hiding place for Ms. Yanai’s family in Veroia, a town in northern Greece, during the German occupation of the country in World War II.  The two women and Yossi Mor, Ms. Yanai’s brother, were reunited at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial center, in Jerusalem on Sunday.  The meeting, which was set up by the center and by the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, a charity that assists those who risked their lives to save Jews, might be the last of its kind, Stanlee J. Stahl, the executive vice president of the foundation, said by phone on Tuesday. “I believe this will be the very last reunion,” Ms. Stahl told reporters on Sunday, noting that most survivors and the people who had helped them were either unable to travel or had died. Ms. Dina, who was accompanied to Jerusalem by her daughter,  was introduced to 40 descendants of the Jewish family she had helped to shelter in a bedroom in Veroia in the 1940s, according to a statement by the center and the foundation. “Everyone is here, they are all waiting to meet you, to tell you that they thank you very much,” Ms. Yanai told Ms. Dina. “We are a large family now, we are all here,” she said.  One by one, members of the Jewish family, middle-aged offspring through to young children, embraced Ms. Dina, who now uses a wheelchair.  “We were hiding in her house — she saved all my family,” said Ms. Yanai, whose family name at the time was Mordechai. “Thanks to her, now she can see all our large family.”  The Mordechais — five children, including Ms. Yanai and Mr. Mor, and their parents, Mentes Mordechai and Miriam Mari — owned a fashion business, according to Yad Vashem.  In March 1943, when Jews in Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, which is close to Veroia, started being rounded up for deportation, the brother of a Greek maid for the Mordechai family helped them try to avoid detection.  But the maid’s brother soon found out that a roundup of Jews in Veroia was imminent. He hid the seven members of the family in his attic for almost a year, but, when the family developed health problems because of their cramped conditions, a new hiding place was needed, Yad Vashem said in a statement recounting the family’s story.  That is where the Giannopoulou sisters — the family name of Ms. Dina — came in. Before the war, Efthimia, Ms. Dina’s elder sister, had trained as a seamstress at Ms. Mordechai’s studio.  Because the sisters were orphans and very poor, Ms. Mordechai had not charged Efthimia for lessons, and Efthimia, who had visited the Mordechai family in their first shelter, wanted to repay the kindness.  So she, along with Bethleem, her 15-year-old sister, and Ms. Dina, then 14, decided to provide refuge for the family — lodging them all in one room and sharing their food rations.  “They had to share the food that they got for themselves,” said Mr. Mor, who is now 77 but who was a baby at the time, said.  “We were more than they were, you see,” he added.   While the family lived with the Giannopoulou sisters, Shmuel, one of the Mordechais’ sons, fell ill. He was taken to the hospital by one of the sisters, but he died, and soon after, the family was reported to the authorities, according to Yad Vashem. The sisters helped them escape and provided them with clothes for hiding in the Vermio Mountains in northern Greece. “You cannot imagine how dangerous it was for her, for all her family, to keep us all, our family, with them,” Ms. Yanai said of Ms. Dina.  Both the families that sheltered the Mordechais during the German occupation were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem and the State of Israel. More than 27,000 people have been recognized to date — 355 of whom were from Greece, according to Yad Vashem. Ms. Dina, whose two sisters have since died, was recognized in 1994. She and other honorees are given financial support “as an expression of gratitude on behalf of the Jewish people,” the center and the foundation said in a statement. About six million European Jews were killed by the Nazis and their associates during World War II.  “My mother and her sisters were young orphan girls, and they had no awareness of danger,” Margarita, Ms. Dina’s daughter, told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency, adding that the three of them had helped the Mordechai family with any means they had.  “What my mother says is that she has a clear conscience,” she added.   ']",Melpomeni Dina was reunited with the two surviving members and 40 descendants of the Jewish family she and her sisters helped escape occupied Greece during World War II.
‘Achieving the American Dream’ With a Loan and a Smuggler,2019-11-05,By Emily Kaplan,"['SANTA LUCÍA UTATLÁN, Guatemala — The local government worker guided the bank representative around the parcel of land in this rural village in Guatemala, describing the dream home he envisioned rising from the dirt. He pointed out where the kitchen would be, and the bedrooms for his family. To make it a reality, all he needed was a loan from the bank. At least, this was what he told the bank official. In truth, he was looking for cash to pay a smuggler to take him to the United States. The ruse worked, and the bank, Banrural, one of Guatemala’s largest financial institutions,  approved a construction loan for about $5,700. Days later, the government worker sneaked across the southwest border of the United States with the help of a smuggler. This is “the easiest way of achieving the American dream,” said the 30-year-old government worker, who now lives in New York and works in construction. He allowed only the publication of his middle name, Yovany, for fear of retribution from the bank.  In recent years, Guatemala has seen record levels of emigration as people, some fleeing violence and many others looking for a way out of poverty, head north with hopes of crossing into the United States. Some prospective migrants raise the necessary smugglers’ fees from relatives. For others, bank loans are the ticket out.  The largely poor migrants take loans against their only possession of value, their land, assuming burdens that for many become overwhelming and lead to a downward spiral of debt and despair. Within this financing ecosystem, no entity may be more central, or making more of a profit, than Banrural, a private institution with ties to the Guatemalan government. Its green-and-white storefronts have popped up in even the country’s most remote villages. Many migrants seeking to make it to the United States have taken out Banrural loans on false pretenses to help pay for their trips, according to migrants, Guatemalan government officials, smugglers, academics and a former Banrural employee.  Some, like Yovany, claim an intent to develop their property. Others say they want to buy a piece of farming machinery. But the money instead goes straight into the hands of smugglers. “Illegal immigration from rural Guatemala wouldn’t be possible without Banrural,” said David Stoll, an anthropology professor at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies debt and Guatemalan society. “Banrural is the de facto financier of migration to the United States.” Officials at Banrural said the bank was a strictly law-abiding institution dedicated to the development of Guatemala’s rural interior and was not complicit in any misuse of loans by borrowers. “Banrural only finances activities accepted by law,” said Edgar Guzmán Bethancourt, the bank’s general manager. “Any violation of this provision is an activity not accepted in any way by the bank.” In recent years, Guatemala has been among the single largest sources of migrants apprehended along the southwest border of the United States, with most of them coming from rural, predominantly indigenous regions of the country. A series of escalating policy and enforcement measures in the United States, and, in recent months, Mexico, have made illegal migration more difficult. But analysts say smugglers have used the stricter enforcement measures as a marketing tool for their services. And they have raised their prices accordingly.  In some cases, smugglers in Guatemala are now charging more than $16,000 to escort an undocumented migrant to the United States. That is a vast fortune for rural Guatemalans who often earn less than $1,000 per year. Still, the demand for such services, and for the loans to pay for them, remains high. Óscar, a migrant smuggler based in Santa Lucía Utatlán, a mountainous region of western Guatemala, said people were increasingly willing to pay the smugglers’ soaring fees because they knew they would have a better chance of making it to the United States than going it alone. “They’ll pay whatever it costs to get there,” he said, declining to give his full name out of fear for his safety. As it is in many other places across Guatemala, migration is part of the cultural and economic fabric of the community in Santa Lucía Utatlán. Migration to the United States has drained the village of about 40 percent of its population, with the outflow accelerating in the past decade, said Santos Augusto Yac Joj, the town’s mayor.  Most have crossed into the United States illegally, and their families, as well as the town’s economy, are dependent on the remittances they send back. Majestic, multistory houses perched on the surrounding mountain slopes stand in contrast to the humble abodes that otherwise characterize the village, and testify to the potential rewards of migration. They belong either to migrants working in the United States who financed their construction with remittances, or to the increasingly wealthy smugglers who helped get them there. Several members of Yovany’s extended family — including two brothers, several cousins and an uncle — have taken out loans from Banrural in the past decade to finance their smuggler-assisted trips to the United States. Like Yovany, they falsely told the bank they needed the loan for some legal purpose in Guatemala, like building an extension on a home or buying a piece of farming equipment. Some poor Guatemalans lack sufficient collateral or bank connections to secure a bank loan. And so they resort to an underworld of private, unregulated moneylenders who charge usurious rates, according to government officials as well as borrowers. In one common process, largely dependent on mutual trust, the borrower gives his or her land title to a money lender in exchange for the loan. In a kind of legal charade known as a “simulation,” the two will visit a notary and testify under oath that the borrower has, in fact, sold their land title to the lender.  If the borrower successfully repays the loan, the lender sells the lands back to the borrower in another simulation. Otherwise, the land becomes the property of the moneylender. Sometimes, however, a pact is struck between the lender and borrower alone, with no notary, and its success is based on honor alone. But residents say moneylenders have the upper hand in these deals and commonly use threats of violence to enforce the repayment schedule. One migrant from Sololá, now living in New York, said he paid a smuggler $12,000 with funds from a moneylender. He still owes half the amount. He said his wife, who remained behind in their Guatemalan village, was routinely threatened to force repayment of the loan. “They come to my house and threaten my children on the street,” said his wife, who withheld her name out of fear for the family’s safety. Some in the country are trying to fight loan sharking. Santiago Tzapinel, a member of an indigenous governing council in Santa Lucía Utatlán, said unregulated loan systems were “bleeding the people.” His council, and other such indigenous groups around the country, try to support borrowers by teaching them their rights and talking to lenders on their behalf to negotiate better terms. In some cases, they try to compel the most exploitative lenders to release borrowers from their agreements. But these efforts can barely compete against the migrants’ desperation to find a way north, no matter how costly. “People are always going to come here,” Yovany said. “Immigration will not diminish.”']","Poor Guatemalans, desperate to come to the United States, take out loans under false pretenses to finance their journey.

"Russian Snipers, Missiles and Warplanes Try to Tilt Libyan War",2019-11-05,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['TRIPOLI, Libya — The casualties at the Aziziya field hospital south of Tripoli used to arrive with gaping wounds and shattered limbs, victims of the haphazard artillery fire that has defined battles among Libyan militias. But now medics say they are seeing something new: narrow holes in a head or a torso left by bullets that kill instantly and never exit the body. It is the work, Libyan fighters say, of Russian mercenaries, including skilled snipers. The lack of an exit wound is a signature of the ammunition used by the same Russian mercenaries elsewhere. The snipers are among about 200 Russian fighters who have arrived in Libya in the last six weeks, part of a broad campaign by the Kremlin to reassert its influence across the Middle East and Africa.  After four years of behind-the-scenes financial and tactical support for a would-be Libyan strongman, Russia is now pushing far more directly to shape the outcome of Libya’s messy civil war. It has introduced advanced Sukhoi jets, coordinated missile strikes, and precision-guided artillery, as well as the snipers — the same playbook that made Moscow a kingmaker in the Syrian civil war. “It is exactly the same as Syria,” said Fathi Bashagha, interior minister of the provisional unity government in the capital, Tripoli. Whatever its effect on the outcome, the Russian intervention has already given Moscow a de facto veto over any resolution of the conflict. The Russians have intervened on behalf of the militia leader Khalifa Hifter, who is based in eastern Libya and is also backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and, at times, France. His backers have embraced him as their best hope to check the influence of political Islam, crack down on militants and restore an authoritarian order. Mr. Hifter has been at war for more than five years with a coalition of militias from western Libya who back the authorities in Tripoli. The Tripoli government was set up by the United Nations in 2015 and is officially supported by the United States and other Western powers. But in practical terms, Turkey is its only patron. The new intervention of private Russian mercenaries, who are closely tied to the Kremlin, is just one of the parallels with the Syrian civil war.  The Russian snipers belong to the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked private company that also led Russia’s intervention in Syria, according to three senior Libyan officials and five Western diplomats closely tracking the war.  In both conflicts, rival regional powers are arming local clients. And, as in Syria, the local partners who had teamed up with the United States to fight the Islamic State are now complaining of abandonment and betrayal.  The United Nations, which has tried and failed to broker peace in both countries, has watched as its eight-year arms embargo on Libya is becoming “a cynical joke,” as the United Nations special envoy recently put it. Yet in some ways, the stakes in Libya are higher.  More than three times the size of Texas, Libya controls vast oil reserves, pumping out 1.3 million barrels a day despite the present conflict. Its long Mediterranean coastline, just 300 miles from Italy, has been a jumping-off point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants.  And the open borders around Libya’s deserts have provided havens for extremists from North Africa and beyond.  The conflict has become a bipolar combination of the primitive and futuristic. Turkey and the Emirates have turned Libya into the first war fought primarily by clashing fleets of armed drones. The United Nations estimates that during the past six months, the two sides have conducted more than 900 drone missions. But on the ground, the war is between militias with fewer than 400 fighters typically engaged on both sides at any time. The fighting happens almost exclusively in a handful of deserted districts on the southern outskirts of Tripoli, while in neighborhoods just a few miles away, streets are clogged with civilian traffic and espresso bars bustle amid heaps of uncollected garbage. “There is a huge discrepancy between the Libyan fighting on the ground and the advanced technology in the air from the meddling foreign powers,” said Emad Badi, a Libyan scholar at the Middle East Institute who visited the front in July. “It’s like they are different worlds.”  On a recent tour of the front-line district of Ain Zara, a Tripoli militia officer, Muhammad el-Delawi, passed out stacks of cash to fighters in T-shirts or mismatched camouflage uniforms, some in tennis shoes or sandals, others only with bare feet. The twisted wreckage of an ambulance hit by a drone missile sat by the side of the road. The arrival of the Russian snipers is already transforming the war, Mr. el-Delawi said, recounting the deaths of nine of his fighters the previous day — one of them shot in the eye.  “The bullet was as long as a finger,” he said.  One European security official said the absence of exit wounds, a mark of hollow-point ammunition, matches injuries inflicted by Russian snipers in eastern Ukraine. By the beginning of April, the conflict had largely died down and the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, arrived in Tripoli to try to finalize a peace deal. But the next day Mr. Hifter launched a surprise assault on the capital, restarting the civil war. Officials of the Tripoli government say Russia is now bringing in more mercenaries by the week.  “It is very clear that Russia is going all in on this conflict,” said Gen. Osama al-Juwaili, the top commander of the forces aligned with the Tripoli government. He complained that the West was doing nothing to protect that government from the foreign powers determined to push Mr. Hifter into power. “Why all this pain?” he said sardonically. “Just stop this now and assign the guy to rule us.” Russia had previously stayed in the background while the United Arab Emirates and Egypt took the leading roles in military support for Mr. Hifter. But by September, his assault on Tripoli seemed to have stalled and Russia apparently saw an opportunity. Given the amateurish nature of the ground fighting, some diplomats said, the arrival of 200 Russian professionals could have an outsized impact. A spokesman for Mr. Hifter’s forces did not respond to a request for comment. Having collapsed into feuding city-states after the overthrow of the longtime Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, Libya is less a functioning state than a vast and bloated public payroll. Citizens and towns are united only by a shared dependence on the oil revenue flowing through the national bank in Tripoli to a vastly inflated government work force. Some of those salaries ultimately end up paying fighters on all sides of the war. Control of the central bank and the oil revenue has made Tripoli the war’s grand prize.   Mr. Hifter, 75, was a former army general under Colonel el-Qaddafi who defected and lived in Northern Virginia as a C.I.A. client for more than a decade. Returning to Libya in 2011, he sought but failed to win a leading role in the uprising.  Five years ago, he vowed to rule Libya as a new military strongman, but his progress has been halting. His limited success has depended heavily on his regional backers and, until now, Russia appeared to have hedged its bets.  The Kremlin has maintained contacts with the authorities in Tripoli as well as with former el-Qaddafi officials, even as its support for Mr. Hifter has been vital and growing.  Russia has printed millions of dollars’ worth of Libyan bank notes and shipped them to Mr. Hifter. By 2015, Russia had set up a base in western Egypt to help provide technical support and repair equipment, according to Western diplomats. By last year, Russia had also sent at least a handful of military advisers to Mr. Hifter’s forces in Benghazi. Last November, Mr. Hifter was filmed at a table in Moscow with both the Russian defense minister and the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr. Prigozhin is under indictment in the United States for involvement in the internet “troll farm” that sought to influence the 2016 presidential election. As in Syria, the Russian escalation in Libya has drawn complaints from former American allies that Washington has abandoned them.  Even though it officially supports the United Nations-recognized government, the United States has largely disengaged and President Trump has appeared to endorse Mr. Hifter. Mr. Trump called Mr. Hifter a few days after he began his assault on Tripoli to applaud his “role in fighting against terrorism.” Now Mr. Hifter’s forces are conducting airstrikes against militias from western Libya that had previously worked closely with American military forces to expel a branch of the Islamic State from its stronghold in the city of Surt. “We fought with you together in Surt and now we are being targeted 10 times a day by Hifter,” Gen. Muhammad Haddad, now a commander for the Tripoli forces, said he told American officials.  When Mr. Hifter began his assault on Tripoli in April, his biggest advantage was the use of armed drones: The United Arab Emirates furnished Chinese-made Wing Loong drones, purchased for $2 million each.  General al-Juwaili blamed drone strikes for nearly two-thirds of the casualties among Tripoli government forces. United Nations officials estimate that more than 1,100 have died in the fighting but say the real number is likely more than double.  “In the beginning, we were terrified,” said Mr. el-Delawi, the officer of the Tripoli-backed militia at Ain Zara. “We just heard a scary noise and we did not know what to do.” Since then, he said, fighters have learned to listen for the whirring noise and hide as the drones approach. They say Mr. Hifter’s forces can fly only three drones at a time, and that each drone fires a maximum of eight missiles. Each must then disappear to reload — allowing the fighters a chance to regain lost ground.  Realizing that the drones target heat sources, the fighters also learned to hide more effectively, including by refraining from smoking. “The drone can see a fighter smoking a cigarette inside a car,” Mr. el-Delawi explained. In May, the Tripoli government began buying drones from Turkey: The Bayraktar TB2 sold for $5 million each and is manufactured by the family business of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law, Selcuk Bayraktar.  “The Turks saved us just in time,” said Mr. Bushagha, the interior minister of the Tripoli government. Turkish drones helped the Tripoli forces recapture the strategic city of Gheryan in June, and since then, the battle lines have barely shifted.  Taking Tripoli may require far more Russian support than a couple hundred mercenaries, given the bloody block-by-block nature of urban combat. But by propping up Mr. Hifter, diplomats said, Moscow has already claimed a major say in any negotiations over Libya’s future. In an interview, the United Nations envoy, Ghassan Salame, said Libyans could patch up their differences if foreign powers stopped arming rival factions. He has organized a conference in Berlin later this year to try to stop that interference.  “Otherwise, this could either go on for an eternity as a low intensity conflict, like a fire that is not extinguished,” he said, “or even escalate, with a doubling down by the international forces intervening, if they believe they can somehow end it for their own advantage.” Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from New York.']","Moscow is plunging deeper into a war of armed drones in a strategic hot spot rich with oil, teeming with migrants and riddled with militants."
"Turkey Sentences, Then Frees, 2 Journalists Jailed in Crackdown",2019-11-04,By Carlotta Gall,"['A Turkish court sentenced two journalists to about 10 years in prison for aiding a terrorist group but also ordered them released Monday in view of time served, in one of the most prominent cases of journalists jailed in the crackdown after the 2016 failed coup. The release of the journalists, Ahmet Altan and Nazli Ilicak, was welcomed by human rights and press freedom groups but was not taken as a sign that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had eased his aggressive prosecution of political opponents and dissenters.  Tens of thousands of people have been detained in the last three years in cases that the government has linked to the coup attempt and to Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkey has accused of instigating it. Mr. Altan and Ms. Ilicak denied the charge that they had aided a terrorist group or had any involvement in the failed coup. Mr. Altan was sentenced to 10 years and six months, and Ms. Ilicak to eight years and nine months; they were released under judicial control, a condition that requires them to report regularly to a local police station.  The court on Monday also acquitted Mr. Altan’s brother Mehmet Altan, a journalist who had already been released from jail. The European Union has put intense pressure on Turkey to improve its judicial record and release many of the dissidents, journalists, lawyers and political figures who are currently held in jail. Turkey’s business institutions have also lobbied for the same in an effort to ease the strain on the country’s economy. Mr. Altan and Ms. Ilicak were previously sentenced to life without parole in a decision that was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court. They then faced a second trial on lesser charges; the case is expected to continue to the appeal courts, and likely to the Supreme Court. Mr. Gulen lives in exile in Pennsylvania and has denied any involvement in the coup.']","A Turkish court sentenced two journalists, Ahmet Altan and Nazli Ilicak, on charges of aiding a terrorist group.

Forger Claims Credit for Paintings in Prince Charles’s Charity Headquarters,2019-11-04,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Until recently, visitors to the headquarters of one of Prince Charles’s charities in Scotland could say that they had seen, among other artworks, three paintings by Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí.  Or so they thought. A well-known American art forger says that the paintings —\xa0displayed at Dumfries House, an 18th-century estate that stretches across 2,000 acres and houses the headquarters of the Prince’s Foundation, one of Prince Charles’s charities — were not actually the works of modern masters.  He says he painted them himself. The forger, Tony Tetro, said in an email on Monday that he had painted at least three works that were lent to the charity —\xa0pieces that The Times of London reported had an estimated value of 100 million pounds, or about $129 million.  A spokesman for the Prince’s Foundation confirmed on Monday that the authenticity of the paintings, which have been removed from display, was in doubt.  All three, along with a painting credited to Marc Chagall and other works whose identities were not disclosed, were being returned to James Stunt, a bankrupt former bullion dealer and art collector who lent the works to the foundation.  Mr. Tetro —\xa0who in 1993 pleaded no contest to forging paintings by artists like Dalí in Los Angeles —\xa0said in an email on Monday that Mr. Stunt had commissioned him to create the paintings from 2015 to 2017.  The forger said that any expert eye could have detected that the paintings were not the work of the celebrated artists whose names were attached to them. None of the paintings “could possibly be construed as real,” Mr. Tetro said, despite their mimicking the artists’ style and technique: rose-tainted water lilies surrounding a light blue stream, à la Monet; two bathers at the beach, inspired by Picasso’s works of the 1920s and 1930s; and a dying Christ, replicating Dalí’s style from the early 1950s. “The pigments, materials, canvas, stretcher bars and other details could be easily detected by even the slightest inspection, and this was done purposely so as to avoid any confusion,”  Mr. Tetro said in the email.  Mr. Stunt — the former husband of the socialite and heiress Petra Ecclestone, whose father is a past chief executive of the Formula One Group — could not be reached for comment on Monday.  Clarence House, the London residence of Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, said on Monday that the prince was not directly involved in the issue. Although Dumfries House is a charity headquarters, it is not a royal residence.  Mr. Tetro said that his paintings would have earned him around $20,000 each, but that Mr. Stunt had paid him in kind, with paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The forger said that in commissioning the works, Mr. Stunt had given him details by telephone of what the paintings should look like, and that he had also painted several other works for the businessman. “I don’t know where they ended up or if he still has them,” Mr. Tetro said.  In an interview published in Tatler, a British society magazine, in March 2018, Mr. Stunt was presented as a larger-than-life figure with expensive tastes and important connections, including the prince himself.  Mr. Stunt, who, according to that article, kept framed letters from Prince Charles in his office and a photograph of the two of them in his house, said that he had lent paintings to Dumfries House, whose donors also include the Scottish National Gallery.  “Works from the likes of Velázquez, Monet, van Dyck, Dalí, Picasso and Constable — a wide array over a two-year period,” Mr. Stunt was quoted as saying, adding that a Chagall painting had gone there recently.  “But it would be hypocritical to name the pieces when I said I didn’t want recognition,” he added in the interview.  Mr. Tetro said that the titles he had given to the paintings were different from those listed as having been displayed at Dumfries House, as cited by The Daily Mail newspaper, which first reported on them. The forger said he had named the Picasso-style painting “Naked Bathers” and the Dalí-inspired one “Christ Rising Above the Red Sea Ascending Towards Heaven.” The Daily Mail cited those paintings as “Liberated Bathers” and “Dying Christ.” Mr. Tetro said he felt bad for any negative implications the paintings might have for Prince Charles. “I would like to say that I’m very sorry if Prince Charles was embarrassed by this,” Mr. Tetro wrote in the email on Monday. “It’s the last thing I thought could ever happen.”']","The works, previously credited to Monet, Picasso and Dalí, have been removed from display at Dumfries House in Scotland."
"With Israel in Limbo, Benny Gantz Vows to Seek a ‘Peace Within’",2019-11-04,By David M. Halbfinger,"['TEL AVIV — Israel seems stuck. Benny Gantz, the former army chief whose party narrowly defeated that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is trying to form a government and drive Mr. Netanyahu from office for the first time in a decade. The prime minister, clinging to power, hopes Mr. Gantz will fail, forcing a third election that few in Israel want. Nothing important can get done until the country resolves the question of who will lead it. And weighty decisions about Israel’s future await — on national security, with rockets from Gaza landing in the South and tensions with Hezbollah cranking up in the North; on how religious the Jewish state should be and who should be exempt from serving in its army; and on how to address other problems, including teeming hospitals, overcrowded classrooms and gridlocked highways. But in some ways, Israel also seems stuck in the past. On Saturday, around 25,000 people flocked to a central plaza facing Tel Aviv City Hall to remember Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who sought to make peace with the Palestinians and who was assassinated by a Jewish extremist who believed he was justly executing a traitor. The annual event functions partly as a somber reunion for what remains of the Israeli left. It is held on the same square, now named for Mr. Rabin, where he was gunned down in 1995 after addressing a huge and adoring crowd in support of the Oslo Accords, the first formal agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Throughout the night, parents brought their children to the precise spot behind City Hall where Mr. Rabin was shot. Perhaps the most impressive of several markers there is in the form of dislodged stones, as if the ground had erupted and was frozen in the act of consuming him. On Rabin Square, Peace Now had a kiosk, while Israel’s communists had a booth, and banners that had seen better days called for an end to the occupation. T-shirt-wearing adherents from different leftist groups buttonholed one another and everyone else, hoping for new recruits to the cause. The speeches each year recall Mr. Rabin’s drive for peace and give lip service, at least, to the goal of a future settlement. But there was a distinct focus on something else this time. In a tent erected by the Labor Party, an exhibit showed the slogans and images that right-wing opponents of the peace process had used to whip up anger against Mr. Rabin. One depicted him in a Gestapo uniform. Another dressed him as Yasir Arafat.  A third doctored a famous photograph of Mr. Rabin reaching to shake the hand of Mr. Arafat, the leader of the P.L.O., at the White House, to make it look as if Mr. Rabin were handing Mr. Arafat an M-16 rifle.  Others showed the leader of the right-wing opposition at the time, at the forefront of the crowds of protesters against Mr. Rabin: a much younger Benjamin Netanyahu. A film now in theaters, “Incitement,” which is Israel’s candidate for a foreign-language Academy Award, retells the story of Mr. Rabin’s assassination from the point of view of the gunman, Yigal Amir. It portrays him not as a madman, but as a rational actor convinced that he was doing the right thing under Jewish law.  The film also shows the carnage of Palestinian suicide bombings that made many Israelis turn against the Oslo process. And it shows the gunman consulting several right-wing rabbis about whether Mr. Rabin deserved to die, none of them bluntly declaring that to kill him would be wrong. The director, Yaron Zilberman, said in an interview that his film was a cautionary tale, relevant to today’s Israel. “It’s totally about today,” he said. “It’s happening now.” Snir Berkovitch, 49, was at Saturday’s rally, as he is every November, with his daughters and their mother, formerly his wife. They had driven from near Haifa, an hour up the coast. “I was here the night he was murdered,” Mr. Berkovitch said. “I think the situation in Israel today is pretty much the same. People who are against peace are trying to scare us all the time, against the Arabs, that we can lose the state. You need strong leadership, like Yitzhak Rabin. Hopefully, Benny Gantz can be that strong.” A few steps away, Guy Moses, 29, and Asaf Shiri, 30, stood watching the speeches and songs. “The last 10 years there hasn’t been as much hope as there is today,” said Mr. Moses, a music producer. Mr. Shiri, who works in finance, said people were impatient to replace Mr. Netanyahu, largely because of how much he had been inciting Israelis to vilify one another. “Most of the anger toward the current government, it’s not about policy,” he said. “It’s about how in the last few years, if you talk about peace in Israel, they mark you as a traitor — you’re against the country. And if anyone on the other side’s a human being, or you understand that it’s complex, then you’re a traitor because you understand there are human beings on the other side.” During both of this year’s election campaigns, Mr. Netanyahu has explicitly played on anti-Arab fears. After a bit of a hiatus, he reverted to form on Thursday, after Mr. Gantz released a photograph of himself sitting down for coalition talks with the leaders of the predominantly Arab Joint List, Ayman Odeh and Ahmad Tibi. On Twitter, Mr. Netanyahu twinned the Gantz photograph with a picture of himself surrounded by Israeli soldiers. “Interesting what each of them did today,” he wrote. Still, Mr. Gantz, a centrist from the new Blue and White party who is aligned with the much smaller left, is in the driver’s seat for now, even if the road ahead looks treacherous. He at least has some options, even if none is fail-safe or ideal. And even a third election appears unlikely to end in an improved result for Mr. Netanyahu. The trend line is negative for his Likud party, and polls also suggest that many voters would blame him for pushing the country to a third ballot. Mr. Gantz, a former army chief of staff, as was Mr. Rabin, has subtly reached for the assassinated leader’s mantle since first becoming a candidate for prime minister early this year. But it’s a measure of how much public discourse and expectations have changed in a quarter-century that merely uttering the word “peace” qualifies as reaching for Mr. Rabin’s mantle. With the spotlight on him on Saturday night as he spoke at the memorial, Mr. Gantz focused on a different kind of peace process — not with the Palestinians, which seems hopelessly far off — but among Israelis, before anyone burns what few bridges remain between left and right. “Partisanship has turned us into strangers,” Mr. Gantz said. “And hatred has once again become a dangerous weapon for politicians who know no boundaries.” He did not mention Mr. Netanyahu’s name. It was not necessary. But Mr. Gantz also said that no one, and no party, held a monopoly on incitement. There were leftists who “mock and criticize those who worship the graves of sages,” just as there were those at the other end of the spectrum who praise the perpetrators of attacks on Palestinians or “revere the heinous murderers of children,” he said. “It is the duty of leaders from the left, center and right to put an end to those whose mouths cannot stop on their own and whose words nourish the flight of the bullets which will be used in the next murder,” Mr. Gantz added. He vowed that, if he does become prime minister, he will return to Rabin Square in November 2020, this time alongside the leader of the opposition, whoever that might be, and “express a message of hope and internal reconciliation.” “We are setting out on the most important fight,” he said, “the fight for peace within.” Gabby Sobelman contributed reporting.']","As he tries to form a government, the would-be prime minister has focused on healing divisions inside his country, even more than on building bridges with the outside world."
‘Chile Woke Up’: Dictatorship’s Legacy of Inequality Triggers Mass Protests,2019-11-04,,"['By Amanda Taub Photographs by Tomas Munita SANTIAGO, Chile — The suddenness of the protests, the anger that spilled onto the streets every day, might have been surprising anywhere. But in the country often lauded as Latin America’s great economic success story, it has shocked the world. For three weeks, Chile has been in upheaval. One day alone, more than a million people took to the streets of Santiago, the capital. Perhaps the only people not shocked are Chileans. In the chaos, they see a reckoning. The promise that political leaders from the left as well as right have made for decades — that free markets would lead to prosperity, and prosperity would take care of other problems — has failed them. “Chile woke up,” thousands of protesters chanted one recent Sunday afternoon in Santiago’s O’Higgins Park. For a while, the promise seemed to be working. The country moved from dictatorship to democracy in 1990, and decades of economic growth and democracy followed, with one government peacefully replacing another.  But that growth did not reach all Chileans. Inequality is still deeply entrenched. Chile’s middle class is struggling with high prices, low wages, and a privatized retirement system that leaves many older people in bitter poverty. And a series of corruption and tax-evasion scandals have eroded faith in the country’s political and corporate elite. “This is a sort of legitimacy crisis,” said Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a political scientist at Diego Portales University in Santiago. “People start to say, ‘O.K., why is it we have to pay that, and the very rich are not paying their fair share?”   “And at the same time, we have a political class that’s totally out of touch,” Mr. Kaltwasser added. In an attempt to restore order, President Sebastián Piñera scrapped the four-cent subway fare increase that set off the initial demonstrations. Then he deployed the military in Chile’s streets for the first time since the country’s transition to democracy.  When that didn’t quell the protests, Mr. Piñera went on television to ask for forgiveness and promise higher pensions, better health coverage, higher taxes for the rich and pay cuts for politicians. Later, he asked his cabinet to resign. But demonstrators were not convinced.  At the protest in O’Higgins park, that was certainly the view of Luis Ochoa Pérez, who was selling flags near the entrance.  “The abuses haven’t stopped,” he said, “so we have to go into the streets.” His best-selling flag, of his own design, demanded Mr. Piñera’s resignation.  Minutes later, it sold out. Javiera López Layana, 24, an activist and student at the University of Chile who helped organize the protest, was buzzing with excitement.  Many of the speakers had used the term “el pueblo” when describing the Chilean people, she pointed out. To an outsider, it seemed like a tiny detail. But that term, which in Latin America is associated with the left, had been taboo in Chile for as long as Ms. López could remember. Its resurgence seemed as if it could be a harbinger of more significant change. The end of the Pinochet dictatorship, in 1990, came with an implicit caveat: Military rule would end, but the socialist policies of Salvador Allende, the leftist president Gen. Augusto Pinochet had deposed in a coup, would not return. Subsequent governments preserved the extreme laissez-faire economic system imposed in the 1970s and 1980s.  But today, widespread public anger over the inequality and economic precarity that many Chileans see as a consequence of that system means that conservative economic policies may be more of a threat to political stability than a means of ensuring it.  “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years” has become one of the slogans of the protests — a reference to the proposed metro fare increase that set off the crisis and to the three decades since military rule ended. The country’s median salary is now about $540 per month — below the poverty line for a family of four, said Marco Kremerman, an economist with the Fundación Sol, a left-leaning think tank in Santiago. Median payments in the national private pension program, the only safety net for retirees, are about $200 per month. There is broad agreement, among protesters and experts alike, that the country needs structural reforms. Replacing the current Constitution, which was adopted under the dictatorship, would also signify that Chile is emerging from the 30-year shadow of the Pinochet regime. “When we’re in debt, living in misery and impoverished, we don’t necessarily think of the Constitution,” Ms. López said. “But in the end, we need to make changes.” That evening, Ms. López and her family gathered around the kitchen table at their home in Lo Espejo, a working-class municipality far from the city center, and discussed the protest movement.  Seeing the military once again patrolling the streets had brought painful memories, long repressed, to the surface. Ms. López’s grandfather revealed to her, for the first time, that he had been arrested during the military regime, and his sister killed by the government, because they had hidden a leftist politician and his family, then helped them escape to safety abroad.  Her father described how dictatorship had divided Lo Espejo in his youth. One neighbor, who still lived nearby, was interrogated and tortured by a man they had both grown up with. Another had a sister who worked for DINA, the feared secret police.  In part because of those experiences, they have been cautious about joining the protests, even if they support the goals. “Javiera’s generation, they grew up without fear of the dictatorship,” said Ms. López’s mother, Pamela Inés Layana Guendelman. “She’s fearless.” “I’m not afraid,” Ms. López said. “But it enrages me” she said, as tears welled in her eyes. “Every time I go to a protest in Plaza Italia, or a protest in La Alameda, I have to come back here, to Lo Espejo, and see the same crap, the same misery, that has been there for many governments. And nothing has changed at all.” In many ways, Ms. López personifies the contradictions of Chile’s political crisis. Her parents and grandfather strained to send her to private schools, she was the first in her family to go to college, and she now hopes to attend graduate school. At least on paper, Ms. López seems to be a success story, proof of the benefits that hard work is supposed to bring under Chile’s free-market system. But when she reached the University of Chile, she said, she confronted an educational system that seemed designed to keep her in Lo Espejo forever.  Though a scholarship covered much of her tuition, she has still had to borrow money to complete her degree. Getting a master’s will mean borrowing even more. “Education was supposed to be our ladder out of poverty,” she said. “But the debt turns out to be a heavy backpack.” Her background may also dilute the value of her degree: Employers are widely believed to discriminate against candidates from poorer social classes. Families like hers have become a new constituency in Chile, one that has sacrificed to succeed in a supposedly meritocratic system, only to find that they are still excluded from its benefits.  “There is this discourse of merit, of striving, of how ‘you should get up earlier,’” she said. “But even if we get up early, nothing is going to change.” One recent day, at the near-shuttered University of Chile, as clouds of tear gas billowed outside, student leaders scrolled through Instagram and Twitter posts announcing demonstrations. “We are the generation for whom the joy never came,” said one of them, Nicole Martínez, 26. Her words were a bitter twist on “joy is coming,” the slogan from the campaign that ended military rule. But the Chilean political crisis is not unique to Chile. It carries unmistakable echoes of a problem that is at the center of political conflict all over the developed world. As free trade, new technologies, the rise of China, and other seismic changes have reshaped the world’s economies, political divisions have emerged between those who gain from the current system and those who do not. In much of Europe and the United States, onetime industrial towns declined  as economic growth accrued to large, globally connected cities, instead. For many, even those who have seen modest objective improvements in their own standards of living, watching others surge ahead while they struggle has left them feeling angry and disillusioned. In many countries, trust in institutions is falling, surveys show.   The same economic changes have shattered longstanding political coalitions, weakening mainstream parties. Far-right populists and other outsider politicians have moved to fill the vacuum left behind. And with no effective channels for public anger, mass frustration has erupted into protest movements like France’s Yellow Vests and the demonstrations in Chile. The Chilean movement, like the Yellow-Vest movement, has no clear leaders, said Ms. Martínez, with  information mostly spreading through people’s social networks. “It is a social explosion,” she said.

Iraqis Rise Against a Reviled Occupier: Iran,2019-11-04,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — It started quietly a month or so ago with scattered protests. Those steadily expanded until last week more than 200,000 Iraqis marched in Baghdad, raging against the Iraqi government and a foreign occupier — not the United States this time, but Iran.  While the current leaders of the Iraqi government cower inside the Green Zone, where officials running the American occupation once sheltered, the protesters outside direct their anger against the Islamic Republic of Iran, which they now see as having too much influence. “Free, free Iraq,” they shout, “Iran get out, get out.”  On the streets and in the squares of Iraq’s capital, in the shrine city of Karbala — where protesters on Sunday threw gasoline bombs at the Iranian Consulate — in back alleys and university hallways, a struggle is taking place over who will shape the country’s future. Iraq, along with Lebanon, another heavily Shiite country that has been roiled by protests, is part of a developing revolt against efforts by Shiite-dominated Iran to project its power throughout the Middle East “The revolution is not anti-American, it is anti-Iran, it is anti-religion — anti-political religion, not religion as such,” said Saad Eskander, the former head of the Iraqi National Archives. The protesters, he said, were fed up with corruption and the Shiite militias, some of which have evolved into mafias running extortion rackets. But more than that, he added, this is “a revolution with a social dimension. In Iraq, patriotism was always political, now it has a social justice component.”  While Iran is the immediate target of the protesters’ wrath, the fight is larger than that. It is a struggle between younger Iraqis and an older, more cautious generation, between a political elite and a rising cohort that rejects their leadership.  It is a struggle, above all, between those who have profited handsomely since the American invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, and those who are struggling to get by and look on with fury as the political parties, some with ties to Iran, distribute payoffs to the well connected.  “It was exactly 99 years ago that the last great Iraqi revolution took place, it was totally Iraqi born,” said Laith Kubba, an adviser to the government.  While the 1920 revolution was ultimately defeated, the sentiment that drove it, the rejection of foreign influence, remains embedded in the Iraqi psyche. A century ago the target was the British; in the early 2000s, it was the Americans that ran afoul of Iraqi nationalism; now it is Iran.  The system put in place after the 2003 invasion, although crafted by Iraqis and enabled by the Americans, enshrined a system of dividing political power along religious and ethnic lines. Iran exploited that framework, using it to embed itself in Iraqi politics.  As the United States retreated from Iraq after 2009, the Iranian-linked parties extended their networks inside the government. In 2014 when the Islamic State invaded, it was Iran that rushed to Iraq’s rescue, helping form militias to fight the militants and by 2018 becoming so powerful that political parties linked to Iran became the kingmakers in the government.  It was an influential Iranian general, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who brokered the deal that created the current government.  Meanwhile, at the grass-roots level and among the country’s young people, there was a growing sense that Iran was profiting at the expense of Iraq. While often exaggerated, the complaints have become part of the political backdrop to the protests.  “All of our budget goes to Iran to support” the Revolutionary Guards, said Ali Jassim, a construction worker, as he washed tear gas out of his eyes below the Jumhuriya Bridge, where the demonstrations are focused.  “All the ministries, all the civilian facilities in Iraq are run by Iran,” he said, but, “still our passports are not good in almost any country. We want to get rid of this government, we want our country back, we want an independent president.” “When we were growing up our parents said, ‘Shut up, the walls have ears,’” said Mohammed al-Amin, a second-year medical student who was working at one of the first aid stations, treating protesters suffering from tear gas and pepper spray exposure. “But we have internet, we have traveled. We can see what the world is like and we want a different life. We want to be like the other countries, we want our rights,” he said.  The demands of the demonstrators — to get rid of corruption, end political parties, create a presidential system instead of a parliamentary one — seem at once reasonable and almost impossible to realize; at least, not without bloodshed.  It is all the more difficult to achieve since the demonstrators are increasingly demanding immediate results, as if they want to see the lawmakers and ministers pack their bags, slink out of their privileged villas in the Green Zone and vanish altogether.  Those politicians who would like to work with the protesters recognize that the fundamental changes they are demanding — new election laws, new elections and ultimately a new Constitution — cannot be achieved overnight. Their methodical approach, however, frustrates protesters who are impatient to see changes start now.  The Iraqi president, Barham Salih, is trying to take steps in that direction, introducing legislation that would eliminate the current system of party lists and allow voters to cast their ballots for individual candidates. But, in essence, he is asking Parliament to adopt a system that would cost many of its members their seats. On Friday night, the largest crowds ever to gather in recent Iraqi history came to protest peacefully, but noisily, against the government, wreathing entire buildings in flags. Inside the Green Zone, the government’s guesthouse inside was as quiet as a library. The vast, marble-floored reception area was perfectly polished as a few men gathered on roomy couches to puzzle over the state of the country, while a waiter served tea and coffee. It was as if there was no rush at all. The two places were physically just a mile apart but metaphorically in different worlds. It was hard to see how Iraqis would ever reconcile the anti-elite, anti-Iran, anti-party feelings in the street with the attitudes of those who have benefited from the system. “There is the political level, the street and the security establishment, and each one of these groups is very occupied with themselves,” said Maria Fantappie, a senior analyst on Iraq at the International Crisis Group.  “The protesters, for instance, they celebrate the feeling of freedom and they feel empowered in the mood they created. Not just young males but also for the first time young females and other factions of the society,” she said.  But the protesters “are not looking at what might be the end goal,” she added. “They are celebrating that they have created this movement.”  Members of the political class, too, are talking largely to one another and not to the protesters — and often blaming one another for the current situation. The Parliament has met just once or twice to discuss legislation that might respond to the demonstrators’ demands.   “They are playing for time,” said Mr. Eskander, the former head of the National Archives, noting that most politicians are still hoping that the protests will blow over.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has drawn criticism for allowing security forces to try to suppress the protests with force. During the first week of October nearly 150 protesters died, a vast majority shot to death, and some 5,500 people, including more than 1,000 members of the security forces, were wounded, according to a government investigation into the incident.  That miscalculation drew tens of thousands more people to the protests. The gatherings have exploded into the range of 20,000 to 25,000 in cities nationwide to close to 200,000 in the capital. And violence flared again on Monday, when the security forces fired into demonstrators as they sought to cross Al Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad, killing at least five. The prime minister, while the target of much criticism, has taken steps to improve the lives of Iraqis, expanding and solidifying the electricity supply, improving relations with Iraq’s Kurds and removing the blast walls that had divided much of Baghdad. But he remains a weak leader who owes his position to a political deal crafted largely by Iran but also acceptable to Washington.  So while Mr. Mahdi has managed to place technocrats in the electricity and oil ministries, Iranian-linked parties dominate at least five major ministries, including those of the interior, communications and labor and social affairs. That gives them access to thousands of patronage jobs, contracts and grants, and breeds the corruption that the protesters are condemning.  The corruption by now is endemic, and present even in those ministries viewed as well run.  “I graduated in engineering, but when I applied for a job at the Ministry of Oil they asked for $7,500,” said Muhaiman Fadil, 30. Now, he says, “I work freelance in construction.”  On Friday in Tahrir Square in Baghdad, the center of the protests, young men put up a white banner with red Xs drawn through photographs of Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, and General Suleimani.  The security forces themselves are divided several times over: between lower-level officers and more senior ones; between those with the Defense Ministry and those with the Interior Ministry, which includes brigades close to Iran; and other, smaller schisms. These divisions led to differences among security entities over how to confront the protesters, who had taken over the unfinished structure known as the Turkish restaurant building that looms over the Jumhuriya Bridge. The army refused to agree to a plan to clear the building, even though it afforded the protesters an ideal perch for tossing gasoline bombs in support of their fellow protesters’ quest to cross the bridge and reach the Green Zone. Army officers feared further bloodshed that would ignite even greater protests. “There is no need to make this big problem by going in,” said a senior military official, speaking of the proposed plan to clear the building. “You cannot imagine what the reaction would be.”  Iraqi news channels announced at midnight Monday that the government had shut down the internet. There was no explanation, but officials also shut it down in early October, when they believed the protests were getting out of control.  Though the government gradually restored internet service, social media services including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp have been blocked throughout the protests. It remains unclear how long the protesters will remain in the streets. For those who go to Tahrir Square every day with flags around their necks, like Abu Jamal, 40, a baker, the answer is that they will stay as long as it takes. “I can demonstrate for a day, two days, a week, a year, 500 years,” said Mr. Jamal.

"Nigel Farage, Brexit Party Leader, Says He Won’t Run in Election",2019-11-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Nigel Farage, who has fared better in fighting for Brexit than in winning elections, has said he will not run for a seat in Parliament in Britain’s general election in December. But he vowed to lead his Brexit Party in a vigorous campaign that could threaten Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr. Farage said in a BBC interview broadcast on Sunday that he had concluded that he could advance the country’s exit from the European Union better by campaigning on behalf of his populist party’s other candidates than by contesting a seat himself. “I don’t want to be in politics for the rest of my life,” Mr. Farage said, adding that he had thought “very hard about this.” By giving up his own ambitions for Parliament, Mr. Farage, who has made much of his friendship with President Trump, could prove to be a bigger disruptive force in the election — and a bigger thorn in Mr. Johnson’s side — than if he were running himself. He said he planned to campaign aggressively across the country against Mr. Johnson’s Brexit agreement, which is a central plank of the prime minister’s election manifesto and that of his Conservative Party. Mr. Farage’s fierce criticism of Mr. Johnson’s deal, as well as his constant reminders that the prime minister broke his promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31, could weaken the Conservatives by splitting the pro-Brexit vote and tipping some close seats to the opposition Labour Party. “If Boris Johnson was going for a genuine Brexit, we wouldn’t need to fight against him in this election,” Mr. Farage said in the BBC interview. “If Boris is determined to stick to this new E.U. treaty, then that is not Brexit.” Mr. Johnson, in a separate interview, apologized on Sunday for failing to achieve Brexit by the deadline of Oct. 31, as he had promised again and again that he would.  “It’s a matter of deep regret,” the prime minister told  the British broadcaster Sky News. But he blamed Parliament for not approving the agreement he had negotiated with the European Union, which approved a Brexit extension to Jan. 31. Some political commentators said Mr. Farage, who spent two decades promoting Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union and has been one of the loudest pro-Brexit voices since the 2016 referendum, was declining to run in the December election because he could not win.  Mr. Farage ran unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times as a candidate for the U.K. Independence Party. He resigned as leader in 2016, left the party altogether in 2018 and has been leader of the Brexit Party since last March. He has been elected to the European Parliament four times as a representative from Southeast England. After mostly lying low during Britain’s recent political upheaval, Mr. Farage has suddenly re-emerged as a noisy presence in British politics. Last Thursday, he welcomed a call from Mr. Trump to his London radio show, during which Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Johnson’s deal with Brussels would make it impossible for Britain to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States — one of the prime selling points of Mr. Johnson’s Brexit policy. “I don’t wish to cast any aspersions on the president of the United States,” Mr. Johnson said in his Sky interview. “But in that respect, he is patently in error.” The president also urged Mr. Johnson to ally with Mr. Farage in a pro-Brexit coalition. Four parties are competing in the Dec. 12 election, with the Conservatives leading the Labour Party in most polls — by double digits in some. But the winning margins are likely to be narrow. But Mr. Johnson has rebuffed Mr. Farage’s proposal of an alliance between the Brexit and Conservative parties because Mr. Farage has made it contingent on the prime minister’s dropping his Brexit agreement. Abandoning the agreement, Mr. Johnson said, would put the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in 10 Downing Street. Without an alliance, Mr. Farage has said, the party will field 600 candidates, several of whom could jeopardize Conservative-held seats in closely fought districts.']",Mr. Farage said he planned instead to campaign aggressively against Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit agreement.
"Xi Jinping Endorses Carrie Lam, Embattled Hong Kong Leader",2019-11-05,By Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley,"['SHANGHAI — President Xi Jinping of China publicly backed the beleaguered leader of Hong Kong on Monday, in his most direct public comments so far on the pro-democracy protests that have shaken the city for months and raised doubts about her political survival.  Mr. Xi gave his endorsement while meeting the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, in Shanghai on Monday night, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported early Tuesday.  Mrs. Lam briefed Mr. Xi on developments in Hong Kong, where demonstrators have protested for 22 weeks to demand the introduction of wider democracy in the semiautonomous city, which falls under Chinese sovereignty as a “special administrative region.”  If Mr. Xi had any criticisms of Mrs. Lam’s handling of the protests, they were not revealed by Xinhua. In the face of the tumult, he told Mrs. Lam, “you have led the government of the special administrative region in diligently carrying out duties and striving to stabilize the situation,” according to the news agency. “The central leadership has high confidence in you, and fully affirms the work of you and your administrative team,” Mr. Xi said. “Halting the violence and restoring order remain the most important duty in Hong Kong at present.” At the same time, Mr. Xi reminded Mrs. Lam of Beijing’s support for a stern approach to the protests, which have grown increasingly violent in the face of heavy-handed policing. He “demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law,” according to Xinhua. Mr. Xi and Mrs. Lam were both in Shanghai for the China International Import Expo, for which Mr. Xi delivered an opening speech on trade and economic policy on Tuesday. Mrs. Lam’s tenure as Hong Kong’s top official, or chief executive, depends on the effective blessing of Mr. Xi. His public endorsement may offer political relief after persistent rumors that he could press her to step down after the protests subside. Still, Mrs. Lam’s survival may depend on going along with plans that Chinese leaders announced last week to impose tougher “national security” measures on Hong Kong. Such a step could give fresh impetus to the protesters, whose demands have included Mrs. Lam’s resignation and democratic elections for chief executive and for the entire Hong Kong Legislative Council. The Chinese Communist Central Committee, a gathering of about 370 senior officials, endorsed plans last week to “build and improve a legal system and enforcement mechanism to defend national security” in Hong Kong. The communiqué from that meeting was released Tuesday evening. Although it included more than a dozen mentions of Hong Kong, it had few details of what Beijing has in mind. Beijing’s plans may include national security legislation that could help stifle antigovernment demonstrations. The Basic Law, the mini-constitution that defines Hong Kong’s status, requires that the territory pass its own national security laws, but it has not done so. In 2003, the Hong Kong government abandoned proposed legislation after protests inundated city streets. Shen Chunyao, the head of a Chinese legislative committee that helps oversee Hong Kong policy, told a news conference in Beijing on Friday that the Chinese leadership also wanted “patriotic education” in Hong Kong to foster stronger loyalty to China, especially among youth and government workers. The communiqué released on Tuesday also called for enhancing “the national consciousness and patriotism of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots.” Mr. Shen indicated that China may revise how Hong Kong’s chief executive is chosen, but gave no details. The chief executive is currently chosen by a 1,200-member election committee dominated by pro-Beijing groups. There are signs that Beijing’s control of the committee may erode in the coming years unless the rules for choosing its members are changed.  The communiqué went further in saying that the central government “will improve the system and mechanism for the appointment and removal” not just of the chief executive but also of other principal officials in Hong Kong. The brief Xinhua report about the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mrs. Lam did not mention those initiatives. But it did list four other officials as attending the meeting, including one whose inclusion may indicate Beijing’s perception of a security threat in Hong Kong: Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security. The communiqué drew a hard line on what the party perceives as a security threat, saying, “We will resolutely prevent and contain external forces from interfering in Hong Kong and Macau affairs and conducting separatism, subversion, infiltration and destruction activities.” Mrs. Lam appears likely to hear more about Beijing’s plans when she attends meetings there on Wednesday, including one with Han Zheng, the Chinese vice premier who oversees policy toward Hong Kong. “The restoration process will be very long term and very difficult,” Tian Feilong, a Chinese law professor who specializes on Hong Kong said at a talk in Beijing on Monday. China had granted Hong Kong considerable autonomy, he said, adding, “high autonomy means high responsibility.” Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.']","The Chinese president gave strong backing to the Hong Kong chief executive, whose resignation has been sought by the territory’s pro-democracy movement."
Turkey Captures Sister of Islamic State Chief Killed in Raid,2019-11-04,By Carlotta Gall,"['DIYARBAKIR, Turkey — Turkey has captured the older sister of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State who died in an American raid in northwestern Syria a week ago, a senior Turkish official said Tuesday. Mr. al-Baghdadi’s sister, Rasmiya Awad, 65, was detained in the town of Azaz, in a Turkish-controlled region of northern Syria, where she was living with her husband and family members. The capture of such a close relative — and one said to be affiliated with the Islamic State movement —  might yield a trove of intelligence information, the official said. In the years since he declared a caliphate in 2014, Mr. al-Baghdadi had become intensely security conscious. He trusted only his family and a close circle of associates, according to women who were held by him as sex slaves, as well as several senior aides interviewed after their capture in prison in Iraq. Abu Ali al-Basri, Iraq’s director general of intelligence, also suggested in an interview last year that Mr. al-Baghdadi was leaning heavily on direct family members, including his brothers and the husbands of his sisters. The ISIS chief had five brothers and several sisters, but it remains unclear how many are still alive. Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, a research organization in New York, cautioned against expecting to learn too much from Ms. Awad’s capture, but said it could prove valuable. “‘Gold mine’ might be overstating the issue,” he said in an email, “but depending on how much time she spent around Baghdadi, it could be significant.

"Italy’s Students Will Get a Lesson in Climate Change. Many Lessons, in Fact.",2019-11-05,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Yes, children, climate change will be on the test. Italy’s education minister said Tuesday that its public schools would soon require students in every grade to study climate change and sustainability, a step he said would put Italy at the forefront of environmental education worldwide.   The lessons, at first taught as part of the students’ civics education, will eventually become integrated throughout a variety of subjects — a sort of “Trojan horse” that will “infiltrate” all courses, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, said. Environmental advocates welcomed the new subject matter, with some caveats. Teaching children about sustainability is “certainly very important” said Edoardo Zanchini, vice president of Legambiente, Italy’s leading environmental group. But he warned that responsibility should not simply be passed on to children. “Science tells us the next 10 years are crucial,” he said. “We cannot wait for the next generation.” Mr. Fioramonti is a member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which has long put environmental concerns at the heart of its identity. He has already become a target of conservatives for backing taxes on sugar and plastics, and for encouraging students to take part in climate protests last September instead of attending class. Starting in September 2020, he said, teachers in every grade will lead lessons in climate change and environmental sustainability. That 33-hour-a-year lesson, he said, will be used as a pilot program to ultimately fold the climate agenda of the United Nations into the entire curriculum. So merely studying place names and locations in geography class? “Forget that,” Mr. Fioramonti said. Geography courses will soon study the impact of human actions on different parts of the planet, too, he said.  In an interview, Mr. Fioramonti said that a group of experts — including Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, and Kate Raworth of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute — will act as “peer reviewers” for ministry staff preparing the curriculum. By January, he said, the ministry will be ready to train teachers. For children age 6 to 11, he said, “we are thinking of using the fairy-tale model,” in which stories from different cultures would emphasize a connection to the environment. Middle schoolers would be expected to learn more technical information, and high school students would explore the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in depth. Until August, Five Star had governed Italy for more than a year with the nationalist League party, led by Matteo Salvini, who is still the country’s most popular politician, and who has a skeptical view of climate change. One cold spring day in Milan, Mr. Salvini, then the interior minister, appeared to trivialize climate change. “Talking about global warming — we are in the middle of May and call upon global warming, because we haven’t had a cold like this in Italy in recent years,” he said. “We are turning on our heaters.” Mr. Fioramonti suggested that Mr. Salvini needed to be educated. “That’s the kind of nonsense we want to avoid by educating children that this is the most important challenge humanity has ever faced,” he said. “And I want to secure this before there is any change in government that can imperil that kind of process.” But Mr. Salvini still looms over the wobbly Five-Star-led government, and Italy’s many government collapses in recent years have cut short other educational programs. An attempt by a left-leaning government to teach children how to spot disinformation, for example, was discontinued after it lost power. Mr. Fioramonti said a law passed last year, when Five Star was still aligned with the League, gave him the authority to introduce lessons on climate change. He said that the conditions had not been right to go forward with the new curriculum then, but that they were now. Still, many Italians are concerned that Five Star’s emphasis on environmental issues — or, perhaps, its failure to pursue such goals competently — is destroying the country’s economy.  This month, Italy faced a new economic emergency when the foreign operator of a southern Italian steel plant, Ilva, said it would pull out because the Five Star-led government had decided to end criminal immunity for environmental breaches even as the company sought to clean up the polluted facilities. Such a move could cost Italy more than 8,000 jobs. One environmental activist expressed reservations that Mr. Fioramonti’s plan may be too dogmatic. Chicco Testa, president of the environmental group Assombiente, urged officials to make sure children were exposed to varied views, including those who claim that climate change is not primarily caused by man. “To listen to people who say different things is good,” he said. “What the U.N. says is not gospel.” But as President Trump began pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement this week, Mr. Fioramonti said that every country needed to do its part to stop the “Trumps of the world” and that his ambition was to show children there was another way.  “The 21st century citizen,” he said, “must be a sustainable citizen.” Anna Momigliano contributed reporting.']",Public schools will require children in every grade to study sustainability.

China Vows Tougher Security in Hong Kong. Easier Said Than Done.,2019-11-06,By Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — Beijing urged Hong Kong’s embattled leader on Wednesday to support a push to impose national security measures in the territory, which has been hit by months of antigovernment protests. The trouble is that what China’s ruling Communist Party has proposed is not clear and could be hard to enforce. The party hopes that such national security measures will head off unrest in Hong Kong that has challenged its authority. But Hong Kong’s politicians have little appetite for security legislation that could set off more intense protests. Many experts also doubt how much Beijing can directly impose its will on the territory’s legal system without dangerously damaging trust in Hong Kong’s special status both there and internationally. China’s latest warning to end the protests that have pummeled Hong Kong for 22 weeks was delivered by Han Zheng, a vice premier who oversees Chinese policy toward the territory, when he met Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s top official, in Beijing on Wednesday. “This extreme violence and destruction would not be tolerated or accepted by any country or society in the world,” Mr. Han told Mrs. Lam, according to footage of the meeting shown by Phoenix, a Hong Kong-based television service.  Mr. Han reiterated the support that Xi Jinping, China’s president and Communist Party leader, expressed in Mrs. Lam in Shanghai on Monday. But he underscored the Chinese government’s impatience with the protests, which he described as the worst trouble in Hong Kong since Beijing regained sovereignty of the territory from the British in 1997. “Stopping the violence and disorder, and restoring order, is the most important task now,” Mr. Han said. He cited a Chinese Communist Party announcement last week of planned national security measures for Hong Kong, and pointedly added that the idea had received support. “I’ve noticed that the public is paying a lot of attention to this,” he said. “The reaction has been intense.” Throughout the protests, the Chinese government has struggled to match its hard-line rhetoric with effective policies. That problem could deter or frustrate the push to drive through national security measures covering the territory. Earlier, China’s suggestions that it could send troops to Hong Kong to help end the protests petered out, dismissed as unrealistic by experts and many Hong Kongers. Chinese propaganda outlets, which depicted the protesters as puppets of “hostile foreign forces,” seemed caught flat footed when Mrs. Lam announced that she would formally drop the draft extradition legislation that ignited the discontent.  The central government has repeatedly expressed support for Hong Kong’s police force, but officers have struggled to drive back crowds of masked protesters by using tear gas, water cannons and sometimes live gunfire. In mainland China, Mr. Xi has driven far-reaching changes through the party-controlled legislature. But Hong Kong’s British-derived legal system could complicate, even confound, any Chinese attempt to directly impose laws against national security crimes, several experts said. Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing member of Mrs. Lam’s cabinet, said she expected that Mrs. Lam would make little progress on national security legislation. Mrs. Ip was the security secretary for Hong Kong in 2003 when the government made an unsuccessful attempt to introduce such measures. “It’s not something that can happen anytime soon,” Mrs. Ip said of any new push for national security legislation. “But it’s clearly something that weighs heavily on the minds of the Chinese leaders.” Just how heavily Hong Kong weighs on Mr. Xi and other leaders became clear in recent days.  Last week, Chinese Communist Party leaders approved a set of proposals for strengthening government, including one that said China would “build and improve a legal system and enforcement mechanism to defend national security” in Hong Kong.  The full decision from their meeting, released on Tuesday, also laid out proposals to support the city’s police force and expand education intended to promote patriotic loyalty to China, though the party has not issued details of its plans. Hong Kong’s inability to pass security legislation has long irked Chinese officials. Article 23 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution defining Hong Kong’s status under China, says the territory “shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the Chinese government. But after the upheaval over the extradition bill, Hong Kong’s leaders and legislators would be reluctant to use Article 23, said Wei Leijie, a law professor at Xiamen University in southeastern China who studies Hong Kong. “That road has been blocked,” he said by telephone. “The obstacles are immense.” Yet the Communist Party leaders’ decision last week has kindled expectations among some that Mr. Xi could push Mrs. Lam or her successor to enact a national security law. Comments in Chinese state-run news outlets have called for quick action, as have Hong Kong commentators loyal to China. If Hong Kong “does not pass legislation on its own, and this keeps dragging out too long, that would also be intolerable,” said Gu Minkang, a Chinese researcher on Hong Kong law who teaches at a college in Hunan Province in southern China, said by telephone. He and other experts and politicians have argued that China could force through national security legislation for Hong Kong if Mrs. Lam or her successor failed to get the territory’s legislative council to approve a bill.  Although election laws ensure that the council is dominated by pro-Beijing members, they could waver in voting for contentious security legislation, as some did in 2003, when a previous bill failed. Some experts argue that under another section of the Basic Law, Article 18, China has the power to impose laws against at least some security threats in Hong Kong by putting them into an annex of the Basic Law. But imposing any laws against political subversion and similar crimes on Hong Kong is much easier said than done, other experts said. The Basic Law clearly indicates that the power to enact legislation covering major national security crimes, such as treason and seeking secession, belonged in the hands of Hong Kong lawmakers, Danny Gittings, an expert on Hong Kong’s legal status, said in a telephone interview. Even Chinese laws lodged in the annex of the Basic Law must be approved by Hong Kong’s chief executive or its legislature to come into force, he said. That step could prove politically incendiary, and laws would be open to challenge in Hong Kong courts. “It’s not enough to put it in the Basic Law,” Mr. Gittings said. “It’s got to go through the local process.” Declaring a state of emergency in the territory could blast a hole through such legal concerns, Mr. Gittings said. But that step could inflame protests and shake global confidence in Hong Kong as a financial center. If China declared a state of emergency to impose security legislation, said Professor Wei, the Chinese legal academic, “the situation in Hong Kong could be hard to clean up.” Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai, and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.

"Mormon Family Massacre Stuns Mexico, Laying Bare Government’s Helplessness",2019-11-06,"By Elisabeth Malkin, Kirk Semple and Julie Turkewitz","['MEXICO CITY — The women and their children were taking a drive along a familiar rural road in northern Mexico when the gunmen attacked, riddling the three-car convoy with bullets. One woman was shot at close range in the chest. One child was shot in the back. Several others — among them 6-month-old twins — were burned beyond recognition when one of the vehicles caught fire. When the shooting stopped, six children and three women were dead, all members of the LeBarón family, dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived for decades in a fundamentalist Mormon community near the  border. “When you know there are babies tied in a car seat that are burning because of some twisted evil that’s in this world, it’s just hard to cope with that,” Kenny LeBarón, a cousin of the women who were killed, said in a telephone interview. Many questions remained on Tuesday about what happened on that lonely stretch of road a day earlier, amid the rugged scrubland of the Mexican border state Sonora. But coming closely on the heels of two other prominent episodes of violence, the ambush horrified a nation reeling from a record-high number of murders. And it added to the pressure on Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to fulfill the promise he made when he took office nearly a year ago: that he would curb the killings. Mr. López Obrador seems to be struggling to fashion a coherent response. In mid-October, at least 13 police officers were killed in the state of Michoacán in an ambush stemming from a struggle between rival criminal groups. Days later, nearly 400 gunmen from the Sinaloa Cartel — the group once led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the imprisoned drug trafficker known as El Chapo — took control of Culiacán, the state capital of Sinaloa, after government forces tried to arrest one of Mr. Guzmán’s sons. But Mexicans seemed especially taken aback by the sheer brutality of the latest spasm of bloodshed — children and their mothers slaughtered in broad daylight — and the government’s seeming inability to do much about any of the violence. On Tuesday, Mr. López Obrador rejected rising criticism that his government is merely improvising against organized crime groups, and struck a defiant tone over his approach. “You can’t fight violence with more violence,” Mr. López Obrador said at a news conference. He vowed that there would be “intelligence, rather than force” and “punishment, not corruption.” Collusion between the authorities and criminals, he said, would end. After taking office, Mr. López Obrador had vowed to end his predecessors’ so-called war on drugs and address the roots of crime by tackling poverty. But on Tuesday, Carlos Bravo Regidor, a political analyst in Mexico City, said the recent violence had “exposed the limits and deficits of the president’s new vision for security.” He added, “The president can no longer continue with his discourse of ‘hugs, not bullets’ after what happened yesterday.”  President Trump offered via Twitter on Tuesday to help Mexico eradicate organized crime groups, saying that it was time “to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” The Mexican leader declined, however, saying that “in these cases we have to act with independence.”  Mr. López Obrador and his top security official said the authorities were still gathering information about the assailants in the latest atrocity. They speculated that the family might have been victims of mistaken identity. Their sport utility vehicles “could have been confused by the criminal groups that are fighting in the region,” said Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister. But details of the attack remained murky on Tuesday. In particular, it was unclear whether the attackers had intentionally targeted the family, which has in the past spoken out about the criminal groups that plague the northern border states of Sonora and Chihuahua. Investigators were looking into the possibility that a person who was arrested on Tuesday — in an operation that freed two people who had been bound and gagged — might have been connected to the massacre, a Sonora law enforcement agency said. But it did not cite any indication of a link, and the person was caught several hours away, in the border town of Agua Prieta. The victims’ three cars were traveling Monday morning from La Mora, in the state of Sonora, to Colonia LeBarón in the state of Chihuahua, a four-hour drive partly along a dirt road through the mountains, relatives said. They knew the route well. Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the three women driving the vehicles, said in a telephone interview from Bavispe, Mexico, that his cousin Rhonita Miller had been traveling to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary. Her car broke down, Mr. LeBarón said, and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car.” She was killed, along with an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and the twins, he said. The two other cars were attacked down the road, and the two other women killed, Mr. LeBarón said. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, he said. One of the women, Christina Langford, 31, was shot outside her car, Mr. LeBarón said. “They shot her point blank in the chest,” he said. Several family members posted a video, said to have been taken after the attack, showing a charred vehicle riddled with bullet holes, with a fire still burning inside.  Several children hid by the roadside to escape the attackers and were later rescued, family members said. One boy, who is about 12, hiked several miles to La Mora to alert family members about what had happened, said David Langford, a relative. The boy’s younger sister, who is about 9, was injured and set out on her own. She became lost, and it took hours for the family to find her, said Mr. Langford, who grew up in Sonora and now lives in North Dakota.  The surviving children were taken to Arizona  for treatment. Among the victims was Mr. Langford’s sister, Ms. Langford, who grew up in La Mora, a small community of Mormon families surrounded by orchards and dairy cows, and had six children.   Ms. Langford was planning to move this week with her children to North Dakota to be closer to her husband, who had relocated there to work in the oil business. “She doesn’t like the city life, and she was trying to give them a better life, and sacrificing being with her husband to do it,” Mr. Langford said.  Mr. LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel. Mr. Langford said relatives had been warned by criminal groups to “stay off” the road between La Mora and LeBarón at night, a command they had complied with. “We’ve been traveling that road for 50 years,” he said.  Mr. LeBarón said that perhaps the killings would finally spur enough outrage to force change. “We need the Mexican people to say at some point, ‘We’ve had enough,” he said. “We need accountability — we don’t have that on any level.” Mormon families have lived in northern Mexico for decades.  Unaffiliated with the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some practice plural marriage, while others are monogamous. The communities make a living on both sides of the border, with many of their members speaking English and holding dual citizenship. In Mexico, they raise cattle and farm alfalfa and chili peppers. The men also travel to the United States to work in different parts of the country.  Over the years, there have been tensions between the Mormons and local criminals. In 2009, two members of the LeBarón family were murdered after organizing local communities against the gangs. But the Mormons have learned to live with the occasional threat, said Lynn Wariner LeBaron, a part-time resident of the community of Colonia LeBarón. And Ruth Wariner, who grew up in the region, said that in recent years, the Colonia LeBarón community seemed to have established a truce of sorts with the gangs. So the killings, Ms Wariner said, were a surprise. There just didn’t seem to be any reason for them. “Things seemed to be getting more peaceful,” she said.

"Israel to Expel Human Rights Worker, Citing Anti-Boycott Law",2019-11-05,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Israel’s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a senior official of the advocacy group Human Rights Watch must leave the country within 20 days, invoking a contentious law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel or its settlements in the occupied West Bank. The ruling upheld a 2018 decision by Israel’s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, itself upheld in April by a lower court, to bar Omar Shakir, an American citizen and the organization’s Israel and Palestine director, from staying and working in the country. The case has shone a spotlight on the limits of what Israel views as legitimate criticism and human rights activity, as well as of its commitment to liberal democratic values.  Rejecting Mr. Shakir’s appeal, the judges wrote that the decision not to renew his visa had stemmed from “a real concern” that Mr. Shakir, through his activities, was “exploiting” his stay to delegitimize Israel and to promote the boycott movement against it. The judges said that the ruling against Mr. Shakir as an individual had no bearing on the work of other rights advocates and did not mean that Israel was “closing its gates” to other representatives of Human Rights Watch, a prominent New York-based organization, or to similar groups.  But critics described the decision as a chilling signal meant to intimidate rights workers and, more broadly, add to a growing Israeli clampdown on peaceful protest against the settlements and the treatment of Palestinians under the conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  “Who will they throw out next?” Mr. Shakir asked in an interview after the ruling. “The Supreme Court has put a veneer of legality on the Netanyahu government’s clampdown on human rights activities.”  Neither he nor Human Rights Watch had called for a wholesale consumer boycott of Israel or its settlements, he said. Michael Sfard, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Shakir, wrote on Twitter: “The ruling gives the Israeli government a dangerous and antidemocratic veto over the identity of representatives of international organizations operating in Israel and the territories,” referring to the areas occupied by Israel since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. “Today, Omar is being expelled,” Mr. Sfard wrote. “Tomorrow they’ll expel representatives from other organizations, foreign journalists and basically anyone who criticizes government policy in the territories.” Israel has stepped up its fight in recent years against the international movement to boycott it, saying that the movement delegitimizes the country and is anti-Semitic because it singles out Israel and ultimately aims to undermine its existence as a Jewish state. In 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment to the Entry Law barring foreigners who have publicly called for boycotts against Israel or its West Bank settlements. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s minister for strategic affairs, who heads the fight against the boycott movement, applauded the court decision. Arguing that Mr. Shakir “took advantage of his stay in Israel to harm it, something no sane country would allow,” Mr. Erdan said that Human Rights Watch was “welcome to appoint another representative in Israel in place of Shakir.”  Activists say that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is a nonviolent means to protest Israel and its policies toward Palestinians, along with its settlements, which most of the world considers to be a violation of international law. In August, under pressure from President Trump, Mr. Netanyahu’s government barred two members of the United States Congress from entering Israel for an official visit, citing their support for boycotting Israel. Israel initially denied Mr. Shakir a work visa in 2017. At the time, Israel’s Foreign Ministry accused Human Rights Watch of engaging in “Palestinian propaganda” and said it was “systematically biased against Israel.” That led rights activists to draw unflattering parallels between Israel and other countries that have denied the group access, such as Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Israel relented. But last year Mr. Deri, the interior minister, decided that Mr. Shakir’s visa should not be renewed, and the case moved to the courts.  The Israeli authorities compiled a dossier on Mr. Shakir documenting his activities in support of a boycott, mostly from before he joined the advocacy group. Like the dossier, the courts also pointed to reports and advocacy by Human Rights Watch that called on businesses to cease activities that benefit Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Tuesday’s judgment cited more recent Twitter posts written by Mr. Shakir, including some promoting a decision by Airbnb to stop listing properties in West Bank settlements — a decision that Airbnb has since frozen.  In February, Mr. Shakir wrote a post praising a Spanish company’s rejection of a tender for Jerusalem’s light rail project, saying that a section would be built on confiscated Palestinian land. “Other companies should follow its lead,” he wrote. Eugene Kontorovich, the director of international law at the right-leaning Kohelet Policy Forum in Jerusalem, said in a statement that the ruling against Mr. Shakir was “entirely unexceptional.”  “Western countries typically have legal provisions barring entry to people that seek to undermine the country,” Mr. Kontorovich said. But Human Rights Watch said in a statement that it had been calling on businesses to stop operating in Israeli settlements “as part of their duty to avoid complicity in human rights abuses,” and that it called on businesses to comply with this duty in many parts of the world. “The Supreme Court has effectively declared that free expression in Israel does not include completely mainstream advocacy for Palestinian rights,” the group’s executive director, Kenneth Roth, said in the statement. After a protracted court battle, Tuesday’s ruling appeared to have all but exhausted Mr. Shakir’s legal options. He said the decision on whether to expel him now reverted to the government.  “Our ask now is for the government to reverse its decision,” Mr. Shakir said. “I hope the government will see what’s at stake here. Regardless of what they say, it is not about one person or one organization. It’s about what kind of country Israel wants to be.”']","Rejecting an appeal by a United States citizen, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that his visa should not be renewed."
Macron Says NATO Is Experiencing ‘Brain Death’ Because of Trump,2019-11-07,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — French President Emmanuel Macron shocked allies in an interview published on Thursday, saying that he did not know whether NATO’s commitment to collective defense was still valid and that the alliance was experiencing “brain death” because of a lack of strategic coordination and leadership from the United States. “What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” Mr. Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” notably by pulling troops out of northeastern Syria without notice, and he called on Europeans, as he has often done, to do more in their own defense with the aim of “strategic autonomy.’’ Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany responded unusually sharply to what she called Mr. Macron’s “drastic words,” which she does not share. “That is not my point of view,” Ms. Merkel said in Berlin when asked about Mr. Macron’s remarks.   “I don’t think that such sweeping judgments are necessary, even if we have problems and need to pull together,” Ms. Merkel said. “NATO remains vital to our security.” Asked for his own response, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised NATO in the eastern German city of Leipzig, after spending the morning touring the former border that divided East Germany from the West, where he was an officer in the United States Army.  “I think NATO remains an important, critical, perhaps historically one of the most critical strategic partnerships in all of recorded history,” he said. NATO was crucial to the collapse of the Iron Curtain that divided Europe for decades, he said. It was the cooperation and “remarkable work” of NATO’s democratic partners “that created freedom and brought millions of people out of very, very difficult situations.” Mr. Pompeo then went on to defend Mr. Trump’s persistent demands that Germany and other allies increase military spending to the NATO goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, with Mr. Pompeo, also rejected Mr. Macron’s characterization. “I do not believe NATO is brain dead,” he said. “I firmly believe in international cooperation.” NATO leaders will gather in London for an abbreviated summit meeting on Dec. 3 and 4 to mark the alliance’s 70th anniversary. Mr. Macron’s pessimistic views about its future are bound to overshadow the meeting, which was already designed to be brief given Mr. Trump’s own harsh criticism of NATO allies for not spending enough in their own defense. Mr. Macron also wants Europeans to spend more on defense, but in pursuit of their own strategic goals, in collaboration with NATO but not beholden to it.  His remarks were clearly in response to some of Mr. Trump’s unilateral actions. “You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies. None,” Mr. Macron said. ‘‘You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another NATO ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake,” he added. “There has been no NATO planning, nor any coordination.’’ Turkey’s military operation against Kurdish forces in northern Syria was opposed by fellow NATO members like France, but made possible by Mr. Trump’s sudden withdrawal of United States forces, against the advice of American officials, after a telephone conversation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. NATO functions well in the military sphere, coordinating armies and commands, Mr. Macron said. But “strategically and politically, we need to recognize that we have a problem,” he said. “We should reassess the reality of what NATO is in light of the commitment of the United States.’’ In fact, despite Mr. Trump’s often truculent criticism and his own early reluctance to support collective defense, he has authorized a sizable increase in the American commitment of money and troops to NATO and European defense, including putting American troops in Poland and rotating through the Baltic nations. Even France, a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, is not reaching the NATO goal, projected by NATO to spend 1.84 percent of gross domestic product on defense this year. The interview with Mr. Macron took place on Oct. 21 in his Paris office in French, but was not released until Thursday by The Economist, in both French and English. Mr. Macron’s real worry seemed to be the sleepwalking drift of Europe, caught between Russia, China and the United States. “All this has led to the exceptional fragility of Europe, which if it can’t think of itself as a global power, will disappear,” he said. Mr. Macron has pushed for closer European integration, a rapprochement with Russia, a tougher line on Brexit and an end to the enlargement of the European Union until the process can be rethought.  The remarks reflected both his striving for a leadership role in a Europe, where Ms. Merkel is perceived to be weakened and Britain is leaving, and also his move to the right for his own domestic political purposes. But his comments brought some sharp criticism from analysts. François Heisbourg, a French defense expert, said that Mr. Macron, who loves to talk, “is speaking like a policy-detached think-tanker” and not the leader of a key NATO ally. Mr. Heisbourg called Mr. Macron’s comments “bizarre” and “dangerous” for a head of state. Mr. Macron’s comments “will really damage NATO and could be seized upon by its opponents, including Trump,"" Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at Washington’s Brookings Institution, wrote on Twitter.  He called the interview “deliberate, provocative and catastrophic,” and added that Mr. Macron “increasingly acts unilaterally without coordinating with the rest of the E.U. or even without informing his own officials and government colleagues.” Ulrich Speck, a German analyst, said in a Twitter response: “With Macron saying that NATO is ‘brain-dead,’ it becomes clearer what ‘strategic autonomy’ means for him: A Europe without NATO.” His words seemed a direct challenge to Berlin, too, Mr. Speck said. Shashank Joshi, the Economist’s defense editor, said: “I cannot imagine how Macron could possibly have thrown a bigger stink-bomb toward NATO ahead of the London summit of leaders in December. Extraordinary words, and extraordinary timing.’’ Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, was also in Berlin for celebrations of the 30th anniversary on Saturday of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He praised NATO and the American role in Europe. “The reunification of Germany and Europe would have been impossible without the United States’ security guarantee,” he said. “Any attempt to distance Europe from North America will not only weaken the trans-Atlantic alliance, it also risks dividing Europe itself.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']","The French president wonders whether NATO is still committed to collective defense, denounces American unilateralism and calls for more European autonomy."
"In the British Election, a Series of Missteps",2019-11-07,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Nobody expected Britain’s general election to follow a smooth script, and by the end of a second hectic day of campaigning both of the country’s major parties had suffered a series of unexpected bumps and blows. On Thursday, it was the opposition Labour Party’s turn. Two former Labour members of Parliament declared that they planned to vote for the Conservative Party because they said Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was unfit to be prime minister. Their comments came a day after the sudden resignation of the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who had tangled for years with Mr. Corbyn over Brexit policy and anti-Semitism in the party’s upper ranks. The upheaval threw Labour’s campaign into disarray only a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives stumbled out of the gate. In just 24 hours they were hit with the sudden resignation of one of Mr. Johnson’s cabinet ministers in a legal scandal, an apology from another following widely condemned comments about the Grenfell Tower fire and accusations that the party had doctored a TV interview with a prominent Labour politician. In Labour’s case, the internal dissent resurfaced allegations of anti-Semitism that have long haunted the party. “I can’t really believe it’s come to this, but I think I need to tell people that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t fit to lead the Labour Party,” Ian Austin, who had been an adviser to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said in an emotional interview broadcast on Sky News. “He’s certainly not fit to lead the country.” Mr. Austin, who left the party earlier this year, accused Mr. Corbyn of having sided with Britain’s enemies, whether it be the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland or Hamas and Hezbollah in the Middle East. The adopted son of a Czech-Jewish father who fled the Nazis, Mr. Austin said Mr. Corbyn had allowed a culture of extremism and anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party. He was joined by another former Labour lawmaker, John Woodcock, who also said he would vote for Mr. Johnson. Their rebellion coincided with a front-page article in an influential London-based Jewish newspaper, the Jewish Chronicle, which urged non-Jews to vote against the Labour Party because of what the editors said was Mr. Corbyn’s long record of espousing and tolerating anti-Semitic views. “There were some who hoped that he might change as leader,” the paper said. “The opposite has happened. The near total inaction of Mr. Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership in dealing with anti-Semites in the party has both emboldened them and encouraged others.” Mr. Corbyn, a strong critic of Israel, has long denied being an anti-Semite. He said the Labour Party had investigated the allegations and suspended or expelled members found guilty of anti-Jewish statements. He did not address the latest charges, which dominated news coverage on a day when he had hoped to sharpen Labour’s attack on Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives for their policy of a swift exit from the European Union. Mr. Watson’s resignation revealed other tensions in the party, which have deepened since Mr. Corbyn became leader in 2015. As deputy leader, he had been the most senior of Mr. Corbyn’s critics to survive with a leadership role in the party and had used that position to promote a conspicuously different agenda. An outspoken opponent of Brexit, Mr. Watson pressed first to embrace the policy of holding a second referendum and then, unsuccessfully, sought to make Labour commit to remaining in the European Union. Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, resisted that, insisting that Labour should stick to a policy of negotiating a new Brexit deal, then putting that to a referendum with the alternative option of remaining in the bloc. Mr. Watson was also vocal in his criticism of the party’s failure to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism. He expressed alarm when another Labour lawmaker, Luciana Berger, quit, saying she had been driven out of the party. It was, he said, the “worst day of shame” in the party’s history. After Ms. Berger and a handful of other lawmakers left the party this year to protest Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, Mr. Watson formed a new caucus for social democrats and urged the centrists to stay and fight. However, he now becomes the latest moderate lawmaker to quit Parliament, among them Owen Smith, who challenged Mr. Corbyn for the leadership in 2016 — an exodus that is noticeable in the Conservative Party as well and that analysts say is radicalizing both of them. For Mr. Corbyn’s most ardent supporters, Mr. Watson had become a reviled figure. On the eve of the Labour Party’s annual conference in September, allies of Mr. Corbyn tried unsuccessfully to abolish his job. He also came under fire for raising accusations that prominent British establishment figures had sexually abused boys — claims made by a man whose evidence subsequently proved to be false. In his resignation letter, Mr. Watson promised to continue to fight for Labour. Unlike Mr. Austin and Mr. Woodcock, he said he would support the party’s candidates in the general election.']","In a bitter and divisive campaign, the Conservatives stumbled first. Labour soon followed, with resignations and charges of anti-Semitism."
9 Members of Mormon Family in Mexico Are Killed in Ambush,2019-11-05,"By Azam Ahmed, Elisabeth Malkin and Daniel Victor","['MEXICO CITY — Three women and six children from a prominent local Mormon family were killed on Monday in northern Mexico, family members said, when gunmen believed to be members of organized crime ambushed their vehicles on a desolate road.  The attack alarmed a nation already reeling from record violence this year, and though its details remained murky it fueled criticism of the government’s strategy against the power of criminal groups.  [Update: In Mormon family’s 12 hours of terror in Mexico, a message emerges: No one is safe.] Members of the LeBarón family, dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived in a fundamentalist Mormon community in the border region for decades, were traveling in three separate vehicles when the gunmen attacked, several family members said. They described a terrifying scene in which one child was gunned down while running away, while others were trapped inside a burning car. Two of the children killed were less than a year old, the family members said. The car they were in with their mother was set ablaze.   David Langford, whose sister Christina died in the attack, said that eight children had survived, including his sister’s 7-month-old infant. Several of the children survived after hiding by a tree, and one, about 12 years old, hiked several miles to get help, Mr. Langford said. One of the children who got away had been shot in the leg and the face and was in critical condition, Mr. Langford said. He blamed cartels in the area for the attack, calling their members “some of the most wicked men on the face of the planet.” Mexico has suffered a string of violent episodes in the past month, each as devastating and infuriating for citizens as the last.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said during a news conference on Tuesday that the region where the attack took place “has been a very violent area for many years.” Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister, said Tuesday that “there were serious advances in the investigation” and that the women’s sport utility vehicles could have been confused by criminal groups operating  in the area. Among those groups is a cell linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, which was led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo. When security forces tried to arrest one of his sons last month in Culiacán, in Sinaloa State, almost 400 gunmen swarmed the city and forced the government to withdraw.  Other groups are trying to seize the region where the attack took place, Mr. Durazo said.  Fourteen police officers were killed in Michoacán State last month, in an ambush stemming from violent clashes there. Days later, cartel gunmen laid siege to Culiacán. In both cases, the stark challenges of public security were revealed, raising questions about the government’s capacity to combat the spiraling violence. On Tuesday, President López Obrador defended his security strategy in the face of the drumbeat of violence, saying, “You cannot put out fire with fire.”  He said “there will be intelligence, which has been lacking, more than force,” and promised “prosecution, punishment.”  But Monday’s killings seem to have hit a new low, with infants, children and their mothers massacred in the road. It threatened to become a galvanizing moment for citizens frustrated with violence and the government’s efforts to stop it. President Trump offered on Tuesday to help Mexico eradicate the cartels, saying on Twitter that the Americans could “wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” He said that the United States was only waiting for a call from Mr. López Obrador, adding, “The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” Mr. López Obrador said it was up to Mexico to deal with the matter. “We appreciate and thank very much President Trump and any foreign government that wants to help, but in these cases we have to act with independence,” he said. Later Tuesday, a White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said the presidents had discussed violence and cooperation in the border region. Mr. Trump offered assistance “to ensure the perpetrators face justice,” Mr. Gidley said.  At least publicly, many details of the attack remained unclear Tuesday, as the state and local authorities struggled to piece together what happened and why. At the heart of the mystery was motive. It was unknown whether the attackers deliberately targeted the family, which has historically spoken out about the criminal groups near the American border, or whether it was a case of mistaken identity. Julian LeBarón, a cousin of the women who were driving, said that they and their children had been traveling from La Mora, in Sonora State, to Colonia LeBarón, in Chihuahua State. One of his cousins, Rhonita LeBarón, was traveling to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary. Her car broke down, Mr. LeBarón said, and the gunmen started shooting, causing the vehicle to explode. He said she was killed with her four children: an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and twins who were less than a year old. About eight miles ahead, the two other cars were also attacked, and the two other women, Christina Langford and Dawna Langford, were killed. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, Mr. LeBarón said.   The children were taken to hospitals, and several or all of them were airlifted to the United States, David Langford said.   Family members expressed bewilderment over what could have precipitated the attack. “They intentionally murdered those people,” Mr. LeBarón said. “We don’t know what their motives were.” One of the women even got out of her car, he said, and put up her hands. “They shot her point blank in the chest,” he said. Mr. LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel. The massacre came a decade after two other members of the LeBarón family were kidnapped and murdered after they confronted the drug gangs that exercise de facto control over  the borderlands south of Arizona.  The family’s religious community is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the mainstream church with 16 million adherents that is headquartered in Utah. Their community began in the early 20th century, when members of the LeBarón family moved to Mexico and practiced polygamy, which was forbidden by the Latter-day Saints. Polygamy has largely faded from the community. Religious communities that date themselves to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often call themselves Mormon. The mainstream church has abandoned the moniker.  It was not immediately clear if their religious beliefs were a factor in their deaths. Family members on social media implored the governments of Mexico and the United States to do something about the intensifying violence in Mexico, in particular in the areas along the  northern border, where Mormons and Mennonites have lived for decades despite the threat from organized crime.  Azam Ahmed, Elisabeth Malkin and Elda Cantú reported from Mexico City, and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong. Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting from Washington, and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.']","Six children were among the victims of a massacre attributed to organized crime, relatives said.

"Football’s Longest Drive: 1,000 Miles Across Australia",2019-11-07,By Matthew Abbott,"['LAJAMANU, Australia — Halfway into a 400-mile journey through a dusty stretch of the Australian desert, the team’s minibus ran into trouble.  The players, Warlpiri Australians from one of the country’s most isolated towns, were headed to a carnival, a celebration of sport and culture that brings together far-flung Indigenous communities from across the Central Desert. Much of the drive to the site of the event, in Yuendumu, from their home in Lajamanu, Northern Territory, was a straight shot along the infamous and empty Tanami Road, a bone-rattling dirt track that stretches 650 miles.  But the trip was just a short jaunt for the players, who have traveled up to 1,000 miles to play their favorite game, a sport called “bush footy.” The game is a take on Australian rules football, one of the world’s most brutal sports. It is the town’s saving grace, residents say — a diversion from everyday hardships in a place with a harsh climate and few employment opportunities. “All them young fellas getting stuck in town and getting into trouble,” said Dione Kelly, the team’s coach. “That’s why we take them out to other communities competing in football.” Nearly every young man in town — and some old men and quite a few women — play the sport, which some experts argue was inspired by an ancient Indigenous game, known locally as purlja. There are just 600 residents in Lajamanu, but it’s home to five bush footy teams, with 18 players on a side. When a carnival is on, nearly the entire town attends. Suddenly, though, the team’s presence at this carnival was in jeopardy. Just before the bus reached the first of two turns in the entire journey, the flashing lights of a police car appeared. “I understand that everyone is traveling to the carnival, but it’s my responsibility to make sure everyone gets there safely,” said Garry Willmett, the officer who pulled over the bus. “So you’re not going anywhere, until I see a license.” The only problem: No one on the bus had one. Also, no one was wearing a seatbelt. And the bus was overcrowded. And it was probably speeding.  Such run-ins with the police are common in Lajamanu (as are other social problems, including substance abuse, domestic violence and suicide). Residents feel they are often unfairly singled out by the authorities who many see as discriminatory and heavy handed. “Three of those boys have warrants out for their arrests, including the driver,” said Clint Firth, a representative of the Australian Football League, the sport’s professional league and governing body, who was watching the scene from another car traveling with the team as part of a convoy. “They’ll probably be running out into the bush now.” The traffic stop came not just with the threat of arrest but of derailing the entire town’s chance of properly enjoying the carnival. Fortunately, a town elder with a license, traveling in another car in the convoy, offered to take over driving the minibus. Satisfied with this arrangement, the officer sent the team, and the convoy of townspeople, back on their way. Not even a mile later, when the coast was clear, the vehicles pulled over and the drivers swapped again. “He’s a new cop, only just arrived in town. Things are different here,” Mr. Firth said. “The last guy was completely different, he realized you can’t book people for small things. Otherwise you’ll be arresting the whole town.” Across Central Australia, Indigenous players and their families see bush footy as an opportunity to connect with their neighbors, their relatives in faraway towns and their culture. “Same like Brazil,” said Cyril Tasman, one of the elders from Lajamanu who supports the team. “They got their footy, we got our footy. It’s like a religion here.” As the team continued its journey, the bus passed burned-out cars, the odd tourist and the Outback’s famous road trains — trucks pulling three or four trailers at a time. The serpentine vehicles can stretch up to 200 feet and kick up dust for miles in their wakes. Shortly after dusk the team pulled into a bus shelter for a meal of corned beef and bread. The area near the Granites, a gold mine, is one of the few spots in the desert between Lajamanu and Yuendumu that has cell service, and the players scrambled to check their phones.  The mine, founded in 1993 by an American company, compensates the land’s traditional owners from Lajamanu and Yuendumu. These royalties help pay for the carnivals by providing money for food, transport and programs run by the A.F.L. Just past 11 p.m., with the fuel light on, the bus made its second turn of the trip, arriving at Yuendumu. The team scattered as each player found a room or camped on the veranda of a relative’s house. This year, 17 men’s and eight women’s teams entered the carnival. It was only the second time in more than 50 years that a women’s competition was also held. Other sports are also typically played during the carnival, including basketball and softball, and the festival features other aspects of the local culture, including art and dance. Some of the carnival’s visitors have other pursuits on their minds as well. As Mr. Tasman, the Lajamanu elder explained: “You know, all these kids are connected on social media now. The boys and girls are talking online and these carnivals are a chance to meet in person.” But footy is the main attraction. Bush footy is played in significantly different ways than how the game is played in cities. For one, the oval, or field, is often dirt instead of grass. While the professional game has become increasingly technical and strategic, bush footy has very little structure. “It’s how they used to play the game 50 years ago,” said Mr. Firth, the football league representative. “Bush footy is pretty unique. It’s a lot looser and, to be honest, more fun.” The first day of competition started with plans to play games well into the night. But suddenly, in the middle of a game, play was halted. Players walked off the field, and the lights illuminating the oval were turned off without explanation. Gradually, a message was whispered through the crowd. There had been a death in the community and to show respect, everyone had to leave the grounds immediately. The crowd dispersed into night. The town was eerily silent, except for the faint sobbing of family members mourning the young man’s death. A rumor quickly circulated that the carnival would be canceled. By the next afternoon, though, the grieving family gave the town permission to continue the carnival. The teams took to the oval and the crowds followed, surrounding the sidelines to cheer. The Lajamanu team made it through to the quarterfinals, facing off against its archrival, the hometown team from Yuendumu. Lajamanu was winning until the game’s final minute of play, when a Yuendumu player ran the ball down the length of the field and scored a goal just as the buzzer sounded. In an instant, the team’s dreams were dashed. But there was little time for misery. They had to get back on the bus. They were expected in Katherine, 710 miles away. Another game of bush footy was waiting for them.']","For Indigenous Australians in isolated towns, “bush footy” is more religion than sport. Neither distance, the police nor even death can keep teams from competing."
Jacob Rees-Mogg Suggests Grenfell Victims Lacked ‘Common Sense’,2019-11-05,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of Britain’s House of Commons and a prominent ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, suggested this week that victims of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire lacked the common sense to defy firefighters’ orders and flee the building, costing them their lives. The comments, appearing to lay some blame for the 72 deaths on the people trapped in the flames, angered other lawmakers and shocked even critics who have grown used to Mr. Rees-Mogg’s flashes of aristocratic obliviousness. They also threatened to undercut the Conservative Party’s main election pitch — that it’s a party for working-class voters alienated from the Labour Party over Brexit  — just as campaigning for the Dec. 12 vote gets underway. Nicknamed “the honorable gentleman from the 18th century,” Mr. Rees-Mogg was recently seen reclining on the front bench of the House of Commons, making clear his boredom during a fierce Brexit debate. And lawmakers said that a speech he gave in the run-up to a crunch vote was so arrogant that it persuaded members of his own Conservative Party to change their minds and rebuff the government’s Brexit plans. Mr. Johnson, who is about to formally launch the Conservative campaign, is already saddled with a reputation for being haughty and occasionally out of touch. For a government trying to dispel an image of being a bunch of smug, entitled private-school types sleepwalking into national crisis, Mr. Rees-Mogg’s air of condescension and disdain has not been helpful. But his comments this week threatened to be even more damaging, casting a fire widely seen as a failure of government oversight as, instead, the fault of the public housing residents who lost their lives in it. A 900-page, government-commissioned report on the fire last week found that more people would have survived if firefighters had not told them to stay inside their apartments. Emergency operators also told residents to shelter in place, because the building was designed to stop the spread of fire. Some tried to escape but were turned back by choking smoke, and others, not knowing where the fire was, feared that they would be walking into even more peril. Still others were physically unable to flee. “If you just ignore what you’re told and leave, you are so much safer,” Mr. Rees-Mogg said on Monday in an interview with Nick Ferrari, the host of a show on LBC, a radio station. “And I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do. And it is such a tragedy that didn’t happen.” Late Tuesday morning, Mr. Rees-Mogg apologized, saying, “I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments.” But some colleagues doubled down, with a Conservative lawmaker, Andrew Bridgen, suggesting that residents of Grenfell Tower exhibited a kind of deference common in people who were not fit, as Mr. Rees-Mogg was, to run the country. “Jacob is a leader, he’s an authority figure,” Mr. Bridgen said in a radio interview, describing why Mr. Rees-Mogg would have made it out of the Grenfell fire alive. “We want very clever people running the country, don’t we?” Opposition lawmakers and Grenfell survivors reacted furiously to Mr. Rees-Mogg’s remarks. Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour leader, called them “crass” and “insensitive.” “What possesses someone to react to an entirely avoidable tragedy like Grenfell by saying the victims lacked common sense?” Mr. Corbyn wrote on Twitter. “People were terrified, many died trying to escape.” Ahmed Chellat, who lost five relatives in the fire, told the newspaper the Mirror: “What common sense is he talking about? People died on the stairs trying to leave, they couldn’t breathe. People needed help and directions, they tried to open doors and there was smoke everywhere.” Mr. Rees-Mogg had been responding to a question about whether racist or classist policies had anything to do with the 2017 blaze, the deadliest in Britain in generations. The fire was fed by flammable cladding on the facade of the building that survivors have charged was installed to beautify their public housing project for the benefit of wealthy neighbors in west London. Mr. Rees-Mogg’s double-breasted suits, antique diction and penchant for polysyllabic words have long endeared him to a nostalgic set of Conservatives pining for the return of a different Britain. He has opposed climate change legislation, same-sex marriage, large-scale immigration and increased spending on social services, while supporting corporate tax cuts. As a lawmaker with impeccable pro-Brexit bona fides and a wide following on the right wing of the party, he is among the most prominent cabinet ministers in Mr. Johnson’s government. But Mr. Rees-Mogg’s unabashed elitism and past support for a no-deal Brexit that economists say would do serious harm have made him a frequent target of critics who would like to make him, not Mr. Johnson, the emblem of the government.  An Oxford graduate who named his sixth child Sixtus, Mr. Rees-Mogg recently had his wife’s ancestral home benefit from a state-funded restoration at a cost of 7.6 million pounds, about $9.8 million. He is a partner in an investment firm that has been criticized for operating in overseas tax havens. His remarks on Grenfell were the second time in days that his party found itself in hot water over the disaster. Last week, during a debate in the House of Commons over the release of the government report, Mr. Corbyn wore a bright green tie, a color long used to honor victims of the fire. Conservative lawmakers treated it as a fashion blunder and laughed at Mr. Corbyn, eliciting an angry response from Theresa May, Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, who had to remind her colleagues that it was for Grenfell. ']","Heading into an election campaign in Britain, the comment by one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s most well-known cabinet ministers could complicate matters for his Conservative Party."
"With a Smile, Southeast Asian Nations Protect an Authoritarian",2019-11-07,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is not an acronym that tends to excite. Founded on notions of consensus-building and noninterference, the 10-nation group issues pronouncements drowning in careful and bland language. This week, though, regional governments have banded together to use ASEAN’s principles to justify a startling act: blocking Cambodian opposition politicians who are trying to return home to confront Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, Asia’s longest-serving authoritarian leader. On Wednesday night, Mu Sochua, the deputy leader of a political party that came closest to unseating Mr. Hun Sen in earlier elections, was detained at the airport after arriving in Malaysia, according to Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. A dual citizen, Ms. Mu Sochua tried to enter Malaysia on her American passport, said Mr. Robertson, who was in touch with Ms. Mu Sochua during her travels. She was held overnight in detention at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, he said. By Thursday evening, immigration paperwork was being processed to allow her to enter the country for five days, said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian legislator and chairman of the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, who was also in communication with Ms. Mu Sochua. The development came as members of the Cambodian opposition had hoped to converge on Phnom Penh, the capital, on Saturday, the anniversary of Cambodia’s independence from France. Mr. Hun Sen has said he will do everything possible to prevent the opposition from returning. Ms. Mu Sochua is the deputy leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved in 2017 after its leader was jailed and accused of conspiring with the United States to overthrow Mr. Hun Sen. The prime minister’s governing party won every parliamentary seat on offer in elections last year that were widely regarded as rigged, with the government having prevented Ms. Mu Sochua’s party from participating. Also on Wednesday, after Sam Rainsy, a co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, tweeted a picture of his plane ticket from Paris to Bangkok, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand made it clear that Mr. Sam Rainsy would not be able to follow his plan to land in Thailand and make his way from there to neighboring Cambodia. “Regarding the political activist from the neighboring country requesting to enter Thailand, I have proceeded by following the ASEAN resolution that we will not interfere with each other’s domestic affairs,” Mr. Prayuth said. “I have given the order. He won’t be able to enter.” The government of Mr. Prayuth, a retired army general who led the 2014 coup that kept the country under military rule for nearly five years, had earlier prevented Ms. Mu Sochua from entering Thailand. Others turned away from Thailand include Joshua Wong, the Hong Kong democracy activist. “We will not allow any resistance group to operate in Thai territory,” Mr. Prayuth said on Wednesday. But human rights advocates say that ASEAN’s neighborliness should not be used to justify strong-arm politics. Mr. Hun Sen’s government has jailed scores of dissenters and forced the exile of many more. On Thursday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia referred to Cambodia, saying that “we aren’t interested in the internal affairs of any country.” “The ASEAN spirit,” said Mr. Robertson, of Human Rights Watch, “should not be a mutual celebration in violating human rights.” On Thursday, Mr. Hun Sen noted with approval Ms. Mu Sochua’s initial detention in Malaysia. “They have cooperation with Cambodia in the ASEAN framework,” he said. Mr. Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia for 34 years, said that his long hold on power had not come up at the ASEAN summit in Bangkok earlier this week. “In the ASEAN meeting, no one talked about any issues related to Cambodia because it is the internal affairs of Cambodia,” he said. On Wednesday, the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to embassies and consular missions accredited in the country, warning them that the Cambodian passports of 12 opposition politicians, including Ms. Mu Sochua, had been declared “null and void.”  Ms. Mu Sochua, who was visiting the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, gave a news conference on Wednesday on the opposition’s plans. The Cambodian ambassador to Indonesia tried to stop the event from proceeding and told a journalist to “shut up.” The news conference went ahead, and Ms. Mu Sochua flew to Malaysia in the evening.  The Cambodian Embassy in Indonesia on Wednesday released a statement urging ASEAN’s biggest member to take seriously an arrest warrant issued last month for Ms. Mu Sochua on charges including plotting to topple the government. “The embassy of Cambodia in Jakarta requests Indonesian authorities to arrest Mu Sochua and deport her to Cambodia immediately in the true spirit of ASEAN,” the statement said. “It is unfortunate that Indonesia, a fellow member state of ASEAN, allows Ms. Mu Sochua to enter Indonesia despite her arrest warrant and conduct anti-Cambodian activities in Jakarta.” But human rights groups say the accusations against her are trumped up. “The charges against her are political, rather than criminal or legal,” said Jerald Joseph, the commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia. “She should be allowed to enter the country.” How Ms. Mu Sochua will get to Cambodia is not clear. Mr. Hun Sen has ordered airlines flying into the country to stop her and other opposition leaders. Soldiers and police have been dispatched to land borders and checkpoints. “There seems to be a conspiracy within ASEAN to bend over backward to support an unpopular dictatorship in Cambodia,” said Mr. Santiago, the Malaysian legislator. “This is happening because some of the ASEAN countries have also denied a legitimate opposition from functioning in their own countries. “ASEAN talks all the time about noninterference in other countries’ affairs,” he added. “But in working together to muzzle the opposition they seem to interfere very well.” On Thursday, Mr. Sam Rainsy tweeted that he was still planning to fly to Bangkok from Paris despite the Thai prohibition on him coming there. Hours later, Mr. Sam Rainsy said he had been prevented from checking in for his flight. Nevertheless, he said, he was still committed to returning to Cambodia.  Sun Narin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.']","In denying Cambodian opposition politicians entry into their countries, some ASEAN governments please a leader who has had a 34-year grip on power."
Police Officer Is Charged With Murder of British Soccer Player,2019-11-07,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — A police officer has been charged with the murder of a former Premier League soccer player who died in 2016 after being shot by a Taser gun during a confrontation outside his father’s home in western England, prosecutors said on Thursday.  Officers from the West Mercia Police, the regional force, had tried to subdue the former player, Dalian Atkinson, 48, with the Taser, which delivers an electrical charge and is intended to be less harmful than ordinary firearms. Mr. Atkinson was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said it was unusual for an officer to be charged with murder for an action taken while carrying out duties on the job. The case is even more unusual because of the involvement of the Taser, which is used precisely because it is less likely to cause loss of life.  Tasers are not listed by the British government as lethal weapons, and they are excluded from the annual figures documenting the use of firearms by the police. A second police officer was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Neither of the officers was named, because their lawyers intend to apply for anonymity on their behalf, prosecutors said. The defendants were set to appear at a court in Birmingham, England, on Thursday. On Aug. 15, 2016, officers were called to a property in Telford, England, at about 1:30 a.m. Mr. Atkinson had apparently gone to the area to visit his father, Ernest Atkinson. After the two officers arrived, one of them discharged a Taser “whilst in contact with Mr. Atkinson outside the property,” according to a statement on the day of the episode, from the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigated the death. More officers arrived, and an ambulance was called, the statement added. Mr. Atkinson was treated on the scene before being taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the statement said. Just over two years later, the Independent Office for Police Conduct referred a file of evidence against two police officers to prosecutors.  The Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday that the officer charged with murder had also been charged with an alternative, lesser offense — “unlawful act manslaughter” — that the jury can consider if it determines that there is insufficient evidence for the murder charge. Inquest, a charity that provides expertise in state-related deaths, said in a statement on Thursday that “no police officer involved in a death in custody or following police contact has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter” since 1990.  Mr. Atkinson, a star of English soccer in the 1980s and 1990s, played for Ipswich Town, Sheffield Wednesday and, perhaps most notably, Aston Villa in the English Premier League. He spent four of the most productive years of his career at Aston Villa, earning a reputation as an inventive and intelligent forward.  He spent the later years of his career playing in Turkey, France and South Korea, before retiring from professional soccer in 2001 at the age of 33.  He struggled with health problems after his career finished, most notably a kidney complaint for which he was receiving treatment in the time leading up to his death.  Rory Smith contributed reporting from Manchester.

Jordan Stabbing Attack Leaves 8 Wounded at Roman Site,2019-11-06,By Rana F. Sweis and Elian Peltier,"['AMMAN, Jordan — An assailant stabbed eight people at the popular archaeological site of Jerash in northern Jordan on Wednesday, according to the authorities, who said the man had been arrested. The motive for the attack remained unclear. Four foreign tourists and four Jordanians — a tour guide, a truck driver, and two police officers, one of whom tried to stop the attack — were wounded and taken to a hospital, a spokesman for the Jordanian police said. Three of the foreign victims were Mexican, the police said, and the other Swiss. One of the police officers and the Swiss tourist were in serious condition, while the others were in stable condition, the police said. In a video from the scene that was shared on social media, a woman could be seen lying facedown on the ground as someone pressed a towel against her lower back. Another man sat nearby, his leg and shirt covered with blood. Jerash contains one of the best-preserved provincial cities of the Roman Empire, much of which still has not been excavated, lying beneath the homes, streets and shops of the modern city, which has 200,000 inhabitants. It is one of the country’s main tourist attractions, along with the archaeological site of Petra. About 50,000 people live in Jerash, which lies about 20 miles north of the capital, Amman. For several years, Jerash struggled to attract visitors, suffering from its proximity to Syria, where civil war has driven more than a million people into Jordan.

Russia Raided a Physics Institute. Kremlin Watchers Are Mystified.,2019-11-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — The Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow helped the Soviet Union detonate its first nuclear bomb, figured out how to build a hydrogen bomb and has stood for decades in the vanguard of Russian scientific achievement. Seven of its scientists have won Nobel Prizes. So it came as a shock last week when, shortly before celebrations to mark the 85th anniversary of the illustrious institute’s founding, its halls were suddenly swarming with security officers wearing masks and armed with automatic weapons. They searched the office of the institute’s director, Nikolai N. Kolachevsky, and questioned him for six hours about a supposed plot to export military-use glass windows. He later denounced the raid as a “masked show,” a phrase Russians use to describe increasingly over-the-top interventions by law enforcement agencies. The operation set off another round of what in recent months has become a favorite, if depressing, parlor game for Russia’s intelligentsia: trying to figure out why “siloviki,” or “people of force” — security, intelligence and military officials — have been acting so strangely and in ways at odds with the stated policy goals of President Vladimir V. Putin. It also provided a grim example of why, despite its scientific prowess, Russia has had such trouble diversifying its economy beyond just pulling oil, gas and other resources out of the ground. Mr. Putin has for years called on scientists to look beyond their books and laboratories, and use their world-class talents to help build a modern economy. But those who try to do so run a serious risk of getting raided by masked men with guns. Cases tend to drag on for months or years, leaving the careers and nerves of suspects shredded, even if they are eventually exonerated. That happened to Dmitri Trubitsyn, a former physicist who was arrested in 2017 in connection with a successful high-tech company he had set up in Siberia with fellow scientists. The case was finally closed more than a year later because of a lack of evidence to support accusations that he was running a criminal conspiracy to deceive regulators. Meeting with security force commanders on Wednesday in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin praised the Federal Security Service — known as the F.S.B., the successor to the domestic arm of the Soviet-era K.G.B. — for its growing role in “Russia’s integrated security,” while conceding that law enforcement agencies needed to work on “strengthening public confidence in them.” When they descended on the Lebedev Physics Institute last week, the security services carried out simultaneous raids on scientists and their family members. The main target of their investigation seems to have been Olga Kanorskaya, the daughter of a Lebedev scientist and the owner of a private company that, from an office she rented at the institute, built up a small business selling precision glassware. The intimidating scale of the investigation, with dozens of armed officers mobilized for the raids, “is brazen, stupid and very frightening,” Ms. Kanorskaya, 36, said in an interview. Security officers stormed her apartment just as she was sitting down for her morning coffee, while another team searched her parents’ apartment. They rifled through her possessions in search of evidence to prove an accusation that she says is “totally fictitious” — that she tried to export pieces of glass with potential military applications to Germany, a crime that carries a sentence of seven to 20 years in prison. She was taken in for questioning by police investigators and an F.S.B. officer. No matter what the eventual outcome of the investigation, the Lebedev institute’s scientific council complained in a tart statement that last week’s raids had “delivered colossal reputational damage with law enforcement organs discrediting themselves in the eyes of the scientific community.” Noting that the Kremlin had announced a special program last year to make scientific research more attractive and rewarding, particularly for young talent that might otherwise emigrate, the council added that the actions of Russia’s security forces “are impossible to imagine in a civilized country in which law enforcement agencies concern themselves with real, not invented, problems.” As with other recent examples of an increasingly aggressive and erratic security apparatus — the planting of drugs on an investigative journalist, the jailing of pacifist religious believers as “extremists” and other risibly fanciful cases — the physics institute saga has generated a swarm of theories to try to explain what is going on. One popular explanation is that the case is related to coming elections at the Russian Academy of Sciences and a bitter rivalry between the Lebedev Physics Institute and the Kurchatov Institute, a nuclear research center. Kurchatov is headed by Mikhail V. Kovalchuk, whose brother, Yuri V. Kovalchuk, is a banker in St. Petersburg and an old friend and crony of Mr. Putin. Mikhail Kovalchuk and the Lebedev Institute director, Mr. Kolachevsky, are both candidates in the Academy of Sciences elections. The two scientists have also clashed in the past over plans by the Kurchatov Institute to commercialize its nuclear projects. Referring to the elections in a message sent to fellow physicists after the raid on his office, Mr. Kolachevsky said, “I did not want to link these two events — but the scientific community itself has already come to a conclusion.” Another theory is that the F.S.B. simply needed a defense-related smuggling case to put in its annual report before the end of the year. Yet another is that a Russian business rival, jealous of foreign sales by Ms. Kanorskaya’s company, bribed the security services to knock out its competitor. The case against Mr. Trubitsyn in Siberia is widely believed to have begun with bribery by a commercial rival. Ms. Kanorskaya is not sure what prompted her travails. “All I know for certain,” she said, “is that the case is totally fabricated and made-to-order.” The case centers on the activities of Trioptics, a company Ms. Kanorskaya set up in 2016 in partnership with a subsidiary of Rusnano, a state-owned venture that promotes the development of high-tech enterprises. Ms. Kanorskaya later split from the state-funded company, buying out its 35 percent share in Trioptics and moving in 2018 into office space rented from the Lebedev Institute, where her father works. “There is nothing secret or sensitive in what we do,” she said, explaining that her business involved buying specialty glass from China, processing it in Moscow, and then selling it for use in meteorological stations and other precision equipment, often to foreign clients. All her company did to the Chinese-made glass at the center of the investigation, she said, was add an antireflection coating to meet the specifications of a customer in Germany. She exported four pieces of the same glass, worth around $15,000, to the same company in Bavaria in the summer last year without any problem. But when she tried later in the year to send two more pieces to the same customer, her shipper in Moscow suggested that she get a permit from a government agency that monitors exports to make sure they do not have military uses. After providing an expert’s certification that the glass was of a type with no military applications, she received the necessary permit and everything seemed in order. Then the F.S.B. got involved. In February, the security service’s department for economic crimes sent a letter to the customs service saying that it had “received information” that Ms. Kanorskaya’s company was breaking the law by trying to export controlled items. The Investigative Committee, Russia’s version of the F.B.I., opened a criminal case. For the moment, neither Ms. Kanorskaya; her father, Sergei; nor Mr. Kolachevsky, the director of the Lebedev institute, has been formally charged. An informal association of Russian academics and scientists called the July 1 Club denounced the case as a “masquerade” and prominent intellectuals weighed in on social media with exasperated messages assailing the security services.  Mr. Kolachevsky, in his statement to fellow scientists, noted that the raid on his institute was the first time that a research center connected with so many renowned scientists had been “turned upside down by the ‘polite people,’ ” — Russian slang for security service thugs. He said he had counted 30 officers from three different agencies, supported by “masked machine gunners.” He added that the operation could be the result of a “tip-off or some kind of fantastical foolishness and lack of coordination in the work of the siloviki.” Whatever the reason, he said, “there is nothing especially surprising here. Everything fits into the ‘witch hunt’ script that has been gaining momentum with every year.” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting']",The armed operation targeting scientists in Moscow prompted outrage and questions about over-the-top actions by the country’s increasingly aggressive security forces.
‘Extremely Evil Misconduct’: Thailand’s Palace Intrigue Spills Into View,2019-11-06,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — The denunciations have swirled through Thailand’s gilded palaces with the rhetorical extravagance of a Shakespearean history. The official consort to the king was accused of trying to upstage the queen and “undermining the nation,” leading to the stripping of her royal titles after less than three months on the job. A grand chamberlain was removed for “severely immoral acts” that allegedly included forcing a paramour to undergo an abortion. And last week, four more courtiers, two of whom were described as bedchamber pages, were removed for “extremely evil misconduct.” [Read: The Thai palace posted dozens of unusual photos of the King’s consort. Then the website went down.] Nearly half a year ago, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun was crowned in a lavish spectacle culminating in the placement of a 16-pound crown on his head. Since then the 67-year-old king has assembled a court whose intrigue frequently spills onto the pages of the Royal Thai Government Gazette, which normally records more anodyne matters. The explosive details of the palace purges stand in contrast to the reserved tenor of the seven-decade reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, his father. At the time of his death in 2016, King Bhumibol was the world’s longest-serving royal. He did not leave Thailand for decades, and he was often pictured in rice paddies or factories with his subjects. King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends much of his time in Germany and has not continued the tradition of communing with ordinary Thais, at least in photos that have been made public. The king has taken high-profile steps that appear to have bolstered his authority. Last year, he assumed oversight over the Crown Property Bureau, whose fortune, believed to be upward of $30 billion, helps make him one of the world’s wealthiest royals. In February, he quashed the political candidacy of his elder sister, Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Varnavadi, calling her attempt to run for prime minister “highly inappropriate.” Last month, he ordered two infantry units in Bangkok, the capital, moved from normal military command to that of his royal corps. “This direct taking of control is something that we haven’t seen since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932,” said Tamara Loos, the chair of the history department at Cornell University and an expert on Thai monarchic traditions. “It’s a slide toward something that is very different from his father’s behind-the-scenes way of operating.” The recent announcement that four palace insiders were being stripped of their royal and military titles capped a tumultuous week, which began when the king’s official companion was publicly purged. On Oct. 21, an announcement in the Royal Thai Government Gazette stated that Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi had been divested of her title of noble consort. She was accused of “ingratitude” and of scheming against Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, the king’s fourth wife. Ms. Sineenat’s actions “caused the royal household staff to be discordant,” the official statement said. A nursing college graduate, Ms. Sineenat had enjoyed her official position, which is separate from that of wife, for only a matter of weeks. The title of noble consort had not been used since Thailand abolished absolute monarchy and polygamy more than eight decades ago. Two days after Ms. Sineenat was stripped of her title, several other courtiers, including a senior representative of the king in many ceremonies, a nurse and a veterinarian from the royal canine division were dismissed for what was termed “severely evil misconduct using their government positions to seek benefits for themselves.” Similar phrasing was used last week to describe the purported misdeeds of four others. Two of the courtiers were accused of adultery, which was deemed “an offense of the principles of the royal household staff.” “You wouldn’t imagine that this is the language of a government gazette,” Ms. Loos said. “It’s more like a tabloid.” The king, who is known in some official pronouncements as “the sacred lord over all heads,” has been married four times. His first wife, who is also his first cousin, retained the title of princess even after their divorce in 1991. They had one daughter. His second wife, with whom he had five children while still married to his first wife, was an actress. She and their four sons live overseas, but their daughter, Sirivannavari Nariratana, carries out royal duties in Thailand. A fashion designer, Princess Sirivannavari made headlines last year after a Thai entertainment host who panned a gown she had designed was threatened with criminal prosecution. Thailand has strict laws against criticism of the royal family. Offenders can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison for each count of lèse-majesté. Because complaints can be lodged by anyone, not only the police, human rights groups say the law, meant to protect the monarchy, has been twisted to suppress political dissent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, multiple academics and political commentators in Thailand declined to comment on the slew of firings recorded in the Royal Thai Government Gazette. The king’s third wife, Srirasmi Suwadee, was considered a princess until she and at least nine of her relatives were purged five years ago, after the palace alleged that they had used their royal connections to illegally burnish their wealth. Ms. Srirasmi’s parents were jailed for lèse-majesté. The pair had one son, Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, who is considered the heir apparent to the throne. The king’s marriage to his fourth wife, Queen Suthida, a former flight attendant, was made public in May, three days before he was crowned. It was on the king’s birthday this year, July 28, that he named Ms. Sineenat his noble consort. The Royal Household Bureau later released pictures of the two together, including images of Ms. Sineenat flying a plane while wearing a camouflage-printed sports bra and another of her cradling a white poodle, which was wearing what appeared to be a black leather onesie. The king has owned a number of pet poodles, one of which was granted the military rank of air chief marshal. Several women associated with the king have also attained high military positions. Queen Suthida was named a general in the king’s bodyguard corps, while Ms. Sineenat was a major general before her downfall. Ryn Jirenuwat contributed reporting.

U.K. Police Identify All 39 People Found Dead in Truck,2019-11-07,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — All 39 people who were discovered dead in a refrigerated trailer in southeast England last month have been identified, the police said on Thursday. The authorities did not reveal the names of the eight women and 31 men whose bodies were found in a trailer in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, on Oct. 23. But the families of the victims were notified, according to a statement from the Essex Police.  The police confirmed that all the victims — who were believed to have been transported to England through a global human-trafficking network — were from Vietnam. Although Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police, the senior police officer in charge of the investigation into the deaths, described the identifications as an “important step” in the inquiry, some Vietnamese families whose missing relatives fell silent two weeks ago did not wait for formal identification before beginning to grieve.  The Vietnamese Embassy in London also released a statement on Thursday expressing “deep sorrow” over the deaths.  Essex Police said further updates on the case of the 39 deaths would be given in due course. But, Mr. Smith’s statement said, “It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.”  The British and Vietnamese authorities have worked closely together to piece together why the 39 people died and how they had traveled from Vietnam to Grays, a town 25 miles east of London.  The police in Vietnam detained eight people on Monday, adding to an increasing tally of arrests in connection with the case.  In Britain, the driver of the truck, Maurice Robinson, 25, of Northern Ireland, was arrested last month and charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, in addition to conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.   Another truck driver from Northern Ireland, Eamon Harrison, 22, was arrested last week and also charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses.  Two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, are also wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking in connection with the case, and the police have appealed to the pair to hand themselves in and assist the authorities with the investigation.  When the 39 bodies were discovered, the case caused shock waves around the world, but there are signs that it has not deterred other human-trafficking and smuggling efforts. In Belgium, 11 men from Syria and one from Sudan were found alive last month by the police in the refrigerated trailer of a truck, and 41 men and boys were discovered by the Greek police in a similar situation during a routine highway check on Monday.

Captives or Defectors? Taliban Fighters Tell Conflicting Tales,2019-11-07,By David Zucchino,"['FAIZABAD, Afghanistan — They paced aimlessly inside a guarded compound, stepping over their beard and hair clippings on the ground. Ninety-eight Taliban in all — fighters as young as 16 and as old as one white-bearded veteran of 65. They had all laid down their weapons and pledged loyalty to the Afghan government. But the reasons for that depended on who was telling the tale — and illuminated some of the complexity of a war in which side-switching is common.  The Afghan military says these Taliban fighters quit to try to save their lives after Afghan forces retook three districts from the Taliban during desperate, pitched battles in the northeastern province of Badakhshan in September.   The fighters had been told by the head of the national intelligence agency in the province that they were free to return to civilian life if they renounced the Taliban. But in the compound’s courtyard, some fighters said they had already been planning to do just that before they were taken into custody. Some told of conspiring with friends and relatives from the government to abandon the Taliban even as the battles for the districts were raging.  Others said they had been given no choice but to surrender at gunpoint, then submitted to having their typical Taliban style — long hair and beards — trimmed back by a barber.  But they were not speaking freely. They related their stories to visiting New York Times journalists in the presence of a glowering officer from the National Directorate of Security, who often interrupted to correct or admonish them for speaking too frankly. The courtyard spectacle had all the trappings of a practiced performance, with the fighters politely agreeing with the intelligence officer. But whenever he stepped away, they offered more candid assessments.  Particularly in remote places like Badakhshan, where the central government in Kabul is a distant idea, switching sides between the Taliban, other insurgent groups, and the security forces is a frequent event. Old local rivalries keep playing out across new allegiances. Lapis lazuli and gold mines, coupled with drug-smuggling, add to the complexity. Several of the men spoke of reluctantly joining the Taliban only after their districts were seized by the militants up to four years ago. They shared a common resentment: the foreign jihadists — from Pakistan, China, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — who commandeered their homes and demanded food. Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hanif Nuristani, the government intelligence commander in Badakhshan, said there were at least 400 foreign fighters in the province who had joined the Taliban, Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. “They didn’t speak our language, but we shared our food,” said Sultan Mohammad, 46, who said he commanded 15 Taliban fighters. “We had no choice, and to protect our families, we supported them.” Mr. Mohammad, who said he was a teacher who supported the government before the Taliban takeover, said he had been in touch by telephone with local government leaders before and during the battles in September.  Asked whether he and his men had surrendered or had been captured, Mr. Mohammed replied, “We weren’t captured. We support the government, inshallah.” Nizamuddin, 19, who goes by one name, said he had eagerly joined the Taliban this year because he was intrigued by what he called “their ideology.” But when the Afghan military attacked, he said, his older brother — a government intelligence officer — telephoned and persuaded him to defect. He said he switched sides because of the foreign jihadists, whose presence he said drew American airstrikes. “We didn’t want them in our homeland but we had no choice,” he said. The intelligence officer, a stocky man in a shiny blue suit who declined to give his name, said the government had provided food, showers and living space for the fighters. At their request, he provided a barber to trim their long hair and wild beards, he said. “We want to look like the government people,” one fighter announced, and his companions laughed uproariously. The intelligence officer said the fighters, who were allowed to keep their cellphones to reach family members, would be permitted to return home soon. He said they were free to leave the compound, but it was surrounded by armed intelligence agency soldiers who blocked the front entrance. The fighters had been taken recently to attend a ceremony in Faizabad, the provincial capital, with the government’s national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib. In a Twitter post, Mr. Mohib said the men had renounced violence. He praised them for “choosing the right way” and “endorsing” the government’s legitimacy. Abdullah Naji Nazari, a member of the provincial council, said the fighters “didn’t like the Taliban anymore” and now trusted government forces to help them secure their villages. General Nuristani said the fighters had provided valuable intelligence. “Perhaps we’ll send them back as spies for us,” he said. In the courtyard, Mohammad Hassan, a wiry little man who thought he was about 65 years old, said he had fired rocket-propelled grenades at Soviet soldiers in the 1980s and at government troops this year while fighting for the Taliban. Now, he said, he was perfectly willing to fire the same weapon at his former Taliban comrades, if only the government would arm him. He had been a farmer before joining the Taliban, he said, but now he wanted nothing more than to fight. “Some people like gardening or parrots,” he said, grinning. “I like to fight.” His comrades doubled over in laughter. One of them slapped the old man on the back. “I’m addicted to war,” Mr. Hassan continued. “My nickname is Hassan Rocket!” There was more laughter, even from the weapons-toting intelligence agency guards. The spectacle inside the courtyard soon drew to a close, with the intelligence officer signaling that it was time to wrap up. The visitors withdrew. The fighters, some who seemed to have surrendered and some who perhaps had defected, resumed pacing the compound. One of the guards watched them warily. “Every one of them is dangerous,” he said. “We don’t trust a single one.” Najim Rahim contributed reporting.']",The simple idea of insurgency versus government proves much more complex when dozens of detained fighters tell their stories in a remote corner of Afghanistan. 
Mining Company Blamed ‘Bandits or Terrorists’ for Prior Attacks,2019-11-07,By Ian Austen,"['A Canadian mining company that employed workers who were fatally ambushed Wednesday in the West African nation of Burkina Faso offered no explanation on Thursday for the attack or the possible motives of the killers.  But in a securities filing made this week in Canada, the Montreal-based company, Semafo, characterized two attacks on its workers in Burkina Faso last year “as part of an increase in similar incidents carried out by bandits or terrorists.”  The company added that “there is no reason to believe that our employees or operations are targeted.” At least thirty-seven people died in the Wednesday attack, one of the deadliest episodes of violence that has convulsed the landlocked nation. It took place when five buses escorted by Burkina Faso’s military were traveling to Semafo’s Boungou mine, an open-pit gold mine in the eastern part of the country, about 25 miles away. Following last year’s two convoy attacks, Semafo began flying foreign workers and contractors by helicopter to its two mines in Burkina Faso. Local employees, however, continued to be moved in buses although the company said that it had augmented their security. W. Cory Wanless, a Toronto lawyer representing a group of Guatemalan women who say they were gang-raped by security forces retained by another Canadian mining company, called Semafo’s action a double-standard for employee security, which may now expose it to litigation in Canada. “It is highly distressing that Semafo made the decision to protect its expat workers by flying them to its mines precisely because of past attacks on ground convoys, and yet continues to rely on exposed ground convoys for its local workers,” Mr. Wanless said. “To me, this reeks of a Canadian company valuing the lives of Canadian and other Western expats over the lives of Africans.” Semafo did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement issued on Thursday, Semafo said that it was suspending production at the mine that was the convoy’s destination “out of respect to the victims and those impacted and to ensure the highest levels of operational safety.”']","Employees of the mining company, Semafo, have suffered three attacks in Burkina Faso in 15 months, including one on Wednesday that left at least 37 dead."
"90 Minutes a Day, Until 10 P.M.: China Sets Rules for Young Gamers",2019-11-06,By Javier C. Hernández and Albee Zhang,"['BEIJING — No playing video games after 10 p.m. No more than 90 minutes of gaming on weekdays. Want add-ons like virtual weapons and costumes? Keep it to $57 a month. The Chinese government has released new rules aimed at curbing video game addiction among young people, a problem that top officials believe is to blame for a rise in nearsightedness and poor academic performance across a broad swath of society. The regulations, announced by the National Press and Publication Administration on Tuesday, ban users younger than 18 from playing games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. They are not permitted to play more than 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays. The limits are the government’s latest attempt to rein in China’s online gaming industry, one of the world’s largest, which generates more than $33 billion in annual revenue and draws hundreds of millions of users. Under President Xi Jinping, officials in China have taken a more forceful approach in regulating large technology companies and pushing them to help spread cultural values advanced by the ruling Communist Party. Video games have become a popular target. The state-run media has likened some games to “poison,” and the government has blocked sales of some titles on the grounds that they are too violent. Mr. Xi spoke publicly last year about the scourge of poor eyesight among children, putting more pressure on officials to act. The National Press and Publication Administration said that minors would be required to use real names and identification numbers when they logged on to play. The rules also limit how much young people can spend on purchases made through apps, like virtual weapons, clothes and pets. Those purchases are now capped at $28 to $57 a month, depending on age. Chinese officials said the regulations were meant to combat addiction. “These problems affect the physical and mental health of minors, as well as their normal learning and living,” the National Press and Publication Administration said in a statement that was published by Xinhua, the official news agency. Analysts said the regulations had been largely anticipated by the industry and were unlikely to hurt revenue. Many of the biggest technology companies, including Tencent and Netease, have already imposed limits on younger users. Young gamers are also likely to find ways around the regulations, such as using a parent’s phone and identification number. “There are always going to be loopholes,” said Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at Niko Partners, a research and consulting firm. But Mr. Ahmad added that China was now one of the most heavily regulated video game markets in the world, and that technology companies in the country and abroad would be forced to follow the government’s policy announcements more closely. “I think compared to the West, it’s very extreme,” he said. “Publishers and developers need to be very aware of the content of the games they are developing for the market.” In a sign of the growing global importance of the Chinese gaming market, Activision Blizzard, an American company, recently suspended an e-sports player who had voiced support for antigovernment demonstrations in Hong Kong during a live broadcast, a move that was seen as a concession to Beijing. The rules were greeted skeptically by some parents and gamers. Yang Bingben, 35, the owner of an industrial technology firm in eastern China, said he worried that many children would still find ways to play video games. For example, he noted that his 7-year-old son often played games that did not require an internet connection and were difficult to regulate. “We have to develop new things to replace games,” he said. “Our minds should be focused on building more stadiums, football courts and basketball courts.” Wang Yiwei contributed research.']","Officials say regulations are meant to curb video game addiction, which they blame for a rise in nearsightedness and poor academic performance."
What We Know About the Killing of 9 Mormon Family Members in Mexico,2019-11-05,By Kelly Virella,"['At least nine members of a Mormon family that has in the past spoken up against Mexican drug cartels were killed on Monday when their vehicles were ambushed by gunmen in a violent region of northern Mexico, family members said.  The victims included six children and their mothers. One of the vehicles caught fire, burning the bodies of one mother and her four children beyond recognition. Eight children survived the attack, although six of them were injured, one of them critically, according to David Langford, a relative of the victims. Family members said that one of the surviving children was shot in the back. One of the women was shot in the chest at point-blank range, said Julian LeBarón, a cousin of some of the victims.  Some of the children hid by the roadside to escape, Mr. LeBarón said. Family members said that the surviving children included a 7-month-old infant and a child about 12 years old who hiked for miles to seek help.   Initial accounts of the violence came from the family of the victims. As Mexican officials tried to determine how it unfolded, details of the attack remained murky on Tuesday.  Here’s what we know so far. The nine victims were members of the LeBarón family, a group of dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived in a fundamentalist Mormon community in the border region since the 1940s.  Much of the LeBarón family now lives in North Dakota, where they work in the oil fields and run businesses, but they frequently travel to the border area for holidays, vacations and other special events, said Kenny LeBarón, a cousin of the three slain women.  David Langford, the brother of one of the victims, said the three women who died were his sister Christina Langford; Dawna Langford and Rhonita LeBarón.  The family is not affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the mainstream church with 16 million adherents that is headquartered in Utah. When the LeBaróns first arrived in Mexico, they practiced polygamy, but that has now largely faded from the community, the family says. The Church of Latter-day Saints prohibits the practice. It has also abandoned the name Mormon, while the LeBaróns continue to use it. The family was traveling in three separate vehicles from La Mora, in the state of Sonora, to Colonia LeBarón, in the state of Chihuahua, when they were set upon by gunmen.  One of the victims, Rhonita LeBarón, was headed to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s anniversary. Her car broke down, Julian LeBarón said, and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car.” She was killed, along with her four children, he said: an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and twins who were less than a year old. About eight miles ahead, the two other cars were also attacked, and the two other women were killed, he said. A 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were also killed, he said. No suspects have been named, but Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s security minister, said Tuesday that “there were serious advances in the investigation.” The family suspects that the gunmen were members of an organized crime group. The Sinaloa Cartel, which was once led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, is active in the area; so are other groups trying to take control. The massacre came a decade after two members of the LeBarón family who confronted local drug cartels were kidnapped and murdered. But things had been peaceful in recent years and there seemed to be a sort of truce, said Ruth Wariner, Rhonita LeBarón’s aunt. It’s unclear whether the attackers intentionally targeted the family on Tuesday or whether it was a case of mistaken identity. [Update: In Mormon family’s 12 hours of terror in Mexico, a message emerges: No one is safe.] Julian LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel. Ms. Wariner said she suspected that drug traffickers had mistaken the women’s caravan of  sport utility vehicles as being from a rival trafficking group. Mr. Durazo offered the same theory on Tuesday. Mexico deployed its newly formed National Guard and its military to the region. President Trump offered to help Mexico eradicate its drug cartels. “This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,” he said on Twitter. “We merely await a call from your great new president!”  He added, “The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said that it was up to Mexico to deal with the matter. “We appreciate and thank very much President Trump and any foreign government that wants to help, but in these cases we have to act with independence, according to our Constitution and our tradition of independence and sovereignty,” he said. Large Mexican criminal groups have launched a string of violent attacks in recent weeks. Fourteen police officers were killed in an ambush last month in the state of Michoacán and, days later, cartel gunmen laid siege to the city of Culiacán, in Sinaloa State, forcing the government to release one of El Chapo’s sons, whom it had just arrested.']",The family has deep roots in Mexico and a history of speaking out about the criminal groups that plague their region.
"A Not-So-Special Relationship: Facing Voters, Johnson Backs Away From Trump",2019-11-06,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain spoke with President Trump by phone on Tuesday, and to judge by the dueling summaries of the call provided by the White House and 10 Downing Street, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Trump were involved in two completely different conversations. The White House said the two leaders pledged to negotiate “a robust bilateral free trade agreement once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.” Downing Street said nothing about a deal, noting instead that Mr. Johnson urged Mr. Trump to lift American tariffs on Scotch whisky. Such divergent accounts of a leader-to-leader call are not unheard-of, but the timing of this one, on the eve of Britain’s general election campaign, was telling. It shows just how much of a liability Mr. Trump has become for Mr. Johnson. Once, the prime minister talked up the benefits of having a close friend in the White House; now he is distancing himself from a figure who is radioactive to many Britons. Mr. Trump was only one of a multitude of headaches for Mr. Johnson on Wednesday, as he kicked off his campaign in an election that will serve as a referendum on his Brexit policy — and was already shaping up as one of the most unpredictable, and consequential, of the post-World War II era in Britain. While Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party leads the opposition Labour Party in the polls, the prime minister was hit by the resignation of one of his cabinet ministers in a legal scandal, accusations that his party doctored a TV interview with a Labour leader and questions about why his government was delaying a report on Russian influence in British politics until after the Dec. 12 vote. Trying to shrug off all the bad news, Mr. Johnson rallied supporters in the West Midlands with his message that only a vote for the Conservatives guarantees that Britain will leave the European Union. Elsewhere in the Midlands, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, drove home his counter-message: that Mr. Johnson would sell out Britain’s state health system to a predatory Mr. Trump in a trade deal. “We’ll never let Donald Trump get his hands on our National Health Service,” he thundered. Mr. Corbyn painted a dystopian picture of a Tory-led Britain that would mimic Mr. Trump’s America. “They’ll slash food standards to match the U.S.,” he said, referring darkly to rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice, “and they’ll put chlorinated chicken on our supermarket shelves.” Mr. Corbyn is hardly the first European politician to tap into anti-American sentiment to appeal to voters. But he has a rare opportunity with Mr. Trump, who has charted an unapologetically “America First” foreign policy and speaks effusively about his friendship with Mr. Johnson. What makes Mr. Trump so dangerous for Mr. Johnson is his unpredictability — and his penchant for butting in. He called in to a London radio show last week with unsolicited advice for Mr. Johnson’s campaign, and Mr. Trump is expected in London for a meeting of NATO leaders in early December, just a few days before Britons go to the polls.  “Corbyn is trying to ensure that anything Trump says will be bad for Johnson — and history suggests he’s not great at shutting up,” said Anand Menon, a professor of politics at King’s College in London. The Labour Party will do its best to surgically attach the two men over the next five weeks. On Tuesday, the party released a new advertisement showing Mr. Johnson in front of a blue bus emblazoned with a banner that said, “We’ll send Trump £500m a week. Let’s fund U.S. drug firms, not our N.H.S.” The ad was a spoof on the infamous pro-Brexit campaign during the 2016 referendum in which Mr. Johnson posed in front of a red bus with the slogan, “We send the E.U. £350 million week. Let’s fund our N.H.S. instead.” The £350 million claim was spurious, but it helped fuel a narrow Brexit victory. The £500 million claim, equivalent to nearly $650 million, is similarly dubious: It is hard to imagine any British government agreeing to a deal with the United States that would drive up prescription drug costs by that much. But in a country that reveres its National Health Service, for all its flaws, such appeals can resonate. Mr. Corbyn suffered his own setback Wednesday when the Labour Party’s deputy, Tom Watson, abruptly resigned and said he would not run for his seat in Parliament. A leader of the party’s dwindling centrist faction, Mr. Watson’s exit will enable Mr. Corbyn to cement control over the party. For Labour’s leftist leader, painting Mr. Trump as Mr. Johnson’s villainous friend is a reliable strategy in Britain, where demonstrators greeted the president during his last two visits with a giant balloon depicting him as a diaper-clad baby. “Generally speaking, foreign leaders don’t play a role in British elections,” said Timothy Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London. “But Donald Trump is so exceptional. We hear and see so much about him that he has almost become a presence in domestic British politics.” Public attitudes toward Mr. Trump have not softened during his presidency. In a poll of Briton’s attitudes toward foreign leaders by the research group YouGov, only 19 percent of those surveyed said they had a positive opinion of Mr. Trump; 67 percent said they had a negative opinion, and 13 percent were neutral. That places him behind George W. Bush and Pakistan’s president, Imran Khan, but ahead of President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Former President Barack Obama remains by far the most popular foreign leader, with 73 percent of people saying they had a positive opinion of him. As polarizing as Mr. Trump is, some skeptics said they doubted Labour would get much mileage out of making him an issue, given that voters ultimately decide based on things that matter to them personally. “I don’t know how successful Corbyn will be in associating Boris with Trump — or even how damaging it would be to the Conservatives,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. “Remember, Trump is still a good deal less unpopular in the U.K. than in other European countries, except perhaps Poland and Hungary.” In Israel, where Mr. Trump remains very popular, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed himself to the president during his campaign and fared poorly, and Mr. Trump has since shown less affection for his erstwhile friend. That fickleness was on display again last week, when he called in to a radio show hosted by the ardent pro-Brexit leader, Nigel Farage. Mr. Trump told him that the withdrawal deal Mr. Johnson negotiated with the European Union would preclude a trade agreement between Britain and the United States. That struck a discordant note, in that Mr. Johnson has promoted his Brexit policy by saying it would open the door to a lucrative deal with Washington. Last weekend, he felt compelled to say in an interview that Mr. Trump was “patently in error.” On that score, at least, the White House’s characterization of the Wednesday phone call could be seen as helping Mr. Johnson. It seemed to suggest that Mr. Trump was no longer troubled by his deal with Brussels and was looking forward to their future negotiations. The fact that Mr. Johnson’s aides chose to ignore that, and play up his demand that Mr. Trump drop tariffs on British exports suggests they are focused more on voters in Scotland, as well as England’s north, where the Conservatives are targeting Labour loyalists who voted to leave the European Union. Whether in the phone call or the Farage interview, Mr. Trump’s remarks have been tailor-made for Mr. Corbyn, who said recently that the president was interfering “to get his friend Boris Johnson elected.” The president’s comments did not sit well with Mr. Farage’s listeners either, who bombarded him with complaints that he should not have given Mr. Trump a platform. “You were crying about how the Americans should not interfere in British political decisions,” said a listener from Essex who identified himself as Jason, “and yet, here you are sitting with him on your show.” Several callers alluded to an episode in April 2016 when then-President Obama, on a visit to London, warned Britons that if they voted to leave the European Union, their country would be at the “back of the queue” for a trade deal with Washington. Mr. Obama’s remark, which came at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron, was widely judged to have backfired. “Obama broke with precedent and it’s now open season on leaders commenting on other countries,” Mr. Farage said to his aggrieved listeners. “And it’s just how it seems to work, right or wrong.”']","Unpopular and unpredictable, President Trump is emerging as a problem for the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, in his election campaign."
"A Wife of al-Baghdadi Is Captured by Turkey, Erdogan Says",2019-11-06,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL —\xa0Turkey has captured one of the wives of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the slain leader of the Islamic State movement, in addition to several other family members, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech on Wednesday. He also confirmed the capture of Mr. al-Baghdadi’s elder sister and brother-in-law in the town of Azaz, in a Turkish-controlled part of northern Syria, several days ago. The Turkish leader, speaking at the Islamic Studies Faculty of Ankara University, took a swipe at the fanfare with which President Trump announced the death of Mr. al-Baghdadi last month. Mr. Trump proclaimed Mr. al-Baghdadi’s demise in a nationally televised address, at a time when American forces were withdrawing from the area. “As you know, Baghdadi killed himself in the tunnel,” Mr. Erdogan said, describing how the Islamic State leader blew himself up along with two of his children when cornered by United States Special Operations forces in northwestern Syria.  “The U.S. with that initiated a serious communication campaign,” Mr. Erdogan said. “We, too, have captured Baghdadi’s wife. But we did not make a fuss about it. I am announcing it here for the first time. Likewise we have captured his sister and brother-in-law.” Mr. Erdogan did not disclose the wife’s name or give details of her capture.  Mr. al-Baghdadi was thought to have four wives, but it is unclear how many of them are alive. American officials have said that three women were killed in the raid in which the terrorist leader died on the night of Oct. 26; but it is unclear whether that included any of his wives. Mr. al-Baghdadi seems to have relied increasingly on close family members for his security as his self-proclaimed caliphate was defeated and his area of operations curtailed. Another of Mr. al-Baghdadi’s wives was arrested by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service earlier this year, and a courier was killed, according to a senior Iraqi official.  That operation ultimately helped Iraqi and American officials determine Mr. al-Baghdadi’s location in northwestern Syria and set in motion the plan that led to his death. When he announced that mission, Mr. Trump said that two of the Islamic State leader’s wives had been killed in the raid.  “There were two women — both wives, both wearing vests,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, in response to a question about whether one of Mr. al-Baghdadi’s wives had tried to detonate an explosive vest as commandos closed in. “They never detonated. But they were dead.”  On Wednesday, a senior State Department official said he could not confirm Turkish reports that Mr. al-Baghdadi’s wife, sister and other members of his family had been captured. He also said the State Department knew “almost nothing” about Mr. al-Baghdadi’s successor, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi. The official, who briefed journalists on the condition that he not be named, said that Mr. al-Qurayshi “appears to be a nobody” and that based on what little that is known about him, “we’re not impressed.” “If he is in Iraq or Syria, we don’t think he is too long for this world anyway,” the official said. He would not say whether Mr. al-Qurayshi had ever been detained by American forces, as Mr. al-Baghdadi was early in the Iraq war. Turkish officials have been keen to emphasize Turkey’s role in fighting terrorism and pursuing Islamic State members since Mr. al-Baghdadi’s death in a house a few miles from the Turkish border in an area where the Turkish armed forces operate. Officials published photographs of three people they identified as Mr. Baghdadi’s elder sister, Rasmiya Awad, 65, her husband and a daughter-in-law, and said they had been detained by Turkish security forces several days ago. The three were living along with five children in a trailer near the town of Azaz, officials said. “Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh,” Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency’s director of communications, said on Twitter, using another name for the Islamic State. “We have been leading in the fight against terrorism in all its forms.”  Turkey has captured 287 foreign Islamic State members in Syria, including children, since beginning its military operation in the country last month, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Monday. Other officials have said that 54 of those are Turkish citizens. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Lara Jakes from Washington.']",The Turkish president said his forces had detained several family members of the ISIS leader who died in a raid.
Zimbabwe’s Civil Servants in Unprecedented Strike for Better Wages,2019-11-06,By Jeffrey Moyo,"['HARARE, Zimbabwe — Civil servants stung by Zimbabwe’s galloping inflation staged a one-day strike on Wednesday in a demand for increased wages, saying that their earnings were disappearing under skyrocketing prices. Inflation in the southern African nation is running at about 300 percent, according to International Monetary Fund figures, and has prompted walkouts by doctors and nurses as well.  “We need increased salaries to be able to keep coming to work,” said Charles Mubwandarikwa, chairman of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, which joined the government workers’ strike in solidarity. Zimbabwean doctors, many of whom have been on strike for about two months, are demanding that their wages not only be increased, but that they be paid in American dollars as a hedge against inflation.  The government fired 77 of the striking doctors this week, out of 1,680 total, accusing them of failing to show up for a disciplinary hearing before the country’s Health Service Board. On Monday, nurses in local authority clinics in the capital, Harare, also walked off the job. The nurses said that they, too, were unable to work because of poor wages. The government appeared acutely aware of the mounting crisis. On Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the minister of information, said at a news conference that “medical services at most central hospitals” remained limited because “the public hospitals medical doctors’ strike has now gone beyond 63 days.” Over the past few months, the government has tried to appease workers by providing allowances to help meet the rising cost of living. But the measures were not enough to stop the board representing civil servants in Zimbabwe, the Apex Council, from calling Wednesday’s strike. “Government workers are earning an equivalent of $40 or less, and so we appeal to the government to pay us better,” said a member of the council, Takavarasha Zhou. The police had approved Wednesday’s strike, the first time a job action by government workers had been permitted. The authorities in general have taken a hard line against demonstrations: In August, with the backing of a court, the authorities banned demonstrations by members of opposition political parties and civil society organizations. The striking workers on Wednesday sang and danced as they gathered outside the offices of the Apex Council. They waved placards with protest slogans directed at the government. Some clashes erupted between strikers and police forces. The protesters had wanted to march to the offices of the Ministry of Finance, where they had intended to hand over a petition outlining their grievances. But heavily armed police officers blocked their movement. “It’s like police gave us the right to march with their right hand, but quickly snatched it away with their left hand,” said Cecilia Alexander, the president of the Apex Council. Since coming to power, President Emerson Mnangagwa’s government has resorted to force to quell dissent. In August 2018, after demonstrators in Zimbabwe’s capital called the country’s peaceful elections a sham and demanded the immediate release of the results in the July presidential poll, Mr. Mnangagwa’s government unleashed the army on protesters. At least six people were killed in the clashes. In January this year, Mr. Mnangagwa’s government again deployed the military when antigovernment protests broke out against a rise in fuel prices, leaving 17 people fatally shot in Harare and nearby towns. Mr. Mnangagwa’s government has struggled to sell its open-for-business mantra to the developed world. In October, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced sanctions against the minister of state security, Owen Ncube, for “a gross violation of human rights in Zimbabwe.” Even as Zimbabwe has tried to re-engage Washington, a diplomatic fallout between Zimbabwe and the United States has complicated matters.  The foreign affairs minister, Sibusiso Moyo, accused the United States ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian Nicholson, of acting like a member of the country’s opposition. Mr. Moyo this month threatened to cut off diplomatic ties after Mr. Nicholson apparently suggested that corruption was behind the country’s economic malaise.']",Government workers say their earnings are disappearing under skyrocketing inflation.
"Ukraine’s Zelensky Bowed to Trump’s Demands, Until Luck Spared Him",2019-11-07,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KIEV, Ukraine — It was early September, and Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, faced an agonizing choice: whether to capitulate to President Trump’s demands to publicly announce  investigations against his political enemies or to refuse, and lose desperately needed military aid. Only Mr. Trump could unlock the aid, he had been told by two United States senators, and time was running out. If the money, nearly $400 million, were not unblocked by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, it could be lost in its entirety. In a flurry of WhatsApp messages and meetings in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, over several days, senior aides debated the point. Avoiding partisan politics in the United States had always been the first rule of Ukrainian foreign policy, but the military aid was vital to the war against Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives since it began in 2014. By then, however, Mr. Zelensky’s staffers were already conceding to what seemed to be the inevitable, and making plans for a public announcement about the investigations. It was a fateful decision for a fledgling president elected on an anticorruption platform that included putting an end to politically motivated investigations. Elements of this internal Ukrainian debate have appeared in the Ukrainian news media and seeped into congressional testimony in the United States, as part of an impeachment inquiry undertaken after accusations surfaced of Mr. Trump’s demands.  But interviews in Kiev with government officials, lawmakers and others close to the Zelensky government have revealed new details of how high-level Ukrainian officials ultimately decided to acquiesce to President Trump’s request — and, by a stroke of luck, never had to follow through. Aides were arguing in favor of “bowing to what was demanded,” said Petro Burkovskiy, a senior fellow at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation who has close ties to the Ukrainian government. They were willing to do so, he said, despite the risk of losing bipartisan support in the United States by appearing to assist Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. “The cost was high.” As President Trump’s principal envoy to Ukraine, Gordon Sondland, admitted Tuesday in congressional testimony, the Trump administration had withheld the military aid to pressure Mr. Zelensky to make a public statement on the two investigations: one into whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had pressed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a natural gas company where his son served on the board; the other into unproven accusations that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election to promote the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. In the July 25 phone call that provoked a whistle-blower complaint and touched off the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Zelensky offered private assurances that his government would look into those matters.  But a public statement that raised doubts about Russian meddling and Mr. Biden, whom the president regarded as the greatest threat to his re-election, would be far more useful politically to Mr. Trump. Not only would it smear Mr. Biden, it could also appear to undermine the Mueller investigation into Russian electoral interference by pinning some blame on Ukraine. A tug-of-war ensued between a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, and another of Mr. Trump’s envoys to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, over the wording of the proposed public statement. Mr. Volker went so far as to draft a statement for Mr. Zelensky that mentioned both investigations. Mr. Yermak pushed back, suggesting language that mentioned investigations but in general terms, so as not to antagonize the Democrats. Late in the negotiations, the American diplomats consented to dropping mention of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Even as Mr. Yermak negotiated the wording in August, the stakes were clear. While rumors had been swirling for months about a possible hold on military aid, by early August high-level Ukrainian officials had confirmed the freeze. The trade soon became explicit. They were approached in September by Mr. Sondland, a major donor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration who had been appointed ambassador to the European Union despite having no diplomatic experience. At that point, he explained in blunt terms to Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Yermak, there was little chance the aid would be forthcoming until they made the public statement on the investigations. “I said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,” Mr. Sondland said in sworn testimony released Tuesday by the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry.   Mr. Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to speak on CNN, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, testified. But aides to Mr. Zelensky, on high alert to avoid any move that might irritate Mr. Trump, wondered if that was such a good idea, in that Mr. Trump habitually called CNN “fake news” in his Twitter posts. They also uncovered a post from Mr. Trump attacking Fox News as “not working for us anymore!”  Nearly all Mr. Zelensky’s top advisers favored his making the public statement, said one of the officials who participated in the debate. United States military aid, they agreed, as well as diplomatic backing for impending peace talks to end the war outweighed the risks of appearing to take sides in American politics. There was a lone holdout — Alexander Danyliuk, the director of the national security council. Mr. Danyliuk, who resigned in late September, told the Ukrainian news media that the Zelensky administration would now need to “correct the mistakes” in relations with the United States and “in particular their own.” Finally bending to the White House request, Mr. Zelensky’s staff planned for him to make an announcement in an interview on Sept. 13 with Fareed Zakaria, the host of a weekly news show on CNN. Though plans were in motion to give the White House the public statement it had sought, events in Washington saved the Ukrainian government from any final decision and eliminated the need to make the statement. Word of the freeze in military aid had leaked out, and Congress was in an uproar. Two days before the scheduled interview, the Trump administration released the assistance and Mr. Zelensky’s office quickly canceled the interview. Since then, Trump administration officials including the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, have tried to argue that the security assistance could not have been conditioned on the public statement, because the aid was released without it.  That stance has crumbled as a succession of United States diplomats, capped by Mr. Sondland on Tuesday, have testified in the impeachment inquiry that the freeze on aid was part of a quid pro quo designed to coerce Mr. Zelensky into making the public statement. In Kiev, there is still a debate about whether Mr. Zelensky caved or held out. “The Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,” said Mr. Burkovskiy, the analyst. “They were ready to do this.”  But Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister until a change of government on Aug. 29, said there was no telling what Mr. Zelensky would have ended up saying in the interview, as there were so many versions of a statement under negotiation.  “From the contacts that took place, it’s difficult to say if they led, or did not lead, to concrete deals,” Mr. Klimkin said in an interview. In public, Mr. Zelensky has insisted he would never order a politicized prosecution. Either way, Mr. Klimkin said, Ukrainian officials were at the least keenly aware of the stakes — a trade of United States assistance for political favors, even as Mr. Trump’s supporters have insisted they should not have viewed relations in this light. “We are not idiots, or at least not all of us,” Mr. Klimkin said.

Brazil Had High Hopes for Its Big Oil Auction. They Went Bust.,2019-11-06,By Manuela Andreoni and Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s government had high hopes that a huge auction held Wednesday to award offshore oil drilling rights would cement the country’s status as an emerging giant in the sector, capable of attracting the industry’s heavy hitters. Those hopes were unfounded. Only Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, and a couple of Chinese firms submitted bids for an auction that the Brazilian government had billed as the largest oil auction in history. Most of the 14 companies eligible to participate stayed away. Two of the four fields on offer got no bids.  Petrobras was the dominant bidder for the other two, winning one entirely and taking a 90 percent stake in the other, the largest field on the block, known as Buzios. Two Chinese firms, Cnooc Limited and the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Company, shared the remaining 10 percent stake in Buzios. The disappointing outcome suggests Brazil overestimated the price of admission that oil companies were willing to pay to get a foothold in vast reserves that lie under the ocean floor off its shores. Brazil had hoped to reap more than $26 billion in signing bonuses for the right to explore so-called pre-salt reserves, which are buried under sand and a thick layer of salt. The windfall would have been a boon to debt-saddled Petrobras and a handful of states that are in the red. But the bonuses amounted to about $17.4 billion, which analysts regarded as a sign that Brazil relied on wishful thinking when it set the price companies had to pay upfront if their bids were accepted.  “Basically, they threw a party with cheap beer but charged a very expensive ticket for people to get in,” said Edmar de Almeida, an economist at the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro who specializes in energy. “Then, no one showed up.” The Brazilian government had hailed Wednesday’s auction as a historic milestone that would help a sputtering economy start growing at a healthy rate. During a recent visit to Beijing, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil told his counterpart Xi Jinping that he hoped China would participate in “the biggest auction there’s ever been.” Roberto Castello Branco, the chief executive of Petrobras, looked disappointed as he told reporters that the company had expected competition. “There wasn’t,” he said. Rodrigo Maia, the speaker of the lower house of Congress, who was instrumental in creating the law that established the rules for this auction, also expressed disappointment. “This outcome is negative, no doubt about it,” he told reporters. “Our expectation was that the private sector would have more interest.” The law established a system to distribute oil revenue among the federal government, states and municipalities, several of which are in the red.  Brazil discovered large offshore oil reserves in 2006 during the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist who invested heavily in social programs for the poor. Getting the fields to start producing took years as politicians argued over how to build up Brazil’s oil sector and how to spend its proceeds. Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency estimated in 2017 that the delays in exploration cost the country more than $300 billion in government revenue and investment. That meant Brazil largely missed some of the most profitable years for the oil industry, when oil was trading at $100 per barrel. In the lead-up to Wednesday’s auction, Brazil made other missteps, analysts said, including establishing an auction system that forced investors to pay an unusually large amount of upfront. That formula reflected the debt-saddled government’s urgency to get an injection of money within months. Significant revenue from the profit-sharing agreements the government hoped to strike with oil companies would take years to materialize.  Wednesday’s auction notwithstanding, Brazil is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, with an expected output of five million barrels per day. Brazil has struggled in recent years to attract foreign investors, who are put off by the mounds of red tape, high taxes, political instability and corruption. But Fernanda Delgado, a research coordinator at Fundação Getúlio Vargas university who studies the oil industry, said Brazil is nonetheless an attractive market to investors at a time when American sanctions are crippling two other oil giants, Iran and Venezuela. “Despite Brazil’s difficulties in doing business and its political issues, it’s still the safest area in terms of oil investments,” she said.']","It was billed as the largest oil auction in history, one expected to produce a windfall. But analysts say a high signing bonus scared away bidders."
China Sentences Man to Death for Trafficking Fentanyl to the U.S.,2019-11-07,By Steven Lee Myers,"['XINGTAI, China — A court in China convicted and sentenced to death on Thursday a man accused of trafficking fentanyl to the United States after a joint investigation with American law enforcement agencies. The case, involving nine defendants in all, was a rare example of cooperation against a surge in fentanyl-related deaths that American officials, including President Trump, have blamed directly on China’s lax enforcement and even complicity in fueling a drug epidemic on American streets. The man sentenced to death, Liu Yong, led an illicit network of labs that produced and shipped packages of fentanyl to American users who were able to place orders online through a dealer simply known as “Diana,” according to the Chinese and American officials. A judge here in Xingtai, a city in Hebei Province about 220 miles south of Beijing, sentenced Mr. Liu to death after detailing a broad conspiracy to manufacture and smuggle fentanyl that evaded China’s strict controls on pharmaceutical production. But Mr. Liu’s death sentence was suspended for two years, leaving open the possibility that it could later be commuted to life in prison. Eight other co-defendants were also sentenced on Thursday, including distributors and online sellers. They received sentences ranging from six months in prison to life. The case started with an arrest by the Drug Enforcement Administration in New Orleans in August 2017, leading to an international investigation into a sprawling underground production network that prosecutors said Mr. Liu orchestrated.  The network included one lab and two distribution centers in Shanghai and the neighboring province, Jiangsu. They were shut down, and 12 kilograms, or about 26 pounds, of fentanyl was seized as part of the investigation, according to the officials and the court’s ruling. “The successful outcome of this case, especially the heavy sentences to the main criminals and others, fully demonstrates the position and determination of the Chinese government to severely punish fentanyl-related crimes,” Yu Haibin, the deputy director of China’s National Narcotics Control Commission, said at a news conference in Xingtai following the court’s sentencing hearing. He was joined by diplomats from the United States Embassy, underscoring China’s eagerness to show it was cooperating with American law enforcement to combat the fentanyl scourge. Many officials in the United States have accused China of abetting the trade. Austin Moore, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official working in the United States Embassy in Beijing, attended the sentencing along with other American diplomats and afterward welcomed the Chinese cooperation in the case, which he said had also resulted in arrests and indictments in New York and Oregon. “I have one more thing to say to those who make it their business to spread illegal narcotics,” he said at the news conference. “We make it our business to find you, arrest you and hold you accountable for your crimes.” Mr. Moore said the United States looked forward to greater collaboration as the Chinese government enforces a decision effective May 1 to classify all variants of fentanyl as controlled substances subject to strict enforcement. That legal change, which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, promised to Mr. Trump last year, closed a loophole in the country’s laws that allowed manufacturers here to make precursors or slight variations of fentanyl that were not explicitly banned in China. As anger rose in the United States over Chinese complicity in the epidemic, the Chinese have complained that they have been unfairly blamed for a problem that stems from pervasive drug abuse and the overprescription of fentanyl and other opioids in the United States. Mr. Yu, sitting beside Mr. Moore in a hotel ballroom, reiterated that view on Thursday. He noted that overdose deaths in the United States had continued to rise even as China intensified its cooperation with American law enforcement agencies and tightened its own export controls. He cited American statistics showing that customs officials had seized 536 kilograms of fentanyl since October 2018, but that only 5.87 kilograms of that came from China. “This data does not support that China is the main source of fentanyl substances in the United States,” he said. The sentencing on Thursday comes as aides to Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump try to finalize an interim deal in the trade war. The cooperation on display could help smooth the way, though Mr. Yu said the timing was in no way related, despite Mr. Trump’s outspoken past criticism of China regarding fentanyl. The case on Thursday was the first fentanyl-related case to conclude, Mr. Yu said. Two other cases are still ongoing. Claire Fu contributed research.

Iran Steps Further From Nuclear Deal With Move on Centrifuges,2019-11-05,By Michael Wolgelenter and David E. Sanger,"['Iran announced plans on Wednesday to reactivate its most sensitive nuclear production site, a deep, underground uranium enrichment center, in a step that dismantles more of the last major restrictions on the country under the 2015 nuclear deal. The facility, known as Fordow, buried under a mountain to protect against bunker-busting weapons, lay hidden from inspectors for years. The revelation of its existence a decade ago touched off a crisis with the West that led to threats from Israel to destroy the facility. The atmosphere created by the revelation led, six years later, to the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. Under that deal, in exchange for the lifting of Western economic sanctions, Iran agreed that no fissile material — the makings of bomb fuel — would be put in the centrifuges spinning at the site.  In a speech on Tuesday, however, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said that his patience had run out, and that Iran would begin to inject uranium gas into the more than 1,000 centrifuges that remained inside the mountain. But he made it clear that this step was part of a pressure campaign to force Europe to make good on its promises to compensate Iran for the cost of harsh sanctions that the United States imposed on Iran after President Trump abandoned the 2015 deal. Mr. Rouhani said Iran was reactivating Fordow, which is adjacent to an Iranian military base, precisely because it was considered such a hard military target. Its renewal as a nuclear production site, he suggested, could be easily reversed — part of the carefully calibrated strategy Iran is pursuing to pressure the United States and its allies just as the American-led sanctions on Iran’s oil shipments are intended to pressure Tehran. “We know how sensitive they are to the Fordow facility,” Mr. Rouhani told the country in a speech about why Iran would no longer abide by an agreement that Mr. Trump has abandoned. But he made clear that he regarded Fordow as a mere bargaining chip, saying that when the United States begins “living up to their commitments” to suspend sanctions while Iran was in compliance with the deal, “then we will stop feeding gas to the centrifuges.” The State Department criticized Mr. Rouhani’s actions on Tuesday. “Iran has no credible reason to expand its uranium enrichment program, at the Fordow facility or elsewhere,” it said in a statement, “other than a clear attempt at nuclear extortion that will only deepen its political and economic isolation.” It was the third time in six months that Mr. Rouhani had announced a careful series of escalations of Iran’s nuclear capacity. On Monday Iran said it was already producing enriched uranium at an ever-faster pace at its primary nuclear enrichment center at Natanz. In recent weeks it has also discussed rebuilding a plutonium reactor that was disabled under the agreement before it ever went into operation. That process is likely to take years.  None of these steps immediately gets Iran the makings of a bomb. But taken together, they create the condition that the three-year-long negotiating process was intended to stop, at least for a while: Iran’s ability to develop the material for a bomb in a year. President Trump’s complaint with the Iran accord was that key restrictions expired by 2030, but the net result of the recent announcements is that those restrictions are largely being thrown out now.  The potential for an Iranian “breakout,” producing fuel for a nuclear weapon within three months, was why Mr. Trump’s top advisers in his first year in office — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis — all urged him to remain in the deal, but press to extend its duration and expand its scope to include Iran’s missile production. Mr. Trump eventually discarded that advice and, over time, all three of those advisers.  The exact details of Iran’s move were difficult to discern. Mr. Rouhani talked about injecting the gas into 1,044 centrifuges at the Fordow nuclear facility, a major step toward uranium enrichment. The 2015 agreement had restricted the centrifuges to non-nuclear uses.  But Mr. Rouhani stopped short of saying that actual enrichment would follow at Fordow, though it is already underway at the larger Natanz facility. Enrichment moves Iran closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon, though it has denied harboring such ambitions. The announcement came a day after Iran said it had doubled the number of more advanced centrifuges operating at Natanz, and planned to install even more efficient centrifuges. While Mr. Rouhani portrayed the announcement on Tuesday — as well as three previous steps it had taken beyond the deal’s limits — as reversible, Iran has made clear that it would step back only if the European signatories to the deal find a way to relieve the economic pressure caused by the American sanctions. “Resistance lays the ground for negotiation, and negotiation takes advantage of resistance,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Fordow was of deep concern to the United States and Israel because it was unclear they could destroy it in a conflict with Iran. The United States conducted secret operations to simulate what it would take to collapse the mountain outside the holy city of Qum, using the largest bunker-busting bomb in its arsenal. The commanders concluded that they could destroy it but that the site would have to be attacked repeatedly.  In the negotiations in 2015, the Obama administration sought, and failed, to close the facility entirely. One American negotiator conceded that leaving it in place was a “bitter pill.” An eventual compromise allowed the centrifuges at the facility to remain in use on the condition that gas was not injected into them.  With the steps taken in recent weeks, Iran might be able to produce enough fuel for a single nuclear bomb in under a year, according to some analysts, but it was not immediately clear how the announcement on Tuesday would change the equation. Sanam Vakil, a research fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program, said that the Iranian authorities had remained “relatively calibrated” with the announcement on Tuesday. “Iran is pushing the red lines, as part of its own maximum pressure campaign to reverse Europe’s position,” she said. “But Iran could have done more and they’re not. This is still one of those steps that Iran can reverse.” The American sanctions, which Mr. Rouhani described Monday as “wrong, cruel and illegal,” delivered a blow to an already fragile Iranian economy, and the Iranian government has responded with what is effectively a two-track strategy — rebuilding its capability while insisting that Europe make up for the economic losses caused by American sanctions.  Mr. Rouhani, who said the work at Fordow would be carried out under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, expressed a willingness to restart nuclear talks if Washington returns to the deal and removes the sanctions. “We should be able to sell our oil,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to The Associated Press. “We should be able to bring our money” into the country. Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, said the union was “concerned” about the announcement, urging Iran to reverse earlier breaches of the nuclear deal and to refrain from any further moves that would undermine it. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that Russia would like to see the nuclear deal remain in force, but he also expressed sympathy for Iran, citing the “unprecedented and illegitimate sanctions” against it. The United States recently extended a waiver from sanctions for foreign companies, including Russia’s state-run nuclear company, Rosatom, to continue work at the Fordow site, but Moscow does not expect the developments on Tuesday to affect its role there.

15 Killed in Southern Thailand in the Worst Violence in Years,2019-11-06,By Hannah Beech and Ryn Jirenuwat,"['BANGKOK — Gunmen killed at least 15 people at a security checkpoint in southern Thailand on Tuesday night, the worst outbreak of violence in years in the country’s insurgency-plagued border region. The attackers stormed several spots around the checkpoint, in the Muang Yala District in Yala Province. The post was guarded by a mix of village defense volunteers, police officers and other security personnel, officials said. Eight people were killed on the spot, while seven died in the hospital, hospital staff said. Three more people sustained serious injuries. Officials said that the gunmen also stole weapons from the checkpoint. “Everywhere I stepped with my feet, it was all blood,” said Saritphan Sae-jang, a rescue worker who rushed to the scene Tuesday night but was delayed by the nails and fallen trees that the militants had scattered across the road to foil any rescue effort. Mr. Saritphan has worked for the Mae Kor Neaw Foundation, a local charity, as an emergency rescuer for nearly 15 years. “I have never seen so many dead people at the scene of one incident,” he said. Since an ethnic Malay Muslim insurgency renewed its campaign against the majority Buddhist state 15 years ago, more than 7,000 people in southern Thailand have been killed counting both sides of the divide. The assault on Tuesday claimed victims from both faiths, but no one has claimed responsibility, which is common for such attacks, officials said. “This is a dreadful incident,” said Lt. Gen. Kongcheep Tantravanich, a Ministry of Defense spokesman, adding that orders had gone out to “the forces to bring the culprits to justice as soon as possible.” The three southernmost provinces bordering Malaysia, which are the only Muslim majority part of the country, are not far from some of the powdery beaches that lure foreign tourists to Thailand. But violence rarely extends beyond the confines of those provinces, once an independent Muslim Malay sultanate before Buddhist-majority Thailand imposed its political will. The attacks usually come in the form of ambushes on checkpoints or bombs targeting military outposts or crowded locations, like shopping malls or hotels. Drive-by shootings of village chiefs and others seen as tied to the state are common. Beheadings and the burning of bodies, particularly of female teachers, have horrified Thais. Unlike some other Muslim insurgencies, which have tied themselves to transnational organizations like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, the militants in southern Thailand so far have focused more on localized grievances than calls for a global jihad. Yet their ambitions for southern Thailand are hardly unified. Some militants have pushed for autonomy, while others have demanded outright independence. Others do not say anything at all, preferring to let the violence, which at its peak was claiming dozens of lives each month, speak for them. The aim of much of the bloodshed, which overwhelmingly targets civilians, appears to be terrorism for its own sake, said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, the director of Deep South Watch, which monitors insurgent activity. “The number of violent incidents has decreased over the past three or four years but the movement of insurgent cells is alive and well,” he said. “The military doesn’t know exactly whom to talk to, whom to negotiate with, whom it’s fighting, so it spends a lot of money on security with marginal, insignificant returns.” Over the years, the central government has transformed the region into what feels like a giant occupation zone, with checkpoints, barbed wire and armored vehicles dotting a landscape of mosques, rubber plantations and palm trees. Around 60,000 Thai security forces are stationed in the three southernmost provinces. To protect themselves from the insurgents, villagers, including Buddhists who were encouraged to move down south by economic incentives, have banded together in corps of armed volunteers. After receiving a modicum of military training, the volunteers are assigned to checkpoints. The homegrown militias are given names like “the eye of the pineapple,” in reference to the spots that pepper the fruit. Most of those who died on Tuesday night were members of such a volunteer defense squad. The majority were elderly residents, said Mr. Saritphan, the rescue worker. “They sacrificed their time to take care of the village,” he said. “It’s very sad. Nobody wanted this to happen.” Lt. Gen. Pornsak Poonsawat, the chief of the 4th Army Region, which includes Yala, said that the insurgents deliberately targeted checkpoints staffed by “volunteers or villagers, who work by day and volunteer by night, so that they can create news to shock Thais.” Three months ago, four other village defense volunteers were killed in a raid on a checkpoint in Pattani, another of Thailand’s southern provinces. Last month, a Buddhist judge in Yala shot himself in a courtroom to protest what he said was pressure from above to sentence Muslim defendants to the death penalty, despite a lack of evidence in the case. The judge survived the bullet wound to his torso. Some ethnic Malays say that even if they do not support independence, they chafe against a Buddhist Thai kingdom that imposes its language and laws on a culturally distinct region. Some have called for Islamic law in the deep south and have urged the teaching of Jawi, the local language, in schools. With a state of emergency recently extended in southern Thailand, due process continues to elude Muslims accused of aiding the insurgency, human rights groups say. The memory lingers of the deaths in 2004 of nearly 80 Malay protesters who were crowded into trucks by security forces and suffocated in the heat or were crushed. Last year, a well-known ethnic Malay activist was held incommunicado in a military detention camp for a week. Recruitment of militants profits from such injustices, said human rights defenders. “The Thai government is fighting a violent separatist insurgency, but that does not empower the military to detain people without access to a judge, lawyer, or their family,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, at the time. “By holding people incommunicado, the military authorities are only increasing distrust among the local population.”']",The attack on a security checkpoint puts new focus on a bitter but often forgotten conflict that has killed both Buddhists and Muslims for years. 
"Gunmen in Burkina Faso Attack Canadian Mining Company Convoy, Killing 37",2019-11-07,By Ian Austen,"['Gunmen in Burkina Faso killed at least 37 people on Wednesday in an attack on a convoy carrying employees, suppliers and contractors of a Canadian mining company, one of the deadliest episodes in a recent tide of violence that has gripped the West African nation. The mining company, Semafo, which is based in Montreal, said that five buses escorted by Burkina Faso’s military were attacked while traveling to the Boungou mine, an open-pit gold mine in the eastern part of the country. They were on their way from the city of Fada-Ngourma, about 25 miles away. Lt. Col. Saïdou T.P. Sanou, the governor of the country’s eastern region, confirmed the death toll in a statement and said that another 60 people had been wounded, but he offered no information about the victims’ identities. Recent violence in Burkina Faso, a nation once known for its relative calm, has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, triggering a sudden humanitarian crisis. Between Aug. 6 and Sept. 30 alone, international organizations estimate, at least 26 military personnel were killed and 25 injured in attacks. Terrorist groups including the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara and Ansaroul Islam are known to be active in the north of Burkina Faso.  But attacks in the east and other parts of the country have, like Wednesday’s attack, gone unclaimed. Some analysts believe those attacks may be motivated by score settling, ethnic tension, monetary gain or personal disputes rather than terrorism driven by ideology or religion. As the attacks have escalated, several military outposts in the northern part of the country have been abandoned by poorly trained and ill paid security forces.  Wednesday’s assault was the third deadly attack in 15 months against Semafo, which also operates a second mine in Burkina Faso. In December 2018, five people traveling to Boungou were killed in nearly the same spot. And in August of last year, Semafo said that a bus headed to the company’s other mine was held up by criminals and that gunfire was exchanged.  After those attacks, Semafo began moving foreign employees by helicopter between Burkina Faso’s cities and its mines. It also said that it had tightened protection for locally hired employees who continued to travel by bus. Semafo said Wednesday that the Boungou mine, which opened in September 2018, had been secured and its operations were not affected.

France Announces Tough New Measures on Immigration,2019-11-06,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron of France tried to seize control of the issue of immigration on Wednesday, as his government announced steps to make the country less attractive to migrants while cracking open the door to skilled foreign workers. The combined moves were a bid by Mr. Macron to wrest the issue from his main political challengers, the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen, which for years has skillfully used immigration in its political ascent.  With critical municipal elections just months away, Mr. Macron has shifted right and begun talking tough on immigration, especially on the perceived abuses of France’s generous social welfare system, hoping to keep Ms. Le Pen’s party, formerly known as the National Front, at bay. Among Mr. Macron’s new get-tough measures is a provision that asylum seekers would have to wait three months before qualifying for non-urgent health care.  In addition, officials said that informal migrant camps in and around Paris would be cleared by the end of the year, as the government confronts a growing and visible problem in many French cities. But the government also announced that, starting next year, it would for the first time establish a system of annual quotas to grant visas to skilled immigrants looking to enter France.  “We want to regain control over our immigration policy,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said. While that may have been the intention, the announcement did as much to underline the political peril the issue presents for Mr. Macron, a centrist whose shape-shifting has often dissatisfied French voters across the political spectrum. The measures drew immediate criticism from both the right, who said they didn’t go far enough, and the left, who said Mr. Macron was unnecessarily endangering the already vulnerable population of asylum seekers for political ends. In recent weeks, Mr. Macron — who as a presidential candidate lauded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for saving Europe’s “collective dignity” through her pro-migrant policies during the height of the crisis in 2015 — had been setting the stage for Wednesday’s announcement. In a long interview on the presidential plane with a right-wing magazine, “Valeurs Actuelles,” Mr. Macron recently said the authorities had been lax in expelling those who had entered France illegally. “My goal is to throw out everybody who has no reason to be here,” he said. In an interview on Radio France, Ms. Le Pen said that the government was addressing the issue of immigration simply because of the municipal elections, scheduled for March. She said the measures would be ineffective in reining in illegal immigration. “They’re talking about immigration because they think it’s enough to talk about immigration to the French to make them believe that solutions are being brought,” Ms. Le Pen said. Nearly 124,000 people requested asylum in France last year, a record number and an increase of 23 percent from the previous year. The requests came mainly from Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan and France’s former African colonies, but also from Albania and Georgia, two countries that France says respect human rights. The increase in asylum seekers has exacerbated housing problems, overwhelming shelters established by the government.  In Paris and other cities, groups of migrants, often numbering in the hundreds, have set up tent cities or are squatting in unused buildings. Nearly 3,000 are estimated to be living on the streets in northern Paris and an adjoining suburb. The authorities have regularly expelled migrants from specific sites, leading them to move elsewhere, in a continuing cat-and-mouse game. Those expulsions have increased with the government’s tougher line on immigration, according to advocates for the rights of immigrants. “Since last summer, the government has been really pushing to close down these camps without offering any solution for those who find themselves on the street, said Yann Manzi, the president of Utopia 56, a group that assists migrants in Paris. The number of asylum seekers in France has risen, migrant support groups say, as part of the continuing effects of the migrant crisis that reached a peak in 2015.  According to the European Union law governing the process, known as the Dublin Regulation, applicants must request asylum in the first country they set foot in, and remain there. But many end up moving to a second country. Those who have gravitated to France are called “Dublinés,” in reference to the law.  Nations like Italy and Greece argue that the system presents an unfair burden on them. But France, Germany and others have stepped up efforts to send migrants back where they landed.  With countries unable or unwilling to rapidly process applications, migrants have been stuck in limbo for years, or ended up wandering inside Europe, said Pierre Henry, the director of France Terre d’Asile, a migrants rights group. “You have 200,000 to 250,000 people who are being sent back and forth in Europe like Ping-Pong balls,’’ Mr. Henry said. Mr. Macron’s government has increasingly adopted arguments that some migrants are exploiting France’s welcome of asylum seekers, who can quickly qualify for health care and other benefits.  His government has accused some asylum seekers of engaging in what it describes as “medical tourism” by seeking treatment for serious medical conditions in French hospitals. Mr. Macron said that reforms were necessary so that France “shouldn’t be too attractive a country” for asylum seekers. Last year, nearly 320,000 people without legal status benefited from a government health care program reserved for them — a situation that has long angered France’s right. Migrant rights groups said that tightening access to health care would harm most legitimate asylum seekers. “Many of them suffer from real mental and physical problems, given the very difficult journeys they’ve had,” said Bruno Morel, the director of Emmaus Solidarité, a migrant rights group. “The government says if we welcome migrants too well, more will come. That’s totally false. That just feeds populism.” Mr. Macron has been criticized for representing the interests of France’s economic elite, especially during the Yellow Vest protests that roiled the country for months starting in October of last year. In explaining his focus on immigration, Mr. Macron told members of his party, La République en Marche, that they must avoid becoming a party of the “bourgeois.” The bourgeois, he said, lived in areas with few immigrants and did not encounter immigration in their daily lives. It is France’s working classes that live with the difficulties of immigration, he said, and “have thus migrated to the far right.”']","With municipal elections approaching, President Emmanuel Macron hopes the stricter stance will lure voters away from the far right."
"Teenage Rescuer, Now 92, Meets Family She Saved From Nazis",2019-11-05,By Iliana Magra,"['Sarah Yanai, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, clutched the handle of her wheelchair as she closed her eyes, and then opened her arms to embrace the woman who helped save her and most of her family from the Nazis more than 75 years ago.  “How are you, how are you Melpo?” Ms. Yanai asked in Greek while stroking the cheek and silver hair of Melpomeni Dina, the 92-year-old Greek woman who, along with her two sisters, provided a hiding place for Ms. Yanai’s family in Veroia, a town in northern Greece, during the German occupation of the country in World War II.  The two women and Yossi Mor, Ms. Yanai’s brother, were reunited at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial center, in Jerusalem on Sunday.  The meeting, which was set up by the center and by the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, a charity that assists those who risked their lives to save Jews, might be the last of its kind, Stanlee J. Stahl, the executive vice president of the foundation, said by phone on Tuesday. “I believe this will be the very last reunion,” Ms. Stahl told reporters on Sunday, noting that most survivors and the people who had helped them were either unable to travel or had died. Ms. Dina, who was accompanied to Jerusalem by her daughter,  was introduced to 40 descendants of the Jewish family she had helped to shelter in a bedroom in Veroia in the 1940s, according to a statement by the center and the foundation. “Everyone is here, they are all waiting to meet you, to tell you that they thank you very much,” Ms. Yanai told Ms. Dina. “We are a large family now, we are all here,” she said.  One by one, members of the Jewish family, middle-aged offspring through to young children, embraced Ms. Dina, who now uses a wheelchair.  “We were hiding in her house — she saved all my family,” said Ms. Yanai, whose family name at the time was Mordechai. “Thanks to her, now she can see all our large family.”  The Mordechais — five children, including Ms. Yanai and Mr. Mor, and their parents, Mentes Mordechai and Miriam Mari — owned a fashion business, according to Yad Vashem.  In March 1943, when Jews in Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, which is close to Veroia, started being rounded up for deportation, the brother of a Greek maid for the Mordechai family helped them try to avoid detection.  But the maid’s brother soon found out that a roundup of Jews in Veroia was imminent. He hid the seven members of the family in his attic for almost a year, but, when the family developed health problems because of their cramped conditions, a new hiding place was needed, Yad Vashem said in a statement recounting the family’s story.  That is where the Giannopoulou sisters — the family name of Ms. Dina — came in. Before the war, Efthimia, Ms. Dina’s elder sister, had trained as a seamstress at Ms. Mordechai’s studio.  Because the sisters were orphans and very poor, Ms. Mordechai had not charged Efthimia for lessons, and Efthimia, who had visited the Mordechai family in their first shelter, wanted to repay the kindness.  So she, along with Bethleem, her 15-year-old sister, and Ms. Dina, then 14, decided to provide refuge for the family — lodging them all in one room and sharing their food rations.  “They had to share the food that they got for themselves,” said Mr. Mor, who is now 77 but who was a baby at the time, said.  “We were more than they were, you see,” he added.   While the family lived with the Giannopoulou sisters, Shmuel, one of the Mordechais’ sons, fell ill. He was taken to the hospital by one of the sisters, but he died, and soon after, the family was reported to the authorities, according to Yad Vashem. The sisters helped them escape and provided them with clothes for hiding in the Vermio Mountains in northern Greece. “You cannot imagine how dangerous it was for her, for all her family, to keep us all, our family, with them,” Ms. Yanai said of Ms. Dina.  Both the families that sheltered the Mordechais during the German occupation were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem and the State of Israel. More than 27,000 people have been recognized to date — 355 of whom were from Greece, according to Yad Vashem. Ms. Dina, whose two sisters have since died, was recognized in 1994. She and other honorees are given financial support “as an expression of gratitude on behalf of the Jewish people,” the center and the foundation said in a statement. About six million European Jews were killed by the Nazis and their associates during World War II.  “My mother and her sisters were young orphan girls, and they had no awareness of danger,” Margarita, Ms. Dina’s daughter, told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency, adding that the three of them had helped the Mordechai family with any means they had.  “What my mother says is that she has a clear conscience,” she added.   ']",Melpomeni Dina was reunited with the two surviving members and 40 descendants of the Jewish family she and her sisters helped escape occupied Greece during World War II.
‘Achieving the American Dream’ With a Loan and a Smuggler,2019-11-05,By Emily Kaplan,"['SANTA LUCÍA UTATLÁN, Guatemala — The local government worker guided the bank representative around the parcel of land in this rural village in Guatemala, describing the dream home he envisioned rising from the dirt. He pointed out where the kitchen would be, and the bedrooms for his family. To make it a reality, all he needed was a loan from the bank. At least, this was what he told the bank official. In truth, he was looking for cash to pay a smuggler to take him to the United States. The ruse worked, and the bank, Banrural, one of Guatemala’s largest financial institutions,  approved a construction loan for about $5,700. Days later, the government worker sneaked across the southwest border of the United States with the help of a smuggler. This is “the easiest way of achieving the American dream,” said the 30-year-old government worker, who now lives in New York and works in construction. He allowed only the publication of his middle name, Yovany, for fear of retribution from the bank.  In recent years, Guatemala has seen record levels of emigration as people, some fleeing violence and many others looking for a way out of poverty, head north with hopes of crossing into the United States. Some prospective migrants raise the necessary smugglers’ fees from relatives. For others, bank loans are the ticket out.  The largely poor migrants take loans against their only possession of value, their land, assuming burdens that for many become overwhelming and lead to a downward spiral of debt and despair. Within this financing ecosystem, no entity may be more central, or making more of a profit, than Banrural, a private institution with ties to the Guatemalan government. Its green-and-white storefronts have popped up in even the country’s most remote villages. Many migrants seeking to make it to the United States have taken out Banrural loans on false pretenses to help pay for their trips, according to migrants, Guatemalan government officials, smugglers, academics and a former Banrural employee.  Some, like Yovany, claim an intent to develop their property. Others say they want to buy a piece of farming machinery. But the money instead goes straight into the hands of smugglers. “Illegal immigration from rural Guatemala wouldn’t be possible without Banrural,” said David Stoll, an anthropology professor at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies debt and Guatemalan society. “Banrural is the de facto financier of migration to the United States.” Officials at Banrural said the bank was a strictly law-abiding institution dedicated to the development of Guatemala’s rural interior and was not complicit in any misuse of loans by borrowers. “Banrural only finances activities accepted by law,” said Edgar Guzmán Bethancourt, the bank’s general manager. “Any violation of this provision is an activity not accepted in any way by the bank.” In recent years, Guatemala has been among the single largest sources of migrants apprehended along the southwest border of the United States, with most of them coming from rural, predominantly indigenous regions of the country. A series of escalating policy and enforcement measures in the United States, and, in recent months, Mexico, have made illegal migration more difficult. But analysts say smugglers have used the stricter enforcement measures as a marketing tool for their services. And they have raised their prices accordingly.  In some cases, smugglers in Guatemala are now charging more than $16,000 to escort an undocumented migrant to the United States. That is a vast fortune for rural Guatemalans who often earn less than $1,000 per year. Still, the demand for such services, and for the loans to pay for them, remains high. Óscar, a migrant smuggler based in Santa Lucía Utatlán, a mountainous region of western Guatemala, said people were increasingly willing to pay the smugglers’ soaring fees because they knew they would have a better chance of making it to the United States than going it alone. “They’ll pay whatever it costs to get there,” he said, declining to give his full name out of fear for his safety. As it is in many other places across Guatemala, migration is part of the cultural and economic fabric of the community in Santa Lucía Utatlán. Migration to the United States has drained the village of about 40 percent of its population, with the outflow accelerating in the past decade, said Santos Augusto Yac Joj, the town’s mayor.  Most have crossed into the United States illegally, and their families, as well as the town’s economy, are dependent on the remittances they send back. Majestic, multistory houses perched on the surrounding mountain slopes stand in contrast to the humble abodes that otherwise characterize the village, and testify to the potential rewards of migration. They belong either to migrants working in the United States who financed their construction with remittances, or to the increasingly wealthy smugglers who helped get them there. Several members of Yovany’s extended family — including two brothers, several cousins and an uncle — have taken out loans from Banrural in the past decade to finance their smuggler-assisted trips to the United States. Like Yovany, they falsely told the bank they needed the loan for some legal purpose in Guatemala, like building an extension on a home or buying a piece of farming equipment. Some poor Guatemalans lack sufficient collateral or bank connections to secure a bank loan. And so they resort to an underworld of private, unregulated moneylenders who charge usurious rates, according to government officials as well as borrowers. In one common process, largely dependent on mutual trust, the borrower gives his or her land title to a money lender in exchange for the loan. In a kind of legal charade known as a “simulation,” the two will visit a notary and testify under oath that the borrower has, in fact, sold their land title to the lender.  If the borrower successfully repays the loan, the lender sells the lands back to the borrower in another simulation. Otherwise, the land becomes the property of the moneylender. Sometimes, however, a pact is struck between the lender and borrower alone, with no notary, and its success is based on honor alone. But residents say moneylenders have the upper hand in these deals and commonly use threats of violence to enforce the repayment schedule. One migrant from Sololá, now living in New York, said he paid a smuggler $12,000 with funds from a moneylender. He still owes half the amount. He said his wife, who remained behind in their Guatemalan village, was routinely threatened to force repayment of the loan. “They come to my house and threaten my children on the street,” said his wife, who withheld her name out of fear for the family’s safety. Some in the country are trying to fight loan sharking. Santiago Tzapinel, a member of an indigenous governing council in Santa Lucía Utatlán, said unregulated loan systems were “bleeding the people.” His council, and other such indigenous groups around the country, try to support borrowers by teaching them their rights and talking to lenders on their behalf to negotiate better terms.

"Why Spy on Twitter? For Saudi Arabia, It’s the Town Square",2019-11-07,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In Saudi Arabia, where a relatively closed culture leaves citizens few public forums to discuss news and politics, Twitter has become a kind of town square, the place where citizens meet to swap information and debate the latest issues. Saudi Arabia’s absolute monarchy has not banned the site, but it has taken extensive measures to shape the information that appears there and to silence or drown out dissidents who use it to post critical views. The Justice Department’s indictment on Wednesday of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for Saudi Arabia cast rare light on one corner of the vast measures the kingdom has taken to shape what its citizens see when they go online. Saudi Arabia provides no public spaces where citizens can gather to discuss news and politics. And the kingdom’s news media are state-owned or controlled, limiting the range of perspectives they carry.  But many Saudi citizens have multiple cellphones and fast internet, which have led them to use Twitter to engage both with the world and with their fellow citizens. That has given the kingdom one of the world’s largest Twitterspheres.  According to one recent report, Saudi Arabia had 9.9 million active Twitter users, the fourth highest in the world, behind the United States, Britain and Japan. But in terms of the percentage of the population using the platform, Saudi Arabia was first, with 37 percent of residents doing so, compared with 18 percent in the United States. It can seem like everyone in Saudi Arabia is on Twitter: prominent Muslim clerics, well-known journalists, TV stars and even the 83-year-old monarch, King Salman, who has 7.8 million followers.  Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi writer who was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul last year, had 1.6 million followers at the time of his death, allowing him to broadcast his views even after he’d been banned from Saudi news outlets. His direct line to fellow Saudis, which the kingdom was powerless to stop, may well have contributed to his death. The platform’s importance has made it a key battleground for the government, which uses it to tout the kingdom’s policies, and a range of dissidents at home and abroad who use it to spread criticism of government policies and campaign for the release of political detainees. Unlike other authoritarian governments in, say, Iran or China, Saudi Arabia has not blocked access to Twitter, perhaps considering it a useful, and relatively harmless, pressure valve for society. Instead, critics and researchers say, it has invested in a range of techniques to influence what Saudis see when they use the platform. These include hard tactics like arresting or putting on trial prominent Twitter personalities who criticize the government and softer efforts like promoting positive tweets and working to sideline negative ones. “They can’t really block out these websites from the server side, so they have to contest the space,” said Alexei Abrahams, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. “If they pour enough resources in, then maybe social media becomes more useful to the regime than to the opposition. I’m not sure we’ve crossed that threshold yet, but we can’t be that far from it.” To shape the online environment, the Saudi government has marshaled armies of accounts to promote pro-government content and attack critical voices, Mr. Abrahams said. These can be automated accounts, known as bots, or accounts run by people working for the Saudi government who use Twitter in a coordinated fashion, according to an investigation published by The New York Times last year. Acting together, they can promote accounts or hashtags that, say, praise the kingdom’s leadership while diluting the presence of critical conversations. That can end up shaping what average Saudis find when they go online. “You can make it appear that the weight of public opinion lies with the regime,” Mr. Abrahams said. How do Saudi dissidents use Twitter? Saudi dissidents, many of them abroad, use Twitter to broadcast their views to their countrymen inside the kingdom. They include human rights activists who track detentions, and dissidents like Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in Canada and who posts frequent videos of himself commenting on current events and criticizing Saudi policies. The Saudi government has tried to shut down these accounts. Mr. Abdulaziz says that his brothers in Saudi Arabia have been detained to pressure him to be quiet and that the Royal Court sent envoys to Canada to try to persuade him to come home and work for the government. He has refused. The kingdom has also gone after the administrators of anonymous accounts, and it appears that this is why it may have sought to recruit spies inside Twitter. Ali Alzabarah, one of the men indicted this week, was an engineer who had access to users’ personal information. Another, Ahmad Abouammo, could see users’ email addresses and phone numbers, sensitive information that could help the government unmask the people behind anonymous accounts. Both men left Twitter in 2015, and no further efforts by the kingdom to infiltrate social media companies have been uncovered.  The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who criticized the kingdom’s leadership, drew international attention to Saudi efforts to silence dissidents. It appears that the kingdom is still working in cyberspace to promote its views. “There are still tons of bots out there,” said Mr. Abrahams, the researcher.']",The indictment of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for the Saudis highlights the platform’s power and the kingdom’s efforts to control it.
ISIS Fighters Attack Outpost in Tajikistan,2019-11-06,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 17 people were killed on Wednesday when militants said to be members of the Islamic State attacked a checkpoint on the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan border, the Tajik authorities said.  The attack points to the resilience of the Islamic State and its longstanding aim to spread further into Central Asia from its enclave in Afghanistan. It comes almost two weeks after the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed during an American military operation in northwestern Syria. Western officials had warned that Mr. al-Baghdadi’s death was likely to lead to retaliatory attacks. Fifteen assailants were killed in the gun battle in Tajikistan, as were a Tajik border guard and an employee of the country’s Interior Ministry. Five militants were captured, the ministry said in a statement. The Islamic State has not taken responsibility for the clash, which occurred around 50 miles southwest of the capital, Dushanbe, but the Interior Ministry said that Tajik officials had learned of the group’s role during “the investigation and interrogation” of the captured fighters. “These attackers are probably our own citizens,” said Umarjon Emomali, a spokesman for the Tajikistan Interior Ministry. The militants crossed into Tajikistan over the weekend from Kunduz Province, in northern Afghanistan, Afghan officials said. The fighters passed through the Qala-e-Zal district, an area where the border is porous because it is almost entirely controlled by the Taliban, said Mohammad Nabi Gochli, the local police commander there. “They didn’t raise their flags because they are scared of the Taliban,” Mr. Gochli said on Wednesday. Mr. Gochli said that he had learned that Islamic State fighters had arrived in his district roughly two weeks ago, and that they had inhabited a cluster of villages along the Amu Darya, a river that runs almost parallel to the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. The governor of Qala-e-Zal, Ahmad Fahim Qarluq, said on Wednesday that an Islamic State commander had arrived in the district about a month ago from the southeastern province of Nangarhar and had been recruiting fighters. As told by Mr. Qarluq and Mr. Gochli, the fighters’ spreading from southeastern Afghanistan and eventually into Tajikistan highlights what could be described as the slow but steady growth of the Islamic State’s affiliate in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State Khorasan.  Tajikistan, an impoverished former Soviet republic of nine million, fought Islamist insurgents in a civil war in the 1990s, and it has regularly been plagued by unrest since then. Hundreds of people from the country are believed to have joined the Islamic State. In May, the group claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 20 people during a riot in a Tajik prison east of Dushanbe, along with the release of prisoners affiliated with the Islamic State. And in July 2018, four touring cyclists — two from the United States, one from the Netherlands and one from Switzerland — were run down and killed by a carload of men who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. American defense officials said the attack was inspired, and possibly even directed, by the Islamic State leadership in Afghanistan. The group’s affiliate in Afghanistan established a foothold in Nangarhar Province in 2015, and it has slowly spread elsewhere in the country, including to Kabul, the capital. Estimated to have between 2,500 and 3,000 fighters, many of whom are from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the group has established itself as an enduring threat in Afghanistan despite repeated American-backed military offensives and hundreds of airstrikes. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reported from Kabul, and Najim Rahim from Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan.']",The violence points to the resilience of the Islamic State and its longstanding aim to spread from its enclave in Afghanistan.
"Russian Snipers, Missiles and Warplanes Try to Tilt Libyan War",2019-11-05,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['TRIPOLI, Libya — The casualties at the Aziziya field hospital south of Tripoli used to arrive with gaping wounds and shattered limbs, victims of the haphazard artillery fire that has defined battles among Libyan militias. But now medics say they are seeing something new: narrow holes in a head or a torso left by bullets that kill instantly and never exit the body. It is the work, Libyan fighters say, of Russian mercenaries, including skilled snipers. The lack of an exit wound is a signature of the ammunition used by the same Russian mercenaries elsewhere. The snipers are among about 200 Russian fighters who have arrived in Libya in the last six weeks, part of a broad campaign by the Kremlin to reassert its influence across the Middle East and Africa.  After four years of behind-the-scenes financial and tactical support for a would-be Libyan strongman, Russia is now pushing far more directly to shape the outcome of Libya’s messy civil war. It has introduced advanced Sukhoi jets, coordinated missile strikes, and precision-guided artillery, as well as the snipers — the same playbook that made Moscow a kingmaker in the Syrian civil war. “It is exactly the same as Syria,” said Fathi Bashagha, interior minister of the provisional unity government in the capital, Tripoli. Whatever its effect on the outcome, the Russian intervention has already given Moscow a de facto veto over any resolution of the conflict. The Russians have intervened on behalf of the militia leader Khalifa Hifter, who is based in eastern Libya and is also backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and, at times, France. His backers have embraced him as their best hope to check the influence of political Islam, crack down on militants and restore an authoritarian order. Mr. Hifter has been at war for more than five years with a coalition of militias from western Libya who back the authorities in Tripoli. The Tripoli government was set up by the United Nations in 2015 and is officially supported by the United States and other Western powers. But in practical terms, Turkey is its only patron. The new intervention of private Russian mercenaries, who are closely tied to the Kremlin, is just one of the parallels with the Syrian civil war.  The Russian snipers belong to the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked private company that also led Russia’s intervention in Syria, according to three senior Libyan officials and five Western diplomats closely tracking the war.  In both conflicts, rival regional powers are arming local clients. And, as in Syria, the local partners who had teamed up with the United States to fight the Islamic State are now complaining of abandonment and betrayal.  The United Nations, which has tried and failed to broker peace in both countries, has watched as its eight-year arms embargo on Libya is becoming “a cynical joke,” as the United Nations special envoy recently put it. Yet in some ways, the stakes in Libya are higher.  More than three times the size of Texas, Libya controls vast oil reserves, pumping out 1.3 million barrels a day despite the present conflict. Its long Mediterranean coastline, just 300 miles from Italy, has been a jumping-off point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants.  And the open borders around Libya’s deserts have provided havens for extremists from North Africa and beyond.  The conflict has become a bipolar combination of the primitive and futuristic. Turkey and the Emirates have turned Libya into the first war fought primarily by clashing fleets of armed drones. The United Nations estimates that during the past six months, the two sides have conducted more than 900 drone missions. But on the ground, the war is between militias with fewer than 400 fighters typically engaged on both sides at any time. The fighting happens almost exclusively in a handful of deserted districts on the southern outskirts of Tripoli, while in neighborhoods just a few miles away, streets are clogged with civilian traffic and espresso bars bustle amid heaps of uncollected garbage. “There is a huge discrepancy between the Libyan fighting on the ground and the advanced technology in the air from the meddling foreign powers,” said Emad Badi, a Libyan scholar at the Middle East Institute who visited the front in July. “It’s like they are different worlds.”  On a recent tour of the front-line district of Ain Zara, a Tripoli militia officer, Muhammad el-Delawi, passed out stacks of cash to fighters in T-shirts or mismatched camouflage uniforms, some in tennis shoes or sandals, others only with bare feet. The twisted wreckage of an ambulance hit by a drone missile sat by the side of the road. The arrival of the Russian snipers is already transforming the war, Mr. el-Delawi said, recounting the deaths of nine of his fighters the previous day — one of them shot in the eye.  “The bullet was as long as a finger,” he said.  One European security official said the absence of exit wounds, a mark of hollow-point ammunition, matches injuries inflicted by Russian snipers in eastern Ukraine. By the beginning of April, the conflict had largely died down and the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, arrived in Tripoli to try to finalize a peace deal. But the next day Mr. Hifter launched a surprise assault on the capital, restarting the civil war. Officials of the Tripoli government say Russia is now bringing in more mercenaries by the week.  “It is very clear that Russia is going all in on this conflict,” said Gen. Osama al-Juwaili, the top commander of the forces aligned with the Tripoli government. He complained that the West was doing nothing to protect that government from the foreign powers determined to push Mr. Hifter into power. “Why all this pain?” he said sardonically. “Just stop this now and assign the guy to rule us.” Russia had previously stayed in the background while the United Arab Emirates and Egypt took the leading roles in military support for Mr. Hifter. But by September, his assault on Tripoli seemed to have stalled and Russia apparently saw an opportunity. Given the amateurish nature of the ground fighting, some diplomats said, the arrival of 200 Russian professionals could have an outsized impact. A spokesman for Mr. Hifter’s forces did not respond to a request for comment. Having collapsed into feuding city-states after the overthrow of the longtime Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, Libya is less a functioning state than a vast and bloated public payroll. Citizens and towns are united only by a shared dependence on the oil revenue flowing through the national bank in Tripoli to a vastly inflated government work force. Some of those salaries ultimately end up paying fighters on all sides of the war. Control of the central bank and the oil revenue has made Tripoli the war’s grand prize.   Mr. Hifter, 75, was a former army general under Colonel el-Qaddafi who defected and lived in Northern Virginia as a C.I.A. client for more than a decade. Returning to Libya in 2011, he sought but failed to win a leading role in the uprising.  Five years ago, he vowed to rule Libya as a new military strongman, but his progress has been halting. His limited success has depended heavily on his regional backers and, until now, Russia appeared to have hedged its bets.  The Kremlin has maintained contacts with the authorities in Tripoli as well as with former el-Qaddafi officials, even as its support for Mr. Hifter has been vital and growing.  Russia has printed millions of dollars’ worth of Libyan bank notes and shipped them to Mr. Hifter. By 2015, Russia had set up a base in western Egypt to help provide technical support and repair equipment, according to Western diplomats. By last year, Russia had also sent at least a handful of military advisers to Mr. Hifter’s forces in Benghazi. Last November, Mr. Hifter was filmed at a table in Moscow with both the Russian defense minister and the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr. Prigozhin is under indictment in the United States for involvement in the internet “troll farm” that sought to influence the 2016 presidential election. As in Syria, the Russian escalation in Libya has drawn complaints from former American allies that Washington has abandoned them.  Even though it officially supports the United Nations-recognized government, the United States has largely disengaged and President Trump has appeared to endorse Mr. Hifter. Mr. Trump called Mr. Hifter a few days after he began his assault on Tripoli to applaud his “role in fighting against terrorism.” Now Mr. Hifter’s forces are conducting airstrikes against militias from western Libya that had previously worked closely with American military forces to expel a branch of the Islamic State from its stronghold in the city of Surt. “We fought with you together in Surt and now we are being targeted 10 times a day by Hifter,” Gen. Muhammad Haddad, now a commander for the Tripoli forces, said he told American officials.  When Mr. Hifter began his assault on Tripoli in April, his biggest advantage was the use of armed drones: The United Arab Emirates furnished Chinese-made Wing Loong drones, purchased for $2 million each.  General al-Juwaili blamed drone strikes for nearly two-thirds of the casualties among Tripoli government forces. United Nations officials estimate that more than 1,100 have died in the fighting but say the real number is likely more than double.  “In the beginning, we were terrified,” said Mr. el-Delawi, the officer of the Tripoli-backed militia at Ain Zara. “We just heard a scary noise and we did not know what to do.” Since then, he said, fighters have learned to listen for the whirring noise and hide as the drones approach. They say Mr. Hifter’s forces can fly only three drones at a time, and that each drone fires a maximum of eight missiles. Each must then disappear to reload — allowing the fighters a chance to regain lost ground.  Realizing that the drones target heat sources, the fighters also learned to hide more effectively, including by refraining from smoking. “The drone can see a fighter smoking a cigarette inside a car,” Mr. el-Delawi explained. In May, the Tripoli government began buying drones from Turkey: The Bayraktar TB2 sold for $5 million each and is manufactured by the family business of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law, Selcuk Bayraktar.  “The Turks saved us just in time,” said Mr. Bushagha, the interior minister of the Tripoli government. Turkish drones helped the Tripoli forces recapture the strategic city of Gheryan in June, and since then, the battle lines have barely shifted.  Taking Tripoli may require far more Russian support than a couple hundred mercenaries, given the bloody block-by-block nature of urban combat. But by propping up Mr. Hifter, diplomats said, Moscow has already claimed a major say in any negotiations over Libya’s future. In an interview, the United Nations envoy, Ghassan Salame, said Libyans could patch up their differences if foreign powers stopped arming rival factions. He has organized a conference in Berlin later this year to try to stop that interference.  “Otherwise, this could either go on for an eternity as a low intensity conflict, like a fire that is not extinguished,” he said, “or even escalate, with a doubling down by the international forces intervening, if they believe they can somehow end it for their own advantage.” Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from New York.']","Moscow is plunging deeper into a war of armed drones in a strategic hot spot rich with oil, teeming with migrants and riddled with militants."
"Mormon Massacre in Mexico May Be Tied to Gang War, Officials Say",2019-11-06,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — A conflict between two criminal groups fighting for control of a region in northern Mexico is a focus of the authorities in their investigation into the massacre of nine members of a Mormon family, officials said Wednesday. Gen. Homero Mendoza Ruiz, Mexico’s chief of staff for national defense, said that before the family was attacked on Monday, the groups had a shootout in the town of Agua Prieta, on the border with the United States. At least one person died and another was wounded. The authorities identified the groups as Los Salazar, based in the state of Sonora, and La Línea, based in the neighboring state of Chihuahua. After the gang shootout Monday morning, they said, La Línea dispatched gunmen to a region that straddles the two states to try to prevent their rivals from entering Chihuahua. The attack on the Mormons as they drove through Sonora, toward the border with Chihuahua, General Mendoza said, is being attributed to this clash between the rival gangs. It remained unclear, however, whether the family was somehow involved in the rivalry or whether the attack was a case of mistaken identity. The S.U.V. model that two of the victims were driving, a Suburban, is commonly used in the area by criminal gangs, the general said. He added that investigators believed that the children in one of the Suburbans were allowed to flee, contributing to the hypothesis that the attack was not directed at the family. The family members, all women and children who were dual American and Mexican citizens, were ambushed while driving in three sport utility vehicles in a rural area of Sonora where Mormon groups that splintered from the main United States church began settling in the early 20th century. Six children and three women were killed. The attack terrified communities that had learned to coexist with violence in the remote, rural area, said a human-rights activist who lives and works in the region and who did not give his name out of fear of reprisal from the gangs. The criminals showed “no mercy even with children and babies,” he said. “This only adds to the fear that we already felt, which is now maximized.” [Is Mexico Becoming More Violent? Our Journalists Answer Reader Questions After a Brutal Attack] At a news conference on Wednesday, Mexican government officials offered few new details about the ambush and its motivations, saying that the investigation was continuing. But they determined that the ammunition used in the attack were .223 caliber cartridges manufactured in the United States by Remington and associated with AR-15 and M16 rifles.  Some 200,000 American guns cross the border into Mexico illegally each year, according to some estimates, landing in the hands of the criminal organizations that fight to control the multibillion drug trade to the United States and helping fuel much of the violence overwhelming Mexico. Mexico has been lobbying the United States for more than a decade to stop the flow.  Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, also said that because the victims were from families that have dual nationality and move frequently between the two countries, Mexican officials would provide their American counterparts with full access to their files as the investigation progressed and would seek the collaboration of United States law enforcement, including the F.B.I., if necessary.  Officials also provided some clarification about the timeline of events on Monday.  General Mendoza said the ambush began with an attack at about 9:40 a.m. on a Tahoe sport utility vehicle that was traveling well behind the other two vehicles and carrying one woman and four children. The Tahoe appeared to have caught fire from the impact of the bullets, he said, and all five passengers were killed.  The second attack, on the two Suburban S.U.V.s that were traveling together, occurred at about 11 a.m., some 11 miles farther along the road. One of the vehicles carried six children, two of whom were killed, and one woman, who was also killed. The other four children escaped.  The other Suburban carried a woman, who was killed, and four children, all of whom managed to escape.  On Tuesday, President Trump wrote in a tweet that this is “time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.”  Since then, American senators from both parties have criticized Mexico’s failure to control the violence and called for its government to step up its fight against the criminal organizations that control swaths of the country and fuel its record-high homicide rate. [In Mormon family’s 12 hours of terror in Mexico, a message emerges: No one is safe.] “This is what happens when Mexico’s politicians look the other way and let drug cartels bribe their way to power,” Senator Ben Sasse said in a statement on Tuesday. “Enough. Mexico’s president hasn’t taken the threat seriously.” But on Wednesday, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico defended his security strategy, which has focused on combating the poverty he sees as the root of violence.  “It hurts a lot,” Mr. López Obrador said of the attack. “But are we going to want to solve the problem in the same way? Declaring war? That, in the case of our country, has been shown not to work. That was a failure, that caused more violence, acting like this.” It remained unclear what the criminal organizations might have been fighting over, analysts said, though control of lucrative drug trafficking routes was a possibility. In recent years, La Línea has been active in the mountainous regions of southern Chihuahua state and in the northwest section of the state, analysts said, and has diversified into a wide range of criminal enterprises, including drug trafficking, extortion and kidnapping Across the state border, in neighboring Sonora, Los Salazar has operated mostly in the southern part of the state and has been associated with what Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City, called “a significant rise in violence in the past two years.” The group has also been a regional ally of the Sinaloa Cartel. Mr. Hope said that a significant transit route for illegal drugs runs through the area of Agua Prieta, the border town where Monday’s clash took place. But analysts also pointed out that a history of tension between the Mormon communities and the criminal organizations they have spoken out against also allows for the possibility that the families were targeted. “These are pretty brutal groups,” said Tony Payan of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “They would not stop at killing children.” Elisabeth Malkin and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.']","Hours before six children and three women were killed, two rival gangs had a shootout near the U.S. border."
Girls as Young as 12 Were Strip-Searched in Australia,2019-11-06,By Isabella Kwai,"[' SYDNEY, Australia — Girls as young as 12 have been strip-searched by the police in Australia’s most populous state in recent years, according to data released on Wednesday, a revelation that spurred new criticism of a tactic frequently used to hunt for drugs at places like music festivals.  The police minister for the state of New South Wales, David Elliott, acknowledged that officers had not always abided by standard procedures in conducting strip searches of children, which are legal if the circumstances are urgent and a parent or guardian is present.   But he said that if drugs were uncovered in the process, parents would nonetheless be happy. “I’ve got young children, and if I thought that the police felt that they were at risk of doing something wrong, I’d want them strip-searched,” he said. Civil liberties advocates strenuously disagreed. They called the searches an invasive overstep of paternalistic police powers that leave psychological trauma. They also said laws allowing the tactic reflected a zero-tolerance drug policy that is doing more harm than good. “It’s the only form of legislation that allows an adult to tell a young child to take off all their clothes,” said Samantha Lee, the head of the Police Accountability Practice at the Redfern Legal Center, which obtained the data through a freedom of information request. “If it was any other circumstance, the law would come down hard and heavy.” From mid-2016 to mid-2019 in New South Wales, a state of 7.5 million people, 122 girls under the age of 18 were strip-searched in places outside police stations. Among them were two 12-year-olds and eight 13-year-olds. Searches of boys were not included in the data. The new statistics follow months of increasing scrutiny of the growing practice of strip searches by police officers. From mid-2005 to mid-2018, such searches in New South Wales, which includes Sydney, increased almost twentyfold. In about two-thirds of cases, the police did not find illegal drugs. While strip searches occur in most of Australia, festivals in New South Wales have become infamous for them, with police officers often patrolling with drug detection dogs. But critics said that such searches, which have also occurred at parks and train stations, should not be routinely conducted for the relatively minor offense of drug possession.  “It’s highly likely the vast majority of strip searches are being conducted unlawfully,” said Vicki Sentas, a senior law lecturer at the University of New South Wales who has researched strip-searching statistics. In an inquiry conducted last month by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, a 16-year-old girl who attended a festival said she was asked to squat and cough in front of a police officer. She had no drugs.  “I could not stop crying. I was completely humiliated,” she said, according to her complaint. An officer who worked at the festival admitted that some of the searches he conducted may have been unlawful. Mark Speakman, the state’s attorney general, said that strip searches in general were an “important investigative tool” but that the police needed to “get the balance right.” Tyson Koh, the leader of Keep Sydney Open, a political party critical of strip searches at festivals, said it was time to scrutinize such arguments. “For the longest time, people have been willing to put up with it because it’s been sold as being for the greater good,” Mr. Koh said. “More people are really starting to question police and government in these situations.” Ms. Lee, of the Redfern Legal Center, has called for changes to legislation that would specify under which circumstances strip searches could occur and require court orders for children to be searched. “The problem has been left to fester for many years,” she said. “It’s time the police force caught up.” Sasha Gattermayr contributed reporting.']","A police official said, “I’ve got young children, and if I thought that the police felt that they were at risk of doing something wrong, I’d want them strip-searched.” "
Why Is Australia Trying to Shut Down Climate Activism?,2019-11-06,By Damien Cave and Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['SYDNEY, Australia — One climate activist halted train service by chaining himself to the tracks. Others have glued themselves to busy roads, causing gridlock. And just last week, protesters locked arms to stop people from entering a mining conference before being forcibly dispersed by police officers with pepper spray.  A surge of climate activism is flooding Australia as the country falls behind on its promise to reduce emissions — effectively ignoring the Paris Agreement the Trump administration just abandoned. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has responded with a threat that’s alarmed scientists and free speech advocates, arguing that the government should outlaw “indulgent and selfish” efforts by environmental groups to rattle businesses with rallies and boycotts. “The right to protest does not mean there is an unlimited license to disrupt people’s lives,” Mr. Morrison said, adding, “I am very concerned about this new form of progressivism.” Australia’s “climate wars,” once confined to election campaigns, are now spilling into the streets with some of the biggest protests the country has ever seen. An increasingly outraged public is demanding action while the conservative national government refuses to budge, relying on the police to squelch dissent.  Australia, of course, is not alone. There have been large climate protests around the globe this year. But while many nations seem willing to tolerate the boycott campaigns and civil disobedience, Australia appears determined to suppress the activism, even as heat waves, drought and fires make the country’s vulnerabilities to climate change ever clearer.  Why has Australia become such an intense climate battleground? The forces defining the conflict are wrapped up in national identity, economics and a growing divide between government and public opinion.  Two years ago, when Mr. Morrison was Australia’s treasurer, he stood up in the House of Representatives with a hunk of black coal in his hand. “Don’t be afraid. Don’t be scared,” he said. “It won’t hurt you.” His shiny prop had been shellacked to keep his hands clean, but the point he made then is one he and his governing coalition stand by: Coal is good.  Scientists strongly disagree, warning that the world stands little chance of averting the most dire effects of climate change without ending its reliance on burning coal for energy. But Australia has an emotional and historical connection to it that continues to shape its politics.  The combustible rock was first mentioned in government records soon after British settlement. Now, Australia is the world’s largest coal exporter. It is also a major exporter of natural gas, making for a resource-driven country that is “rich, dumb and getting dumber,” according to one recent headline summarizing the findings of a Harvard study that ranked Australia’s economy 93rd in complexity, behind Kazakhstan, Uganda and Senegal. The mingling of mining interests with national interests is perpetuated through a revolving door: lawmakers frequently work for the coal industry after leaving office. And for some, defending coal has come to be equated with defending the country.  Even the opposition center-left Labor Party is hooked, pushing for emissions cuts while continuing to support more coal mining. “They’re trying to play both sides,” said David Ritter, the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia. “They’re avoiding the work that’s necessary to create a clean energy economy.” Poll after poll shows growing concern about climate change among Australians of all ages and political persuasions. In September, a survey by the Australia Institute found that 81 percent of Australians believe climate change will result in more droughts and flooding (up from 78 percent in 2018). Two out of three Australians agreed that the government should plan for an orderly phaseout of coal, while 64 percent said Australia should aim for net-zero emissions by 2050. And researchers continue to sound the alarm. A paper co-written by an Australian scientist and signed by 11,000 other experts warned on Wednesday of a clear “climate emergency.”  “There is high concern in Australia about climate change, but the political process doesn’t seem to be responding at all,” said David C. Holmes, director of Monash University’s Climate Change Communication Research Hub, which focuses on climate literacy.  As a result, he added, “certain segments of the population get very frustrated — more and more of them are willing to come out and march.” The so-called climate strike in September, part of a global effort led by children, was the largest mass demonstration in Australian history. It was quickly followed last month by the Extinction Rebellion protests, and then came last week’s anti-mining protests in Melbourne.  “Decades of lobbying have gotten us nowhere,” said Edward Plowman, one of the anti-mining organizers. “So we’re committed to using direct action.” Mr. Morrison is not alone in noticing that disruptive acts have become increasingly common.  Extinction Rebellion encourages activists to get arrested so they can use the courts as a platform to call for climate action. Some delay their removal and draw the news media by locking or gluing themselves in place. In Brisbane, one activist harnessed himself below a bridge with a “climate emergency” sign. Other countries have dealt with these tactics through persistent arrests. Over 10 days of protests in London, the police arrested more than 1,700 Extinction Rebellion protesters. Australia aims to go further. A law passed last year allows the military to break up protests. The Labor government in Queensland is fast-tracking a law to add new fines for protesters who use locking devices to prevent their removal.  Mr. Morrison has also focused on an indirect form of disruption: boycotts or other efforts to pressure businesses, including banks, to cut ties with companies that environmentalists oppose. He said he was looking to prevent boycotts from spreading to any industry with a significant carbon footprint, such as airlines. Robyn Eckersley, an expert on the politics of climate change at the University of Melbourne, said Mr. Morrison’s statements fit the government’s playbook of deflecting and dividing to preserve policy inaction.  “When they talk about climate change and criticize protesters, they tackle it not in terms of the problem,” she said. “What they do is aim for the person and what they stand for in a way that will appeal to their people, to their base.”  As the climate conflict intensifies, activists and their opponents are fighting hard to win over public opinion — often with misconceptions used to maximize alarm.  Take coal. Reduced coal mining would not hurt the economy as much as people think.  According to the Australia Institute poll from last month, Australians believe coal mining accounts for 12.5 percent of Australia’s economic output and employs 9.3 percent of its work force. “In reality,” the report says, “coal mining employs only 0.4 percent of workers in Australia and is 2.2 percent of Australia’s G.D.P.” Of the roughly 238,000 jobs that mining provides in Australia, only around 50,000 are tied to coal, according to government figures.  “The government relies on ignorance,” Professor Eckersley said. “It’s a very toxic politics.” Portrayals of extreme activism are also exaggerated. The vast majority of protesters demanding climate action are not radical disrupters. They are more like Jemima Grimmer, 13, who asked adults to “respect our futures” at the Sydney climate strike in September, or Vivian Malo, an Aboriginal woman attending last week’s protest in Melbourne, where she said the experience of being pepper-sprayed felt like chemotherapy “on the outside.”  Here in a country rapidly losing its laid-back image, the future of Australia’s climate battles could be seen in her bloodshot eyes as she stood near a line of stone-faced police officers, describing their use of force as “scary.”  “The insatiable drive for resource extraction,” she said. “It’s out of control.”']",An increasingly outraged public is demanding action in a nation intimately linked to coal mining. The government has responded by threatening a new law to punish protesters. 
Pompeo and Netanyahu Push to Scrap Iran Nuclear Pact,2019-11-07,By David M. Halbfinger and Richard Pérez-Peña,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Thursday that the International Atomic Energy Agency had validated his longstanding allegation that Iran has been maintaining a secret nuclear site in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty — a claim that the agency did not publicly confirm.   Mr. Netanyahu’s assertion came as the Vienna-based agency held a closed-door meeting on Thursday about questions concerning Iran’s “safeguard declarations,”  but did not specify more precisely what had been discussed.  The Israeli leader spoke hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, while visiting Europe, accused Iran of “nuclear extortion” by having accelerated its ability to develop a nuclear weapon in a shortened time frame.  The statements from Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Pompeo, both avowed critics of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, appeared aimed at escalating the pressure on the Europeans to abandon the accord instead of scrambling to salvage it, as they have been doing since President Trump formally withdrew last year and reimposed tough sanctions on Iran. “The IAEA now confirms that Iran lied. And that Iran continues to lie,” Mr. Netanyahu said. ”Europe must stop stalling,” he added. “It must act against Iranian aggression now.” Mr. Netanyahu was referring to a site in Turquzabad, south of Tehran, where, in a speech at the United Nations in September 2018, he charged that Iran had been storing “massive amounts” of nuclear equipment and material. He said then that Israel had shared that information with the  agency’s inspectors.  Providing further details, Israeli intelligence and national security officials contended late Thursday that the atomic agency’s inspections earlier this year, including analysis of samples taken from the site, had shown that Iran stored nuclear material at the Turquzabad site that had been converted from raw uranium but not yet enriched. The Israelis also said the material’s characteristics and age did not correspond with any nuclear facility previously disclosed by Iran. In other words, the Israeli officials said, the inspection pointed to the existence of a secret Iranian nuclear conversion facility, which if confirmed amounted to a fresh violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty’s safeguards agreement. The Israeli officials briefed international journalists on the condition that their names, titles and agencies not be published. Echoing the prime minister, the Israeli officials expressed hope that what they described as the new finding would help persuade the international community — and in particular Germany, France and Britain, along with the broader European Union — to abandon hopes of reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and join with the United States in its “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against Iran. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said Iran was moving toward being able to develop a nuclear weapon in a short time frame,  asserting that Iran’s behavior should inspire “all nations” to increase pressure.  But he made no threat of military action. Nor did the Israelis, though they considered striking Iran’s facilities several times before the 2015 nuclear accord had been reached under the Obama administration.  In response to President Trump’s abandonment of the accord,  the Iranians began edging out of its restrictions earlier this year, saying they would not remain in compliance while the United States was violating its terms by reimposing sanctions.  Iran said this week that it had increased its supply of advanced centrifuges and reactivated a much larger number of old centrifuges that had been idle, accelerating its ability to produce enough nuclear material to make a bomb. The addition of centrifuges is among several steps Iran has taken in recent months to ratchet up pressure on the West in response to President Trump’s decision to exit the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions.  In a statement released by the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said Iran’s actions amounted to “nuclear extortion” and were designed to intimidate the world into accepting its sponsorship of violent insurgencies and terrorism. Mr. Pompeo was in Germany for meetings with government officials.  The moves raise “concerns that Iran is positioning itself to have the option of a rapid nuclear breakout,” Mr. Pompeo said, meaning a rush to develop a nuclear bomb. He added: “The United States will never allow this to happen.” There was no immediate response from the government of Iran, which has denied having any ambition to be a nuclear power. Experts say that Iran has not yet come near the level of uranium enrichment needed for a weapon, but some Western analysts say that if it attempted a “breakout,” Iran could develop a bomb in less than a year. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s closed-door meeting n Thursday to discuss Iran followed a recent move by the Iranian authorities to prevent an agency inspector from entering its main nuclear facility at Natanz. She was briefly detained. After the meeting, an agency spokesman, Fredrik Dahl, said that top officials had discussed “questions related to the completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations,” the commitments that nations make to the agency to ensure that nuclear material intended for peaceful uses is not diverted to weapons. The agency did not announce any actions. Under the nuclear agreement signed in 2015, Iran agreed to limit the size and scope of its uranium enrichment, in return for relief from damaging economic sanctions imposed by the United States.   President Trump withdrew the United States from that pact last year and reimposed sanctions. Administration officials say the measures are intended to pressure Tehran to agree to stricter limits and cut off its support for militia groups around the Middle East. Iran has responded with its own pressure campaign, deliberately going beyond the limits imposed by the 2015 deal as it pushes for relief from the sanctions.  Mr. Pompeo landed in Germany on Wednesday for a two-day trip commemorating 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and, with it, the Iron Curtain that once divided Europe into the communist east and democratic west. As a United States soldier, Mr. Pompeo was posted in 1986 to a base in Bindlach, Bavaria, where he was focused on securing the borders with what was then East Germany and Czechoslovakia. That base closed in the 1990s when the United States drew down its troop strength after German reunification. He met on Thursday with German and American veterans who served at the same time. He also toured a village known as Little Berlin, which once straddled the border.  Later Thursday, he traveled to Leipzig to meet with Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, and tour the St. Nicholas church, where East Germans held mass demonstrations calling for democratic reforms in 1989. American-German relations have been strained under Mr. Trump, who has frequently criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel and her policies on immigration, climate change and Iran. On Friday, Mr. Pompeo is to meet in Berlin with Ms. Merkel and her ministers of defense and finance. David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, and Richard Pérez-Peña from London.

"Xi Jinping Endorses Carrie Lam, Embattled Hong Kong Leader",2019-11-05,By Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley,"['SHANGHAI — President Xi Jinping of China publicly backed the beleaguered leader of Hong Kong on Monday, in his most direct public comments so far on the pro-democracy protests that have shaken the city for months and raised doubts about her political survival.  Mr. Xi gave his endorsement while meeting the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, in Shanghai on Monday night, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, reported early Tuesday.  Mrs. Lam briefed Mr. Xi on developments in Hong Kong, where demonstrators have protested for 22 weeks to demand the introduction of wider democracy in the semiautonomous city, which falls under Chinese sovereignty as a “special administrative region.”  If Mr. Xi had any criticisms of Mrs. Lam’s handling of the protests, they were not revealed by Xinhua. In the face of the tumult, he told Mrs. Lam, “you have led the government of the special administrative region in diligently carrying out duties and striving to stabilize the situation,” according to the news agency. “The central leadership has high confidence in you, and fully affirms the work of you and your administrative team,” Mr. Xi said. “Halting the violence and restoring order remain the most important duty in Hong Kong at present.” At the same time, Mr. Xi reminded Mrs. Lam of Beijing’s support for a stern approach to the protests, which have grown increasingly violent in the face of heavy-handed policing. He “demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law,” according to Xinhua. Mr. Xi and Mrs. Lam were both in Shanghai for the China International Import Expo, for which Mr. Xi delivered an opening speech on trade and economic policy on Tuesday. Mrs. Lam’s tenure as Hong Kong’s top official, or chief executive, depends on the effective blessing of Mr. Xi. His public endorsement may offer political relief after persistent rumors that he could press her to step down after the protests subside. Still, Mrs. Lam’s survival may depend on going along with plans that Chinese leaders announced last week to impose tougher “national security” measures on Hong Kong. Such a step could give fresh impetus to the protesters, whose demands have included Mrs. Lam’s resignation and democratic elections for chief executive and for the entire Hong Kong Legislative Council. The Chinese Communist Central Committee, a gathering of about 370 senior officials, endorsed plans last week to “build and improve a legal system and enforcement mechanism to defend national security” in Hong Kong. The communiqué from that meeting was released Tuesday evening. Although it included more than a dozen mentions of Hong Kong, it had few details of what Beijing has in mind. Beijing’s plans may include national security legislation that could help stifle antigovernment demonstrations. The Basic Law, the mini-constitution that defines Hong Kong’s status, requires that the territory pass its own national security laws, but it has not done so. In 2003, the Hong Kong government abandoned proposed legislation after protests inundated city streets. Shen Chunyao, the head of a Chinese legislative committee that helps oversee Hong Kong policy, told a news conference in Beijing on Friday that the Chinese leadership also wanted “patriotic education” in Hong Kong to foster stronger loyalty to China, especially among youth and government workers. The communiqué released on Tuesday also called for enhancing “the national consciousness and patriotism of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots.” Mr. Shen indicated that China may revise how Hong Kong’s chief executive is chosen, but gave no details. The chief executive is currently chosen by a 1,200-member election committee dominated by pro-Beijing groups. There are signs that Beijing’s control of the committee may erode in the coming years unless the rules for choosing its members are changed.  The communiqué went further in saying that the central government “will improve the system and mechanism for the appointment and removal” not just of the chief executive but also of other principal officials in Hong Kong. The brief Xinhua report about the meeting between Mr. Xi and Mrs. Lam did not mention those initiatives. But it did list four other officials as attending the meeting, including one whose inclusion may indicate Beijing’s perception of a security threat in Hong Kong: Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security. The communiqué drew a hard line on what the party perceives as a security threat, saying, “We will resolutely prevent and contain external forces from interfering in Hong Kong and Macau affairs and conducting separatism, subversion, infiltration and destruction activities.” Mrs. Lam appears likely to hear more about Beijing’s plans when she attends meetings there on Wednesday, including one with Han Zheng, the Chinese vice premier who oversees policy toward Hong Kong. “The restoration process will be very long term and very difficult,” Tian Feilong, a Chinese law professor who specializes on Hong Kong said at a talk in Beijing on Monday. China had granted Hong Kong considerable autonomy, he said, adding, “high autonomy means high responsibility.” Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.']","The Chinese president gave strong backing to the Hong Kong chief executive, whose resignation has been sought by the territory’s pro-democracy movement."
Pro-Beijing Lawmaker Stabbed in Hong Kong,2019-11-06,By Austin Ramzy and Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — A pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in Hong Kong while canvassing for votes on Wednesday, the latest incident of political violence in a city convulsed by months of antigovernment protests. The politician, Junius Ho, who many protesters accuse of supporting mob attacks on demonstrators, did not appear to be seriously injured. He helped subdue the attacker, according to video of the incident, and was conscious when he was taken to a hospital. Several political figures have been assaulted in recent weeks in Hong Kong, including three pro-democracy candidates for upcoming district council elections. On Sunday, Andrew Chiu, a pro-democracy district council member, had part of his ear bitten off when he tried to restrain a man, apparently an opponent of the protests, who stabbed two people outside a shopping mall. The attacks until now have been primarily focused on members of the pro-democracy camp, although Mr. Ho’s district offices and his parents’ gravestones had previously been vandalized. Video of the assault shows Mr. Ho, who was campaigning on a sidewalk in the Tuen Mun neighborhood, being approached by a man in a blue shirt and holding a bouquet of flowers. “These flowers\xa0are for you, everyone has seen your efforts,” said the man in blue. “That’s thoughtful, thank you,” said Mr. Ho as he accepted the bouquet. “Would you mind,” the man begins to ask. “I take a photo with you?” Mr. Ho said. “I’ll take my phone out first, O.K.?” the man said, reaching into his bag and pulling out an object that appeared to be a knife. He quickly thrust it toward Mr. Ho’s torso. Mr. Ho and others quickly subdued the attacker. The lawmaker appeared to be bleeding from his chest, but remained standing and was conscious when he was later wheeled into an ambulance. A police spokesman said three men including Mr. Ho were injured in the attack. All three men were conscious when sent to the hospital, the spokesman said, and the attacker had been placed under arrest. The attacker appeared to have had a knife, the police said, but indicated the investigation was still ongoing. No details about the identity of the attacker or the third injured person were released.  The speed with which the attacker was subdued and a well-positioned camera that recorded the incident prompted some speculation on social media platforms used by protesters that the incident might have been staged. Others worried that the attack could be used to call off the city’s District Council elections scheduled for Nov. 24. The pro-establishment camp has long dominated those elections, but the opposition could make strong gains this year because of widespread anger with the government.  Hong Kong is a semiautonomous Chinese territory. The city’s top leader is picked by an election committee of about 1,200 that is controlled by pro-Beijing interests, but more than half of local lawmakers are directly elected by Hong Kong’s citizens. This year’s protests, prompted by since withdrawn legislation that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to China for trial, have expanded to include demands of greater democracy and more accountability for the police. Mr. Ho, who was elected to the Hong Kong legislative council in 2016, took on a prominent role as one of the protest movement’s chief enemies after a group of men with sticks and metal bars attacked people in a train station on July 21. At least 45 people were injured, including protesters, journalists, bystanders and a pro-democracy lawmaker. Mr. Ho was seen in a video from that night shaking hands with men in white T-shirts, the uniform of the attackers, and saying, “You guys are my heroes.” He denied any connection with the attack, saying he was merely talking with people he encountered on a walk. Later in July, Mr. Ho broadcast a video in which he appeared to make a death threat toward a pro-democracy lawmaker. In September a night of horse racing at the Happy Valley Racecourse in Hong Kong was canceled after a competition including a horse partly owned by Mr. Ho became a focus of possible protest.']",Junius Ho emerged in recent months as a chief opponent of the Hong Kong protest movement.
False Hijacking Alarm Throws Amsterdam Airport Into Chaos,2019-11-06,By Christopher F. Schuetze and Liam Stack,"['“False alarm,” the airline declared on Twitter — but by then it was too late. Military police officers, fearing a hijacking on Wednesday, had already swarmed onto the tarmac of Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, and air traffic controllers were scrambling flight schedules at one of Europe’s busiest air hubs. But Air Europa, a Spanish carrier, said it was all a mistake. A warning system on one of its flights from Amsterdam to Madrid had been accidentally activated late in the day. “Nothing has happened,” the airline said in a Twitter post more than an hour after the airport was partially shut down. “All passengers are safe and sound, and waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologize.” How the alarm was set off Air Europa did not say. Nor did it say how many passengers had been affected. But it did have some good news: “Our flight UX1094 may take off shortly to Madrid.” Hans Van Kastel, an airport spokesman, said in an interview that the situation began about 7 p.m. local time, when the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, a branch of the Dutch military, were called to the airport to investigate “a suspicious situation.”  The airline announced the false alarm shortly after the military police said on Twitter that the passengers and crew of the plane were safe, but that the investigation was continuing.  As early reports came in, Mark Rutte, the country’s prime minister, did not alter his schedule, but he did say he was monitoring the situation. “Something is going on, we are finding out what is going on,” he told reporters. “I hope it ends well.” Images on social media showed sections of the airport closed off, with armed officers standing nearby and crowds of passengers waiting. The airport said that Terminal D had been temporarily closed because of the incident but that it reopened around 9 p.m. One passenger, Ewan MacIntosh, arrived on a KLM flight from Hamburg, Germany, to a scene of confusion on the tarmac. Emergency responders were swarming to one area, while idling planes accumulated in others, he said in an online message. “Pilot saying things are fairly chaotic — there’s no ground staff at all at this pier to help,” Mr. MacIntosh said. He said the pilot told passengers “there are lots of fire brigade, police and ambulances Mr. MacIntosh said his plane had sat on the tarmac for 20 minutes until a gate was found. Terminal D, he said, looked “pretty closed off and empty.” After the airline’s sheepish twitter post, life returned to normal. Mr. MacIntosh said travelers were flooding back into the terminal D and making their way to delayed flights.

"Italy’s Students Will Get a Lesson in Climate Change. Many Lessons, in Fact.",2019-11-05,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Yes, children, climate change will be on the test. Italy’s education minister said Tuesday that its public schools would soon require students in every grade to study climate change and sustainability, a step he said would put Italy at the forefront of environmental education worldwide.   The lessons, at first taught as part of the students’ civics education, will eventually become integrated throughout a variety of subjects — a sort of “Trojan horse” that will “infiltrate” all courses, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, said. Environmental advocates welcomed the new subject matter, with some caveats. Teaching children about sustainability is “certainly very important” said Edoardo Zanchini, vice president of Legambiente, Italy’s leading environmental group. But he warned that responsibility should not simply be passed on to children. “Science tells us the next 10 years are crucial,” he said. “We cannot wait for the next generation.” Mr. Fioramonti is a member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which has long put environmental concerns at the heart of its identity. He has already become a target of conservatives for backing taxes on sugar and plastics, and for encouraging students to take part in climate protests last September instead of attending class. Starting in September 2020, he said, teachers in every grade will lead lessons in climate change and environmental sustainability. That 33-hour-a-year lesson, he said, will be used as a pilot program to ultimately fold the climate agenda of the United Nations into the entire curriculum. So merely studying place names and locations in geography class? “Forget that,” Mr. Fioramonti said. Geography courses will soon study the impact of human actions on different parts of the planet, too, he said.  In an interview, Mr. Fioramonti said that a group of experts — including Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, and Kate Raworth of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute — will act as “peer reviewers” for ministry staff preparing the curriculum. By January, he said, the ministry will be ready to train teachers. For children age 6 to 11, he said, “we are thinking of using the fairy-tale model,” in which stories from different cultures would emphasize a connection to the environment. Middle schoolers would be expected to learn more technical information, and high school students would explore the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in depth. Until August, Five Star had governed Italy for more than a year with the nationalist League party, led by Matteo Salvini, who is still the country’s most popular politician, and who has a skeptical view of climate change. One cold spring day in Milan, Mr. Salvini, then the interior minister, appeared to trivialize climate change. “Talking about global warming — we are in the middle of May and call upon global warming, because we haven’t had a cold like this in Italy in recent years,” he said. “We are turning on our heaters.” Mr. Fioramonti suggested that Mr. Salvini needed to be educated. “That’s the kind of nonsense we want to avoid by educating children that this is the most important challenge humanity has ever faced,” he said. “And I want to secure this before there is any change in government that can imperil that kind of process.” But Mr. Salvini still looms over the wobbly Five-Star-led government, and Italy’s many government collapses in recent years have cut short other educational programs. An attempt by a left-leaning government to teach children how to spot disinformation, for example, was discontinued after it lost power. Mr. Fioramonti said a law passed last year, when Five Star was still aligned with the League, gave him the authority to introduce lessons on climate change. He said that the conditions had not been right to go forward with the new curriculum then, but that they were now. Still, many Italians are concerned that Five Star’s emphasis on environmental issues — or, perhaps, its failure to pursue such goals competently — is destroying the country’s economy.  This month, Italy faced a new economic emergency when the foreign operator of a southern Italian steel plant, Ilva, said it would pull out because the Five Star-led government had decided to end criminal immunity for environmental breaches even as the company sought to clean up the polluted facilities. Such a move could cost Italy more than 8,000 jobs. One environmental activist expressed reservations that Mr. Fioramonti’s plan may be too dogmatic. Chicco Testa, president of the environmental group Assombiente, urged officials to make sure children were exposed to varied views, including those who claim that climate change is not primarily caused by man. “To listen to people who say different things is good,” he said. “What the U.N. says is not gospel.” But as President Trump began pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement this week, Mr. Fioramonti said that every country needed to do its part to stop the “Trumps of the world” and that his ambition was to show children there was another way.  “The 21st century citizen,” he said, “must be a sustainable citizen.” Anna Momigliano contributed reporting.']",Public schools will require children in every grade to study sustainability.

Macron Says NATO Is Experiencing ‘Brain Death’ Because of Trump,2019-11-07,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — French President Emmanuel Macron shocked allies in an interview published on Thursday, saying that he did not know whether NATO’s commitment to collective defense was still valid and that the alliance was experiencing “brain death” because of a lack of strategic coordination and leadership from the United States. “What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” Mr. Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” notably by pulling troops out of northeastern Syria without notice, and he called on Europeans, as he has often done, to do more in their own defense with the aim of “strategic autonomy.’’ Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany responded unusually sharply to what she called Mr. Macron’s “drastic words,” which she does not share. “That is not my point of view,” Ms. Merkel said in Berlin when asked about Mr. Macron’s remarks.   “I don’t think that such sweeping judgments are necessary, even if we have problems and need to pull together,” Ms. Merkel said. “NATO remains vital to our security.” Asked for his own response, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised NATO in the eastern German city of Leipzig, after spending the morning touring the former border that divided East Germany from the West, where he was an officer in the United States Army.  “I think NATO remains an important, critical, perhaps historically one of the most critical strategic partnerships in all of recorded history,” he said. NATO was crucial to the collapse of the Iron Curtain that divided Europe for decades, he said. It was the cooperation and “remarkable work” of NATO’s democratic partners “that created freedom and brought millions of people out of very, very difficult situations.” Mr. Pompeo then went on to defend Mr. Trump’s persistent demands that Germany and other allies increase military spending to the NATO goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany, with Mr. Pompeo, also rejected Mr. Macron’s characterization. “I do not believe NATO is brain dead,” he said. “I firmly believe in international cooperation.” NATO leaders will gather in London for an abbreviated summit meeting on Dec. 3 and 4 to mark the alliance’s 70th anniversary. Mr. Macron’s pessimistic views about its future are bound to overshadow the meeting, which was already designed to be brief given Mr. Trump’s own harsh criticism of NATO allies for not spending enough in their own defense. Mr. Macron also wants Europeans to spend more on defense, but in pursuit of their own strategic goals, in collaboration with NATO but not beholden to it.  His remarks were clearly in response to some of Mr. Trump’s unilateral actions. “You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies. None,” Mr. Macron said. ‘‘You have an uncoordinated aggressive action by another NATO ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are at stake,” he added. “There has been no NATO planning, nor any coordination.’’ Turkey’s military operation against Kurdish forces in northern Syria was opposed by fellow NATO members like France, but made possible by Mr. Trump’s sudden withdrawal of United States forces, against the advice of American officials, after a telephone conversation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. NATO functions well in the military sphere, coordinating armies and commands, Mr. Macron said. But “strategically and politically, we need to recognize that we have a problem,” he said. “We should reassess the reality of what NATO is in light of the commitment of the United States.’’ In fact, despite Mr. Trump’s often truculent criticism and his own early reluctance to support collective defense, he has authorized a sizable increase in the American commitment of money and troops to NATO and European defense, including putting American troops in Poland and rotating through the Baltic nations. Even France, a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, is not reaching the NATO goal, projected by NATO to spend 1.84 percent of gross domestic product on defense this year. The interview with Mr. Macron took place on Oct. 21 in his Paris office in French, but was not released until Thursday by The Economist, in both French and English. Mr. Macron’s real worry seemed to be the sleepwalking drift of Europe, caught between Russia, China and the United States. “All this has led to the exceptional fragility of Europe, which if it can’t think of itself as a global power, will disappear,” he said. Mr. Macron has pushed for closer European integration, a rapprochement with Russia, a tougher line on Brexit and an end to the enlargement of the European Union until the process can be rethought.  The remarks reflected both his striving for a leadership role in a Europe, where Ms. Merkel is perceived to be weakened and Britain is leaving, and also his move to the right for his own domestic political purposes. But his comments brought some sharp criticism from analysts. François Heisbourg, a French defense expert, said that Mr. Macron, who loves to talk, “is speaking like a policy-detached think-tanker” and not the leader of a key NATO ally. Mr. Heisbourg called Mr. Macron’s comments “bizarre” and “dangerous” for a head of state. Mr. Macron’s comments “will really damage NATO and could be seized upon by its opponents, including Trump,"" Thomas Wright, a senior fellow at Washington’s Brookings Institution, wrote on Twitter.  He called the interview “deliberate, provocative and catastrophic,” and added that Mr. Macron “increasingly acts unilaterally without coordinating with the rest of the E.U. or even without informing his own officials and government colleagues.” Ulrich Speck, a German analyst, said in a Twitter response: “With Macron saying that NATO is ‘brain-dead,’ it becomes clearer what ‘strategic autonomy’ means for him: A Europe without NATO.” His words seemed a direct challenge to Berlin, too, Mr. Speck said. Shashank Joshi, the Economist’s defense editor, said: “I cannot imagine how Macron could possibly have thrown a bigger stink-bomb toward NATO ahead of the London summit of leaders in December. Extraordinary words, and extraordinary timing.’’ Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, was also in Berlin for celebrations of the 30th anniversary on Saturday of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He praised NATO and the American role in Europe. “The reunification of Germany and Europe would have been impossible without the United States’ security guarantee,” he said. “Any attempt to distance Europe from North America will not only weaken the trans-Atlantic alliance, it also risks dividing Europe itself.” Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']","The French president wonders whether NATO is still committed to collective defense, denounces American unilateralism and calls for more European autonomy."
"In the British Election, a Series of Missteps",2019-11-07,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Nobody expected Britain’s general election to follow a smooth script, and by the end of a second hectic day of campaigning both of the country’s major parties had suffered a series of unexpected bumps and blows. On Thursday, it was the opposition Labour Party’s turn. Two former Labour members of Parliament declared that they planned to vote for the Conservative Party because they said Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was unfit to be prime minister. Their comments came a day after the sudden resignation of the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who had tangled for years with Mr. Corbyn over Brexit policy and anti-Semitism in the party’s upper ranks. The upheaval threw Labour’s campaign into disarray only a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives stumbled out of the gate. In just 24 hours they were hit with the sudden resignation of one of Mr. Johnson’s cabinet ministers in a legal scandal, an apology from another following widely condemned comments about the Grenfell Tower fire and accusations that the party had doctored a TV interview with a prominent Labour politician. In Labour’s case, the internal dissent resurfaced allegations of anti-Semitism that have long haunted the party. “I can’t really believe it’s come to this, but I think I need to tell people that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t fit to lead the Labour Party,” Ian Austin, who had been an adviser to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said in an emotional interview broadcast on Sky News. “He’s certainly not fit to lead the country.” Mr. Austin, who left the party earlier this year, accused Mr. Corbyn of having sided with Britain’s enemies, whether it be the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland or Hamas and Hezbollah in the Middle East. The adopted son of a Czech-Jewish father who fled the Nazis, Mr. Austin said Mr. Corbyn had allowed a culture of extremism and anti-Semitism to fester in the Labour Party. He was joined by another former Labour lawmaker, John Woodcock, who also said he would vote for Mr. Johnson. Their rebellion coincided with a front-page article in an influential London-based Jewish newspaper, the Jewish Chronicle, which urged non-Jews to vote against the Labour Party because of what the editors said was Mr. Corbyn’s long record of espousing and tolerating anti-Semitic views. “There were some who hoped that he might change as leader,” the paper said. “The opposite has happened. The near total inaction of Mr. Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership in dealing with anti-Semites in the party has both emboldened them and encouraged others.” Mr. Corbyn, a strong critic of Israel, has long denied being an anti-Semite. He said the Labour Party had investigated the allegations and suspended or expelled members found guilty of anti-Jewish statements. He did not address the latest charges, which dominated news coverage on a day when he had hoped to sharpen Labour’s attack on Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives for their policy of a swift exit from the European Union. Mr. Watson’s resignation revealed other tensions in the party, which have deepened since Mr. Corbyn became leader in 2015. As deputy leader, he had been the most senior of Mr. Corbyn’s critics to survive with a leadership role in the party and had used that position to promote a conspicuously different agenda. An outspoken opponent of Brexit, Mr. Watson pressed first to embrace the policy of holding a second referendum and then, unsuccessfully, sought to make Labour commit to remaining in the European Union. Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, resisted that, insisting that Labour should stick to a policy of negotiating a new Brexit deal, then putting that to a referendum with the alternative option of remaining in the bloc. Mr. Watson was also vocal in his criticism of the party’s failure to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism. He expressed alarm when another Labour lawmaker, Luciana Berger, quit, saying she had been driven out of the party. It was, he said, the “worst day of shame” in the party’s history. After Ms. Berger and a handful of other lawmakers left the party this year to protest Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, Mr. Watson formed a new caucus for social democrats and urged the centrists to stay and fight. However, he now becomes the latest moderate lawmaker to quit Parliament, among them Owen Smith, who challenged Mr. Corbyn for the leadership in 2016 — an exodus that is noticeable in the Conservative Party as well and that analysts say is radicalizing both of them. For Mr. Corbyn’s most ardent supporters, Mr. Watson had become a reviled figure. On the eve of the Labour Party’s annual conference in September, allies of Mr. Corbyn tried unsuccessfully to abolish his job. He also came under fire for raising accusations that prominent British establishment figures had sexually abused boys — claims made by a man whose evidence subsequently proved to be false. In his resignation letter, Mr. Watson promised to continue to fight for Labour. Unlike Mr. Austin and Mr. Woodcock, he said he would support the party’s candidates in the general election.']","In a bitter and divisive campaign, the Conservatives stumbled first. Labour soon followed, with resignations and charges of anti-Semitism."
"Football’s Longest Drive: 1,000 Miles Across Australia",2019-11-07,By Matthew Abbott,"['LAJAMANU, Australia — Halfway into a 400-mile journey through a dusty stretch of the Australian desert, the team’s minibus ran into trouble.  The players, Warlpiri Australians from one of the country’s most isolated towns, were headed to a carnival, a celebration of sport and culture that brings together far-flung Indigenous communities from across the Central Desert. Much of the drive to the site of the event, in Yuendumu, from their home in Lajamanu, Northern Territory, was a straight shot along the infamous and empty Tanami Road, a bone-rattling dirt track that stretches 650 miles.  But the trip was just a short jaunt for the players, who have traveled up to 1,000 miles to play their favorite game, a sport called “bush footy.” The game is a take on Australian rules football, one of the world’s most brutal sports. It is the town’s saving grace, residents say — a diversion from everyday hardships in a place with a harsh climate and few employment opportunities. “All them young fellas getting stuck in town and getting into trouble,” said Dione Kelly, the team’s coach. “That’s why we take them out to other communities competing in football.” Nearly every young man in town — and some old men and quite a few women — play the sport, which some experts argue was inspired by an ancient Indigenous game, known locally as purlja. There are just 600 residents in Lajamanu, but it’s home to five bush footy teams, with 18 players on a side. When a carnival is on, nearly the entire town attends. Suddenly, though, the team’s presence at this carnival was in jeopardy. Just before the bus reached the first of two turns in the entire journey, the flashing lights of a police car appeared. “I understand that everyone is traveling to the carnival, but it’s my responsibility to make sure everyone gets there safely,” said Garry Willmett, the officer who pulled over the bus. “So you’re not going anywhere, until I see a license.” The only problem: No one on the bus had one. Also, no one was wearing a seatbelt. And the bus was overcrowded. And it was probably speeding.  Such run-ins with the police are common in Lajamanu (as are other social problems, including substance abuse, domestic violence and suicide). Residents feel they are often unfairly singled out by the authorities who many see as discriminatory and heavy handed. “Three of those boys have warrants out for their arrests, including the driver,” said Clint Firth, a representative of the Australian Football League, the sport’s professional league and governing body, who was watching the scene from another car traveling with the team as part of a convoy. “They’ll probably be running out into the bush now.” The traffic stop came not just with the threat of arrest but of derailing the entire town’s chance of properly enjoying the carnival. Fortunately, a town elder with a license, traveling in another car in the convoy, offered to take over driving the minibus. Satisfied with this arrangement, the officer sent the team, and the convoy of townspeople, back on their way. Not even a mile later, when the coast was clear, the vehicles pulled over and the drivers swapped again. “He’s a new cop, only just arrived in town. Things are different here,” Mr. Firth said. “The last guy was completely different, he realized you can’t book people for small things. Otherwise you’ll be arresting the whole town.” Across Central Australia, Indigenous players and their families see bush footy as an opportunity to connect with their neighbors, their relatives in faraway towns and their culture. “Same like Brazil,” said Cyril Tasman, one of the elders from Lajamanu who supports the team. “They got their footy, we got our footy. It’s like a religion here.” As the team continued its journey, the bus passed burned-out cars, the odd tourist and the Outback’s famous road trains — trucks pulling three or four trailers at a time. The serpentine vehicles can stretch up to 200 feet and kick up dust for miles in their wakes. Shortly after dusk the team pulled into a bus shelter for a meal of corned beef and bread. The area near the Granites, a gold mine, is one of the few spots in the desert between Lajamanu and Yuendumu that has cell service, and the players scrambled to check their phones.  The mine, founded in 1993 by an American company, compensates the land’s traditional owners from Lajamanu and Yuendumu. These royalties help pay for the carnivals by providing money for food, transport and programs run by the A.F.L. Just past 11 p.m., with the fuel light on, the bus made its second turn of the trip, arriving at Yuendumu. The team scattered as each player found a room or camped on the veranda of a relative’s house. This year, 17 men’s and eight women’s teams entered the carnival. It was only the second time in more than 50 years that a women’s competition was also held. Other sports are also typically played during the carnival, including basketball and softball, and the festival features other aspects of the local culture, including art and dance. Some of the carnival’s visitors have other pursuits on their minds as well. As Mr. Tasman, the Lajamanu elder explained: “You know, all these kids are connected on social media now. The boys and girls are talking online and these carnivals are a chance to meet in person.” But footy is the main attraction. Bush footy is played in significantly different ways than how the game is played in cities. For one, the oval, or field, is often dirt instead of grass. While the professional game has become increasingly technical and strategic, bush footy has very little structure. “It’s how they used to play the game 50 years ago,” said Mr. Firth, the football league representative. “Bush footy is pretty unique. It’s a lot looser and, to be honest, more fun.” The first day of competition started with plans to play games well into the night. But suddenly, in the middle of a game, play was halted. Players walked off the field, and the lights illuminating the oval were turned off without explanation. Gradually, a message was whispered through the crowd. There had been a death in the community and to show respect, everyone had to leave the grounds immediately. The crowd dispersed into night. The town was eerily silent, except for the faint sobbing of family members mourning the young man’s death. A rumor quickly circulated that the carnival would be canceled. By the next afternoon, though, the grieving family gave the town permission to continue the carnival. The teams took to the oval and the crowds followed, surrounding the sidelines to cheer. The Lajamanu team made it through to the quarterfinals, facing off against its archrival, the hometown team from Yuendumu. Lajamanu was winning until the game’s final minute of play, when a Yuendumu player ran the ball down the length of the field and scored a goal just as the buzzer sounded. In an instant, the team’s dreams were dashed. But there was little time for misery. They had to get back on the bus. They were expected in Katherine, 710 miles away. Another game of bush footy was waiting for them.']","For Indigenous Australians in isolated towns, “bush footy” is more religion than sport. Neither distance, the police nor even death can keep teams from competing."
Anger in Hong Kong After Student Dies From Fall Following Clash With Police,2019-11-08,By Austin Ramzy and Ezra Cheung,"['HONG KONG — A Hong Kong student died on Friday after falling earlier this week from a parking garage where police officers clashed with protesters, a development that further escalated the public’s fury after months of antigovernment demonstrations. Chow Tsz-lok, who was a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, sustained head and pelvis injuries when he fell one story early Monday morning. His death on Friday morning was confirmed by the city’s Hospital Authority. Anger with the police has run high over the force’s widespread use of tear gas, pepper spray and batons on demonstrators during five months of protest. A key demand of the protest movement, which began over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, has been an independent investigation into the police’s use of force. Thousands of people, including police officers, have been injured since the protests began in June, but despite the rising violence, no one has been killed in the clashes up until now. The police shot and wounded a demonstrator on Oct. 1 and another three days later in what they described as acts of self-defense. In addition, several protesters have killed themselves this summer. Wei Shyy, the president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, asked for a moment of silence for Mr. Chow during a graduation ceremony Friday, and was seen wiping away tears before resuming the event. The school’s student union held a moment of silence and a march on campus. Some demonstrators smashed a window and painted slogans on Mr. Shyy’s residence, calling on him to condemn the police. Others gathered for an impromptu memorial in the city’s Central district, where tempers flared after the arrival of police officers. “Do you know you can’t wear masks at a rally?” a police commander said to a man in black, citing a ban on face masks that was enacted last month under an emergency powers law. “This is a funeral, are you crazy?” another man was heard yelling back. Memorial gatherings were held in the evening across the city, including at the parking garage in the Tseung Kwan O area where Mr. Chow fell. Violent protests later broke out, with protesters throwing bricks and a police officer firing a warning shot into the air in the Yau Ma Tei neighborhood. The lawmaker Eddie Chu was arrested late Friday, and at least five other pro-democracy lawmakers were told by the police that they would be arrested in connection with scuffles in the legislature in May. Those clashes were driven by anger over the now-withdrawn extradition bill that incited the protest movement, and the detention of the lawmakers added to the grievances of protesters on the streets. Mr. Chow, 22, could be the first death as a direct result of the confrontations between the police and protesters. But what exactly led to his fall is still unclear.  Some protesters have speculated that tear gas or an effort to flee police officers were factors. But security camera video released Wednesday by the building owner did not show police officers or significant amounts of tear gas in the parking garage before Mr. Chow fell. Roger Tam, 21, a fourth-year H.K.U.S.T. science student, said he had been friends with Mr. Chow for the last three years, and they often spent time together playing video games like Grand Theft Auto. Mr. Chow played  basketball and netball and was a “keen protester” who paid close attention to the movement, Mr. Tam said. The news of Mr. Chow’s death brought a somber mood to the campus. Alvin Lee, 23, a H.K.U.S.T. student who graduated Friday, swapped his graduation gown for black clothes and a mask.  “We can’t possibly be in the mood to celebrate when such terrible things have happened to Hong Kong and when our schoolmate just died,” he said. “We want our school president to condemn the police and protect us, and we want justice for our dead schoolmate. Where is the truth?” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said Tuesday that since the case of the student’s fall was still under investigation, she would not “haphazardly jump to conclusions.” She offered her “deepest sympathies” to him. She also urged residents to stay away from the protests “in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings when the police are enforcing the law.” Suzette Foo, a senior superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Force, said that the case will be handed over to the Coroner’s Court. She said the police were “heartbroken” at Mr. Chow’s death. “No one wants to see this tragedy happen,” she added. She acknowledged on Friday that officers had been in the parking garage where Mr. Chow was found nearly an hour earlier than previously admitted. But it remained unclear what if any interactions he had with officers. Earlier this week Ms. Foo said that police officers had fired 44 rounds of tear gas, 11 rubber bullets, three beanbag rounds and one sponge grenade during operations in the Tseung Kwan O district. “The sole purpose was to disperse those protesters who had assembled, thrown hard objects and attacked the police in that area,” she said. Video from i-Cable News, a Hong Kong broadcaster, showed the police firing rounds of tear gas up into an elevated parking garage from which protesters had thrown traffic cones down. Ms. Foo said the point where the student fell was about 130 yards from where police officers fired tear gas that night. She did not deny the possibility that tear gas could have contributed to the incident, but said there was only a small amount in the air when rescuers responded. She also denied that the police had interfered with emergency responders who were treating Mr. Chow or had barred an ambulance from reaching him.  An emergency responder, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the incident, said officers tried to make rescuers leave as they were treating the injured student. They also blocked an ambulance from approaching, the emergency responder said. Video of the scene showed that another ambulance eventually took Mr. Chow to a hospital. Leung Kwok-lai, an assistant chief ambulance officer of the Fire Services Department, said Friday that the ambulance sent to aid Mr. Chow was blocked by buses and private vehicles, but that the ambulance “did not have any contact with the police on duty.” In an email to students, Mr. Shyy, the university president, called for a “thorough and independent investigation” into Mr. Chow’s death. “We demand clarifications from all parties — especially from the police, regarding the cause of the delay in those most critical moments that might have saved a young life,” he wrote. “We will be outraged if there is no acceptable explanation offered to us.” Mr. Chow’s fall followed a weekend that was punctuated by violence. Riot police officers charged into multiple shopping malls where protesters had gathered Sunday evening.  At one mall in the Quarry Bay area of Hong Kong Island, a man apparently opposed to the protests slashed a man and a woman with a knife and bit off part of the ear of a district council member who attempted to restrain him. Bystanders beat the man before the police arrived. Pro-democracy legislators said the district council member, Andrew Chiu, had surgery to reattach his ear on Monday. The man who was accused of attacking him was charged on Monday with assault causing actual body harm, the police said. A man who attempted to stab Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing legislator, is being held on a charge of attempted murder, the police said Thursday. Katherine Li and Elaine Yu contributed reporting.']","The death of the student, Chow Tsz-lok, ignited public fury after months of antigovernment demonstrations."
"With a Smile, Southeast Asian Nations Protect an Authoritarian",2019-11-07,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is not an acronym that tends to excite. Founded on notions of consensus-building and noninterference, the 10-nation group issues pronouncements drowning in careful and bland language. This week, though, regional governments have banded together to use ASEAN’s principles to justify a startling act: blocking Cambodian opposition politicians who are trying to return home to confront Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, Asia’s longest-serving authoritarian leader. On Wednesday night, Mu Sochua, the deputy leader of a political party that came closest to unseating Mr. Hun Sen in earlier elections, was detained at the airport after arriving in Malaysia, according to Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. A dual citizen, Ms. Mu Sochua tried to enter Malaysia on her American passport, said Mr. Robertson, who was in touch with Ms. Mu Sochua during her travels. She was held overnight in detention at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, he said. By Thursday evening, immigration paperwork was being processed to allow her to enter the country for five days, said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian legislator and chairman of the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, who was also in communication with Ms. Mu Sochua. The development came as members of the Cambodian opposition had hoped to converge on Phnom Penh, the capital, on Saturday, the anniversary of Cambodia’s independence from France. Mr. Hun Sen has said he will do everything possible to prevent the opposition from returning. Ms. Mu Sochua is the deputy leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved in 2017 after its leader was jailed and accused of conspiring with the United States to overthrow Mr. Hun Sen. The prime minister’s governing party won every parliamentary seat on offer in elections last year that were widely regarded as rigged, with the government having prevented Ms. Mu Sochua’s party from participating. Also on Wednesday, after Sam Rainsy, a co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, tweeted a picture of his plane ticket from Paris to Bangkok, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand made it clear that Mr. Sam Rainsy would not be able to follow his plan to land in Thailand and make his way from there to neighboring Cambodia. “Regarding the political activist from the neighboring country requesting to enter Thailand, I have proceeded by following the ASEAN resolution that we will not interfere with each other’s domestic affairs,” Mr. Prayuth said. “I have given the order. He won’t be able to enter.” The government of Mr. Prayuth, a retired army general who led the 2014 coup that kept the country under military rule for nearly five years, had earlier prevented Ms. Mu Sochua from entering Thailand. Others turned away from Thailand include Joshua Wong, the Hong Kong democracy activist. “We will not allow any resistance group to operate in Thai territory,” Mr. Prayuth said on Wednesday. But human rights advocates say that ASEAN’s neighborliness should not be used to justify strong-arm politics. Mr. Hun Sen’s government has jailed scores of dissenters and forced the exile of many more. On Thursday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia referred to Cambodia, saying that “we aren’t interested in the internal affairs of any country.” “The ASEAN spirit,” said Mr. Robertson, of Human Rights Watch, “should not be a mutual celebration in violating human rights.” On Thursday, Mr. Hun Sen noted with approval Ms. Mu Sochua’s initial detention in Malaysia. “They have cooperation with Cambodia in the ASEAN framework,” he said. Mr. Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia for 34 years, said that his long hold on power had not come up at the ASEAN summit in Bangkok earlier this week. “In the ASEAN meeting, no one talked about any issues related to Cambodia because it is the internal affairs of Cambodia,” he said. On Wednesday, the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to embassies and consular missions accredited in the country, warning them that the Cambodian passports of 12 opposition politicians, including Ms. Mu Sochua, had been declared “null and void.”  Ms. Mu Sochua, who was visiting the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, gave a news conference on Wednesday on the opposition’s plans. The Cambodian ambassador to Indonesia tried to stop the event from proceeding and told a journalist to “shut up.” The news conference went ahead, and Ms. Mu Sochua flew to Malaysia in the evening.  The Cambodian Embassy in Indonesia on Wednesday released a statement urging ASEAN’s biggest member to take seriously an arrest warrant issued last month for Ms. Mu Sochua on charges including plotting to topple the government. “The embassy of Cambodia in Jakarta requests Indonesian authorities to arrest Mu Sochua and deport her to Cambodia immediately in the true spirit of ASEAN,” the statement said. “It is unfortunate that Indonesia, a fellow member state of ASEAN, allows Ms. Mu Sochua to enter Indonesia despite her arrest warrant and conduct anti-Cambodian activities in Jakarta.” But human rights groups say the accusations against her are trumped up. “The charges against her are political, rather than criminal or legal,” said Jerald Joseph, the commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia. “She should be allowed to enter the country.” How Ms. Mu Sochua will get to Cambodia is not clear. Mr. Hun Sen has ordered airlines flying into the country to stop her and other opposition leaders. Soldiers and police have been dispatched to land borders and checkpoints. “There seems to be a conspiracy within ASEAN to bend over backward to support an unpopular dictatorship in Cambodia,” said Mr. Santiago, the Malaysian legislator. “This is happening because some of the ASEAN countries have also denied a legitimate opposition from functioning in their own countries. “ASEAN talks all the time about noninterference in other countries’ affairs,” he added. “But in working together to muzzle the opposition they seem to interfere very well.” On Thursday, Mr. Sam Rainsy tweeted that he was still planning to fly to Bangkok from Paris despite the Thai prohibition on him coming there. Hours later, Mr. Sam Rainsy said he had been prevented from checking in for his flight. Nevertheless, he said, he was still committed to returning to Cambodia.  Sun Narin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.']","In denying Cambodian opposition politicians entry into their countries, some ASEAN governments please a leader who has had a 34-year grip on power."
Tunisia’s #MeToo Started Outside a High School. Will It End in Court?,2019-11-09,By Lilia Blaise,"['TUNIS — The imbalance of power seemed unmistakable. On one side, a prominent politician, freshly elected to Parliament. On the other, a 19-year-old student who accused him of sexually harassing her outside her high school. The student’s accusation — initially posted, with photographic evidence, to a private Facebook group — prompted not just shock and disgust, but also an outpouring of support on social media that is quickly becoming Tunisia’s answer to the #MeToo movement. Many of the posts carried the hashtag #EnaZeda, Tunisian dialect for #MeToo. Women of every age and social background started to share their experiences of harassment and abuse, sometimes anonymously, often for the first time, in a private #EnaZeda group that has grown to have more than 17,000 members and through a public Facebook page with more than 70,000 posts and comments.  But whether the #EnaZeda movement will have a long-term impact to match its rapid rise may depend on the fate of the legal case around the student’s accusation, which remains at an early stage, with formidable obstacles ahead. In Nabeul, the coastal city where the student took the photographs on Oct. 10, the public prosecutor opened a public indecency and sexual harassment case without waiting for a formal complaint, citing the prominence of the accused.  The politician, Zouheir Makhlouf, denies doing anything untoward and has not been charged with a crime. And with no charges or hearing date announced, the case may soon run out of time: Once lawmakers take their seats, expected on Nov. 13, Mr. Makhlouf may be able to claim parliamentary immunity. “It is truly a race to get something from the judge before the abuser takes his seat,” said Naima Chabbouh, one of the lawyers for the student, whose name has not been made public, as is common in such cases in Tunisia.  Tunisia’s Constitution gives lawmakers immunity from prosecution only on issues connected to their parliamentary function, Ms. Chabbouh added, “but, depending on the judge, the interpretation of the article can be broadened.”  Malek Ben Jaafar, another of the student’s lawyers, said, “We are pushing for it to be considered as an issue of sexual harassment and not just public indecency because it could set a legal precedent and actually encourage other women to file a complaint.” Tunisia has a proud recent tradition of spontaneous protest leading to real change. The Arab Spring revolts began here in late 2010 after a suicide protest by a fruit seller.  The uprising led to the replacement of the country’s longtime autocrat, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, with a democracy that recently completed its second set of free presidential elections.  Tunisia has also been one of the most progressive countries in the Arab world on women’s rights. Measures such as a law combating violence against women, passed in 2017, provide a safety system for women who want to denounce abuse, harassment and violence based on their gender.  But in 97 percent of sexual harassment cases, either the victim does not file an official complaint or the alleged attacker avoids punishment, according to a 2017 report by the Tunisian Center for Research, Studies, Documentation and Information on Women, which operates under the Ministry of Women and Family Affairs. More recent statistics are not available.  “It is still really difficult to prove there was sexual harassment,” said Fadoua Braham, a lawyer who has handled several harassment cases. “Even if the law punishes it and gives several definitions for it, the most difficult for women is to get the proof and also to stay strong during the judicial process, which is often an ordeal,” she added. “In the cases of sexual harassment in the workplace, for instance, women who speak out are often not supported by their employer, who fears for the reputation of their company,” she said. “Worse than that, women can be targeted by their own abusers for defamation when they had the courage to file a complaint.” The photographic evidence could make such an outcome less likely in this case. As she was walking back to school from her lunch break, the 19-year-old student wrote on Facebook, she noticed that a car appeared to be following her. She took out her cellphone.  As she moved closer, snapping photographs of the license plate, she saw who was inside the car: a local politician, elected to Parliament days earlier, with his trousers down and ointment or cream on one hand. Mr. Makhlouf, who made his reputation as a human rights advocate, maintains there is an innocent explanation: He says he is diabetic and frequently needs to urinate while on the move and that he was applying cream to treat an irritation.  The #EnaZeda hashtag began appearing on Twitter shortly after the student posted the pictures. Later, her supporters created a Facebook page with the same hashtag inviting women to publish their experiences, anonymously if they wished. Aswat Nissa, a women’s rights organization, then created a private Facebook group that receives accounts from women daily. The association is an administrator of the group; it checks the accounts sent in private messages and publishes them publicly, anonymously if requested. “We did not expect so many testimonies to arrive and so many requests to join the group,” said Sonia Ben Miled, the communication manager of Aswat Nissa. “It has been overwhelming but at the same time so rewarding. It shows how much women needed to talk and the fact that it was to support the victim in the first place created a real strength based on solidarity.”  Hajer L, 25, a director’s assistant who did not want her last name published because she feared reprisals in her workplace, was among those who spoke out for the first time on the group.  “Since the scandal, I wanted to share what I lived as well on a daily basis,” she said: “A man in the subway touching him near me or a director making comments about my breasts looking like leeks in front of a crew during shooting, or another assistant taking my hands in his and mimicking a fellation while I hand him work documents.” “It could go on forever,” she added. “#EnaZeda made me feel not alone for the first time. Some of us got used to daily harassment in the street — #EnaZeda showed that this is not O.K., and we should not get used to it at all.” Both the Facebook page and the private group are open to men. The idea is to include anyone who wants to testify about abuse. “The beauty of the movement is its spontaneity and the fact that it belongs to no one,” said Najma Kousri Labidi, one of the founders of the EnaZeda Facebook page. “It is not just about #MeToo but more about women being fed up all over the world with the way their access to a male public space is limited. Women in Egypt spoke up about this issue years ago, for instance.” “We also talked about this before in Tunisia,” she said. “We made awareness campaigns for sexual harassment in public transportation, but #EnaZeda has managed what no feminist association could do by gathering so many testimonies and a national outcry in a short time.” It remains an open question, however, whether the accounts revealed by #EnaZeda will result in legal cases, and how much of a cultural shift the movement can create in what is generally a conservative country. Adel Dhahri, 34, a policy researcher, posted a message of support in the group.  “EnaZeda and similar initiatives will not have a real impact on sexual harassment unless we start targeting men, educating them and changing their behavior,” he said. Aswat Nissa is planning an #EnaZeda demonstration in front of Parliament on Nov. 13, to protest the prospect of Mr. Makhlouf taking his seat without a court judgment.']",Outrage over photographs of a politician appearing to sexually harass a student led hundreds of women to speak out about abuse. But how much change results may depend on a legal case.
Police Officer Is Charged With Murder of British Soccer Player,2019-11-07,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — A police officer has been charged with the murder of a former Premier League soccer player who died in 2016 after being shot by a Taser gun during a confrontation outside his father’s home in western England, prosecutors said on Thursday.  Officers from the West Mercia Police, the regional force, had tried to subdue the former player, Dalian Atkinson, 48, with the Taser, which delivers an electrical charge and is intended to be less harmful than ordinary firearms. Mr. Atkinson was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said it was unusual for an officer to be charged with murder for an action taken while carrying out duties on the job. The case is even more unusual because of the involvement of the Taser, which is used precisely because it is less likely to cause loss of life.  Tasers are not listed by the British government as lethal weapons, and they are excluded from the annual figures documenting the use of firearms by the police. A second police officer was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Neither of the officers was named, because their lawyers intend to apply for anonymity on their behalf, prosecutors said. The defendants were set to appear at a court in Birmingham, England, on Thursday. On Aug. 15, 2016, officers were called to a property in Telford, England, at about 1:30 a.m. Mr. Atkinson had apparently gone to the area to visit his father, Ernest Atkinson. After the two officers arrived, one of them discharged a Taser “whilst in contact with Mr. Atkinson outside the property,” according to a statement on the day of the episode, from the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigated the death. More officers arrived, and an ambulance was called, the statement added. Mr. Atkinson was treated on the scene before being taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the statement said. Just over two years later, the Independent Office for Police Conduct referred a file of evidence against two police officers to prosecutors.  The Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday that the officer charged with murder had also been charged with an alternative, lesser offense — “unlawful act manslaughter” — that the jury can consider if it determines that there is insufficient evidence for the murder charge. Inquest, a charity that provides expertise in state-related deaths, said in a statement on Thursday that “no police officer involved in a death in custody or following police contact has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter” since 1990.  Mr. Atkinson, a star of English soccer in the 1980s and 1990s, played for Ipswich Town, Sheffield Wednesday and, perhaps most notably, Aston Villa in the English Premier League. He spent four of the most productive years of his career at Aston Villa, earning a reputation as an inventive and intelligent forward.  He spent the later years of his career playing in Turkey, France and South Korea, before retiring from professional soccer in 2001 at the age of 33.  He struggled with health problems after his career finished, most notably a kidney complaint for which he was receiving treatment in the time leading up to his death.

We Asked Students to Write About Migration. Read the Winning Essay.,2019-11-08,By Gina Song,"['What has your life experience and the experience of those around you taught you about global migration? That’s the question we asked students as part of “Hard Truths,” a photography exhibit from The New York Times that appeared at the University of Melbourne. And after receiving dozens of submissions, we have a winner: Gina Song. Her essay, “Future Tense,” stood out for its insight and lyricism, packed into our 500-word limit. Read. Enjoy. Share your thoughts on the question by emailing us: nytaustralia@nytimes.com. When my grandparents, my dad and my aunt step off the plane and into the “last utopian land” of Australia (as advertised by a Korean brochure) they are met with angry protesters. Sweating under the heat, they hold up signs that read: “Go back to your country!” “Our land, not yours!” My family only realizes this later. In the moment, not understanding a single word of what the sunburned white people were saying, they simply raise their hands and wave. “What a nice welcome!” my grandfather says, before they go to get their bags. Fast forward a few decades, and global migration pays for my groceries. I charge $40 an hour to break down a language that I have rarely given a second thought to. One of my students asks: “Teacher, why is ‘would’ a past tense word but can be used as a future tense word, granted that it’s placed before ‘do’ and ‘make’?” And I stare for a moment, mutter something about the “mechanics of grammar” and then offer a hopeless “I guess it just is?” They laugh and laugh and laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. My grandfather doesn’t laugh. He attends 50 job interviews, each a human resources job that matches the managerial position he had in Korea. He glows on paper but in the interview room he’s quickly rejected. Maybe it’s his name that’s the problem? Jay-Hong becomes Jay. My father, Hyun-Duk, becomes Harry. It is 1999 and Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are at the height of their fame. My mother, Soon-Yool, becomes Sally.  The boy I tutor changes his name every week. When I first met him, he was Joe. He went to class and realized every other white boy was named Joe — so he becomes Michael. The three- hour Michael Jackson documentary is released and he becomes Adam. I tell him his Korean name, Jun-Hyuk, is nice. He laughs. “Do you have a Korean name?” he asks me. I tell him that my parents had named me Jin-A, or Gina. “See? Korean but still easy for white people to pronounce.” He smiles. “How could you possibly understand?” My grandparents buy a struggling candy store called Kandy Korner. My grandfather sorts gumdrops and sherbets and now knows the difference between “rocky road” and “peppermint crunch.” At night, they attend language school. The teachers are kind, but when they walk home they hear people yell “Ching-Chong!” and “Gook!” They understand what that means now. My grandparents set up a family, and now their grandchildren have acceptable names and can speak enough English to prove their worth in a job interview. We understand attempts at humor. We understand offense. We have studied the language. We want you to do the same. Change the idea that global migration is thievery, a pastime, a decision made on a whim. Change the idea that it is anything but an attempt at renewal. It is the ridiculousness of a new language. It is Jun-Hyuk changing his name. It is my grandparents, waving at anger. It is my ability to think in a future tense — rather than one of present survival. Now on to stories from the week. Why Is Australia Trying to Shut Down Climate Activism?

Russia Raided a Physics Institute. Kremlin Watchers Are Mystified.,2019-11-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — The Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow helped the Soviet Union detonate its first nuclear bomb, figured out how to build a hydrogen bomb and has stood for decades in the vanguard of Russian scientific achievement. Seven of its scientists have won Nobel Prizes. So it came as a shock last week when, shortly before celebrations to mark the 85th anniversary of the illustrious institute’s founding, its halls were suddenly swarming with security officers wearing masks and armed with automatic weapons. They searched the office of the institute’s director, Nikolai N. Kolachevsky, and questioned him for six hours about a supposed plot to export military-use glass windows. He later denounced the raid as a “masked show,” a phrase Russians use to describe increasingly over-the-top interventions by law enforcement agencies. The operation set off another round of what in recent months has become a favorite, if depressing, parlor game for Russia’s intelligentsia: trying to figure out why “siloviki,” or “people of force” — security, intelligence and military officials — have been acting so strangely and in ways at odds with the stated policy goals of President Vladimir V. Putin. It also provided a grim example of why, despite its scientific prowess, Russia has had such trouble diversifying its economy beyond just pulling oil, gas and other resources out of the ground. Mr. Putin has for years called on scientists to look beyond their books and laboratories, and use their world-class talents to help build a modern economy. But those who try to do so run a serious risk of getting raided by masked men with guns. Cases tend to drag on for months or years, leaving the careers and nerves of suspects shredded, even if they are eventually exonerated. That happened to Dmitri Trubitsyn, a former physicist who was arrested in 2017 in connection with a successful high-tech company he had set up in Siberia with fellow scientists. The case was finally closed more than a year later because of a lack of evidence to support accusations that he was running a criminal conspiracy to deceive regulators. Meeting with security force commanders on Wednesday in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin praised the Federal Security Service — known as the F.S.B., the successor to the domestic arm of the Soviet-era K.G.B. — for its growing role in “Russia’s integrated security,” while conceding that law enforcement agencies needed to work on “strengthening public confidence in them.” When they descended on the Lebedev Physics Institute last week, the security services carried out simultaneous raids on scientists and their family members. The main target of their investigation seems to have been Olga Kanorskaya, the daughter of a Lebedev scientist and the owner of a private company that, from an office she rented at the institute, built up a small business selling precision glassware. The intimidating scale of the investigation, with dozens of armed officers mobilized for the raids, “is brazen, stupid and very frightening,” Ms. Kanorskaya, 36, said in an interview. Security officers stormed her apartment just as she was sitting down for her morning coffee, while another team searched her parents’ apartment. They rifled through her possessions in search of evidence to prove an accusation that she says is “totally fictitious” — that she tried to export pieces of glass with potential military applications to Germany, a crime that carries a sentence of seven to 20 years in prison. She was taken in for questioning by police investigators and an F.S.B. officer. No matter what the eventual outcome of the investigation, the Lebedev institute’s scientific council complained in a tart statement that last week’s raids had “delivered colossal reputational damage with law enforcement organs discrediting themselves in the eyes of the scientific community.” Noting that the Kremlin had announced a special program last year to make scientific research more attractive and rewarding, particularly for young talent that might otherwise emigrate, the council added that the actions of Russia’s security forces “are impossible to imagine in a civilized country in which law enforcement agencies concern themselves with real, not invented, problems.” As with other recent examples of an increasingly aggressive and erratic security apparatus — the planting of drugs on an investigative journalist, the jailing of pacifist religious believers as “extremists” and other risibly fanciful cases — the physics institute saga has generated a swarm of theories to try to explain what is going on. One popular explanation is that the case is related to coming elections at the Russian Academy of Sciences and a bitter rivalry between the Lebedev Physics Institute and the Kurchatov Institute, a nuclear research center. Kurchatov is headed by Mikhail V. Kovalchuk, whose brother, Yuri V. Kovalchuk, is a banker in St. Petersburg and an old friend and crony of Mr. Putin. Mikhail Kovalchuk and the Lebedev Institute director, Mr. Kolachevsky, are both candidates in the Academy of Sciences elections. The two scientists have also clashed in the past over plans by the Kurchatov Institute to commercialize its nuclear projects. Referring to the elections in a message sent to fellow physicists after the raid on his office, Mr. Kolachevsky said, “I did not want to link these two events — but the scientific community itself has already come to a conclusion.” Another theory is that the F.S.B. simply needed a defense-related smuggling case to put in its annual report before the end of the year. Yet another is that a Russian business rival, jealous of foreign sales by Ms. Kanorskaya’s company, bribed the security services to knock out its competitor. The case against Mr. Trubitsyn in Siberia is widely believed to have begun with bribery by a commercial rival. Ms. Kanorskaya is not sure what prompted her travails. “All I know for certain,” she said, “is that the case is totally fabricated and made-to-order.” The case centers on the activities of Trioptics, a company Ms. Kanorskaya set up in 2016 in partnership with a subsidiary of Rusnano, a state-owned venture that promotes the development of high-tech enterprises. Ms. Kanorskaya later split from the state-funded company, buying out its 35 percent share in Trioptics and moving in 2018 into office space rented from the Lebedev Institute, where her father works. “There is nothing secret or sensitive in what we do,” she said, explaining that her business involved buying specialty glass from China, processing it in Moscow, and then selling it for use in meteorological stations and other precision equipment, often to foreign clients. All her company did to the Chinese-made glass at the center of the investigation, she said, was add an antireflection coating to meet the specifications of a customer in Germany. She exported four pieces of the same glass, worth around $15,000, to the same company in Bavaria in the summer last year without any problem. But when she tried later in the year to send two more pieces to the same customer, her shipper in Moscow suggested that she get a permit from a government agency that monitors exports to make sure they do not have military uses. After providing an expert’s certification that the glass was of a type with no military applications, she received the necessary permit and everything seemed in order. Then the F.S.B. got involved. In February, the security service’s department for economic crimes sent a letter to the customs service saying that it had “received information” that Ms. Kanorskaya’s company was breaking the law by trying to export controlled items. The Investigative Committee, Russia’s version of the F.B.I., opened a criminal case. For the moment, neither Ms. Kanorskaya; her father, Sergei; nor Mr. Kolachevsky, the director of the Lebedev institute, has been formally charged. An informal association of Russian academics and scientists called the July 1 Club denounced the case as a “masquerade” and prominent intellectuals weighed in on social media with exasperated messages assailing the security services.  Mr. Kolachevsky, in his statement to fellow scientists, noted that the raid on his institute was the first time that a research center connected with so many renowned scientists had been “turned upside down by the ‘polite people,’ ” — Russian slang for security service thugs. He said he had counted 30 officers from three different agencies, supported by “masked machine gunners.” He added that the operation could be the result of a “tip-off or some kind of fantastical foolishness and lack of coordination in the work of the siloviki.” Whatever the reason, he said, “there is nothing especially surprising here. Everything fits into the ‘witch hunt’ script that has been gaining momentum with every year.” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting']",The armed operation targeting scientists in Moscow prompted outrage and questions about over-the-top actions by the country’s increasingly aggressive security forces.
The Hidden Cost of Gold: Birth Defects and Brain Damage,2019-11-09,By Richard C. Paddock,"['CIDAHU, Indonesia — Thousands of children with crippling birth defects. Half a million people poisoned. A toxic chemical found in the food supply. Accusations of a government cover-up and police officers on the take. This is the legacy of Indonesia’s mercury trade, a business intertwined with the lucrative and illegal production of gold. More than a hundred nations have joined a global campaign to reduce the international trade in mercury, an element so toxic there is “no known safe level of exposure,” according to health experts. But that effort has backfired in Indonesia, where illicit backyard manufacturers have sprung up to supply wildcat miners and replace mercury that was previously imported from abroad. Now, Indonesia produces so much black-market mercury that it has become a major global supplier, surreptitiously shipping thousands of tons to other parts of the world. Much of the mercury is destined for use in gold mining in Africa and Asia, passing through hubs such as Dubai and Singapore, according to court records — and the trade has deadly consequences. “It is a public health crisis,” said Yuyun Ismawati, a co-founder of an Indonesian environmental group, Nexus3 Foundation, and a recipient of the 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize. She has called for a worldwide ban on using mercury in gold mining. Mercury can be highly dangerous as it accumulates up the food chain, causing a wide range of disorders, including birth defects, neurological problems and even death. Today, despite the risks, small-scale miners using mercury operate in about 80 countries in Asia, Africa and the Americas. They produce up to 25 percent of all gold sold. As gold makes its way around the world, so too does mercury — poisoning the air and food of people thousands of miles away. Small-scale gold mining is the largest single source of mercury pollution. A recent study of women on 24 remote islands found that more than half displayed high mercury levels. The women lived far from sources of mercury pollution but ate a diet rich in fish. In the United States, contaminated fish is the No. 1 source of mercury poisoning. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, stands out for its huge number of outlaw gold miners and for concerns that some law enforcement officials assigned to police the trade are instead profiting from it. As much as anyone, Cece Rifa’i, a former miner, is responsible for Indonesia’s mercury boom and spreading the scourge of contamination across the country. But he has no regrets. “I don’t feel guilty about anything,” he said from the veranda of his two-story home on the island of Java. For years, Mr. Cece was a pioneer in a network of illegal mercury producers, traders and smugglers who supply gold miners across Indonesia with mercury, used to extract gold from crushed ore. On a single day, operating a furnace he constructed in his backyard, he could produce a ton of black-market mercury worth more than $20,000, he said. For decades, Indonesia got most of its mercury legally from the United States and Europe. But recognizing the harm it was doing, Western countries began reducing mercury exports six years ago. Since 2013, 114 countries, including Indonesia, have signed on to the Minamata Convention, a treaty that took effect in 2017 and that requires participating nations to reduce the export and use of mercury in a variety of industries. Nevertheless, United Nations trade data shows that Indonesia became a significant exporter of mercury from 2015 to 2017, peaking at more than 320 tons in 2016. Ms. Yuyun, the environmentalist, estimates that illicit manufacturers in Indonesia produce more than 10,000 tons of mercury a year. About a third is used in gold mining in Indonesia, she said, the rest smuggled overseas. The government banned the use of mercury in gold mining in 2014, but has done little to curb its use, clean up contaminated sites or warn the public of the danger. In surveys of 24 hot spots, the Nexus3 Foundation and a team of independent doctors found more than 700 cases of suspected mercury poisoning, including children with birth defects and villagers with irreversible neurological disorders. At least 45 have died. Based on these studies, the environmental group estimates that decades of mining have poisoned 500,000 people. The mercury trade is lucrative, but the gold business it supports is far more profitable. By some estimates, Indonesia’s illicit small-scale gold miners produce as much as $5 billion a year. Poverty is widespread in Indonesia, and many people, jobless and desperate, have flocked to the gold fields. As miners, they often live outside the law, digging for ore on land without permission or government permits, sometimes in national parks and protected areas. To extract gold, the miners mix liquid mercury with crushed ore. Gold in the ore binds with the mercury to produce an amalgam of the metals. The miners heat the small lump with a blowtorch, sending mercury vapors into the air and leaving the gold behind. Many miners like the method because it gives them a quick return. But in mining communities, airborne mercury levels can be dangerously high. Wastewater containing mercury finds its way into fields, streams and bays, contaminating rice, fruit and fish, studies show. Government officials have known about mercury-related health problems in the gold fields since at least 2012, Ms. Yuyun said, but they have not warned residents about the dangers of consuming potentially contaminated rice and fish. Last year, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry conducted tests in seven mining communities and identified 558 adults and children with high mercury levels, many with severe exposure. The sampling also found high levels in rice. But the ministry has yet to notify subjects of their test results or issue a public warning for fear of setting off panic over the safety of the food supply. “It’s a crime to deliberately conceal the damning results,” said Ms. Yuyun, the lead researcher on small-scale mining at the International Pollutants Elimination Network. “People are dying and have little access to any effective treatment. The government has to stop the mercury trade and clean up the mess.” Environment Ministry officials declined to be interviewed and did not respond to written questions. Officials in the office of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, acknowledged that mercury contamination is a serious problem and said he had issued a national action plan that calls for cleaning up four hot spots. The president also has directed police and military commanders to take action against personnel found to be involved in the illegal metals trade. Officials said they were unaware of anyone being disciplined. Spokesmen for the national police and the military declined to be interviewed. Officials say the public has been warned about mercury’s dangers, but there is little evidence of this in mining areas. Many miners insist it is not hazardous. The role of corrupt officials in the gold and mercury trade is widely recognized but seldom addressed by the government. Some members of the police and military are said to finance gold mining operations, extort protection money, oversee their own mines and ensure the safe transit of mercury and gold. Many tons of mercury seized by the police have gone missing. “When we went to the field and talked to the people there, they admitted that the police gave them the mercury,” said Putu Selly Andayani, head of the West Nusa Tenggara Province Trade Agency. “They said the police helped them to set up the illegal mining.” Throughout the country, miners work with mercury in plain sight without fear of punishment. The occasional arrests of furnace workers and smugglers have barely dented the supply. Mercury remains cheap and plentiful in the gold fields, where it is sold in mining supply shops or by dealers who travel from village to village. Dozens of Indonesian websites offer mercury for sale. One international smuggler arrested last year was Chander Hass Khera, an Indian citizen. Seized documents show that he shipped 9.7 tons of mercury to South Africa, Thailand and India in 2017. Last year, he bought an additional 3.8 tons from a dozen traders, said Dyah Paramita, a researcher at the Center for Regulation Policy and Governance in West Java, who reviewed court records. Soon after the smuggler’s arrest, most of his confiscated mercury disappeared from police custody. The police told the court they were investigating. Mr. Khera was sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to ship mercury produced without proper permits. Like methamphetamine labs in rural America, mercury distillation often takes place in remote areas, far from prying eyes. Mr. Cece, 64, the prolific backyard mercury producer, began mining gold as a young man. In 2010, as wildcat mining boomed, he said he started searching for cinnabar, the ore from which liquid mercury is produced. Inspired by his years vaporizing mercury by blowtorch, he constructed a simple concrete furnace with a narrow trench in the center for a wood fire, steel buckets to heat the reddish ore and fixtures to capture the mercury as it cooled and liquefied. His home in Sukabumi Regency in western Java is an unlikely spot for this backyard industry. A picturesque area of rice paddies and simple villages, there is no cinnabar ore or nearby highway. There is not even a road to Mr. Cece’s house in Cidahu village. But on his patio, Mr. Cece built a furnace so large it could produce a ton of mercury in 24 hours. He arranged to have cinnabar shipped from distant islands, often using express courier services. He hired local men — “robbers, thieves and hit men,” he called them — to work the furnace. Local police officers and health officials visited frequently, sometimes taking water samples. On each visit, he said, he gave them “pocket money.” The inspectors found no health problems. On one occasion, he said, he demonstrated his furnace to a high-ranking police official from Jakarta. Soon dozens of copycat furnaces began appearing in Sukabumi and on islands closer to the cinnabar mines, helping flood the black market with cheap mercury. “We all know that he is the pioneer,” said, Alung, 35, who learned the business working for Mr. Cece. Like many Indonesians, he uses one name. The police cracked down on mercury producers in Sukabumi in 2017, shutting down three dozen furnaces and arresting about 100 people, including Mr. Cece. He and nearly all the others avoided jail by agreeing to stop making mercury. Mr. Cece dismantled his furnace. The police seized nearly a ton of mercury from three furnaces in the village. Mr. Cece and Mr. Alung suspect the police sold it because they brought their own containers to haul it away. Before the crackdown, mercury production meant jobs. Whatever the health hazard, the work paid better than anything else, and they were disappointed when the furnaces were shut down. “We know it’s dangerous,” Mr. Alung said. “But we’re sad. We no longer have the income.”']",
U.K. Police Identify All 39 People Found Dead in Truck,2019-11-07,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — All 39 people who were discovered dead in a refrigerated trailer in southeast England last month have been identified, the police said on Thursday. The authorities did not reveal the names of the eight women and 31 men whose bodies were found in a trailer in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, on Oct. 23. But the families of the victims were notified, according to a statement from the Essex Police.  The police confirmed that all the victims — who were believed to have been transported to England through a global human-trafficking network — were from Vietnam. Although Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police, the senior police officer in charge of the investigation into the deaths, described the identifications as an “important step” in the inquiry, some Vietnamese families whose missing relatives fell silent two weeks ago did not wait for formal identification before beginning to grieve.  The Vietnamese Embassy in London also released a statement on Thursday expressing “deep sorrow” over the deaths.  Essex Police said further updates on the case of the 39 deaths would be given in due course. But, Mr. Smith’s statement said, “It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.”  The British and Vietnamese authorities have worked closely together to piece together why the 39 people died and how they had traveled from Vietnam to Grays, a town 25 miles east of London.  The police in Vietnam detained eight people on Monday, adding to an increasing tally of arrests in connection with the case.  In Britain, the driver of the truck, Maurice Robinson, 25, of Northern Ireland, was arrested last month and charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, in addition to conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.   Another truck driver from Northern Ireland, Eamon Harrison, 22, was arrested last week and also charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses.  Two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, are also wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking in connection with the case, and the police have appealed to the pair to hand themselves in and assist the authorities with the investigation.  When the 39 bodies were discovered, the case caused shock waves around the world, but there are signs that it has not deterred other human-trafficking and smuggling efforts. In Belgium, 11 men from Syria and one from Sudan were found alive last month by the police in the refrigerated trailer of a truck, and 41 men and boys were discovered by the Greek police in a similar situation during a routine highway check on Monday.

Captives or Defectors? Taliban Fighters Tell Conflicting Tales,2019-11-07,By David Zucchino,"['FAIZABAD, Afghanistan — They paced aimlessly inside a guarded compound, stepping over their beard and hair clippings on the ground. Ninety-eight Taliban in all — fighters as young as 16 and as old as one white-bearded veteran of 65. They had all laid down their weapons and pledged loyalty to the Afghan government. But the reasons for that depended on who was telling the tale — and illuminated some of the complexity of a war in which side-switching is common.  The Afghan military says these Taliban fighters quit to try to save their lives after Afghan forces retook three districts from the Taliban during desperate, pitched battles in the northeastern province of Badakhshan in September.   The fighters had been told by the head of the national intelligence agency in the province that they were free to return to civilian life if they renounced the Taliban. But in the compound’s courtyard, some fighters said they had already been planning to do just that before they were taken into custody. Some told of conspiring with friends and relatives from the government to abandon the Taliban even as the battles for the districts were raging.  Others said they had been given no choice but to surrender at gunpoint, then submitted to having their typical Taliban style — long hair and beards — trimmed back by a barber.  But they were not speaking freely. They related their stories to visiting New York Times journalists in the presence of a glowering officer from the National Directorate of Security, who often interrupted to correct or admonish them for speaking too frankly. The courtyard spectacle had all the trappings of a practiced performance, with the fighters politely agreeing with the intelligence officer. But whenever he stepped away, they offered more candid assessments.  Particularly in remote places like Badakhshan, where the central government in Kabul is a distant idea, switching sides between the Taliban, other insurgent groups, and the security forces is a frequent event. Old local rivalries keep playing out across new allegiances. Lapis lazuli and gold mines, coupled with drug-smuggling, add to the complexity. Several of the men spoke of reluctantly joining the Taliban only after their districts were seized by the militants up to four years ago. They shared a common resentment: the foreign jihadists — from Pakistan, China, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — who commandeered their homes and demanded food. Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hanif Nuristani, the government intelligence commander in Badakhshan, said there were at least 400 foreign fighters in the province who had joined the Taliban, Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. “They didn’t speak our language, but we shared our food,” said Sultan Mohammad, 46, who said he commanded 15 Taliban fighters. “We had no choice, and to protect our families, we supported them.” Mr. Mohammad, who said he was a teacher who supported the government before the Taliban takeover, said he had been in touch by telephone with local government leaders before and during the battles in September.  Asked whether he and his men had surrendered or had been captured, Mr. Mohammed replied, “We weren’t captured. We support the government, inshallah.” Nizamuddin, 19, who goes by one name, said he had eagerly joined the Taliban this year because he was intrigued by what he called “their ideology.” But when the Afghan military attacked, he said, his older brother — a government intelligence officer — telephoned and persuaded him to defect. He said he switched sides because of the foreign jihadists, whose presence he said drew American airstrikes. “We didn’t want them in our homeland but we had no choice,” he said. The intelligence officer, a stocky man in a shiny blue suit who declined to give his name, said the government had provided food, showers and living space for the fighters. At their request, he provided a barber to trim their long hair and wild beards, he said. “We want to look like the government people,” one fighter announced, and his companions laughed uproariously. The intelligence officer said the fighters, who were allowed to keep their cellphones to reach family members, would be permitted to return home soon. He said they were free to leave the compound, but it was surrounded by armed intelligence agency soldiers who blocked the front entrance. The fighters had been taken recently to attend a ceremony in Faizabad, the provincial capital, with the government’s national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib. In a Twitter post, Mr. Mohib said the men had renounced violence. He praised them for “choosing the right way” and “endorsing” the government’s legitimacy. Abdullah Naji Nazari, a member of the provincial council, said the fighters “didn’t like the Taliban anymore” and now trusted government forces to help them secure their villages. General Nuristani said the fighters had provided valuable intelligence. “Perhaps we’ll send them back as spies for us,” he said. In the courtyard, Mohammad Hassan, a wiry little man who thought he was about 65 years old, said he had fired rocket-propelled grenades at Soviet soldiers in the 1980s and at government troops this year while fighting for the Taliban. Now, he said, he was perfectly willing to fire the same weapon at his former Taliban comrades, if only the government would arm him. He had been a farmer before joining the Taliban, he said, but now he wanted nothing more than to fight. “Some people like gardening or parrots,” he said, grinning. “I like to fight.” His comrades doubled over in laughter. One of them slapped the old man on the back. “I’m addicted to war,” Mr. Hassan continued. “My nickname is Hassan Rocket!” There was more laughter, even from the weapons-toting intelligence agency guards. The spectacle inside the courtyard soon drew to a close, with the intelligence officer signaling that it was time to wrap up. The visitors withdrew.

One of the guards watched them warily. “Every one of them is dangerous,” he said. “We don’t trust a single one.” Najim Rahim contributed reporting.']",The simple idea of insurgency versus government proves much more complex when dozens of detained fighters tell their stories in a remote corner of Afghanistan. 
Mining Company Blamed ‘Bandits or Terrorists’ for Prior Attacks,2019-11-07,By Ian Austen,"['A Canadian mining company that employed workers who were fatally ambushed Wednesday in the West African nation of Burkina Faso offered no explanation on Thursday for the attack or the possible motives of the killers.  But in a securities filing made this week in Canada, the Montreal-based company, Semafo, characterized two attacks on its workers in Burkina Faso last year “as part of an increase in similar incidents carried out by bandits or terrorists.”  The company added that “there is no reason to believe that our employees or operations are targeted.” At least thirty-seven people died in the Wednesday attack, one of the deadliest episodes of violence that has convulsed the landlocked nation. It took place when five buses escorted by Burkina Faso’s military were traveling to Semafo’s Boungou mine, an open-pit gold mine in the eastern part of the country, about 25 miles away. Following last year’s two convoy attacks, Semafo began flying foreign workers and contractors by helicopter to its two mines in Burkina Faso. Local employees, however, continued to be moved in buses although the company said that it had augmented their security. W. Cory Wanless, a Toronto lawyer representing a group of Guatemalan women who say they were gang-raped by security forces retained by another Canadian mining company, called Semafo’s action a double-standard for employee security, which may now expose it to litigation in Canada. “It is highly distressing that Semafo made the decision to protect its expat workers by flying them to its mines precisely because of past attacks on ground convoys, and yet continues to rely on exposed ground convoys for its local workers,” Mr. Wanless said. “To me, this reeks of a Canadian company valuing the lives of Canadian and other Western expats over the lives of Africans.” Semafo did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement issued on Thursday, Semafo said that it was suspending production at the mine that was the convoy’s destination “out of respect to the victims and those impacted and to ensure the highest levels of operational safety.”']","Employees of the mining company, Semafo, have suffered three attacks in Burkina Faso in 15 months, including one on Wednesday that left at least 37 dead."
Indonesia Wants ‘Halal Tourism.’ But Some Want to Wrestle Pigs.,2019-11-08,By Richard C. Paddock,"['MUARA, Indonesia — Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, seems an unlikely place for a party dedicated to all things pig.  But last month on the shores of Sumatra’s Lake Toba, more than 1,000 people gathered for pig races, pig selfies and contests devoted to calling pigs and drawing pigs. They also came to eat a local delicacy, barbecued pork.  The festival was more than just a celebration of pigs. It was also a way for the area’s large Christian community to push back at government-sanctioned efforts to promote a conservative version of Islam throughout the country and in their home province. In recent months that trend toward religious conservatism has included a proposed national law that would outlaw premarital sex and the election of a vice president who once issued a fatwa against the wearing of Santa Claus hats. And it has prompted the government to promote “halal tourism,” vacations composed of activities and foods permissible under Islamic law.  “Tourism is about happiness. Tourism is about fun. Tourism is not about religion,” said Togu Simorangkir, a biologist and farmer, who came up with the idea for the Pig Festival.  That sentiment puts Mr. Simorangkir at odds with government officials and some of his Muslim neighbors at a time when Lake Toba is trying to attract more attention.  Lake Toba, the world’s largest volcanic lake, is the historic center of Indonesia’s indigenous Batak people, most of whom are Christians, and they make up one of the country’s largest minority groups. But the area has also been designated by the government as one of the country’s next tourism hot spots.  The government plans to boost tourism nationwide by creating “10 Balis” in the hopes of replicating that island’s success as a holiday destination. Lake Toba is one of that program’s top priorities, but with only 231,000 foreign visitors in 2018, the region has a long way to go. The government constructed a new regional airport in 2017, but the capsizing of an overloaded ferry that killed 188 people last year has not helped attract visitors. Indonesia drew a record number of foreign tourists in 2018. Of the 15.8 million visitors, the single largest group was from Malaysia, also a Muslim-majority country. The second largest group was from pork-loving China, where Muslims are a minority. Mr. Simorangkir and other Batak Christians said they resent the government’s plan to play down their traditions, which include eating pork, in order to pander to Muslim tourists. Muslim leaders at the lake, Christian residents said, are using the mantle of halal tourism to push policies that are discriminatory.  One Muslim leader has called for bans on eating pork in public and wearing Western swimwear — especially women’s bathing suits — except in designated zones. “For people who want to eat pork, they will be given a special place,” said Halasan Simangunsong, the head of Al Hadhonah mosque in the lakefront town of Balige. “For the foreign tourists to do what they want, give them a special zone.” Perhaps coincidentally, he runs a halal restaurant at nearby Bul Bul Beach. Such restrictions on food and clothing, some Batak people fear, would apply not only to foreign visitors but local Christians as well.  The pig is freighted with symbolism for both Muslims and Christians, and each group has used the animal to advocate for their traditions.  For Muslims, who make up nearly 90 percent of Indonesia’s population, eating or even touching pigs is considered haram — forbidden. But for Batak Christians, pigs are a part of everyday life, and serving pork is an essential part of every important ceremony, from birth to death. “The pig is a symbol of pride for Batak people,” said Ondi Siregar, a tour guide at the Batak Museum in Balige who raises 20 pigs at home. “In every ceremony, pork has to be one of the offerings.” Even today, many villagers live in traditional raised wooden houses with space underneath for their pigs. “Our whole life is connected with the pig,” said Martongo Sitinjak, a leader of the Batak Protestant Church, one of Indonesia’s largest religious organizations. “It is not coming from religion or Christian teachings. It is coming from the culture.” The plan to attract more Muslim visitors, particularly from neighboring Malaysia and Brunei, surfaced in August when the governor of North Sumatra province, Edy Rahmayadi, a Muslim, proposed building more mosques near the lake and ending the slaughtering of pigs in public. “If you don’t build mosques there, they won’t come,” the governor said at the time. “If you slaughter pigs outdoors, they may come tomorrow, but they won’t come again.” When widespread condemnation of the governor’s remarks spread online among his Christian constituents, Mr. Edy insisted he had never called for halal tourism. The highlight of the two-day Pig Festival was a pig catching contest. In six rounds of competition, groups of blindfolded men and boys piled into a small coral and tried to capture a piglet. The game was similar to greased pig contests at American rodeos and county fairs, but the blindfolds added an extra dimension of slapstick comedy.  Hundreds of people crowded around the enclosure, laughing uproariously at each missed tackle as three little pigs scooted past the diving contestants. More than once, a man grabbed for a pig only to end up rolling on the ground with a competitor, prompting even more laughter. Early on, a small black pig slipped out of the split-bamboo enclosure, raced past a barbecued pig on a spit, jumped into Lake Toba and swam away. Mr. Simorangkir, the pig festival’s organizer, said it was not pork that was deterring tourists, but environmental destruction.  With the central government’s permission, he said, companies from outside the area have logged the lake’s surrounding forests and set up vast fish farming operations that have polluted the lake, once famous for its clear waters. “If they want to increase the tourism at Lake Toba, don’t put on the label of halal tourism,” Mr. Simorangkir said. “Just close the companies that destroy the Lake Toba environment.” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']",A Christian community on the shores of Lake Toba is pushing back against Indonesia’s rising religious conservatism with a party devoted to all things pig. 
Bolivian Leader Clings to Power as Police Join Protesters,2019-11-09,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Ernesto Londoño and Mónica Machicao","['The Bolivian president’s grip on power grew shakier on Saturday as police units in major cities flipped their allegiance and joined anti-government demonstrations, key allies resigned and protesters forced the state broadcaster to halt news programming.  The developments were the most serious threat yet to President Evo Morales’s attempts to hold on to power after last month’s disputed elections. “A coup is underway,” Mr. Morales declared in a televised address on Saturday from his traditional stronghold in the city of El Alto, outside La Paz. Looking tired and deflated, he called on supporters to take to the streets while asking political rivals to sit down for talks to resolve the crisis. The dramatic escalation of tensions over the weekend raised the question whether the security forces more broadly were abandoning the president, something that would make it virtually impossible for him to remain in power. [Update: Evo Morales flies to Mexico but vows to return to Bolivia “with force.”] In a blow to Mr. Morales’s chances of regaining control, the country’s armed forces responded to the president’s speech by issuing a statement professing neutrality and promising to “not clash with the people.” The commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, said Saturday afternoon that the military would not crack down on protesters. But the statement suggested that top military leaders were hedging their bets as the crisis escalated: It did not clearly signal support for either Mr. Morales or those seeking to oust him. “The country’s current problems generated in the political arena must be resolved bearing in mind the nation’s highest interests before we reach an irreversible moment,” General Kaliman said. Military leaders are no doubt mindful of the last time the armed forces were deployed to restore order during a period of social unrest in 2003. After those confrontations turned deadly, some military personnel were accused of committing human rights abuses and prosecuted. By Saturday evening, Mr. Morales lost a key propaganda tool, the state-run Television Boliviana, after protesters forced its employees to abandon the broadcaster. The station then switched from pro-government news bulletins to old documentaries. Bolivia erupted in violent protests after Mr. Morales claimed to have won an unprecedented fourth term last month despite concerns from electoral observers over the validity of the results. The head of a vote auditing company contracted by the Bolivian government said Friday that ballot counting had revealed irregularities that prevented him from certifying the results. Police units defected in La Paz and in at least five other major cities, and officers were reported to have abandoned their posts outside the presidential palace. State television broadcast images of throngs of police, many still in uniform, marching with protesters in La Paz and in the country’s business capital Santa Cruz. In La Paz, crowds of protesters cheered the rebelling officers. Rebel police officers claimed to have taken over at least one regional governor’s office by Saturday, and one ruling party mayor joined the opposition. In the city of Oruro, defecting policemen dispersed government supporters with tear gas, according to local media. As unrest spread across the nation, one of Mr. Morales’s key political allies, Juan Carlos Cejas, the governor of the Potosí region, resigned because, he said, he feared for his life. “I’m not going to hold on to this job,” he said, according to a report in the Página Siete newspaper. “I’m not going to put myself and my family at risk.” Mr. Morales in his address cast himself as a victim of a conspiracy by people who “don’t respect democracy, and don’t respect the results of the last elections.” He called on the police to “uphold their duty to safeguard the safety of the Bolivian people.” It was his strongest direct acknowledgment of the spreading rebellion.  He said the talks he was proposing should involve members of four parties that won legislative seats in the latest election, a criteria that would exclude some of the main leaders who have been mobilizing against him in recent days. “We hope tonight to find peaceful solutions through dialogue,” the president said. “We’ll have an open agenda with the goal of pacifying Bolivia.” Leaders of Bolivia’s main opposition parties swiftly rejected his proposal. Mr. Morales also called on supporters to come out to defend his government, raising fears that clashes could intensify. On Saturday, eight anti-government protesters were injured when their convoy was ambushed by government allies on the way to a demonstration in La Paz, opposition leaders said.  Isabel Mercado, the director of Página Siete, one of the country’s main newspapers, said Saturday that Mr. Morales’s hold on power appeared to be slipping as the police mutiny grew and the leaders of the armed forces remained out of sight. “Without the police and the armed forces, I think it’s very hard for him to hold on,” she said.  Local news media reported that police defections had spread to at least four cities outside La Paz. The police have demanded better working conditions, the resignation of their commander and guarantees they won’t be used for political ends, The Associated Press reported.  Police guards outside the presidential palace in La Paz left their posts on Saturday, the A.P. reported, allowing anti-government protesters to walk up to the doors of the building. Mr. Morales was not in the compound when police retreated to their barracks. Officials in the palace in La Paz were evacuated, leaving only a military presidential guard. Protesters moved peacefully to the doors of the compound, and later left the area. Some police guards have abandoned their posts at several ministerial buildings and officers took over the old presidential palace, hanging national flags from its walls. Bolivia’s postelection unrest has so far claimed the lives of three people. Protesters have clashed with security forces across the country and burned public buildings. A pro-government mayor in a small city in central Bolivia was kidnapped and marched through the streets barefoot and drenched with red paint in the past week. Carlos Mesa, the former president who came second in the Oct. 20 election, said Mr. Morales is to blame for the unrest that has rattled the country in recent weeks. “The government is condemning itself to a disastrous exit,” Mr. Mesa told reporters on Saturday. “That’s what they deserve for not listening to the people.” The opposition claims the vote on October 20 was rigged. When initial vote tallies showed Mr. Morales had to face an uncertain second round of elections, the ballot count suddenly stopped. Election officials didn’t provide updates for nearly 24 hours without giving an explanation. When the results were finally updated, the initial trends were reversed, giving Mr. Morales just enough of a lead to avoid a runoff and spurring the opposition to take to the streets. “We want President Evo Morales to go,” the leader of Bolivia’s civic opposition, Luis Fernando Camacho, told reporters in La Paz on Friday. “We need him to go because we have decided so, because he has laughed at all of us.” Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Caracas, Venezuela; Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro; and Mónica Machicao reported from La Paz, Bolivia.']",Key allies resigned and anti-government protesters took over government offices in anger over last month’s disputed election.
"The City That Cycles With the Young, the Old, the Busy and the Dead",2019-11-09,By Peter S. Goodman,"['COPENHAGEN — By the standards operative on most of planet Earth, this is not an especially wonderful day for a bicycle ride. The temperature reads 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and a vengeful breeze forces damp chill to the bone. Sullen gray clouds occupy the sky, dispensing an apathetic drizzle. Natalie Gulsrud scoffs at these details. It is nearing 4 p.m., darkness already bringing finality to this bleak November afternoon. She has to go to the child care center to pick up her 5-year-old son — “5 and a half,” he quickly corrects, later. She has to stop for groceries, and then head home for dinner. Like tens of thousands of other people in Denmark’s elegant yet frequently dank capital, she pedals her way through her daily rounds, relying on the world’s most advanced and widely used network of bicycle lanes. She does not own a car. She does not want a car. She settles her bag into the front compartment of her cargo bike — a three-wheeled contraption built for hauling children and groceries that is something like the S.U.V. of local family transportation. She climbs aboard the saddle, gathers her overcoat around her, and leans into the uncompromising wind. “People here say there’s no such thing as bad weather,” said Ms. Gulsrud, 39. “Only bad clothing.” On the other side of the Atlantic, New York has just proclaimed intentions to spend $1.7 billion to dramatically expand the city’s now-convoluted and treacherous patchwork of bicycle lanes. Local leaders speak of dismantling car culture and replacing it with a wholesome dependence on human-powered vehicles. The mission is draped in high-minded goals — addressing climate change, unclogging traffic and promoting exercise. Copenhagen’s legendary bicycle setup has been propelled by all of these aspirations, but the critical element is the simplest: People here eagerly use their bicycles — in any weather, carrying the young, the infirm, the elderly and the dead — because it is typically the easiest way to get around. “It’s A to B-ism,” said Mikael Colville-Andersen, a raffish bicycle evangelist who preaches the gospel of Copenhagen to other cities. “It’s the fastest way from point to point.” The bicycle is liberation from municipal buses and their frequent stops. The bicycle spares people from having to worry about where to park cars. The bicycle puts people in control of when they leave and when they arrive. “Some people ride their bikes to the hospital to give birth,” said Ms. Gulsrud, who is herself pregnant with her second child. “I’m not going to do that.” A former neighbor operates a bicycle mortuary service, pedaling the departed to their final destinations in caskets. Mail carriers use bicycles to deliver parcels. People use bicycles to get to the airport, sometimes pushing wheeled suitcases alongside them while they roll. Some 49 percent of all journeys to school and work now transpire by bicycle, according to the city, up from 36 percent a decade ago. When the municipal government recently surveyed Copenhagen’s bikers on what inspires them to bike, 55 percent said it was more convenient than the alternatives. Only 16 percent cited environmental benefits. “It’s not in the morning, when you’re late for work, that you want to save the planet,” said Marie Kastrup, who heads the city’s bicycle program. On weekday mornings, some 42,000 people traverse the Queen Louise’s bridge in central Copenhagen, bringing residents from fashionable neighborhoods in the north into the city’s medieval center. On a recent soggy Monday, a woman in high heels and a trench coat pedaled a cargo bike decked out like a city taxi, her three toddlers in the front compartment. A plumber traversed the traffic in a cargo bike, his tools stashed in the compartment. Bicycles vastly outnumber cars. Most of the bicycles were old-school upright varieties distinguished by their utility and lack of appeal to thieves, whose ubiquity is a gnawing source of worry among the pedaling class.  But on the opposite side of the thoroughfare, in a shopfront done up like a Parisian boutique, a retailer, Larry vs. Harry, displayed its sleek, shiny two-wheeled cargo bike, The Bullitt, which sells for as much as 43,450 Danish kroner, about $6,500. Three models are parked in the front window, green, yellow and red, glinting like Ferraris. Nearby at Nihola, a cargo bike brand that is more like the Toyota of the pedaling scene, a showroom displays compartments big enough to fit four children. One can carry a wheelchair. Front doors swing open, allowing toddlers and dogs to climb in. Copenhagen’s status as a global exemplar of bicycle culture owes to the accommodating flatness of the terrain and the lack of a Danish auto industry, which might have hijacked the policy levers. Trouble also played a role.  The global oil shock of the 1970s lifted the price of gasoline, making driving exorbitantly costly. A dismal economy in the 1980s brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy, depriving it of finance to build roads, and making bicycle lanes an appealingly thrifty alternative. The city focused on making biking safe and comfortable, setting lanes apart from cars on every street. As biking captured mass interest, improving the infrastructure became good politics. When it snows in Copenhagen, bike lanes are typically plowed first. This was the situation that drew Ms. Gulsrud to Copenhagen from her native United States. Raised in the Pacific Northwest, she was pursuing graduate studies in public policy and working to promote bicycle commuting in Seattle when she opted for a semester in Copenhagen in 2009. She fell hard for the city, transferred her studies here, and now teaches natural resources management at the University of Copenhagen. She and her husband, Kasper Rasmussen, his 9-year-old daughter, Pixie, and their son Pascal, live in a sixth-story walk-up apartment in Vesterbro, a former warren of leatherworks shops that has rapidly gentrified, yielding peculiar contrasts. Prostitutes trawl for customers at night, walking past shops that sell Tibetan mandala paintings, organic produce and essential oils. “The other day, I heard people talking about whether their dogs were vegan,” Ms. Gulsrud said. She picked up Pascal in the handsome yet fading villa that is his child care center. He balked at putting on his coat despite the chill. She strapped him into a harness inside her compartment as he pulled on his helmet. She zipped shut a clear plastic cover, shielding him from the weather.  Then she rode through puddles to the grocery store, where she scanned dozens of bicycles lining the sidewalk until she found a spot big enough to accommodate hers. Emerging from the market, she deposited her groceries — kale, milk, Greek yogurt — into the compartment in front of Pascal and rode a few blocks to her apartment. She pulled open the gate and wheeled into the courtyard. The walls there were lined with bicycles — the cargo bike her neighbor, a medical student, uses to transport her three children, including her 6-month-old in a bassinet; her husband’s cargo bike, which includes an electric engine to help with hills; and standard bicycles used by the Pakistani immigrant family upstairs, by the Argentine-Brazilian couple and their two small children, and by her neighbor from Sweden and her wife and their two children. Not long ago, modernity felt bound for something like the Jetsons, with families zipping around via jet packs. But maybe this is the future, a resumption of the past, upgraded by contemporary design. “The infrastructure is there and it’s safe,” said Mr. Rasmussen, as he prepared a comforting dinner of squash soup and home-baked sourdough bread. “Why wouldn’t you bike? It’s stupid not to bike.”']",Nearly half of all journeys to school and work in Copenhagen take place on bicycles. And people like it that way.
Bolivian Mayor Assaulted by Protesters in Postelection Mayhem,2019-11-08,By Mónica Machicao and Kirk Semple,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — In a spasm of violence related to last month’s disputed presidential election, protesters kidnapped the mayor of a small town in central Bolivia on Wednesday, forcibly cut her hair, drenched her with red paint, made her sign an improvised resignation letter, then marched her through the streets barefoot, witnesses said. The protesters had accused the official, Patricia Arce, mayor of Vinto, of orchestrating a pro-government mob that tried on Wednesday to break up an antigovernment blockade, a clash that resulted in the death of an antigovernment protester, officials said. Ms. Arce is a member of the party led by President Evo Morales, who claims he won a fourth consecutive term in the Oct. 20 election by a sufficient margin to avoid a runoff. But opponents contend that the election was marred by fraud and have paralyzed the nation with protests that have erupted into clashes with security forces. At least three people have died in the demonstrations. Violent protests continued in La Paz, the capital, on Thursday night with reports of clashes involving Molotov cocktails and at least four people wounded, including two police officers. President Morales condemned the attack on the mayor. “All my solidarity with our sister, mayor of Vento, Patricia Arce, who was kidnapped and cruelly harassed for expressing and defending her ideals and the principles of the poorest,” he wrote on Twitter. Earlier in the day, clashes had erupted in Vinto between club-wielding supporters of Mr. Morales and antigovernment protesters who were blocking a bridge. When word spread that at least one person, a 20-year-old man, had been pummeled to death, a mob of antigovernment protesters marched to town hall to seek revenge on the mayor, whom they accused of having bused in thousands of Morales supporters to break the blockade, witnesses said. Protesters wearing masks to conceal their identities hauled Ms. Arce out of her office and forced her to walk barefoot to the bridge where the blockade was happening. The protesters — yelling “Murderess!” — made her kneel down, then cut her hair, sprayed her with red paint and forced her to sign the resignation letter, according to witnesses and local news accounts. The mob then paraded her around town. Throughout the ordeal, she denied that she had organized the government supporters who had tried to break up the blockade. In a video that circulated on social media, Ms. Arce, drenched in red paint, her hair shorn, is surrounded by masked protesters. “I’m not going to shut up,” she says defiantly. “And if they want to kill me, may they kill me.” She adds: “For this process of change, I will give my life.” Ms. Arce was eventually rescued by the police. A team from the Organization of American States is in Bolivia conducting an audit of the election, but the results are unlikely to ease tensions. Carlos Mesa, Mr. Morales’s main challenger, has dismissed the audit and has urged his supporters to remain in the streets. Mr. Mesa and his supporters say the vote was rigged. After polls closed on Oct. 20, Bolivia’s electoral tribunal released a preliminary vote count that suggested Mr. Morales had fallen short of the 10-percentage-point lead he needed to avoid a runoff. Election officials stopped providing updates for nearly 24 hours without giving an explanation. But when results were finally updated the night after the election, the final tally put Mr. Morales ahead with just enough of a lead to avoid a runoff, spurring the opposition to take to the streets in protest. Mónica Machicao reported from La Paz, Bolivia, and Kirk Semple from Mexico City.']","After the mayor was accused of organizing a pro-government mob, antigovernment protesters kidnapped her, cut her hair and doused her in paint."
Indigenous Art That Targets Stereotypes,2019-11-08,By Ian Austen,"['The National Gallery of Canada had a rusty start when it came to Indigenous people and their art. It had been around for 47 years before it finally showed any works by Indigenous people in 1927 as part of a West Coast exhibit that is most remembered for introducing much of Canada to Emily Carr, a non-Indigenous woman whose paintings often portrayed Indigenous art. All that’s long gone. A complete rethink of its Indigenous galleries just over two years ago won praise from even some skeptical Indigenous art historians.  On Thursday night, I attended an event that dramatically underscored the prominence of Indigenous artists within the National Gallery. A crowd of about 2,500 squeezed into its main hall while several hundred other people were turned away for the opening of a major, international exhibition of contemporary Indigenous art called Àbadakone, the Algonquin word for continuous fire. (It’s pronounced AH-bada-kwanay.) While Indigenous artists from Canada and the United States are prominently featured among 70 artists in the exhibit, so are a wide range of cultures, including the Sápmi of Norway, Māori from New Zealand and the Yorùbá people of Nigeria.  For people who don’t follow Indigenous art closely, many of the 100 works in the exhibition may not fit their preconceived notions. Ursula Johnson, a performance and installation artist of Mi’kmaw ancestry from Nova Scotia, told me that Indigenous art has always evolved in both its forms and materials. Beading, variations of which appear in several works of the show, only developed after Europeans arrived. “There are customary practices of working with materials, but as time changes, as materials change, then we’re constantly adapting,” she said over the roar of the opening night crowd. “Look around the room: There’s plastic, there’s vinyl, there’s Kevlar, there are all kinds of materials that are being worked with because these are the materials of our society today. It’s not just wood, bones, stone.” While many of the artists showed up for the opening ceremony in a global array of traditional dress, Ms. Johnson wore a piece of contemporary Indigenous art. It was a Chicago Blackhawks jersey on which Carrie Allison, a young Métis artist, had replaced the embroidered team logo, which is widely seen as offensive among members of Indigenous communities, with one created in beads. Several of the works in the exhibition were entirely created or finished at the gallery — a process that involved, among other things, tanning animal hides over open fires in its forecourt.  Four Māori women who prefer to be only known as the Mata Aho Collective, took traditional hand-weaving to a monumental scale with a 14-meter, or 45-foot, high cylinder of green, nylon marine rope that now dominates one of the gallery’s spaces. The group, which often mixes traditional techniques with industrial materials, started the work at a university laboratory in New Zealand normally used for volcanic ash studies. But its ceiling topped out at 10 meters, forcing them to finish the job, which was commissioned by the gallery, in Ottawa. It was worth the globe-spanning effort. Their sculpture is spectacular. The exhibition, which runs until April, is the second show in what the gallery promises will be a continuing series. “It has to be a series because of the number of amazing artists, truly great contemporary artists who are Indigenous, around the world,” Christine Lalonde, one of the exhibition’s three curators, told me. “So next week we’ll start working on the next one.” Not surprisingly, regardless of where the artists live, many of them used their works to examine the effects of European colonization on their cultures. Ruth Cuthand, who is of Plains Cree, Scottish and Irish ancestry and lives in Saskatoon, used elaborate beadwork to recreate microscopic images of diseases brought from Europe that brought devastation to many Indigenous groups. Ms. Johnson’s pieces in the show are eight acrylic vitrines with hand-etched and sandblasted images of traditional Mi’kmaw baskets made by her great-grandmother, Caroline Gould. As the crowd formed a long and patient queue to enter the exhibition, I asked Ms. Johnson what she hoped non-Indigenous Canadians who attended would take from the artists’ work. “It’s work for us to constantly try to break down stereotypes,” she said. “But if non-Indigenous people come in and say: ‘Wow, I had no idea that this existed. Can you excuse my naïveté or my ignorance of not knowing the history of this tribal culture and explain some of this to me?’— that’s totally O.K., because then we’ll actually begin to make change together.” A flood of oil from Canada and three other countries is about to gush into world markets. Clifford Krauss, a former Times correspondent based in Toronto who now covers the energy industry from Houston, found that its consequence is likely not what Alberta’s oil industry wants to hear: lower prices. A 31-year-old French citizen fluent in French can’t get a certificate she needs to settle permanently in Quebec. Why? One chapter of her doctoral thesis was written in English rather than in French. For 101 years, Niagara Falls’ attractions have included the wreck of a dredging scow stuck just above its precipice. And for a century after the dramatic rescue of its two passengers, it did nothing but slowly rust. Until Halloween. A storm flipped it over and has brought the scow closer to the point of no return. In Opinion, the runner Mary Cain speaks out on the tolls Nike and its coaches took on her emotional and physical health in a chilling video. It costs $100 a jar, and now manuka honey has become a source of major tension between Australia and New Zealand.  And also from Australia: The conservative prime minister has suggested that it’s time to outlaw climate change protests in the name of the economy. It’s not just advertising.

The Fall of the Berlin Wall in Photos: An Accident of History That Changed The World,2019-11-09,By Katrin Bennhold,"['The Communist regime was prepared for everything “except candles and prayers.” East Germany’s peaceful 1989 revolution showed that societies that don’t reform, die. By Katrin Bennhold BERLIN — When Werner Krätschell, an East German pastor and dissident, heard that the Berlin Wall was open, he did not quite believe it. But he grabbed his daughter and her friend and drove to the nearest checkpoint to see for himself.  It was the night of Nov. 9, 1989. As their yellow Wartburg advanced unimpeded into what had always been an off-limits security zone, Mr. Krätschell rolled down the window and asked a border guard: “Am I dreaming or is this reality?” “You are dreaming,” the guard replied. It had long been a dream for East Berliners like Mr. Krätschell to see this towering symbol of unfreedom running like a scar of cement and barbed wire through the heart of their home city ripped open.  And when it finally became reality, when the Cold War’s most notorious armed border opened overnight, and was torn apart in the days that followed, it was not in the end the result of some carefully crafted geopolitical grand bargain.  It was, at the most basic level at least, the wondrous result of human error, spontaneity and individual courage.  “It was not predestined,” said Anne Applebaum, the historian and columnist. “It was not a triumph of good over evil. It was basically incompetence — and chance.” In the early evening of that fateful November day, a news conference took a historic turn. Against the backdrop of mass protests and a wave of eastern German refugees that had already fled the country via Hungary and what was then Czechoslovakia, Günter Schabowski, the leader of the East Berlin Communist Party, convened journalists to announce a series of reforms to ease travel restrictions. When asked when the new rules would take effect, Mr. Schabowski paused and studied the notes before him with a furrowed brow. Then he stumbled through a partially intelligible answer, declaring, “It takes effect, as far as I know... it is now... immediately.” It was a mistake. The Politburo had planned nothing of the sort. The idea had been to appease the growing resistance movement with minor adjustments to visa rules — and also to retain the power to deny travel. But many took Mr. Schabowski by his word. After West Germany’s main evening news, popular with East Germans who had long stopped trusting their own state-controlled media, effectively declared the wall open, crowds started heading for checkpoints at the Berlin Wall, demanding to cross. At one of those checkpoints, a Stasi officer who had always been loyal to the regime, was working the night shift. His name was Lt. Col. Harald Jäger. And his order was to turn people away. As the crowd grew, the colonel repeatedly called his superiors with updates. But no new orders were forthcoming. At some point he listened in to a call with the ministry, where he overheard one senior official questioning his judgment. “Someone in the ministry asked whether Comrade Jäger was in a position to assess the situation properly or whether he was acting out of fear,” Mr. Jäger recalled years later in an interview with Der Spiegel. “When I heard that, I’d had enough.” “If you don’t believe me, then just listen!” he shouted down the line, then took the receiver and held it out the window. Shortly after, Mr. Jäger defied his superiors and opened the crossing, starting a domino effect that eventually hit all checkpoints in Berlin. By midnight, triumphant easterners had climbed on top of the wall in the heart of the city, popping champagne corks and setting off fireworks in celebration. Not a single shot was fired. And no Soviet tanks appeared.  That, said Axel Klausmeier, director of the Berlin Wall Foundation, was perhaps the greatest miracle of that night. “It was a peaceful revolution, the first of its kind,” he said. “They were prepared for everything, except candles and prayers.” Through its history more than 140 people had died at the Berlin Wall, the vast majority of them trying to escape.  There was Ida Siekmann, 58, who became the first victim on Aug. 22, 1961, just nine days after the wall was finished. She died jumping from her third-floor window after the front of her house on Bernauer Strasse had become became part of the border, the front door filled in with bricks.  Peter Fechter, 18, became the most famous victim a year later. Shot several times in the back as he scaled the wall, he fell back onto the eastern side where he lay for over an hour, shouting for help and bleeding to death, as eastern guards looked on and western cameras whirled. The youngest victim was 15-month-old Holger H., who suffocated when his mother tried to quiet him while the truck his family was hiding in was being searched on Jan. 22, 1971. The parents made it across before realizing that their baby was dead. For the first half of 1989, it was still nearly impossible to get out of East Germany: The last killing at the wall took place in February that year, the last shooting, a close miss, in April.  The Soviets had squashed an East German uprising in June 1953 and suppressed similar rebellions in Hungary in 1956 and Prague in 1968.  In June 1989, just five months before the Berlin Wall fell, the Communist Party of China committed a massacre against democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. “They had been shooting people for 40 years,” said Ms. Applebaum, the historian. “No one knew what they would do in 1989.” But 1989 proved different. In the end, what gave people courage to resist were a series of shocks that had already shaken Soviet Communism to the core. Poland’s successful Solidarity movement, which had culminated in a semi-free election that year, was one. Others included a series of social and political reforms across Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe with which the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev hoped to preserve — not end — his Communist Party’s control. And perhaps most important, Ms. Applebaum said, belief in the system had long evaporated.  “The ideology had collapsed and people just didn’t believe in it anymore,” she said.  That is how the little things that culminated in this historic moment could become big things, said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at Oxford University. But that is sometimes misunderstood. “We took one of the most non-linear events and turned it into a linear version of history,” said Mr. Garton Ash.  The fall of the Berlin Wall became the end of history and liberalism the unchallenged model of modernity. Now illiberalism, Chinese-style, is challenging the West. Complacency is dangerous, said Ms. Applebaum: “The lesson is: Societies that don’t reform, die.” Mr. Krätschell, the pastor, had been among those demanding reforms and protesting the system with peaceful means. He held dissident meetings in his home and was harassed by the Stasi, East Germany’s fearsome secret police, for years. The churches played an important role in the resistance movement against East Germany’s Communist authorities.  “We knew: All the phone calls were bugged,” said Mr. Krätschell, now 79. Years later, after reading his own Stasi file, he learned that special commandos had bugged his home, updating the technology whenever he was on holiday with his family.  Soon after Mr. Krätschell, the pastor, had driven across the border on Nov. 9, 1989, a friend of his daughter who was also in the car asked him to pull over. She was 21 and pregnant and had never set foot in the West before.  Once Mr. Krätschell had parked, she opened the door, stuck her leg out, and touched the floor with her foot. Then she smiled triumphantly. “It was like the moon landing,” recalled Mr. Krätschell, “a kind of Neil Armstrong moment.”  Later, back in the East, she had called her parents and said, “Guess what, I was in the West.” Christopher F.

Another Election in Spain Threatens to Deepen the Political Deadlock,2019-11-09,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — In September, Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s caretaker Socialist prime minister, called off coalition talks with a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos, saying that he “could not have slept at night” if he had allowed its more radical politicians into his government. It is unclear, however, that Mr. Sánchez has been able to sleep better since. The acrimonious breakdown of talks to form a government is forcing Spain to hold its fourth national election in four years, a vote that will take place on Sunday. And the latest opinion polls suggest that the outcome is too close to call, with no single party likely to come near to winning a parliamentary majority.  The vote could plunge Spain into another round of tortuous coalition talks that would prolong the political sclerosis. Mr. Sánchez and his Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party remain in the lead, according to pollsters, but the repeat election provides an unexpectedly early opportunity for right-wing parties to benefit from the bickering among left-wing politicians. One of the parties most likely to reap such gains is the anti-migration and ultranationalist Vox party, which entered Parliament after winning 10 percent of the vote in the last election, in April.  Writing in El Confidencial, Ignacio Varela, a columnist, warned that the new election was likely to result in a lower turnout, more deadlock and more extremism. “Right now,” he wrote, “the only party that has reasons to celebrate is Vox.” The election in April produced a near-record turnout of 76 percent, which helped Mr. Sánchez, who had mobilized left-wing voters to oppose the far-right threat of Vox. But most pollsters warn that in the election on Sunday, about one-third of the electorate is undecided about whom to vote for. That could lead to even lower participation, especially when coupled with increasing frustration among voters about their party leaders’ inability to form a government, let alone resolve the lengthy separatist conflict in Catalonia.  Four years ago, Spain’s two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape. Five parties, led by younger leaders, won at least 10 percent of the vote in the April election. But this new generation of politicians has shown little inclination to work together in a coalition government, leaving Spain in deadlock at a time when Europe’s economy is showing worrying signs of a slowdown. “Spain would benefit from having a stronger government capable of confronting problems, but I don’t see any rapid end to our crisis of governance,” said Jaime Pastor, a professor of politics at the UNED University.  “We have a paradoxical situation in which the leaders have gained almost absolute control over their own parties, but are mostly losing the trust of voters and seem unwilling to compromise and unable to negotiate any kind of agreement,” he added.  When the talks with Unidas Podemos collapsed, Mr. Sánchez gambled that voters would give him a stronger negotiating mandate, after his Socialists won the election in April but did not gain a parliamentary majority. Mr. Sánchez was also comforted at the time by a further splintering among politicians on his left, as one of the founders of Podemos broke away to set up his own formation. But then nine former separatist leaders of Catalonia were sentenced to prison last month for sedition, and the backlash in the northeastern region has returned Spain’s territorial conflict to the top of the agenda.  The sentencing unleashed not only peaceful mass protests, but also nights of violence during which the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters who set off bomb fires and threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers. In view of the violence on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities, right-wing parties have raised the pressure on Mr. Sánchez to use his executive emergency powers to restore law and order in the region. “It seems to me that the Spanish government no longer really knows what it should be doing in Catalonia,” said Manuel Valls, a former prime minister of France who sits on the municipal council of Barcelona. “The polls are looking worse, Vox is rising, and this is turning into a very uncertain situation.” Calm has returned to Catalonia this month, but, 4,500 Spanish police officers have been dispatched to the region to monitor the weekend election and avoid further turmoil. And the Catalan question is not going away, with candidates homing in on the issue during the only televised election debate between the main candidates, on Monday. Albert Rivera, the leader of the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party, held up a paving stone that he suggested had been thrown in Barcelona against the police, warning that the uncontrolled situation in Catalonia presented a “threat to democracy.”  Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, used his first televised election debate to demand that the Spanish government impose another period of direct rule from Madrid over Catalonia and ban all separatist parties for being “criminal organizations.” He also peppered his remarks with xenophobic comments about migrants and Islam, which mostly went unanswered.  In defense of the constitutional values of Spain, the newspaper El País wrote in an editorial that Mr. Abascal’s intervention “should raise all alarm bells without delay.” Before the April election, Pablo Casado, the leader of the Popular Party, called Mr. Sánchez a traitor and a felon for suggesting that a mediator could help resolve the Catalan conflict. But the party had its worst-ever showing in April, and Mr. Casado recently toned down his rhetoric in order to draw more moderate voters in Sunday’s election.  After the violence in Barcelona, Mr. Sánchez toughened his stance against the leaders of the independence movement. During the debate on Monday, he also promised to return to Spain Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan leader who fled to Brussels in 2017 and is fighting another extradition request. While the relationship between the governing politicians in Madrid and Barcelona has reached another low point, the separatist parties hope to turn the election on Sunday into an opportunity to strengthen their presence within the Spanish Parliament.  A good result will confirm “the failure of the Spanish government’s strategy to clamp down on Catalan Republican progress,” said Alfred Bosch, who oversees foreign affairs within the Catalan separatist government. On Monday, Mr. Sánchez called on his rivals to accept the idea that whichever party wins the most votes on Sunday should be allowed to form the next administration.  But Mr. Casado reminded Mr. Sánchez that he himself had blocked the re-election of the previous Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, forcing Spain into another repeat election in 2016 and 10 months of political stalemate.

The Populist Pastor Leading a Conservative Revival in South Korea,2019-11-08,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[' SEOUL, South Korea\u200b — Supporters credit him with “Moses’ leadership\u200b and Solomon’s wisdom\u200b.” Detractors invoke labels like “narcissistic demagogue” and “fake prophet.” Whatever else the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon may be called, there is no denying that the 63-year-old Presbyterian pastor has become a force to be reckoned with in South Korea, spearheading a conservative pushback against President Moon Jae-in. Once dismissed as a crank, Mr. Jun has attracted huge crowds to his rallies in central Seoul in recent weeks, forcing Mr. Moon’s justice minister, Cho Kuk\u200b, to step down. He is also demanding Mr. Moon’s resignation, \u200bcalling it “an order from the Lord.” “We cannot let a madman drive a car,” Mr. Jun said about Mr. Moon during an interview, a reference to a comment by a German pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, on Hitler. He adds, without evidence: “Moon Jae-in is the main North Korean spy.” Mr. Jun rouses his crowds, mostly older Christians, by constantly repeating such incendiary but easy-to-remember tag lines. Progressive leaders like Mr. Moon are “Communizing” South Korea, he says. Those “followers of North Korea” are “driving the country to ruin” by prying South Korea away from the United States and taking it closer to North Korea and China\u200b, he warns\u200b. Mr. Jun’s rise shares many aspects with the surge of Western right-wing populism: an appeal to patriotism and nativism; a penchant for ideological and anti-immigrant slurs; a frequent invocation of God and tradition; and the use of alternative news sources on social media to spread resentment and stoke fear that the country is in danger of “collapsing” or being “wiped off the face of the Earth.” Not surprisingly, Mr. Jun is a great admirer of President Trump. When Mr. Trump visited Seoul in 2017, Mr. Jun’s church members took to the streets, holding placards that read, “God be with President Trump” or “We pray for President Trump.” He says American evangelical Christians were “cheated by Obama” and elected Mr. Trump to prevent the United States from being Islamized through immigration.  Mr. Jun says South Korea is “a child of the United States” because the Americans liberated Korea from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II and defended it from Communist invaders during the 1950-53 Korean War. His rallies feature as many American flags as South Korean. Speaker after speaker calls anyone they suspect of undermining the alliance with Washington “evil” or “Satan,” while the crowds\u200b respond with “Amen!” or “Hallelujah!” \u200bThe chances of Mr. Moon resigning are all but nil, and analysts treat Mr. Jun as a quixotic firebrand whose flame will eventually peter out. But in past months, the pastor has brewed a political firestorm by exploiting two powerful sentiments: a fear of North Korea that is widespread among older South Koreans and growing discontent over an ailing domestic economy. Mr. Moon’s office initially dismissed Mr. Jun’s expletive-ridden diatribes against the president as “not worth commenting upon.” But last month, Mr. Moon’s Democratic Party asked the police to investigate Mr. Jun on charges of inciting sedition after he exhorted followers to join a band of “martyrs” who would invade Mr. Moon’s presidential Blue House to topple him. “His rallies could be off-putting to non-Christians because they look like church revival meetings, and some of his remarks, like his claim that Moon is a North Korean spy, sound over-the-top and propagandistic,” said Hwang Gui-hag, editor in chief of the Seoul-based Law Times, which specializes in church law and news. “But the thing is, his strategy works, making him a force that cannot be ignored.” Mr. Jun\u200b was born in Yecheon, in central South Korea, the eldest son in a deeply religious family that was converted \u200bby American missionaries \u200bwho \u200breached\u200b their village \u200bby river more than a century ago. He reached a defining moment in his life when, falling behind in his school classes, he was sent to live with a relative who was a pastor. By day he attended a vocational high school in electronics. At night, the Princeton-educated pastor taught Mr. Jun English and had him read widely, including the biography of South Korea’s autocratic founding president, Syngman Rhee, another Princeton-educated Christian, who relied on humanitarian aid from American churches and favored fellow Christians in his government. Mr. Jun said he was strongly influenced by the pastor, who was dedicated to the rights of the urban poor. Schooled in the idea that the church could serve as an instrument for social and political change, he enrolled in a seminary after high school. “Throughout history, the church has always been a political organization,” Mr. Jun said. South Korea’s churches have a history of political activism. Progressive pastors and priests campaigned against the military dictators who ruled the country in past decades. But conservative pastors equate religious faith with anti-Communist patriotism. Many of the mega churches in Seoul, with congregations of tens of thousands, were founded by evangelical Christians who fled Communist persecution \u200bin North Korea \u200b\u200bbefore the Korean War\u200b. Mr. Jun said he began organizing his “patriots’ rallies” in 2005, after his high school son came home one day to say that President George W. Bush \u200bshould be killed. The episode convinced him that unionized progressive teachers were poisoning children with anti-American and pro-North Korean ideology. Mr. Jun’s Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul claims a congregation of 5,000, and while his profile is rising, local news outlets have tended to write about him only to ridicule his ideas. He once said South Korea should boost its birthrates, one of the world’s lowest, by punishing families that produce fewer than five children. He also said that South Korea should Christianize itself by incarcerating all Buddhist monks on an island. \u200bHe once remarked that he was so trusted in his church that female members \u200bwould “take their panties off\u200b”\u200b before him if he \u200btold them to. Mr. Jun dismisses those remarks, saying either that he did not mean them literally or that the news media had quoted him out of context. \u200b But \u200bMr. Jun \u200bstill \u200bcalls abortion “murder” and says homosexuality makes the world “dirty.” His sermons brim with Islamophobic messages, and he routinely calls Arab immigrants potential “terrorists.” In January, Mr. Jun \u200bwon an important political perch when he \u200bwas elected head of the Christian Council of Korea, \u200ban umbrella group for conservative churches. When he held news conferences with his new title in June to demand Mr. Moon’s resignation, rival pastors called him “a son of vipers.” The National Council of Churches in Korea denounced him for leading his followers into “mass hysteria” through lies and fake statistics.  Still, most South Koreans did not take Mr. Jun seriously until Mr. Moon’s appointment of Mr. Cho as justice minister in August. Following news reports of a slew of ethical lapses in Mr. Cho’s family, Mr. Jun pounced. As public ire soared, his weekend rallies ballooned into some of the largest anti-government protests South Korea has seen in years. Mr. Jun has strong supporters among right-wing YouTube channels, which live-stream his rallies and promote viral narratives that spread resentment and polarize\u200b the society\u200b. Mr. Jun runs his own YouTube channel and helps fund like-minded YouTubers. He is also sponsoring the Christian Liberty Party, which hopes to become the first faith-based political party to win a seat in Parliament in April. Each night, hundreds of Mr. Jun’s followers camp out near Mr. Moon’s office to demand his resignation. When Mr. Jun appears in the morning, some rush to him offering cash donations and seeking his blessing. Some come from afar, like Kim Seok-nam, 69, \u200bwho \u200bflew from Sacramento, Calif., \u200bto join the sit-in for a few days. “He is a latter-day prophet\u200b,” Ms. Kim said after Mr. Jun blessed her with a prayer, putting his hand on her head, while she knelt and wept\u200b. She said she has donated $4,000 to Mr. Jun’s cause. “It’s the work of the Holy Spirit,” Mr. Jun said, when asked about his success. “It’s not me, but people’s anger against Moon that brought them out to my rallies.”']","Invoking God, patriotism and family values, the Rev.

At Least 3 Dead as Fires Rage Across Eastern Australia,2019-11-09,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Wildfires surging across Australia’s drought-ravaged East Coast have left three people dead and destroyed more than 150 homes, officials said on Saturday, sounding the alarm for what is expected to be one of the country’s worst recorded fire seasons. With summer heat waves still several weeks away, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires across New South Wales, mostly north of Sydney, where massive clouds of smoke drifted east, turning skies orange. The smoke clouds were large enough to create their own weather systems, experts said. Officials said it was unprecedented to see so many fires so out of control this early in spring. “The consequences are absolutely apparent and evident over the last few weeks and particularly highlighted in the last 24 hours,” said Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “We have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We’re not even in summer yet.” The dire assessment from both firefighters and meteorologists — who warned of dry, windy conditions to come — confirmed what scientists have been predicting: Australia’s bush fires will become more frequent and more intense as climate change worsens. Few if any other developed countries in the world are as vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate as Australia, according to independent scientific reports. The country’s ecology combines a vast arid interior with rapidly-heating ocean currents that make it a global hot spot for warming seas. And over the past year, the urgency of the issue has increased because of a drought that’s settled across swaths of the country’s most productive agricultural areas — including some of those now ablaze. Farmers and residents in the areas that are now burning have reported being surprised by both the intensity and speed of the fires’ spread. Some residents reported seeing flames that were 60 feet tall. Others drove through conditions that looked apocalyptic.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Defense Force would help where needed, and financial assistance would be made available to people affected by the fires. “The devastating and horrific fires that we have seen particularly in New South Wales but also in Queensland have been absolutely chilling,” Mr. Morrison told reporters in Sydney. Two of the people who were killed died near Glen Innes, a small town of around 6,000 people northeast of Coffs Harbour.  Firefighters said they found a body on Saturday in a burned car. Another woman, found on Friday unconscious and with serious burns, later died in a hospital. At least seven more people have been reported missing near the same fire. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, described the terrifying scene.  “People were burned, lives were lost,” she told reporters. “People battled to save their houses and then had to walk out because their cars had blown up — it was just horrific.” Commissioner Fitzsimmons said more deaths and damage were likely to be on the way. “Not only is it about next week,” he said, “but, unfortunately, the forecast for the balance of the season continues to be driven by above-normal temperatures, below-average rainfall.”']","Firefighters warned of dry, windy conditions to come, signaling an early start for what could be the country’s worst fire season in decades.

"As Deaths Mount in Iraq Protests, a Rocket Attack Raises New Questions",2019-11-09,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — At least two people were killed Friday as antigovernment protests entered their fifth week amid rising concern that security forces continue to use lethal force in defiance of senior military officials. The deaths, which occurred in clashes between protesters and security forces in the southern city of Basra, raised the number of dead to nearly 300 since demonstrations calling for an end to corruption and a change in leadership began last month. And as protests gripped the country’s south and the capital, Baghdad, a rocket attack in the north created a new level of uncertainty.  Seventeen rockets struck inside and near the Gayara military base south of Mosul on Friday, said Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, the spokesman for the Joint Command in Baghdad.  Most of the troops at the base are Iraqi but some American personnel are also stationed there.  No one was killed or wounded at the base, General al-Khafaji said, and an American counterstrike killed three people. It was not clear who launched the rocket attack,  although the Islamic State has been active in the area for the past year, largely targeting small villages that have failed to comply with its demands for shelter, food and support.  Northern Iraq has been largely untouched by the political turbulence in Baghdad and the south. Human rights groups have issued increasingly worried statements about the tactics being used against unarmed, largely peaceful protesters.  A banner unfurled near the main protest site in Baghdad cried out for international intervention. “To the whole world, to the United Nations, to the European Union, to the Security Council, to the Arab League: They stole my country and killed our young men and destroyed our Iraq.”  Since the demonstrations began, 294 Iraqis have been killed and 9,800 wounded, according to a survey of hospitals by the Iraqi government.  United Nations officials in Geneva said Friday that the Iraqi government was not doing enough to defuse the protests and had failed to rein in security forces and militias, some of which have fired live ammunition at protesters. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, told reporters that the Iraqi government had not started any meaningful dialogue with protesters. “To get out of that cycle they clearly need to do more than they are now,” he said. United Nations officials are also alarmed by reports that protesters have been abducted by unknown people, Mr. Colville said, and that demonstrators, bloggers and social media commentators have been arrested. Human rights groups have criticized the tear gas canisters and the tactics  of the security forces. The canisters are larger than those used in many urban crowd-control operations, and they are sometimes shot directly at protesters, causing lethal head injuries.    “We lost so many brothers and friends, we have so many martyrs,” said Ali Hassan, 30, who has a master’s degree in business administration but has been unable to find a job.  He said the government was behaving “like a mafia.” “They are killing so many unarmed people, so we are asking for help from the United Nations, from the European Union,” he said. “Please, please help bring peace between our security forces and all of our unarmed people.”  Nick Cummings Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.  ']",Nearly 300 Iraqis have died in antigovernment demonstrations in the south and in the capital. A rocket attack in the north has added yet another level of uncertainty.
"More Spending on Public Services? Sure, Boris Johnson Says",2019-11-08,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Outside 10 Downing Street this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain launched his election campaign with a broadside against his opponents — joking that delays to Brexit made him want to chew his necktie — but then abruptly changed tack. With a wave of his arm, he promised the biggest program of health spending in a generation. Then came a pledge of billions of pounds for schools. That was followed by one to hire 20,000 police officers. As for rail and road, there would be nothing less than a “revolution” in infrastructure. “It’s only if you have great public services that you can have a successful market economy,” said Mr. Johnson, banging his fists on a lectern to underscore the point. After years of austerity from the ruling Conservatives many Britons would agree. Yet the promise to transform Britain’s creaking, overstretched, public services is one of the more remarkable election pitches of recent years. In effect, Mr. Johnson is running against his own party’s record of nine years in power. “He really is pulling off the brakes of austerity and seeking to inject money into the public services that we haven’t seen recently from the Conservatives,” said Sophia Gaston, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, who argued that the election campaign had added a new and surreal dimension to the country’s Brexit convulsions. “You have this messaging from the Conservatives that Britain deserves better, and you think, ‘Well you have been in power for almost 10 years,’” Ms. Gaston said. “It is really extraordinary.” Behind the shift is a simple strategy. Mr. Johnson and his Conservatives need to appeal to working-class voters, who have traditionally spurned the Tories. The route to victory, said Craig Oliver, who was director of communications to former Prime Minister David Cameron, is “to convince them that their concerns — like the health service — are your concerns too.”  Mr. Johnson has been prime minister only since July and was not in Parliament when austerity began in 2010 under a Conservative-led coalition. He is, however, a lifetime Tory, was twice elected mayor of London for the Conservatives and served for two years as foreign secretary in the cabinet of his predecessor, Theresa May. But that was then. On Thursday the chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, tore up the government’s fiscal rule book and announced plans that would allow an extra 22 billion pounds a year in public investment, financed by borrowing.  In opening the spending taps, the Conservatives have learned the lesson of Mrs. May’s disastrous 2017 election campaign, a contest she precipitated in the hubristic expectation of a big win to help her push Brexit over the finish line. But Mrs. May proved to be a wooden campaigner and lost her majority. Part of her failure was blamed on a manifesto that offered voters a combination of Brexit and more economic pain. This time, Mr. Oliver said, “the Tories are doing much more on public spending to show that they understand their concerns.” So much, in fact, that according to one report, both main parties “would push the U.K. state close to — or even above — 1970s levels of spending,” a reference to a decade associated with heavy public spending and an economic malaise from which the country was jolted by the bracing market economics of the Conservative Margaret Thatcher. “The election therefore has the potential to reverse the Thatcher revolution on the public finances,” said the report from the Resolution Foundation, adding that the Tory plans would lift government spending to 41.3 percent of gross domestic product. Yet for Mr. Johnson this is not an easy fight. The opposition Labour Party wants to go further and on Thursday its finance spokesman, John McDonnell, promised “investment on a scale never seen before,” outlining plans that would allow 55 billion pounds a year in extra capital spending. And critics point out that this new approach is an implicit admission that the Conservatives got austerity wrong. Architects of the policy argue that it was needed to stabilize public finances after the financial crisis and huge bailout of the banking sector. Others note that, while Mr. Johnson wants to recruit 20,000 new police officers, that would simply take the numbers up to where they were when his Conservatives took power in 2010. “Whether or not you think austerity was the right policy in macroeconomic terms, what we are seeing now is an admission that the way it was implemented was wrong because it proved politically unsustainable,” said Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College, London. “There is no economic rationale for cutting 20,000 police officers and then deciding a few years later that you need to hire 20,000 to get back to where you were,” he said. “It’s just a stupid way to run the country.” Carys Roberts, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a center-left think tank, sees increased spending as a political expedient for the Tories rather than a fundamental shift. “I don’t think the Conservative Party has had some kind of Damascene conversion,” she added. “I think they are in election mode and realize that the country is tired of austerity and tired of underinvestment in public services.” “The problem is that they haven’t yet announced how they will fund it in the long term,” she said. Inside the Conservative Party there is concern about sacrificing a reputation for sound economic management cultivated by the sober former chancellor, Philip Hammond, nicknamed “spreadsheet Phil.” For one thing, it makes it harder to accuse the Labour Party of profligacy or, as it did in 2017, of believing in a “magic money tree.”  The other question is whether it will work. “One of the lessons that the Tories have taken from the Brexit referendum campaign is that the long tail of austerity had really impacted on towns and communities and so this is part of their strategy to remake the Conservative Party as the Brexit Party,” said Ms. Gaston, referring to the populist party led by Nigel Farage who wants a quicker and sharper break with the European Union. But it is far from assured that Mr. Johnson will win over voters who might have spent a lifetime supporting Labour and remember how the Tories, under Mrs. Thatcher, sacrificed thousands of jobs in manufacturing and mining.

"Ukraine’s Zelensky Bowed to Trump’s Demands, Until Luck Spared Him",2019-11-07,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KIEV, Ukraine — It was early September, and Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, faced an agonizing choice: whether to capitulate to President Trump’s demands to publicly announce  investigations against his political enemies or to refuse, and lose desperately needed military aid. Only Mr. Trump could unlock the aid, he had been told by two United States senators, and time was running out. If the money, nearly $400 million, were not unblocked by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, it could be lost in its entirety. In a flurry of WhatsApp messages and meetings in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, over several days, senior aides debated the point. Avoiding partisan politics in the United States had always been the first rule of Ukrainian foreign policy, but the military aid was vital to the war against Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives since it began in 2014. By then, however, Mr. Zelensky’s staffers were already conceding to what seemed to be the inevitable, and making plans for a public announcement about the investigations. It was a fateful decision for a fledgling president elected on an anticorruption platform that included putting an end to politically motivated investigations. Elements of this internal Ukrainian debate have appeared in the Ukrainian news media and seeped into congressional testimony in the United States, as part of an impeachment inquiry undertaken after accusations surfaced of Mr. Trump’s demands.  But interviews in Kiev with government officials, lawmakers and others close to the Zelensky government have revealed new details of how high-level Ukrainian officials ultimately decided to acquiesce to President Trump’s request — and, by a stroke of luck, never had to follow through. Aides were arguing in favor of “bowing to what was demanded,” said Petro Burkovskiy, a senior fellow at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation who has close ties to the Ukrainian government. They were willing to do so, he said, despite the risk of losing bipartisan support in the United States by appearing to assist Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. “The cost was high.” As President Trump’s principal envoy to Ukraine, Gordon Sondland, admitted Tuesday in congressional testimony, the Trump administration had withheld the military aid to pressure Mr. Zelensky to make a public statement on the two investigations: one into whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had pressed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a natural gas company where his son served on the board; the other into unproven accusations that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 election to promote the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. In the July 25 phone call that provoked a whistle-blower complaint and touched off the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Zelensky offered private assurances that his government would look into those matters.  But a public statement that raised doubts about Russian meddling and Mr. Biden, whom the president regarded as the greatest threat to his re-election, would be far more useful politically to Mr. Trump. Not only would it smear Mr. Biden, it could also appear to undermine the Mueller investigation into Russian electoral interference by pinning some blame on Ukraine. A tug-of-war ensued between a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, and another of Mr. Trump’s envoys to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, over the wording of the proposed public statement. Mr. Volker went so far as to draft a statement for Mr. Zelensky that mentioned both investigations. Mr. Yermak pushed back, suggesting language that mentioned investigations but in general terms, so as not to antagonize the Democrats. Late in the negotiations, the American diplomats consented to dropping mention of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Even as Mr. Yermak negotiated the wording in August, the stakes were clear. While rumors had been swirling for months about a possible hold on military aid, by early August high-level Ukrainian officials had confirmed the freeze. The trade soon became explicit. They were approached in September by Mr. Sondland, a major donor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration who had been appointed ambassador to the European Union despite having no diplomatic experience. At that point, he explained in blunt terms to Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Yermak, there was little chance the aid would be forthcoming until they made the public statement on the investigations. “I said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,” Mr. Sondland said in sworn testimony released Tuesday by the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry.   Mr. Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to speak on CNN, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, testified. But aides to Mr. Zelensky, on high alert to avoid any move that might irritate Mr. Trump, wondered if that was such a good idea, in that Mr. Trump habitually called CNN “fake news” in his Twitter posts. They also uncovered a post from Mr. Trump attacking Fox News as “not working for us anymore!”  Nearly all Mr. Zelensky’s top advisers favored his making the public statement, said one of the officials who participated in the debate. United States military aid, they agreed, as well as diplomatic backing for impending peace talks to end the war outweighed the risks of appearing to take sides in American politics. There was a lone holdout — Alexander Danyliuk, the director of the national security council. Mr. Danyliuk, who resigned in late September, told the Ukrainian news media that the Zelensky administration would now need to “correct the mistakes” in relations with the United States and “in particular their own.” Finally bending to the White House request, Mr. Zelensky’s staff planned for him to make an announcement in an interview on Sept. 13 with Fareed Zakaria, the host of a weekly news show on CNN. Though plans were in motion to give the White House the public statement it had sought, events in Washington saved the Ukrainian government from any final decision and eliminated the need to make the statement. Word of the freeze in military aid had leaked out, and Congress was in an uproar. Two days before the scheduled interview, the Trump administration released the assistance and Mr. Zelensky’s office quickly canceled the interview. Since then, Trump administration officials including the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, have tried to argue that the security assistance could not have been conditioned on the public statement, because the aid was released without it.  That stance has crumbled as a succession of United States diplomats, capped by Mr. Sondland on Tuesday, have testified in the impeachment inquiry that the freeze on aid was part of a quid pro quo designed to coerce Mr. Zelensky into making the public statement. In Kiev, there is still a debate about whether Mr. Zelensky caved or held out. “The Zelensky team was ready to make this quid quo pro,” said Mr. Burkovskiy, the analyst. “They were ready to do this.”  But Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s foreign minister until a change of government on Aug. 29, said there was no telling what Mr. Zelensky would have ended up saying in the interview, as there were so many versions of a statement under negotiation.  “From the contacts that took place, it’s difficult to say if they led, or did not lead, to concrete deals,” Mr. Klimkin said in an interview. In public, Mr. Zelensky has insisted he would never order a politicized prosecution. Either way, Mr. Klimkin said, Ukrainian officials were at the least keenly aware of the stakes — a trade of United States assistance for political favors, even as Mr. Trump’s supporters have insisted they should not have viewed relations in this light. “We are not idiots, or at least not all of us,” Mr. Klimkin said.

China Sentences Man to Death for Trafficking Fentanyl to the U.S.,2019-11-07,By Steven Lee Myers,"['XINGTAI, China — A court in China convicted and sentenced to death on Thursday a man accused of trafficking fentanyl to the United States after a joint investigation with American law enforcement agencies. The case, involving nine defendants in all, was a rare example of cooperation against a surge in fentanyl-related deaths that American officials, including President Trump, have blamed directly on China’s lax enforcement and even complicity in fueling a drug epidemic on American streets. The man sentenced to death, Liu Yong, led an illicit network of labs that produced and shipped packages of fentanyl to American users who were able to place orders online through a dealer simply known as “Diana,” according to the Chinese and American officials. A judge here in Xingtai, a city in Hebei Province about 220 miles south of Beijing, sentenced Mr. Liu to death after detailing a broad conspiracy to manufacture and smuggle fentanyl that evaded China’s strict controls on pharmaceutical production. But Mr. Liu’s death sentence was suspended for two years, leaving open the possibility that it could later be commuted to life in prison. Eight other co-defendants were also sentenced on Thursday, including distributors and online sellers. They received sentences ranging from six months in prison to life. The case started with an arrest by the Drug Enforcement Administration in New Orleans in August 2017, leading to an international investigation into a sprawling underground production network that prosecutors said Mr. Liu orchestrated.  The network included one lab and two distribution centers in Shanghai and the neighboring province, Jiangsu. They were shut down, and 12 kilograms, or about 26 pounds, of fentanyl was seized as part of the investigation, according to the officials and the court’s ruling. “The successful outcome of this case, especially the heavy sentences to the main criminals and others, fully demonstrates the position and determination of the Chinese government to severely punish fentanyl-related crimes,” Yu Haibin, the deputy director of China’s National Narcotics Control Commission, said at a news conference in Xingtai following the court’s sentencing hearing. He was joined by diplomats from the United States Embassy, underscoring China’s eagerness to show it was cooperating with American law enforcement to combat the fentanyl scourge. Many officials in the United States have accused China of abetting the trade. Austin Moore, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official working in the United States Embassy in Beijing, attended the sentencing along with other American diplomats and afterward welcomed the Chinese cooperation in the case, which he said had also resulted in arrests and indictments in New York and Oregon. “I have one more thing to say to those who make it their business to spread illegal narcotics,” he said at the news conference. “We make it our business to find you, arrest you and hold you accountable for your crimes.” Mr. Moore said the United States looked forward to greater collaboration as the Chinese government enforces a decision effective May 1 to classify all variants of fentanyl as controlled substances subject to strict enforcement. That legal change, which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, promised to Mr. Trump last year, closed a loophole in the country’s laws that allowed manufacturers here to make precursors or slight variations of fentanyl that were not explicitly banned in China. As anger rose in the United States over Chinese complicity in the epidemic, the Chinese have complained that they have been unfairly blamed for a problem that stems from pervasive drug abuse and the overprescription of fentanyl and other opioids in the United States. Mr. Yu, sitting beside Mr. Moore in a hotel ballroom, reiterated that view on Thursday. He noted that overdose deaths in the United States had continued to rise even as China intensified its cooperation with American law enforcement agencies and tightened its own export controls. He cited American statistics showing that customs officials had seized 536 kilograms of fentanyl since October 2018, but that only 5.87 kilograms of that came from China. “This data does not support that China is the main source of fentanyl substances in the United States,” he said. The sentencing on Thursday comes as aides to Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump try to finalize an interim deal in the trade war. The cooperation on display could help smooth the way, though Mr. Yu said the timing was in no way related, despite Mr. Trump’s outspoken past criticism of China regarding fentanyl. The case on Thursday was the first fentanyl-related case to conclude, Mr. Yu said. Two other cases are still ongoing. Claire Fu contributed research.

Holocaust Survivor Is Swept Up in Italy’s Storm of Vitriol,2019-11-08,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — In a recent lecture at a Milan university, Liliana Segre, an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor honored as a senator for life, told students that “haters are people we should feel sorry for.” These are sorry days for Italy, then. Ms. Segre, who at 13 was deported to Auschwitz, where Nazis killed much of her family, received a police escort this week after the Milan police determined that anti-Semitic messages and language — much of it online and some of it expressing outrage at her creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate hate and racism — constituted a threat. “She is not afraid,” said Luciano Belli Paci, Ms. Segre’s 61-year-old son, who said his mother declined to comment because she felt exhausted by the immense pressure and sudden political spotlight. “She is shocked by these tensions and by this entire situation.” In recent weeks, a dark cloud of racist and hateful language has hovered over Italy, from its soccer stadiums to its web. Last week, Mario Balotelli, an Italian soccer star who is black and was raised by adoptive Jewish parents in a suburb of Brescia, was targeted by racist chants and monkey sounds from the infamously extremist “ultra” fans of the Hellas Verona team. The right-wing mayor of Verona then defended the fans, whose leader, Luca Castellini, has argued that seemingly anti-Semitic jeers were in fact not, because “Hitler chants are just kidding around.” Over the weekend, a mother watching a soccer game between 10-year-olds called a black child on the opposing team a racial slur. (The Italian word “negri” is still often overheard in casual conversation.)  In a “gesture of solidarity” with the boy, the management of his league said older boys would play their next game “with their faces painted black.” The idea was ultimately ditched, said the club manager, Alessandro Crisafulli, “because we received emails telling us it could be perceived as offensive in some cultures, for instance in America.” In September, activists attending a rally of the antimigrant League party in Pontida shouted at Gad Lerner, a prominent Jewish journalist, telling him, “You’re not Italian, you are Jewish, go home!” Noemi Di Segni, the president of the Union of the Italian Jewish Community, Italy’s largest Jewish organization, said the country was experiencing a “rise in anti-Semitism, which manifests itself in many ways.”  She said an increased tolerance for Mussolini and Fascist nostalgia was troubling and “creating an uncomfortable climate for Jews.” The police protection of Ms. Segre, she said, was not only to protect the senator, “it’s about protecting Italy.” Politicians and Jewish groups have organized rallies in Milan and Rome to show solidarity with Ms. Segre. She has received calls of support, her son said, from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and President Sergio Mattarella.  In 2018, Mr. Mattarella made Ms. Segre, who had never worked in politics, a senator for life, in part because of her years giving students a firsthand account of the Holocaust. She said at the time she felt it her obligation to “pass on the memory.” But around that time Mr. Belli Paci said he and his brother noticed a spike in anti-Semitic insults, some wishing their mother death, on the web. While they did not inform their mother, they reported the messages to the counterterrorism police, he said. That vitriol is not unique to Ms. Segre. While speaking at a conference three weeks ago in Milan, Betti Guetta, an anti-Semitism researcher at the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation, said that her group had noticed that general anti-Semitic offenses, mostly online, had increased in recent years. They had reached the clip of nearly 200 a day, she said, later calling the statistic an estimate. At the conference, she said, she also noted that even Ms. Segre was a frequent target of attacks. The figure of 200 daily attacks was subsequently misinterpreted as referring to aggression specific to Ms. Segre. Then, on Tuesday, Forza Nuova, a neo-Fascist political party, raised a banner against anti-Fascists near a theater where Ms. Segre was scheduled to speak.  On Wednesday, Renato Saccone, the prefect of Milan, dispatched two paramilitary Carabinieri officers to guard Ms. Segre at public events. He declined to comment on why he ordered the security detail. Mr. Belli Paci called the escort “light,” and clarified that while neither his mother nor her family had requested it, “we are more assured knowing that she is protected.” He said that while he doubted that vitriol on the web would actually manifest in violence, he worried that a “general climate of excessive tension” had taken over Italy. He worried that racists now felt liberated in a political atmosphere marked by anti-immigrant and nationalist language. “People who were once forced to feel ashamed of these views now express them with pride,” he said, noting that when people pointed out that remarks are offensive to blacks or Jews, those making them respond that they are simply “joking around.” Matteo Salvini, who leads the League party and has spearheaded a surge of nationalism in Italy, at times echoing Mussolini and posting derogatory videos about migrants on social media, condemned the threats made against Ms. Segre. “Threats on the web, which I receive every day, are very worrying,” Mr. Salvini said. “Threats against Segre, against Salvini, against whomever, they are very worrying.” While Mussolini passed racial laws against the Jews in 1938, Italy has largely avoided a historical reckoning for its persecution of Jews and its role in the Holocaust.  The Nazis, once they occupied much of Italy, deported 7,172 Jews, the vast majority of whom were killed in Auschwitz, according to the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation in Milan. Of the 733 Italian children sent to Auschwitz, only 121 survived. Ms. Segre was one of them. At age 13, she and her father fled Italy to Switzerland, where they were denied refuge in December 1943. They were rejected, Mr. Belli Paci said, and arrested by Italian border guards in Varese, who handed them over to the Nazis.  The Germans moved them to a jail in Milan and Ms. Segre and her father were deported in January 1944 to Auschwitz, the Nazi camp in Poland where she was immediately separated from her father.  He died there weeks later. Her paternal grandparents were arrested in a town near Como and also sent to Auschwitz, where they were killed. Ms. Segre survived Auschwitz. She was moved to Ravensbrück in Germany and survived that, too. She was moved again and finally rescued by the Soviet Red Army. For more than a half-century she remained quiet about her tragedy, but in the 1990s she began speaking up and visiting classrooms, becoming Italy’s living memory of the horrors. Last month, to counteract what increasingly feels like a political time marked by ethnic scapegoating and nationalist invective, Ms. Segre called for the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate hate, racism and social media. But the League Party, led by Mr. Salvini, the post-fascist Brothers of Italy and the center-right Forza Italia led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi all opposed the commission.  They abstained from the vote, seeing it as a political trap by their enemies to make them look extremist and as a first step toward censorship.  Mr. Salvini said that while anti-Semitism was always out of bounds, he worried that such a committee could deem him racist for wanting to curb migrant boat landings or could censure a mayor from his party for saying “he wants to assign housing projects to Italians first.” The motion passed without the conservative votes. Ms. Segre expressed bewilderment at the abstentions, saying they made her feel “like a Martian in the Senate.” She told Italian reporters: “I thought a committee against hatred, as a matter of principle, should be accepted by everyone. I thought it was almost banal.” Mr. Belli Paci said his mother had been taken back by the “barbarization” of the country. Nevertheless, he said, she planned to continue reaching out to students and telling the story of what happened here not so long ago. Anna Momigliano contributed reporting from Rome.

"Gunmen in Burkina Faso Attack Canadian Mining Company Convoy, Killing 37",2019-11-07,By Ian Austen,"['Gunmen in Burkina Faso killed at least 37 people on Wednesday in an attack on a convoy carrying employees, suppliers and contractors of a Canadian mining company, one of the deadliest episodes in a recent tide of violence that has gripped the West African nation. The mining company, Semafo, which is based in Montreal, said that five buses escorted by Burkina Faso’s military were attacked while traveling to the Boungou mine, an open-pit gold mine in the eastern part of the country. They were on their way from the city of Fada-Ngourma, about 25 miles away. Lt. Col. Saïdou T.P. Sanou, the governor of the country’s eastern region, confirmed the death toll in a statement and said that another 60 people had been wounded, but he offered no information about the victims’ identities. Recent violence in Burkina Faso, a nation once known for its relative calm, has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, triggering a sudden humanitarian crisis. Between Aug. 6 and Sept. 30 alone, international organizations estimate, at least 26 military personnel were killed and 25 injured in attacks. Terrorist groups including the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara and Ansaroul Islam are known to be active in the north of Burkina Faso.  But attacks in the east and other parts of the country have, like Wednesday’s attack, gone unclaimed. Some analysts believe those attacks may be motivated by score settling, ethnic tension, monetary gain or personal disputes rather than terrorism driven by ideology or religion. As the attacks have escalated, several military outposts in the northern part of the country have been abandoned by poorly trained and ill paid security forces.  Wednesday’s assault was the third deadly attack in 15 months against Semafo, which also operates a second mine in Burkina Faso. In December 2018, five people traveling to Boungou were killed in nearly the same spot. And in August of last year, Semafo said that a bus headed to the company’s other mine was held up by criminals and that gunfire was exchanged.  After those attacks, Semafo began moving foreign employees by helicopter between Burkina Faso’s cities and its mines. It also said that it had tightened protection for locally hired employees who continued to travel by bus. Semafo said Wednesday that the Boungou mine, which opened in September 2018, had been secured and its operations were not affected.

"Why Spy on Twitter? For Saudi Arabia, It’s the Town Square",2019-11-07,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In Saudi Arabia, where a relatively closed culture leaves citizens few public forums to discuss news and politics, Twitter has become a kind of town square, the place where citizens meet to swap information and debate the latest issues. Saudi Arabia’s absolute monarchy has not banned the site, but it has taken extensive measures to shape the information that appears there and to silence or drown out dissidents who use it to post critical views. The Justice Department’s indictment on Wednesday of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for Saudi Arabia cast rare light on one corner of the vast measures the kingdom has taken to shape what its citizens see when they go online. Saudi Arabia provides no public spaces where citizens can gather to discuss news and politics. And the kingdom’s news media are state-owned or controlled, limiting the range of perspectives they carry.  But many Saudi citizens have multiple cellphones and fast internet, which have led them to use Twitter to engage both with the world and with their fellow citizens. That has given the kingdom one of the world’s largest Twitterspheres.  According to one recent report, Saudi Arabia had 9.9 million active Twitter users, the fourth highest in the world, behind the United States, Britain and Japan. But in terms of the percentage of the population using the platform, Saudi Arabia was first, with 37 percent of residents doing so, compared with 18 percent in the United States. It can seem like everyone in Saudi Arabia is on Twitter: prominent Muslim clerics, well-known journalists, TV stars and even the 83-year-old monarch, King Salman, who has 7.8 million followers.  Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi writer who was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul last year, had 1.6 million followers at the time of his death, allowing him to broadcast his views even after he’d been banned from Saudi news outlets. His direct line to fellow Saudis, which the kingdom was powerless to stop, may well have contributed to his death. The platform’s importance has made it a key battleground for the government, which uses it to tout the kingdom’s policies, and a range of dissidents at home and abroad who use it to spread criticism of government policies and campaign for the release of political detainees. Unlike other authoritarian governments in, say, Iran or China, Saudi Arabia has not blocked access to Twitter, perhaps considering it a useful, and relatively harmless, pressure valve for society. Instead, critics and researchers say, it has invested in a range of techniques to influence what Saudis see when they use the platform. These include hard tactics like arresting or putting on trial prominent Twitter personalities who criticize the government and softer efforts like promoting positive tweets and working to sideline negative ones. “They can’t really block out these websites from the server side, so they have to contest the space,” said Alexei Abrahams, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. “If they pour enough resources in, then maybe social media becomes more useful to the regime than to the opposition. I’m not sure we’ve crossed that threshold yet, but we can’t be that far from it.” To shape the online environment, the Saudi government has marshaled armies of accounts to promote pro-government content and attack critical voices, Mr. Abrahams said. These can be automated accounts, known as bots, or accounts run by people working for the Saudi government who use Twitter in a coordinated fashion, according to an investigation published by The New York Times last year. Acting together, they can promote accounts or hashtags that, say, praise the kingdom’s leadership while diluting the presence of critical conversations. That can end up shaping what average Saudis find when they go online. “You can make it appear that the weight of public opinion lies with the regime,” Mr. Abrahams said. How do Saudi dissidents use Twitter? Saudi dissidents, many of them abroad, use Twitter to broadcast their views to their countrymen inside the kingdom. They include human rights activists who track detentions, and dissidents like Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in Canada and who posts frequent videos of himself commenting on current events and criticizing Saudi policies. The Saudi government has tried to shut down these accounts. Mr. Abdulaziz says that his brothers in Saudi Arabia have been detained to pressure him to be quiet and that the Royal Court sent envoys to Canada to try to persuade him to come home and work for the government. He has refused. The kingdom has also gone after the administrators of anonymous accounts, and it appears that this is why it may have sought to recruit spies inside Twitter. Ali Alzabarah, one of the men indicted this week, was an engineer who had access to users’ personal information. Another, Ahmad Abouammo, could see users’ email addresses and phone numbers, sensitive information that could help the government unmask the people behind anonymous accounts. Both men left Twitter in 2015, and no further efforts by the kingdom to infiltrate social media companies have been uncovered.  The killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who criticized the kingdom’s leadership, drew international attention to Saudi efforts to silence dissidents. It appears that the kingdom is still working in cyberspace to promote its views. “There are still tons of bots out there,” said Mr. Abrahams, the researcher.']",The indictment of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for the Saudis highlights the platform’s power and the kingdom’s efforts to control it.
Iraq Cracks Down on Protests as Prime Minister Gains Support,2019-11-09,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['Iraqi security forces moved Saturday to take ground back from anti-government demonstrators in Baghdad, forcing a confrontation that turned violent and filled the streets with careening vehicles rushing the wounded to first aid stations and hospitals.  The melee, which killed six people on Saturday, followed blanket crackdowns in the southern city of Basra on Friday and in the shrine city of Karbala. As the Iraqi government pushed broadly to constrain the protests, it sought in Baghdad, the capital, to restrict them to a smaller public space.  However, with more than 100 people injured, the mounting casualties could make that tactic backfire, and draw back to the streets those protesters who had begun to go home. “What has been taken by force, we will take back by force,” said Mohammed Juhi, a civil society activist whose organization — I Am Here to Take My Rights — has been on the front line since the demonstrations began in October.  “I do not know why the government and international community have not responded to us,” he added. The demonstrators are demanding a change in the system of government. They would like a presidential system instead of a parliamentary one, no more corruption and the end of political parties as well as the division of ministries among them.  The repressive moves angered the influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. He had been careful until now to calibrate his encouragement of the demonstrators, many of whom are from Sadr City, a vast slum in eastern Baghdad which is a wellspring of support for the Sadr family.  Some of his supporters have been disappointed at the moderate tone of his previous messages. But Mr. al-Sadr has hesitated to confront other Shiite leaders, many of whom support the prime minister and his Shiite-dominated government. However, he is unambivalently opposed to Iraqi security forces’ shooting Iraqi protesters. Five of those killed were hit by live ammunition, The Associated Press reported, while the sixth died after being shot in the head with a tear-gas canister. “Sayid Moqtada Sadr wants people to exercise their right to protest, to say what they want,” said Sheikh Saleh al-Obeidi, his spokesman. “Regarding the massacre that happened today in Baghdad and yesterday in Basra — the killing in cold blood with live bullets — there’s no justification for it.” In Basra, a Sadr stronghold, the security forces also burned the tents of demonstrators near the provincial council building, effectively demolishing the main sign of their presence.  It was not yet clear whether Mr. al-Sadr would call on his supporters to come to Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protests in Baghdad. But his statements appeared to be inching toward that — an outcome that could add considerable manpower and energy to those who have been protesting for weeks.  The backdrop to the security force offensive is a newfound clarity on the part of the Shiite political elite and allied groups regarding support for Prime Minister Adil Mehdi.  Three weeks ago, Mr. Medhi was on the brink of resigning. Every day brought new discussions of what would happen if he left and how his successor might be chosen.  As the protests became entrenched and broadened, the political parties with parliamentary blocs began to look hard at possible candidates to replace him. Both Iran and the United States — two countries that have been heavily involved in Iraq since the 2003 fall of Saddam Hussein — weighed in.  Although the two countries could hardly be more different in their foreign policy in Iraq, they both feared a vacuum and found none of the other candidates terribly appealing.  Earlier this week, at a meeting of most of the political blocs, almost everyone agreed to support Mr. Mehdi for the foreseeable future, said Izzat Shahbendar, an informal adviser to Mr. Mehdi who has been trying to open the way for discussions between the protesters and the government.  “Now Adil Mehdi feels bolstered; he’s encouraged to stay,” Mr. Shahbendar said. “Who would he resign for? It would be chaos if he resigned.” It remains unclear whether Mr. Mehdi is up to the job of charting a course to resolve the demonstrations constructively. The security force pushback on Saturday night appeared designed to shrink the demonstrations, but without offering protesters a reason to retreat, it seemed more likely to strengthen antagonism toward the government.  “From the protesters’ point of view, it is a now-or-never situation,” said Abbas Kadhim, who leads the Atlantic Council’s Iraqi Initiative. “They have invested so much — so much in lives and injuries — and they are afraid if they go home, they will get nothing.”  The government, for its part, wants the country to remain functional. It has already lost millions of dollars because of the protesters’ closing of the port at Um Qasr, which ships much of Iraq’s crude oil.  “The only way for it to end is for the government to be creative and give the demonstrators something they can go home with, and they also need to bring in a third party to be the guarantor of the agreement,” Mr. Kadhim said.  But with every person killed, it gets harder to bridge the gap.  “As much as they try to oppress us, we are just as determined to resist them,” said Mohammed Qassim Mohammed, 25, an engineering student who was protesting near a bridge in Baghdad that the security forces retook on Saturday. One of those killed was a friend his age, he said.  “Is this acceptable to the government or the international community that a 25-year-old man would be killed asking for his rights?”  he asked, adding, “I have decided from today that even if all the protesters return home, I will not return until I get my rights and the rights for my friend.”  Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","With six demonstrators killed, the government’s tough tactic could backfire.

U.K. Police Release Names of 39 People Found Dead in Essex Truck,2019-11-08,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — For weeks, the Vietnamese relatives of a 26-year-old woman who had left home in search of a better life in Europe had feared that she was among the 39 people whose bodies were found in a refrigerated trailer in southeastern England last month.  The woman, Pham Thi Tra My, who hailed from a village in Ha Tinh, had been convinced that she could find a job as a manicurist in England and help her family, which had accumulated $19,000 in debt.  But late one day in October, she had texted her parents, “I’m dying because I can’t breathe,” and apologized because her “path abroad didn’t succeed.”  On Friday, the police in Essex, England, said publicly that their daughter had been positively identified among the bodies found on Oct. 23 in the refrigerated trailer that was transported from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to an industrial park in Grays, Essex. Ms. Pham’s father, Pham Van Thin, said on Friday that his wife had been unable to get out of bed ever since they had learned their daughter’s fate. “I only wish the governments of the two countries will help us to bring my daughter back to Vietnam,” he added. On Thursday, the British authorities said that working with Vietnamese officials, they had identified all the bodies, putting an end to weeks of uncertainty. On Friday, they released the names, ages and home provinces of the eight female and 31 male victims. They ranged in age from 15 to 44, the police said in a statement. Ten of them were teenagers. Three were minors: Nguyen Huy Hung and Dinh Dinh Binh, both 15, and Tran Ngoc Hieu, 17. The grisly discovery had all the signs of a human-smuggling operation turned tragically wrong. The case plunged dozens of family in Vietnam into sorrow and shed a grim light on smugglers that prey on desperate people trying to reach Europe for a better future. An estimated 18,000 Vietnamese people a year set out on the journey. The driver of the truck, Maurice Robinson, 25, of Northern Ireland, was charged on Oct. 26 with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. Several others either were arrested or are wanted by the British police.  But the trail of grief led back to Vietnam, which has arrested eight people in connection with the case. Vietnamese smugglers have called the deadly route taken by those seeking a new life the “CO2” route, a poorly ventilated trip across the English Channel in shipping containers or trailers that marks the final leg of a perilous journey across Asia and Europe. For many in Vietnam, Britain represents a chance at better economic opportunities than other European countries. That prospect has turned the Southeast Asian country into a major source of human-trafficking victims to Britain, experts say, the second-highest after Albania.  Most Vietnamese end up working in cannabis farms, restaurants, nail salons and the catering industry, said Nando Sigona, a professor of migration studies and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham who has studied the path of young Vietnamese to Britain. Mr. Sigona said worsening livelihoods in Vietnam have forced people there to take on higher debts than many others traveling from other Asian countries. “The more risks you’re able to take, the less you will pay,” Mr. Sigona said. “It’s survival migration.” But migrants’ hope that they will earn more money in Britain than in other Western European countries are often illusionary, Mr. Sigona added, leading many to take more unnecessary risks.  “There is this idea that Britain is a better place for migrants than, say, France,” he noted. “Once they’re here, they realize it might not be so true. Yet those back home in Vietnam keep thinking that one more step to Britain will be worth it.” Ten of the truck victims identified this week were from Ha Tinh, one of Vietnam’s poorest provinces, where officials estimate 41,000 people left in the first eight months of this year. But most of those found in the trailer, 20, were from Nghe An, another impoverished province of Vietnam, according to the Essex Police.  Among them was Nguyen Dinh Tu, a 26-year-old father of two who had borrowed $17,000 to build a house for his family, his relatives said. Mr. Nguyen had worked at a food company in Romania, and later at a restaurant in Germany, before embarking on a final journey to England.  “If you want your life in the village to change,” Mr. Nguyen’s brother said in October, “the only way is to go overseas.” Last month, a journalist from The Times met several families that feared their relatives were among the victims. Nguyen Dinh Luong, a 20-year-old farmer whose body was also found in the trailer in Essex, had traveled to Russia and then Ukraine before reaching France in July 2018.  He found work there as a waiter. In October, he went to Belgium, aiming to reach England and to work in a nail salon. His father, Nguyen Dinh Gia, had given DNA samples to the police to help in the identification. Ms. Pham, who texted her parents from the truck, had traveled to China to get a fake passport, and then to France, hoping that Britain would be the final destination. Her parents said they had taken out a mortgage to finance her trip.  But on Oct. 23, Ms. Pham’s parents saw her final text message. That was the day her body was found in an industrial park, almost 6,000 miles away from home. The Essex Police said on Friday that the Vietnamese and British governments were working together to repatriate the victims’ bodies. For weeks, the British authorities had scrambled to identify the victims, first announcing that the bodies found in the trailer were believed to be Chinese and that one minor was among them — instead of the three announced on Friday. Relatives in Vietnam also made anguished calls to people in the Vietnamese community in Britain, asking for help to identify their missing loved ones. The Rev. Simon Thang Duc Nguyen, the parish priest at a Roman Catholic church in East London attended by many migrant parishioners, said eight families had called him and sent details about their relatives’ identities.  “Many started to face the truth,” Father Simon said on Friday, “and now we all have to, even if it’s so hard to bear.” Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith of Essex Police, the senior officer overseeing the investigation, said the police had released the names after informing the families to give them “some time to absorb this tragic news.” Father Simon said he would ask the authorities to allow Vietnamese residents in London to pay tribute to the victims before the bodies were repatriated. “Many of my parishioners escaped from their country this way, and they also bear this mark,” he said of the journey in the back of a truck. “There is real sadness here in London, in Vietnam and everywhere across the world where you have Vietnamese people,” he added. “Now, this is the reality we have to carry with us.” Sui-Lee Wee and Chau Doan contributed reporting from Vietnam, and Anna Schaverien from London.']",Ten of the victims were teenagers. All were from Vietnam. The police in England were working to repatriate the bodies.
Roman Polanski Accused of 1975 Rape,2019-11-09,By Liz Alderman and Elian Peltier,"['PARIS — A French photographer has accused the director Roman Polanski of violently raping her in 1975 in his ski chalet in Switzerland when she was 18, adding to the list of several women who have publicly accused Mr. Polanski of sexually abusing them as teenagers. The director, who is preparing to release a film on Wednesday dealing with themes of injustice, “firmly denied” the latest accusation, his lawyer said. In a letter published online Friday by the French newspaper Le Parisien, the photographer, Valentine Monnier, 62, said she was breaking 44 years of silence after a recent interview by Mr. Polanski. In it, the director suggested that he was a victim of persecution, like the main subject of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish military officer wrongly convicted of treason in what remains France’s most notorious miscarriage of justice. “Is it credible to hear somebody say, ‘I accuse’ when they have branded you and forbidden you, the victim, to accuse him?” Ms. Monnier said in an interview published by the same newspaper.  A lawyer for Mr. Polanski, Hervé Temime, said on Saturday: “For 45 years, these accusations have never been reported to judicial authorities. I strongly deplore their publication a few days before the release of his film.” Ms. Monnier told Le Parisien that she went to Mr. Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, in the winter of 1975 with friends, but had not known him personally. When the group went skiing, she said, he propositioned her in vulgar terms while they were seated together on a ski lift, and she declined. Later that evening, after returning to the chalet from dinner, Mr. Polanski called her upstairs, she said. “Life had not yet trained me to be suspicious,” she told the paper. When Ms. Monnier arrived on the top landing, she continued, Mr. Polanski emerged naked and threw himself on her, striking her, tearing off her clothes and then raping her. “I was totally shocked,” she told the paper. “I weighed 50 kilos. Polanski was small but muscular and at 42 was in the prime of his life. He got the upper hand in two minutes.” She said she remembered fearing she would die. “I said to myself, this is Roman Polanski. He can’t take the risk that this would be known, so he will have to kill me.”  Mr. Polanski later apologized to her in tears, she said. Ms. Monnier said she wanted to speak publicly in order to bring an end to “idolizing the guilty ones.” Mr. Polanski has lived in France since 1978, when he fled the United States before sentencing after pleading guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. Because the statute of limitations for rape is 20 years in France, her accusation cannot lead to an investigation or prosecution. “I denounce this crime knowing that there can’t be any punishment, in an attempt to end exceptions, impunity,” she said in Le Parisien. In an email to The New York Times on Saturday, Ms. Monnier declined to comment further. Le Parisien reported that it had spoken with members of Ms. Monnier’s entourage, including a close friend, family members and her then-boyfriend, who corroborated her story. Mr. Polanski’s new film, known in English as “An Officer and a Spy,” is titled “J’Accuse” in French, after the famous open letter in which the writer Émile Zola accused the French establishment of anti-Semitism and deception over the jailing of Dreyfus. In an interview published in August with a French writer discussing “An Officer and a Spy,” which is scheduled to be released in French theaters in the coming week, Mr. Polanski said: “There are moments of this story that I feel I’ve lived myself.  “Every season there’s a new accusation, a new absurd story from a woman I’ve never seen in my life and who accuses me of things that supposedly happened a half century ago.”  In 2017, a German former actress, Renate Langer, accused Mr. Polanski of raping her in 1972, when she was 15, also in his Gstaad chalet. Swiss prosecutors declined to pursue a rape investigation in that case, citing statute of limitations laws. Mr. Polanski has also been accused of sexual abuse by the British actress Charlotte Lewis, who said in 2010 that the director abused her in 1983, when she was 16; and by a woman publicly identified only as Robin, who in 2017 said that he had “sexually victimized” her in 1973, when she was 16.  Also in 2017, an artist, Marianne Barnard, accused Mr. Polanski of molesting her in 1975, when she was 10. The director said at the time that he rejected the “unfounded allegations.” He remains wanted in the United States over the case involving the 13-year-old, Samantha Geimer, but France does not extradite its citizens. Judges have denied multiple requests from the director to drop the decades-old case. Feminist groups in France have regularly staged protests against Mr. Polanski, including outside a retrospective of his career at the prestigious Cinémathèque in October 2017. Although Ms. Monnier first spoke publicly on Friday, she had long made her story known to those close to her, she told Le Parisien. She said she also written about her accusation to France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, to the culture minister and to the junior minister for gender equality, Marlène Schiappa, in 2018. Ms. Schiappa, in turn, wrote a letter to Ms. Monnier in March of that year, which The New York Times has obtained. In the letter, she praised Ms. Monnier for “breaking a 42-year-old silence,” and said she empathized with her pain, adding, “I understand your indignation.”  Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Elian Peltier from London.']",A French photographer said the director hit her and assaulted her when she was 18. She is the sixth woman to publicly accuse him of sexual abuse.
"President Reagan Returns to Berlin, This Time in Bronze",2019-11-08,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — When Germans mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Saturday, an American who was intertwined with the events of that day  will be looking on, figuratively at least. A towering sculpture of Ronald Reagan, clutching the cards inscribed with his 1987 speech challenging Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to “tear down this wall,” was unveiled on Friday atop the United States Embassy, after the Berlin authorities refused for years to allow his likeness to be placed in the city. The statue of Mr. Reagan, the 40th U.S. President — who died in 2004 — overlooks the Brandenburg Gate he called on Mr. Gorbachev to open.  The unveiling of the statue was attended by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was wrapping up a two-day tour of Germany meant to shore up relations that have frayed under President Trump and to shift public focus from the pressure Mr. Pompeo faces at home over the Ukraine scandal.  At the ceremony unveiling the statue, accessible only to embassy staff and guests, Mr. Pompeo praised Mr. Reagan for his bold defense of freedom, telling a gathering of politicians, diplomats, donors and others that the former president “courageously denounced the greatest threat to that freedom, the Soviet Empire, the Evil Empire.” Mr. Pompeo’s characterization of Reagan’s role in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism varied in important ways from the German version. Just days before the unveiling, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was criticized for failing to mention the United States or any of its presidents by name in an op-ed thanking European countries for their role. “Dear Minister Maas, on behalf of the late President Reagan, whom you don’t mention, and the millions of American Soldiers who served in West Germany along with your other NATO Allies, you’re welcome,” the former commander of the United States Army in Europe, retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, wrote on Twitter. Relations between the United States and Germany have been tense, with Mr. Trump relentlessly pressuring Germany to increase its contribution to NATO. Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel also disagree over immigration policies and over her insistence on pushing ahead with Nord Stream 2, a major gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany that is opposed by many European countries and the United States.  John Heubusch, who heads the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, said they had been trying for 10 years to get a statue of the president erected in the German capital. While other cities across Europe, from London to Budapest to Tblisi, Georgia, were more accommodating, Berlin city officials insisted the 40th President had already been an honorary citizen of the city in 1992, and that was honor enough.  Not so, argued those like Mr. Heubusch, who sought a visible marker to the speech that many credit with at least symbolically creating the first cracks in the Berlin Wall, which East German demonstrators finally pressured their government to open on the night of Nov. 9, 1989.  In 2012, the city allowed a plaque embedded in the sidewalk on the exact location where Mr. Reagan stood when giving the speech, with the East German capital, stretching out behind it. The foundation had largely given up the fight for a statue when Richard Grenell, the Ambassador to Germany, contacted them to say he had named the terrace on the embassy roof overlooking the Brandenburg Gate after Mr. Reagan — and suggested it would make a perfect place for the statue. “If you examine the sculpture closely, you’ll discover that I placed an original piece of The Wall inside the hollow bronze stack of speech cards,” said Chas Fagan, the artist commissioned by the foundation to create the 800-pound bronze statue. “The story of the Berlin Wall is embedded in the sculpture.” The significance of that speech has been fiercely debated since that June afternoon, with some dismissing it as an act of showmanship, while others consider it the first direct challenge to the Soviet leadership to take action.  Some years earlier, concerned that the Soviet Union was falling behind the West, Mr. Gorbachev had declared the twin programs of perestroika and glasnost. These were intended to open up civil society and to restructure the economy to make it more responsive to market signals, but there was a lively debate in the West whether he was sincere. “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!” he said. “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” Appealing directly to East Germans, Mr. Reagan also said, “Es gibt nur ein Berlin,” or “There is only one Berlin” — a remark that would prove equally prescient.  “He was courageous enough to stand there, at that point and remind people that this wall was an eyesore and a symbol of unacceptable division of Europe,” said Jens Schöne, a historian who works at the Foundation for the Study of Communist Dictatorship in East Germany. “He kept that memory alive at a time when people had come to almost accept it.” The president opened the speech by quoting from a Marlene Dietrich song with the line, “Ich hab’ noch einen Koffer in Berlin,’’ or ‘‘I still have a suitcase in Berlin.’’ Now, he has a seven-foot likeness instead.

"For Quebec, a French Woman May Not Be French Enough",2019-11-08,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Is a French woman who grew up speaking the language of Molière not French enough for Quebec? That question was being debated in Canada this week after Émilie Dubois, a 31-year-old French citizen fluent in French, was unable to get a certificate she needs to  settle permanently in Quebec. Her transgression? Writing one chapter of her doctoral thesis in English rather than in French. Ms. Dubois would seem like an ideal immigrant for Quebec, a French-speaking province determined to preserve its French language and identity. She completed a biology doctorate  at Laval University in Quebec City, a French-language university. She also started a scientific graphic design company. But despite being a Francophone from Burgundy in eastern France, she said the immigration minister had written to her that she had not demonstrated sufficient proficiency in French to receive a certificate that is a prerequisite to gaining permanent residency. “It is beyond absurd, it is not logical, it is a joke,” she said in French by phone from Quebec City. “I am a French woman.” Marc-André Gosselin, a spokesman for the Quebec immigration ministry, said the minister was aware of the case, had deemed that it “made no sense” and had asked that the ministry review the file. He said officials had also reached out to her on Friday. But Ms. Dubois was still baffled. “I started my own company,” she said. “I hired people, I am expanding Quebec scientific knowledge internationally. Quebec is shooting itself in the foot. Is a French woman not French enough for Quebec?” The letter from the immigration ministry read: “You haven’t completed your program of study in Quebec entirely in French, including the dissertation or thesis.” Ms. Dubois, who likes painting and hiking, said she was flabbergasted since her doctoral thesis on cellular and molecular biology was written in French, except for one of five chapters written in English because it was a scholarly article published in a scientific journal. Even after she spent $200 to pass a French test recognized by the ministry, she said she was still turned down, leaving her feeling dejected in the province where she had first arrived seven years ago and had hoped to settle. Issues of language run deep in Quebec, a majority French province surrounded by English-speaking North America, where French is the official language of government, commerce and the courts. On commercial advertising and public signs, the French must be at least twice as large as any other language. Such are the concerns about French being threatened by the proliferation of English that the Quebec government two years ago unanimously passed a resolution calling for shopkeepers to stop saying “bonjour hi” — a popular greeting in bilingual Montreal — and to just say “bonjour” instead. More recently, the government attracted criticism after it said Quebecers who wanted access to provincial government services like utility bills in English would need to prove they were part of the “historic English community.” That, in turn, prompted some to ask whether English Quebecers seeking utility bills in the language of Shakespeare would need to prove that their ancestors fought against the French before Quebec was ceded to Britain in 1763 after France’s defeat in the Seven Years’ War.']",A French woman was denied a certificate she needed before she can settle permanently in Quebec on the grounds that she had not demonstrated sufficient proficiency in French.
"Court Backs Hindus on Ayodhya, Handing Modi Victory in His Bid to Remake India",2019-11-09,By Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — India’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hindus on Saturday in a decades-old dispute over a holy site contested by Muslims, handing the prime minister and his followers a major victory in their quest to remake the country as Hindu and shift it further from its secular foundation. The ruling greenlighted construction of a Hindu temple on a site where a mosque had stood before Hindu devotees destroyed it in 1992 with sledgehammers and their bare hands. The demolition of the Babri Mosque in the city of Ayodhya set the tone for sectarian tensions that haunt India today.  The prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party swept India’s elections in May by campaigning on a Hindu nationalist agenda, and the court case became an emotionally charged flash point. The party cast its quest to build a temple as a key step in establishing India as Hindu, wiping away centuries of oppression at the hands of the Muslim Mughal Empire and British colonialists.  Many Hindus believe that the disputed site was the birthplace of their revered god Ram and that an earlier temple was demolished during Mughal rule to build the mosque. The case has been in Indian courts since the 1950s, but when it reached the Supreme Court in 2010, the deity Ram was given legal standing, awkwardly pitting the god Hindus revere most against the country’s Muslim population. Many of India’s Muslims fear that the court’s decision will relegate them to second-class citizenship and empower Hindu extremists. Though many appeared to accept the ruling with sullen resignation, they see an India where mob lynchings of Muslims are seldom condemned by the government and where members of the governing party are implicated in sectarian violence. Mr. Modi tried to calm those fears in an address to the nation on Saturday night. “Today’s message is to unite, to associate and to live together,” Mr. Modi said. “In the new India, fear, animosity and negativity should have no place.”  In its highly anticipated ruling, the five-judge panel unanimously decided that the sliver of barren land in question — barely three acres — would be placed in a government-run trust. The decision allows Hindus to construct a temple, which they have planned since the Babri Mosque was destroyed.  The court also ruled that Muslims would be given five acres to build a mosque at a prominent site in Ayodhya, the town at the center of the dispute, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. When the Babri Mosque was demolished by Hindu extremists, it set off riots across the country that killed around 2,000 people in some of the worst violence India had seen since its bloody partition in 1947. In place of the mosque, Hindus erected a tent resembling a temple, which still stands and draws thousands of tourists every day. The mosque was built in the 1500s during Mughal rule, a period that many right-wing Hindus believe serves as a reminder of their humiliation under Muslim occupation. Although sites like the Taj Mahal — also built under the Mughals — are considered famous symbols of India, right-wing Hindus see them as testaments to past oppression.  Some Hindu nationalists want to erase that history and replace it with symbols that reinforce India as a Hindu nation. About 80 percent of India’s population is Hindu. “Post the independence of our country, we have erased all the symbols of British imperialism,” said Ram Madhav, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. “The names of our roads have been changed, the statues of Queen Elizabeth and all of them have been removed.” India should undergo a similar exorcism of certain symbols of Mughal rule, including the Babri Mosque, Mr. Madhav said, calling the 300-year reign of the Mughal Muslim emperors “cruel.”  “It’s as simple as that,” he said. “This is not about religion. We are not against any religion. India is one of the most religiously diverse places in the world.” When the Supreme Court announced its decision, lawyers outside the court yelled, “Hail Lord Ram” while Hindu devotees blew conch shell horns, a celebratory tradition.  In Ayodhya, just yards from the disputed site, Indian sadhus shouted, “Praise mother India,” while devotees passed out sweets to mark the victory. But not all pockets of Ayodhya were filled with jubilation.  Much of the town’s Muslims kept off the streets and tried to keep their heads down. Some appeared to hope that now that the decades-long court decision had been settled, the sectarian tensions that have become a way of life in Ayodhya would finally ease. Iqbal Ansari, a resident of Ayodhya whose father was a litigant in the case and had demanded the Babri Mosque be restored, said he welcomed the decision and hoped it would end years of sectarian strife. “We should stop seeing each other from the religious prism,” he said. “The court’s verdict is final, and we will not appeal against it.”  Mr. Modi’s government praised the ruling but was quick to call for unity and warned Hindus against boisterous celebrations for fear they would set off clashes. While India under Mr. Modi has adopted a Hindu tilt, the prime minister has also focused on raising India’s profile on the international stage.  Officials in Delhi have been dismayed by the persistent news coverage of India’s sectarian disharmony, including antigovernment protests in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was stripped of its autonomy in August.  In the hours after Saturday’s ruling, India’s Muslims were divided between those who want to contest the decision and those who want to move on for the sake of sectarian harmony. Those who want to contest it have come to see the restoration of the Babri Mosque as a proclamation of Muslims’ place in India, and they fear that more religious sites will be targeted for destruction. After the court announced its verdict, senior government officials were quick to call journalists in and promise — anonymously — that no more mosques would be destroyed and that they, too, wanted to move on and focus on building the nation. Before this year’s election, Mr. Modi promised to deliver ambitious growth, to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. But growth so far has been sluggish, with unemployment reaching a 45-year high.  “There is short-term fear about communal tensions,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s South Asia program. “The soil is pretty fertile for conflict.” “The longer term fear,” he added, “is do Muslims and other minorities of India begin to feel resigned to a permanent status as second-class citizens? The genius of India in the way it was constructed is that it avoided that tension eating away at the state, unlike its neighbors.”  The ruling comes just three months after Mr. Modi’s government achieved another goal written into his party’s manifesto by stripping the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir of its autonomy, increasing central government control over the territory, which Pakistan also claims.  Many in the B.J.P. say they believe that Muslims and other minorities in India, including Christians, have been given a special status that has set them apart from their Hindu peers, creating a nation with a tiered structure that they would like to flatten. Hindu temples, for example, are controlled by the government, while Christians and Muslims control their own churches and mosques.  Ahead of the verdict, schools were shut and 4,000 security officers were deployed to the area in case of sectarian violence. Rallies were banned, shops barred from selling kerosene and people prevented from collecting bricks or stones.  A rush of Hindu pilgrims had visited Ayodhya ahead of the verdict. Sudarshan Jain and his family, pilgrims from Rajasthan, a state hundreds of miles away, visited an open-air workshop where craftsmen chiseled floral designs and figurines of Ram on pink sandstone slabs that will form the temple. Its first floor is ready to be fixed in place, the craftsmen said. Hindus from around the world have donated hundreds of bricks carved with the inscription “Sri Ram,” hoping that the court would rule in favor of building the temple. The bricks have sat in organized piles next to the contested site, numbered and ready to be fixed and shaped into a temple, which devotees say can be constructed within hours once they get the green light.  “These are not stones, but feelings of millions of Hindus,” Mr. Jain said. “Now the dream is going to be a reality.” Sitting in the courtyard of his home in Ayodhya, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a litigant who had wanted the mosque to be rebuilt, said that Muslims would accept a ruling against them but that he feared that right-wing Hindu forces would be emboldened and more mosques would be destroyed. “Violence against Muslims will rise, and it will become institutionalized,” said Mr. Ahmad, 75, who had to flee the town for a month after the mosque was demolished nearly 30 years ago. Maria Abi-Habib reported from New Delhi, and Sameer Yasir from Ayodhya, India. Suhasini Raj and Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.

Ex-President ‘Lula’ Is Freed From Prison in Brazil After Supreme Court Ruling,2019-11-08,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — His fist thrust in the air, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil triumphantly walked out of prison Friday, after the Supreme Court issued a broad ruling that allows defendants to remain free while their appeals are pending. Though Mr. da Silva cannot run for office unless  his criminal convictions are overturned, his mere release could upend Brazil’s politics by pitting him as a fiery, leftist rival to President Jair Bolsonaro, whose far-right policies have left the country deeply polarized. The charismatic Mr. da Silva, 74, universally known as “Lula,” is widely expected to plunge back into the political fray, bolstered by his longstanding popularity: As president, he launched programs that lifted millions out of poverty, expanded access to higher education and promoted racial equality.    On Friday, he walked out of a police building in the southern city of Curitiba shortly after 5:30 p.m., raised a fist  and waded into a crowd of supporters waving his party’s trademark red flag. He kissed babies and pulled supporters into bear hugs before addressing the crowd. His words were interrupted by fireworks as he railed against the police and prosecutors who handled his case. “They tried to criminalize the left,” he said. “They didn’t lock up a man, they tried to kill an idea. But an idea can’t be destroyed.” There was no immediate comment from Mr. Bolsonaro, a brash nationalist who shot to the presidency last year on a wave of anger about corruption and violence. He has repudiated Mr. da Silva’s party at nearly every turn, vowing that socialists will never again take the reins of the country.  Left-wing leaders call Mr. Bolsonaro a dangerous authoritarian who has violently cracked down on criminal suspects, imposed environmental policies that are driving up deforestation and ordered cuts to government spending that have weakened the safety net for Brazil’s poor. Mr. da Silva’s freedom gives the opposition, which has been splintered and largely rudderless in the Bolsonaro era, a towering figure to lead the charge. Mr. da Silva offered a preview of the issues he will champion on Friday, speaking of growing hunger and unemployment under  a president who is privatizing state companies and  trimming pension benefits.  But there was no clear sign of how visible Mr. da Silva intends to be in the months ahead or whether he intends to position himself for a new presidential run, which would require either winning his court battles or changing the law that bars people convicted of crimes from seeking elected office.  Still, Mr. da Silva’s supporters hailed the court decision  as a victory after two years of setbacks, including his conviction in 2017 and his party’s defeat in the election last year. Since Mr. da Silva began serving a 12-year sentence in April of last year, they have campaigned at home and abroad for his release, calling him a political prisoner. “This restores a sense of hope in Brazil,” said Maria do Rosário Nunez, a member of Congress from Mr. da Silva’s Workers’ Party. “Lula’s freedom can offer a rebuttal to the rigid views they are trying to impose in the country,” she added, referring to the current government.  Thursday’s 6-to-5 ruling stands to affect thousands of inmates, including several high-profile people convicted on corruption charges. It is also expected to complicate Brazil’s efforts to root out endemic corruption: Dozens of high-profile politicians have been ensnarled in corruption cases in recent years, as the authorities unraveled complex kickbacks and campaign finance schemes. Prosecutors say that with the Supreme Court’s decision, a reversal of a 2018 decision, they will now lose valuable leverage in corruption cases because the threat of imprisonment has aided law enforcement officials in persuading defendants to cooperate in criminal investigations.  The case that led to Thursday’s ruling was litigated by two political parties and Brazil’s bar association. The plaintiffs argued that Brazil’s 1988 Constitution — which says “no one shall be considered guilty until their case is fully adjudicated” — gives defendants the right to remain free as long as appeals are pending. Until the ruling, criminal defendants could be ordered to start serving a sentence once the first appeals court upheld their convictions. Brazil’s courts have wide discretion to imprison people convicted of violent crimes, but defendants appealing those convictions could, in theory, seek relief under the new ruling.  The Supreme Court last ruled on this legal question in the lead-up to Mr. da Silva’s imprisonment in 2018, following his July 2017 conviction on corruption and money laundering charges for accepting the use of a seaside apartment as part of what prosecutors described as a kickback scheme.  That ruling was the final blow to Mr. da Silva’s bid to run for a third presidential term last year, paving the way for the election of Mr. Bolsonaro. Suspicion that Mr. da Silva’s prosecution had been motivated by politics became widespread after Mr. Bolsonaro appointed Judge Sérgio Moro, who handled Mr. da Silva’s case, as justice minister.  Earlier this year, a trove of cellphone messages exchanged by prosecutors raised fresh questions about the fairness of Mr. da Silva’s prosecution. The messages made clear, for instance, that Mr. Moro had actively advised prosecutors on strategy in the case, conduct that legal analysts have called an ethical and legal transgression.  Mr. Moro said Friday in a statement that he hopes Congress will change the Constitution to allow imprisonment after an appeals court has upheld a conviction.  “At the end of the day, judges interpret the law and lawmakers make laws,” said Mr. Moro, who has disputed that he acted improperly in Mr. da Silva’s case.  Mr. da Silva had been serving a 12-year sentence in the apartment case and faces several other corruption charges. In February, he was convicted in another graft case and sentenced to 13 years in prison. The prosecutors who handled Mr. da Silva’s case,  disappointed by the court’s ruling, said in a statement that  it contradicted “the fight against corruption, which are priorities for the nation.” Thiago de Aragão, an analyst at the Arko Advice political risk consultancy in Brasília, said the ruling would likely make investors think twice about making long-term bets in Brazil because it will inevitably be construed as a setback in the country’s fight against corruption. Supporters of Mr. da Silva,  who governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010, began celebrating the ruling hours before he was freed, at a rally outside the police building in Curitiba. After Judge Danilo Pereira Júnior ordered Mr. da Silva released, his official Twitter account posted two words — “Lula free” — and a video montage of him training in a gym, to the song “Eye of the Tiger.”   The former president faces two main options in his return to politics, said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at Fundação Getulio Vargas University: to unite segments of the opposition by taking a conciliatory, moderate approach to politics or to focus on running for president once more in 2022.  “If he does the latter, the opposition will continue being divided and we’ll continue in a polarized environment, perhaps even more than now,” Mr. Couto said.   Mr. da Silva gave no indication of his thinking as he left from the crowd Friday. He thanked supporters, and said he did not leave incarceration embittered.  “I’m leaving here without hate,” he said, noting his age, 74. “My heart only has room for love.”  Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Letícia Casado from Recife, Brazil.']","Brazil’s top court ruled that defendants may remain free while they exhaust appeals in criminal cases, a decision with far-reaching implications in corruption cases.

Germany Has Been Unified for 30 Years. Its Identity Still Is Not.,2019-11-08,By Katrin Bennhold and Laetitia Vancon,"['East Germans, bio-Germans, passport Germans: In an increasingly diverse country, the legacy of a divided history has left many feeling like strangers in their own land.  By Katrin Bennhold Photographs by Laetitia Vancon BERLIN — Abenaa Adomako remembers the night the Berlin Wall fell. Joyous and curious like so many of her fellow West Germans, she had gone to the city center to greet East Germans who were pouring across the border for a first taste of freedom. “Welcome,” she beamed at a disoriented-looking couple in the crowd, offering them sparkling wine.  But they would not take it. “They spat at me and called me names,” recalled Ms. Adomako, whose family has been in Germany since the 1890s. “They were the foreigners in my country. But to them, as a black woman, I was the foreigner.’’  Three decades later, as Germans mark the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, the question of what makes a German — who belongs and who does not — is as unsettled as ever. The integration of East and West has in many ways been a success. Germany is an economic and political powerhouse, its reunification central to its dominant place in Europe.  But while unification fixed German borders for the first time in the country’s history, it did little to settle the neuralgic issue of German identity. Thirty years later, it seems, it has even exacerbated it.  Ethnic hatred and violence are on the rise. A far-right party thrives in the former East. Ms. Adomako says she is still afraid to go there. But she is not the only one who feels like a stranger in her own land. [Readers in Germany told us how they think about German identity.] Germany’s current effort to integrate more than a million asylum seekers welcomed by Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 is just the most immediate challenge. It is compounded by past failures in a country that opened a regular path to citizenship for the children of immigrants only in 2000. In the decades since the wall fell, Germany’s immigrant population has become the second largest in the world, behind the United States. One in four people now living in Germany has an immigrant background.  But that is not the story Germans have been telling themselves.  Two decades after the country stopped defining citizenship exclusively by ancestral bloodline, the far right and others have started distinguishing between “passport Germans” and “bio-Germans.”   The descendants of Turkish guest workers who arrived after World War II still struggle for acceptance. Jews, most of whom arrived from the former Soviet Union, are wary after a synagogue attack in the eastern city of Halle last month shocked the country that had made ‘‘Never Again’’ a pillar of its postwar identity.  Not least, many East Germans feel like second-class citizens after a reunification that Dr. Hans-Joachim Maaz, a psychoanalyst in the eastern city of Halle, calls a “cultural takeover.” Across the former Iron Curtain, a new eastern identity is taking root, undermining the joyful narrative that dominated the reunification story on past anniversaries.  “It’s an existential moment for the country,” said Yury Kharchenko, a Berlin-based artist who defiantly identifies as a German Jew despite — and because of — the armed guards outside his son’s nursery in Berlin. “Everyone is searching for their identity.”’ Overcoming the past, especially the Nazi ideology that gave rise to the Holocaust, has been a guiding precept of German identity since World War II. In West and East alike, the ambition was to create a different, better Germany.  The West resolved to become a model liberal democracy, atoning for Nazi crimes and subjugating national interests to those of a post-nationalist Europe.  The East defined itself in the tradition of communists who had resisted fascism, giving rise to a state doctrine of remembrance that effectively exculpated it from wartime atrocities. Behind the wall, the East was frozen in time, a largely homogeneous white country where nationalism was allowed to live on.  “Under the lid of antifascism, the old nationalism partly survived,” said Volkhard Knigge, a historian and director of the memorial at the former Buchenwald concentration camp. “The lid came off in 1989.” That is one reason nationalist populism thrives more openly in the former East. The other is that easterners have been rebelling against a western narrative that has disempowered them. Dr. Maaz, like many of his patients, now identifies as East German, something he never did under Communism. The West, he said, had misunderstood 1989. It had overlooked the role national identity played in the East’s peaceful revolution against Soviet rule.  “We marched, we defeated communism, but it all became a victory of the West,” he said.  “We were never given the power to tell our version of the story,” he added. “You can’t even say that you had a happy childhood without breaking a taboo.” That eats away at people, he said.  The bitterness is all the greater as easterners were complicit in their own subjugation, he said. “The western prejudice was: We are better. The eastern prejudice was: We are not as good,” he said. “Now easterners are saying: We are different.” The far-right Alternative for Germany has successfully tapped into that feeling, styling itself as an eastern identity party and fueling resentments — not least toward migrants, who they say threaten German identity.  More than nine in 10 migrants live in the former West. But it is in the former East that antimigrant sentiment is strongest. Dr. Maaz says that has less to do with immigration than mass emigration in the years following 1989.  Some regions lost two generations. “There is demographic anxiety and that has sharpened the sense of a threat to identity,” he said. Ms. Adomako, who grew up in West Germany, recalled the wave of antimigrant attacks in the years after the fall of the wall. She is still afraid to travel in the East, which remains largely white. For the first part of her life, the West, too, had been overwhelmingly white. When she was born in the 1960s, she was the only black child in her West Berlin school.  By the time her daughter, Antonia, 20, finished high school last year, one in four of the students in her class were nonwhite. But four generations after her great-grandfather came to Germany from Cameroon, then a German colony, Antonia still routinely gets asked: “Where are you from?” “When I’m abroad, I feel German,” she said. “But when I’m in Germany, I don’t know.” Ulrich Gerst, 36, a teacher in a multiethnic school who grew up in the wealthy southwest of Germany, tries hard to avoid asking that question.  In 2010, Mr. Gerst wrote a master’s thesis about how schools could help students develop their identity. He says he wants to see a Germany that celebrates hyphenated identities. Still, even he sometimes catches himself assuming women in head scarves are not German.  “These subconscious devices are still prevalent,’’ Mr. Gerst said. For a long time, that discrimination was not merely subconscious, but structural.  Even as Germany became a major immigration country, no real path to citizenship was extended even to the children of immigrants born in the country. After the fall of communism, the intrinsic racism of German citizenship law became impossible to ignore. Russian citizens with German ancestry who spoke no German were suddenly allowed passports, while second-generation Turks born and raised in Germany were not.  The change to the immigration law in 2000 opened parallel tracks to citizenship for those who were born in Germany or who had lived in the country for at least eight years. As a child, Idil Baydar says she felt German. But that has changed. The 44-year-old daughter of a Turkish guest worker who arrived in the 1970s now describes herself as a “passport German foreigner.”  “The Germans have turned me into a migrant,” said Ms. Baydar, a comedian who has grown popular on YouTube by mocking Germany’s uneasy relationship with its largest immigrant group. The final straw came last year when a verdict was reached in a series of 10 murders of mostly Turkish immigrants that had been blamed on other immigrants. In reality, they had been carried out over seven years by an underground neo-Nazi group shielded by Germany’s own intelligence service. For many in Germany, the case became a byword for the failure of the postwar security apparatus to control far-right extremism. For Ms. Baydar, it took away the last shred of confidence that the country of her birth had her back. Recently, she has been planning an “escape route,” possibly to Canada. “My German friends tell me: ‘You’re overreacting,” she said. “I tell them: ‘If I had blue eyes and blond hair, I’d say the same.” “And now they’re chasing foreigners on German streets,” she added, referring to far-right extremists attacking people who looked “foreign” in the eastern city of Chemnitz last year. Chemnitz came to symbolize an emboldened far right. But it was not a singular event. In June this year, a regional politician who had defended Germany’s refugee policy was shot dead on his front porch. Then in October, there was the attack in Halle on the synagogue, which narrowly escaped a massacre, though two were killed.  The Jewish community in Germany, which counts around 200,000 members, is nervous. As a Jew in Germany, said Mr. Kharchenko, the Berlin-based artist, “You’re inevitably asking yourself: Could it happen again?” Understanding that it could is key to preventing it, said Mr. Knigge, the historian at the Buchenwald memorial. “That’s the most important lesson from German history,” he added.  The resurgence of pre-fascist ideology today worries him, he said. People crave a strong national identity, he noted, and the old West German recipe of deliberately tying it to humility — “being proud of not being proud” — has not satisfied that need. It has also proved a difficult template for integrating newcomers. “We need to make the lessons of the Holocaust about human rights and the protection of minorities relevant to all minorities,” Mr. Knigge said. Now, 30 years after the fall of Communism, Germany has another opportunity to try. Ibrahim Kodaimi, a 52-year-old father of five, said he would never forget the smiling faces and hot food that greeted his family three years ago after their long, treacherous journey from Syria.  But his 20-year-old daughter Nahida said she felt excluded for wearing a head scarf. And his 18-year-old son Omar said he had tried to make German friends in school, but had found them unresponsive. He said he spent time mostly with other immigrants during recess. “It was like that,” Mr. Kodaimi interjected. “It’s still like that,” Omar responded. Even so, Omar is determined to make Germany accept him. One of his proudest moments, he said, was when a German, after hearing him speak the language, asked if he had been born in Germany. Adapting a phrase that Ms. Merkel used when the waves of migrants came to Germany, he said, “Ich schaffe das” — “I can do it.’’  John Eligon and Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

Turkey Vows to Send ISIS Militants Home,2019-11-08,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey said Friday that it would begin sending captured Islamic State militants to their home countries in 72 hours, part of an effort aimed at pressuring reluctant European states to take back citizens recruited by the violent extremist group. “Now we are telling you that we are going to send them back to you,” the Turkish interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in announcing that the repatriations would start on Monday. Turkey, he said in comments last weekend, was “not a hotel” for Islamic State detainees from other countries. He did not explain precisely how they would be returned or what would happen if their home countries would not accept them. It was also unclear how Turkey would be able to legally repatriate those whose citizenship has been nullified by their home countries. Turkey has captured several hundred people affiliated with the Islamic State over the last month as its forces seized a pocket of territory in northeastern Syria, forcing Kurdish forces there to abandon several towns and at least one detention camp. Mr. Soylu told reporters that Turkey had captured 287 Islamic State members, including women and children, during the operation. Many of the detainees come from Western Europe. Mr. Soylu has complained that in some cases European states have revoked the citizenship of suspected Islamic State members, making them stateless. Most of the detainees were captured after having escaped from a detention camp at Ain Issa in Syria. They have been placed in a facility at Al-Rai, in Turkish-controlled territory in northern Syria, he said. Turkish-backed Syrian fighters made a swift advance toward Ain Issa at the beginning of Turkey’s operation, which began on Oct. 9. The fighters encountered 190 people, mostly women and children, who had escaped from the camp and taken shelter in nearby homes on Oct. 13. At first the fighters were fearful of such a large group but they were unarmed and cooperated peacefully, one of the militia members involved said. The fighters, members of the Ahrar al-Sharqiya militia, transported the women and children to the border town of Tel Abyad and held them temporarily in houses there, according to the militia member, who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Among the detainees were people from Germany, an Irish woman and a British woman with a child, he said. The British woman had flu and the fighters provided her with medicine, he said. The issue of what to do with captured members of the Islamic State, which once controlled a vast swath of territory straddling Syria and Iraq, has long been one of the festering problems of the Syrian war.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey emphasized the importance of dealing with Islamic State prisoners on his return from a visit to Hungary on Friday. “We are taking back Turkish citizens, their wives and children, who are identified as joining Daesh in Syria,” he told reporters, using the Arabic term for the Islamic State. “We impose a legal process against those with evidence of terror links. We prosecute them. As for the children, we involve all our relevant authorities to rehabilitate them to overcome the trauma they have been through.” Turkey was also holding 1,201 Islamic States militants in jails and detention facilities, he said. They include several hundred Europeans, according to officials. Among them are two Dutch-Moroccan women, who escaped from Al Hol camp in Syria, smuggled themselves with three small children into Turkey and turned up at the Dutch Embassy in Ankara. Dutch officials notified Turkish officials who detained them, according to BBC Turkish, quoting a statement by the Dutch foreign minister, Stefan Blok. Turkey has complained that the Dutch revoked the citizenship of one woman on the day that she was detained. Mr. Soylu said Britain has also revoked the citizenship of Islamic State members held by Turkey. “Saying: ‘I will revoke their citizenship and you handle the rest,’ this is unacceptable for us,” he said. “This is irresponsibility. What shall I do with your terrorist?” Turkish media have listed more than 1,000 Islamic State detainees in Syria, many of them women and children, as coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Britain, Italy and Austria.']",The interior minister declared that Turkey was “not a hotel” for captured Islamic State fighters as it began to pressure reluctant European states to take back their citizens.
Pompeo and Netanyahu Push to Scrap Iran Nuclear Pact,2019-11-07,By David M. Halbfinger and Richard Pérez-Peña,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Thursday that the International Atomic Energy Agency had validated his longstanding allegation that Iran has been maintaining a secret nuclear site in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty — a claim that the agency did not publicly confirm.   Mr. Netanyahu’s assertion came as the Vienna-based agency held a closed-door meeting on Thursday about questions concerning Iran’s “safeguard declarations,”  but did not specify more precisely what had been discussed.  The Israeli leader spoke hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, while visiting Europe, accused Iran of “nuclear extortion” by having accelerated its ability to develop a nuclear weapon in a shortened time frame.  The statements from Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Pompeo, both avowed critics of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, appeared aimed at escalating the pressure on the Europeans to abandon the accord instead of scrambling to salvage it, as they have been doing since President Trump formally withdrew last year and reimposed tough sanctions on Iran. “The IAEA now confirms that Iran lied. And that Iran continues to lie,” Mr. Netanyahu said. ”Europe must stop stalling,” he added. “It must act against Iranian aggression now.” Mr. Netanyahu was referring to a site in Turquzabad, south of Tehran, where, in a speech at the United Nations in September 2018, he charged that Iran had been storing “massive amounts” of nuclear equipment and material. He said then that Israel had shared that information with the  agency’s inspectors.  Providing further details, Israeli intelligence and national security officials contended late Thursday that the atomic agency’s inspections earlier this year, including analysis of samples taken from the site, had shown that Iran stored nuclear material at the Turquzabad site that had been converted from raw uranium but not yet enriched. The Israelis also said the material’s characteristics and age did not correspond with any nuclear facility previously disclosed by Iran. In other words, the Israeli officials said, the inspection pointed to the existence of a secret Iranian nuclear conversion facility, which if confirmed amounted to a fresh violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty’s safeguards agreement. The Israeli officials briefed international journalists on the condition that their names, titles and agencies not be published. Echoing the prime minister, the Israeli officials expressed hope that what they described as the new finding would help persuade the international community — and in particular Germany, France and Britain, along with the broader European Union — to abandon hopes of reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and join with the United States in its “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against Iran. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said Iran was moving toward being able to develop a nuclear weapon in a short time frame,  asserting that Iran’s behavior should inspire “all nations” to increase pressure.  But he made no threat of military action. Nor did the Israelis, though they considered striking Iran’s facilities several times before the 2015 nuclear accord had been reached under the Obama administration.  In response to President Trump’s abandonment of the accord,  the Iranians began edging out of its restrictions earlier this year, saying they would not remain in compliance while the United States was violating its terms by reimposing sanctions.  Iran said this week that it had increased its supply of advanced centrifuges and reactivated a much larger number of old centrifuges that had been idle, accelerating its ability to produce enough nuclear material to make a bomb. The addition of centrifuges is among several steps Iran has taken in recent months to ratchet up pressure on the West in response to President Trump’s decision to exit the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions.  In a statement released by the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said Iran’s actions amounted to “nuclear extortion” and were designed to intimidate the world into accepting its sponsorship of violent insurgencies and terrorism. Mr. Pompeo was in Germany for meetings with government officials.  The moves raise “concerns that Iran is positioning itself to have the option of a rapid nuclear breakout,” Mr. Pompeo said, meaning a rush to develop a nuclear bomb. He added: “The United States will never allow this to happen.” There was no immediate response from the government of Iran, which has denied having any ambition to be a nuclear power. Experts say that Iran has not yet come near the level of uranium enrichment needed for a weapon, but some Western analysts say that if it attempted a “breakout,” Iran could develop a bomb in less than a year. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s closed-door meeting n Thursday to discuss Iran followed a recent move by the Iranian authorities to prevent an agency inspector from entering its main nuclear facility at Natanz. She was briefly detained. After the meeting, an agency spokesman, Fredrik Dahl, said that top officials had discussed “questions related to the completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations,” the commitments that nations make to the agency to ensure that nuclear material intended for peaceful uses is not diverted to weapons. The agency did not announce any actions. Under the nuclear agreement signed in 2015, Iran agreed to limit the size and scope of its uranium enrichment, in return for relief from damaging economic sanctions imposed by the United States.   President Trump withdrew the United States from that pact last year and reimposed sanctions. Administration officials say the measures are intended to pressure Tehran to agree to stricter limits and cut off its support for militia groups around the Middle East. Iran has responded with its own pressure campaign, deliberately going beyond the limits imposed by the 2015 deal as it pushes for relief from the sanctions.  Mr. Pompeo landed in Germany on Wednesday for a two-day trip commemorating 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and, with it, the Iron Curtain that once divided Europe into the communist east and democratic west. As a United States soldier, Mr. Pompeo was posted in 1986 to a base in Bindlach, Bavaria, where he was focused on securing the borders with what was then East Germany and Czechoslovakia. That base closed in the 1990s when the United States drew down its troop strength after German reunification. He met on Thursday with German and American veterans who served at the same time. He also toured a village known as Little Berlin, which once straddled the border.  Later Thursday, he traveled to Leipzig to meet with Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, and tour the St. Nicholas church, where East Germans held mass demonstrations calling for democratic reforms in 1989. American-German relations have been strained under Mr. Trump, who has frequently criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel and her policies on immigration, climate change and Iran. On Friday, Mr. Pompeo is to meet in Berlin with Ms. Merkel and her ministers of defense and finance. David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, and Richard Pérez-Peña from London. Melissa Eddy and Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin, and David E. Sanger from New York.

"After Mormon Family’s Terror in Mexico, a Message Emerges: No One Is Safe",2019-11-08,By Azam Ahmed,"['The killings of six children and their three mothers burst the illusion that only criminals fall victim to Mexico’s gang-fueled violence. By Azam Ahmed LA MORA, Mexico — Andre Miller saw the column of black smoke rising from at least a mile away. Moments later, he said, the boom erupted.  He charged up the road to find a sport utility vehicle engulfed in flames — the same one his sister-in-law, Rhonita Miller, had been driving with her four children on Monday morning. He watched in horror, unable to approach. The heat was too intense. “I couldn’t get any closer than 30 feet,” said Andre, 18. “I couldn’t tell if they were inside the car or not.” [Is Mexico growing more violent? Our journalists answer reader questions.] Past the flames, he spotted three armed men racing away. It was 10:20 a.m.  It was the first harrowing evidence that something had gone horribly wrong for the Mormon community in La Mora, a tiny hamlet of fruit and nut orchards tucked in a curtain of mountains in northern Mexico. For the next 12 hours, the shattered family raced to find their loved ones and piece together a tragedy that has shocked the country and the world at large: the massacre of three mothers and six of their children, including 8-month-old twins, on an isolated road that their families have traveled for decades. One of the women was on her way to start a new life in North Dakota with her husband. Another planned to meet her spouse to celebrate their anniversary. A third was getting ready to attend a wedding. But gunmen, staged along the ridgeline, were lying in wait for the passing vehicles.  In two separate ambushes separated by miles of rugged dirt road, they fired hundreds of rounds of ammunition, from hundreds of yards away, sweeping in from the knuckled hills.  Spent shell casings at the first ambush site showed the path of the assassins as they closed in with assault rifles, firing as they descended the scrub-covered hill to the road. The authorities said the attack appeared to be a devastating case of mistaken identity, launched by a cartel that mistook the family for a rival gang. If the government’s early version is accurate, the killings stemmed from little more than bad luck — driving in a dangerous area in large S.U.V.s generically similar to those used by organized crime.  For all the years that the drug war has ravaged Mexico, a common refrain has often been used to make sense of the unthinkable toll, repeated by government officials, members of law enforcement and many Mexicans themselves: that the violence mostly claims the lives of criminals, of those involved in the ruthless underworld, of those who walk the wrong path. But the killings here in Eastern Sonora obliterated that argument in the most brutal way. Even in a nation as plundered by violence as Mexico, which is suffering its deadliest year in more than two decades, the murder of innocent mothers and children has stripped away any pretense that the mayhem is largely calculated, targeted and therefore contained.  In Mexico and abroad, it has cut through the collective numbness to the violence and given a new face to the homicide crisis — in no small part, relatives say, because they are a prominent family made up of many American citizens. “This case has exploded simply because of who we are,” said Kenneth Miller, Mrs. Miller’s father-in-law. He nodded toward the main road into the community, where soldiers guarded the entrance. “Why should our family have these soldiers around us for protection when other people have nothing?” He rattled off a few recent homicide victims in the area, none of them Mormon, and the widows and orphans they left behind. He felt differently about them now. “The only people that hear their cries is God in heaven,” he said. “I feel it more now, because it hits home.” Funeral services for some of the victims began on Thursday in La Mora, where the families make up an independent Mormon fundamentalist community that is not affiliated with the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Members of the family were still questioning the government’s narrative of the attack.  Officials and investigators have said that the shooting caused Mrs. Miller’s vehicle to blow up, incinerating her and four of her children with a heat so intense that there was little left but charred bone, the vehicle’s gray husk and hardened pools of chrome melted from the blaze. But in the hours after the ambush, family members said they found scattered bits of evidence tossed outside of the S.U.V., like Mrs. Miller’s checkbook, suggesting that the gunmen had rummaged through the vehicle first — perhaps in an effort to see who they had killed — before setting it ablaze. The senseless loss of life poses an existential crisis for Mexico and its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In recent weeks, a wave of disasters has forced the issue into the public eye with relentless consistency: the murder of 14 police officers in a single episode; a separate firefight that left 15 dead; an entire city placed under siege in broad daylight by nearly 400 gunmen from the Sinaloa Cartel — the criminal group once led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo. In that case, the cartel completely overwhelmed the Mexican government’s forces, taking eight of their members hostage and forcing them to let Mr. Guzmán’s son go free. The president has struggled to assuage the divided nation, with some casting their support behind his impulse not to fight “fire with fire,” and others crying out for a stronger, more coherent response. The murder rate has reached its highest point since the nation began collecting homicide data, and families across Mexico have largely writhed anonymously under the weight of loss.  Now, the ambushes have cast a glaring international light on the violence, spurring President Trump to vow to help Mexico “wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth,” while leaving the Mormon community of La Mora in tatters.   “I don’t know if I’ll ever come back here,” said Tyler Johnson, the husband of Christina Langford Johnson, who died in the second ambush, but whose 7-month-old baby, Faith, survived. “Not after everything that’s happened.” Andre raced back home to tell his family what he had seen. At the time, he didn’t know whether Mrs. Miller had made it out of the S.U.V. with her children. Men gathered to rush to the scene. They stopped near the undulating dirt road that leads over rugged mountains into the state of Chihuahua, fearful of what lay ahead. Andre had told his father about the gunmen, and the chance of another ambush couldn’t be ignored. Nearby, members of a local cartel they knew, Los Salazar, began to gather as well. After the murder of two family members in 2009, the Mormon community had learned to coexist with the local cartel members. It purchased fuel from them — an arrangement more forced than agreed upon — and the two sides maintained a largely peaceful, if uncomfortable, arrangement.  The local cartel members had heard the explosion as well. And they knew a possible reason for the attack — their rivals from Chihuahua had crossed into their territory to stake a claim. After waiting for reinforcements, the members of Los Salazar took off down the road, heading toward the site of the ambush. The Mormons followed. As the local cartel raced up the road to confront its enemies, the family stopped at the S.U.V.’s smoldering frame, where the remains of Mrs. Miller and her children were scarcely recognizable. Social media began to light up as family members shared the tragic news on WhatsApp and posted videos to Twitter, pleading for help. Along the road through the mountains, cell reception is spotty at best. Within a few hours, the family was in a panic, worried about the other S.U.V.s in Mrs. Miller’s convoy. They had set out from La Mora shortly after 9 a.m. and hadn’t been heard from since. Relatives called the United States Embassy, the federal police, offices of two state attorneys general and the Mexican military, leveraging any connections they could to mount a rescue.  By late afternoon, Julian LeBarón and his father formed a search party and took off from the community of LeBarón, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive, hoping to intercept the women from the opposite end of the road. It is unclear what time the second ambush — on the two vehicles carrying Christina Langford Johnson, Dawna Langford and their children — occurred. The government says it happened around 11 a.m., perhaps an hour or more after Mrs. Miller was ambushed. By that time, the other mothers and children were about 11 miles ahead of her. The road narrowed as it climbed steeply. To the left, a dense wall of mud rose into the hillside. To the right, a ravine plunged to the floor of a narrow valley before rising into a towering mountain. The location seemed chosen for its vulnerability. An attack could not easily be defended — or escaped. As the women barreled up the road, their vehicles were easy targets. From a few hundred yards away, gunmen unleashed a fusillade on the S.U.V. driven by Dawna, who was traveling with her nine children. Bullet holes riddled the windshield and passenger’s side. A young child was shot across the chest, another in the arm. Another boy was shot in the jaw. Two of her children, Trevor, 11 and Rogan, 3, died in the onslaught. Christina, traveling alone with her infant daughter, was struck down by gunfire. She fell a few feet behind the vehicle, according to images shared by the family. Her baby remained inside, covered by a blanket, unharmed. The account of the events was assembled from a range of sources — visits to the sites of both ambushes, a review of WhatsApp messages and voice memos sent between relatives, and interviews with more than a dozen family members, among them witnesses to the wreckage and, later, the rescue. It is unclear whether the gunmen stopped shooting and allowed the children to escape after they shot Christina — having realized the vehicles were not filled with rivals — or whether they simply missed the children. The gunmen fled soon after, racing off the mountainside, while the children hid in the brush. Led by the eldest son, Devin Langford, 13, they slipped out of the vehicle and dashed into the ravine for cover, hiding beneath the low-hanging trees that clung to its side. Devin told the six others, including his sister McKenzie, that he was going to walk back to La Mora to tell the adults what happened. The journey is tough by road, with large stones and loose, silty earth, troubling the journey for even four-wheel drive vehicles. By foot and off the road, as Devin traveled, it is staggeringly difficult — at least 15 miles of ravines lined with thorny bramble and loose rock. The boy walked the entire way, arriving in La Mora sometime after 5 p.m., according to the family. They formed a search crew and raced to the site where the missing children were hidden. The rescue team from LeBarón eventually arrived at the ambush site shortly after 7 p.m. They found both mothers dead: Dawna in the driver’s seat, slumped over the steering wheel, and Christina by the back of the car, in a T-shirt and jeans. “She was shot with her hands in the air,” Mr. LeBarón said. The group from La Mora soon caught up. Devin, having witnessed his mother and two brothers perish in the gunfire, came along as a guide. When the group arrived, it discovered five of the children alive. But McKenzie Langford, 9, was not there — she had followed her brother to warn the families. The men searched late into the night, tracking her footprints. She was missing a left shoe, leaving a distinctive pattern that alternated between bare foot and running shoe. They eventually found her off the road, alive, in the dark. The men cried with relief. The family members cleared the bodies, pulling them from the vehicles and taking them back to La Mora for burial. Even after the authorities showed up and scoured the ambush sites days later, relatives still found what investigators had missed: spent bullet casings and McKenzie’s lost shoe, which the officials had run over on the drive to the crime scene.  In a large, hangar-sized woodshop, the family built coffins and hosted a group of soldiers and marines sent there for protection. Dawna had lived here for 25 years and loved La Mora: The cypress trees that grew on the edge of brick walls, the yellow leaves of pomegranate trees teasing the skyline, the handsome, custom-built homes. “She was a devoted wife, and devoted mother,” said her brother, Justin Ray. “She was my oldest sister and was like a second mother to me.” Two of the husbands of the deceased sat on couches in one home, wrapped in blankets, their faces swollen and eyes blank. Their children played on the floor with stuffed animals and toys, as the family ate fried eggs, hash browns and toast.  La Mora had been tarnished for the men. Mrs. Miller’s husband, Howard, wanted to bury his wife hours away in LeBarón. So did Christina’s husband, Tyler, wondering if he could stomach La Mora any longer. At her family’s home, four generations of women gathered to mourn. The smell of chicken soup and homemade tamales filled the air. Newcomers arrived to attend the funeral, dragging suitcases behind them. The relatives clung to one another, embracing, holding hands and sitting nearby. One of the girls played piano and the family sang. The family had just held a goodbye party for Christina in the same home. She had decided to leave La Mora to join Tyler, who lived in North Dakota. Though she loved raising their children in La Mora — in the country, surrounded by high-definition views of uninterrupted landscape — they missed living together.  The next day, she headed out toward LeBarón to start the process of moving. The women discussed the fear of the road, and agreed to ride together in a convoy for safety. In general, they figured they were safe — the local cartel knew them. Sometimes, its members would even come off the mountain to help them change flat tires. And besides, they needed to go. They had family business to attend to. Her grandmother, Virginia Sedgwick, who divided time between La Mora and Utah, watched her dash back and forth, brimming with excitement. Three times, she came and hugged Ms. Sedgwick, she recalled, telling her how much she loved her, and how happy she was to be moving to a beautiful new place, to live with her husband, who worked in the oil industry. “And she did go to a beautiful place,” she said. “The sorrow I feel is that I won’t see her again for now.”']",
Evo Morales of Bolivia Accepts Asylum in Mexico,2019-11-11,By Clifford Krauss,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia who resigned under pressure from street protests and the military, was granted asylum in Mexico on Monday, departing from the country at a time when it is deeply polarized and leaderless.  Mr. Morales, who stepped down on Sunday, was granted refuge “for humanitarian reasons and in light of the urgent situation Bolivia is facing,” said Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, in a televised address. Mr. Morales flew out late Monday on a Mexican government plane, according to a statement from the Mexican foreign minister.  Mr. Morales left office after weeks of growing unrest over a disputed presidential election and after the military indicated it would support the people in the streets calling for him to step down. Bolivia now faces a power vacuum because several politicians in the line of succession resigned after Mr. Morales did. Lawmakers in La Paz, the country’s most important city, scrambled to take charge as the streets emptied out, with residents leaving work early and heading indoors, fearing for their safety.  [Update: Bolivian senator Jeanine Añez Chavez has declared herself leader.] Hundreds of supporters of Mr. Morales made their way on late afternoon Monday toward the center of La Paz from the mountains surrounding the city, some of them armed with sticks. As they approached, their chants of “here we go, civil war” could be heard echoing above the city. The police said the armed group had vandalized police offices, causing panic in some neighborhoods where people blocked their doors with old furniture to protect stores and houses.  After receiving requests for help from the national police and civilian politicians, the armed forces announced Monday night they would mobilize to defend gas, water and electricity services around the capital. Army and police units will also begin joint patrols around the city, according to the national police. Mr. Morales, who said he was forced to resign in what he called a “coup,” softened his language by Monday afternoon and urged an end to violence in Twitter messages posted from an undisclosed location. “We can’t have a confrontation between Bolivian brothers,” he said. “I am making an urgent appeal to resolve any differences with dialogue.” Late on Monday night, Mr. Morales posted a message on Twitter acknowledging that he was on his way out of the country, thanking Mexico for giving him asylum and expressing sorrow that he had to abandon the country “for political reasons.” But he added: “I will return soon with more strength and energy.” After the resignations by top government officials in the line of succession, a leading opposition politician said she was ready to take the reins of power until new elections could be held. The politician, Jeanine Añez Chavez, the Senate’s second vice president, appeared on television Monday morning before boarding a plane for La Paz, sobbing as she described the chaos of the night before. “Bolivia doesn’t deserve this, all these deaths and destruction,” she said, before promising a quick transition “that is absolutely necessary to return to a democracy.” But it is unclear if she would get the necessary approval from the national assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Morales’s supporters Mr. Morales appeared to be in hiding in a province where he has traditionally had much support. Late Sunday he said on Twitter that the police were seeking to arrest him “illegally” and that “violent groups” had broken into his house. He was not home at the time. A video circulating on social media showed dozens of people exploring what was reported to be Mr. Morales’s ransacked home, with furniture toppled, items broken and political slogans spray painted on walls in red.  Ms. Añez, a senator from the opposition Democratic Union party, said she would need a quorum in the assembly to approve a transfer of power, and Mr. Morales’s party, the Movement for Socialism, controls both houses. His supporters in the assembly may try to block the appointment of an interim president using procedural rules, leaving a vacuum at the top of the government. Carlos Mesa, a former president who was the losing candidate in the recent presidential election — widely considered fraudulent — said members of the opposition were attempting to appeal to the patriotism of lawmakers who have backed Mr. Morales. “They have no reason to believe they will be persecuted,” Mr. Mesa said at a news conference Monday morning. One of the principal leaders of the demonstrators, Luis Fernando Camacho, in a video distributed over social media, rejected the description that what had happened in Bolivia was a coup, insisting that what took place was peaceful resistance in the streets. He also said constitutional procedure would be followed to bring Bolivia back to normal. “We don’t bring down government,” he said. “We liberated a people.” Voice and text messages asking members of Mr. Morales’s party for comment were not returned.  On Monday morning, much of downtown was blockaded by demonstrators peacefully demanding that the assembly select an interim president. Lawmakers from around Bolivia attempted to return to La Paz to approve the resignation of Mr. Morales and his vice president, and begin the process of selecting a caretaker government. The military attempted to speed up the process by offering helicopter transport to some legislators. Opposition leaders said they were working for a rapid transition. “We need an expeditious resolution,” said Luis Vasquez, a former Social Democratic senator. But the country’s rugged geography made travel difficult, and as the day progressed, tension escalated in La Paz and around Congress. By Monday afternoon, the assembly was cleared of lawmakers and their staff as reports circulated that pro-Morales activists were heading downtown from El Alto, a working-class, largely Indigenous city adjacent to La Paz that had been a bastion of support for Mr. Morales. More than 400 police equipped with tear gas launchers and a water cannon truck stood guard around Congress and surrounding government buildings, which were also empty. A few civilian supporters of the opposition patrolled their own barricades of wire and corrugated metal around the downtown, saying they were guarding against a counter-coup by the Morales forces. Otherwise, the downtown are was empty and quiet. By nightfall the police and army had apparently been able to block the El Alto protesters from reaching the center of the city, though sirens and small explosions rang out across the city. Drinking water was cut off to parts of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia’s second-largest city, but the reason for the cutoff was not known. There was little to no violence in Santa Cruz, a center of the opposition. A festival-like mood prevailed there, with people celebrating on the streets and waving flags.  The political crisis began when Mr. Morales, a leftist who came to power more than a decade ago and was once widely popular, claimed victory in the Oct. 20 election, which protesters and international observers suspected was rigged. In 2016, a court packed with loyalists allowed him to do away with the Constitution’s two-term limit, allowing him to run for office indefinitely.  For weeks after the disputed election results, demonstrations paralyzed much of the country, and groups supporting the president have roughed up protesters. But Friday night, some police units broke from the government and joined the protesters. On Sunday, the rebellion spread to the military, with the commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, calling for Mr. Morales to step down.  While several left-leaning governments across the region, including Venezuela’s, Cuba’s, and Mexico’s, joined Mr. Morales in denouncing the pressure that led to his resignation as a coup, President Trump welcomed the news, saying “Morales’s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard.” Daniel Victor contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']","The former president, who faced weeks of protest, said he had been forced out in a “coup.” He leaves Bolivia in a power vacuum, with politicians scrambling to form a caretaker government.

Bolivian Leader Evo Morales Steps Down,2019-11-10,By Ernesto Londoño,"['President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who came to power more than a decade ago as part of a leftist wave sweeping Latin America, resigned on Sunday after unrelenting protests by an infuriated population that accused him of undermining democracy to extend his rule. Mr. Morales and his vice president, Álvaro García Linera, who also resigned, said in a national address that they were stepping down in an effort to stop the bloodshed that has spread across the country in recent weeks. But they admitted no wrongdoing and instead insisted that they were victims of a coup. “The coup has been consummated,” Mr. García said. Mr. Morales was once widely popular, and stayed in the presidency longer than any other current head of state in Latin America. He was the first Indigenous president in a country that had been led by a tiny elite of European descent for centuries, and he shepherded Bolivia through an era of economic growth and shrinking inequality, winning support from Bolivians who saw him as their first true representative in the capital.  “I want to tell you, brothers and sisters, that the fight does not end here,” Mr. Morales said on Sunday. “The poor, the social movements, will continue in this fight for equality and peace.” “It hurts a lot,” he added. Mr. Morales’s reluctance to give up power — first bending the country’s laws to stand for a fourth election, then insisting that he won despite widespread concerns about fraud — left him besieged by protests, abandoned by allies and unable to count on the police and the armed forces, which sided with the protesters and demanded he resign. As the country slipped into deeper turmoil over the weekend, protesters voiced their fear of Bolivia’s trajectory under Mr. Morales. “This is not Cuba. This is not Venezuela!” they chanted in La Paz, Bolivia’s main city, over the weekend. “This is Bolivia, and Bolivia will be respected.” Carlos Mesa, the former president who came second in last month’s election, celebrated Mr. Morales’s resignation, which he characterized as “the end of tyranny.”  It remained unclear on Sunday night who would take power, as several officials in the line of succession had resigned. Mr. Morales’s resignation statement was expected to be read in Congress Monday.  Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said on Twitter on Sunday night that his country would offer Mr. Morales asylum if he sought it. Late Sunday night, Mr. Morales said in a statement on Twitter that the police were seeking to arrest him “illegally” and that “violent groups” had assaulted his home. Mr. Morales’s departure is a milestone in the spasms of unrest that have roiled Latin America in recent months. Several leaders in the region have been bedeviled by street protests, acts of vandalism and deepening political polarization — dynamics exacerbated by underperforming economies and rising outrage over inequality. As it became clear that the military would turn on him, Mr. Morales flew with Mr. García and a small number of aides from La Paz to Chimoré, in the state of Cochabamba. It was unclear whether Mr. Morales intended to leave Bolivia or stay in that area, which is home to coca leaf growers and has been a stronghold of support.  Mr. Morales’s increasing grip on the country had been worrying critics — and many supporters — for years. In 2016, he had asked voters to do away with the two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution, which was drafted and approved during his first term. Voters narrowly rejected the proposal in a referendum — which, under Bolivian law, was supposed to have been binding. But Mr. Morales found a workaround. The Constitutional Court, which is packed with his loyalists, held that term limits constricted human rights, giving Mr. Morales the right to run for office indefinitely. The beginning of the end for Mr. Morales came on Friday night, when a smattering of small police units made dramatic pronouncements that they were breaking from the government and joining protesters angry over suspicions that the Oct. 20 presidential election had been rigged. Mr. Morales appeared intent on weathering the storm until his generals abandoned him on Sunday. During his presidency, Mr. Morales went to great lengths to make the armed forces an integral part of his political movement, mindful of the country’s long history of coups.  Christoph Harig, a research fellow at University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Germany, who studies the relationship between the military and civilian leaders in Latin America, said Mr. Morales’s ouster did not constitute an “old-school coup in which the military aims to take power itself.”  But he said the sequence of events that led to the president’s resignation was “not the sign of a healthy democracy,” and added to the recent events in Latin America in which military leaders have been dragged into political disputes.  “It once more reinforces the military’s position as final arbiter in political crises,” he said, predicting that it would “further fuel polarization.” Police officers in La Paz were among the first to join the revolt. Initially, many took to the streets with bandannas or surgical masks covering their faces, apparently fearful of being identified. But as their ranks grew, many shed the masks and used bullhorns to address protesters. “Our duty will always be the defense of the people,” a female officer said through tears in a televised address. “The police are with the people!” By Sunday, the rebellion had spread to the military. Shortly before Mr. Morales went on national television to announce his resignation, the commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, said the military chiefs believed he should step down to restore “peace and stability and for the good of our Bolivia.” When Bolivians went to the polls in October, many expressed hope that the president would suffer the first electoral loss since his landslide victory in 2005. Graffiti denouncing Mr. Morales as a “dictator” was ubiquitous in the capital. The opposition felt victorious when initial results showed that Mr. Morales had failed to carve out the 10-percentage-point margin needed for an outright win and would have to face a runoff. That scenario was potentially ruinous for Mr. Morales because other opposition candidates had endorsed the runner-up, Mr. Mesa. Without explaining why, election officials stopped releasing information on the vote count for 24 hours. The evening after the election, they announced a stunning update: Mr. Morales had won outright, with enough votes to avoid a second round. Opposition leaders and international observers cried foul, saying that Mr. Morales’s turn of fortune defied credulity. Angry mobs attacked election buildings around the country, setting some on fire. In subsequent days, large demonstrations and strikes paralyzed much of the country. Mr. Morales defended his electoral triumph as rightful and called on supporters to take to the streets in a show of force. Many have, including bands that have roughed up people protesting the government. Mr. Morales’s standing grew precarious on Sunday after the Organization of American States, which monitored the election, issued a preliminary report that outlined irregularities and said the vote should be annulled. In response, Mr. Morales called for a new election in an extraordinary concession. But it did not appease demonstrators and opposition leaders, who renewed calls for him to step down. The president’s hold on power grew more tenuous as the day wore on. Leading figures in his party resigned, and the military launched operations that appeared intended to protect protesters from armed bands of Morales supporters.  Mr. Morales, a member of the Aymara Indigenous people, rose to prominence as a union leader for coca leaf growers. On his watch, the country’s power structure was transformed. Women today hold nearly half the seats in Congress, and Indigenous people hold more sway than ever. His first term also coincided with a commodities boom that allowed him and other leftist leaders in Latin America to lift millions out of poverty through subsidies and political patronage. One of the poorest nations in the world, Bolivia used proceeds from natural gas exports to turbocharge its economy. His party, the Movement for Socialism, has long been the country’s dominant political force, controlling both houses of Congress. Opponents struggled to compete with Mr. Morales because of his enormous support, but they also faced enormous personal risk. Mr. Morales has unleashed allies in the judiciary against political rivals, many of whom have landed in jail or gone into exile. Raúl L. Madrid, a professor of government and Latin American politics at the University of Texas at Austin who studies Bolivia closely, said Mr. Morales came to feel indispensable. “I think he views himself as the savior of Bolivia, as a representative of the marginalized people of Bolivia, especially Indigenous people,” he said. Mr. Madrid said that if Mr. Morales had stepped down after his second or third term, he would have walked away with a commendable legacy. Yet, he added, the president’s decision to try to remain in power was unsurprising. “From the beginning, he was not interested in grooming a successor that could have threatened him from within,” Mr. Madrid said. “These populist leaders who try to hold on to power at all cost end up undermining their legacy, and people remember them as dictators or would-be dictators.” Leftist leaders in Latin America, including President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, Argentina’s incoming president, Alberto Fernández, and former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil condemned Mr. Morales’s ouster as a coup.  “It’s unfortunate that Latin America has a financial elite that does not know how to abide by democracy and the social inclusion of the poorest people,” Mr. da Silva said.  Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, said he was pleased to see Mr. Morales go. “The word coup is used a lot when the left loses,” he told the newspaper O Globo. “When they win, it’s legitimate. When they lose it’s a coup.”  Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro. Cesar Del Castillo and Mónica Machicao contributed reporting from La Paz, Bolivia, and Anatoly Kurmanaev from Caracas, Venezuela.

French Baguettes From a Vending Machine? ‘What a Tragedy.’,2019-11-10,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['LA CHAPELLE-EN-JUGER, France — The lights inside the village bakery used to come on before dawn, an hour or so before the smell of baking bread would waft into neighbors’ homes. The storefront door would soon be heard, opening and closing, the rhythm as predictable as the life stirring awake across the French countryside. But everything changes. “Without bread, there is no more life,” said Gérard Vigot, standing in his driveway across the street from the now shuttered bakery. “This is a dead village.” Two years ago, the 650 residents of La Chapelle-en-Juger lost their bakery, the last local business where they could meet one another, chitchat and gossip while waiting in line for their daily baguette or their weekend éclairs. For the community, the closing of the bakery was “un drame,” as one newspaper put it, or a tragedy, one that is being repeated in countless French villages. Young people are no longer drawn to the long hours of the traditional bakers who live above their store. Shopping malls have taken root on the periphery of rural areas, drawing in people who are content to buy at supermarkets or chains. Customers, especially the young, are not eating as much bread.  Traveling in rural France these days means spotting closed bakeries, the faded paint on old windows and doors giving an indication of when the lights went out. It means encountering people mentioning with visible relief that their village still has one. Like in La Chapelle-en-Juger, the bakery is very often the one business that clings on after the disappearance of the butcher shop, the grocer or cafe. Given the centrality of bread in France, and its links to its religious practices and political history, the vanishing of traditional bakeries has also come to symbolize the waning of the country’s rich village life — one with the kinds of characters and stories that yielded the material for novels like Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary,’’ set in a fictional village in Normandy, where La Chapelle-en-Juger is. La Chapelle-en-Juger lies in the coastal department of Manche, where American flags can often be seen flying to commemorate the Allied invasion of World War II. Since the start of the decade, about 50 traditional bakeries have closed in Manche, leaving about 370, and 20 more are expected to disappear in the next year, according to the Chamber of Trades and Crafts in the department. “An unprecedented wave of bakery closures,” one local newspaper said with alarm. But a quick scan of the headlines in local newspapers reveals similar “tragedies” in many corners:  A village near Dieppe “desperately looking for a baker.”  “Baker in Preignac seeks a buyer.” In Lozère, a “village rendered destitute without its bakery.” In Loire, “a collection to save the only bakery in Jonzieux.” In Prisches, “the mayor does not want a village without a bakery.” In Lot-et-Garonne, “a bakery in the hot seat.” Or simply: “The village without a baker.” Vending machines have sometimes popped up in towns where bakeries have closed. In Gratot, a red machine sat in a quiet parking lot on a recent morning. A few miles away, on the side of a busy country road in La Vendelée, Vincent Lenoir’s daughter hopped out of their minivan to get a premade baguette from a machine that resembled a telephone booth.  “It’s the best,” Mr. Lenoir said of the bread’s taste. But the vanishing bakeries, he added, are “killing our villages.” Without a bakery, La Chapelle-en-Juger was turning into a lifeless bedroom town, some residents said. “Our little village is dying,” said Hélène Collard, whose family has lived in the village for four generations. “We’re no longer in contact with the other inhabitants. It was the only meeting point left.” The number of bakeries overall is increasing in France, especially in big cities. In Paris, people walking home at the end of the day, munching on a bit of baguette, remains a part of the cityscape.  But traditional mom-and-pop bakeries in rural areas are disappearing quickly — sometimes at a rate of four percent, or even higher, within a single year. Few countries keep such extensive data about bakeries as France does. Half the nation lives within 1.4 miles of a bakery, “as the crow flies,” according to a 2017 government report. In cities, 73 percent of the population lives within less than a half-mile. How long do the French take to reach their bakery? According to the national bakery and confectionary association, the average trip to a bakery takes 7.4 minutes on foot, by car or with another mode of transportation. To be more precise, it’s five minutes in a city or 9.4 minutes in the countryside. In La Chapelle-en-Juger, Mr. Vigot, 71, used to cross the street to the bakery. Now, he drives about two and a half miles to the small town of Marigny-le-Lozon, where he always buys two boules and a sliced loaf. “I always add a little brié,” he said, referring to a traditional Normandy bread, “and on my way back, I eat it like a cake.” Between 30 and 40 residents of La Chapelle-en-Juger now buy their bread at Jeannot and Valérie Culeron’s bakery in Marigny-le-Lozon. Despite the positive effects on his business, Mr. Culeron, 48, who began his career as an apprentice at age 15, worries about the overall trends. “When villages lose their bakery, they cry, ‘What a tragedy!’” Mr. Culeron said. “But they have to be willing to walk the talk.” Many now go to their local bakery only on weekends, he said, while they used to shop every day. Customers were more loyal, he said, in part because bakers played an important role in celebrating major life events. “We were there for baptisms, communions, weddings, and we made their yule logs,” Mr. Culeron said. On Sundays, people were taught that Jesus was the bread of life. At home, they carved the sign of the cross into bread crust before the start of the meal. Children were admonished never to put a loaf on its back because “you don’t earn your bread while lying on your back.” “That’s how I was raised, and how I’ve raised my children,” said Fabien Rose, 46, who lives within a stone’s throw of the old bakery in La Chapelle-en-Juger. “That’s why the bakery has an enormous place in a village — because bread is life.” After everything in La Chapelle-en-Juger, except for the church tower, was razed during World War II, it was rebuilt with two grocery stores, a butcher shop and a bakery. When the couple who had owned the bakery for nearly two decades called it quits in late 2017, Nelly Villedieu, the mayor since 2001, sprang into action.  In the country where bread shortages helped trigger a revolution, Ms. Villedieu was aware of bread’s sensitivities: She herself had never purchased bread outside La Chapelle-en-Juger. “Politically, it wasn’t possible,” she said. A worker was hired, at 30 hours a week, to deliver bread to the village where it was sold between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. The service was discontinued a year later because of the cost and criticism that the hours were inconvenient. The municipality spent 130,000 euros, or about $144,000, to buy the building that had once housed the bakery. Now it is considering loans of as much as €40,000 for the purchase of a used oven and other baking equipment, Ms. Villedieu said, as well as low rent. Without public assistance, a bakery would not be viable in such a small village, the mayor said. But La Chapelle-en-Juger is still studying the feasibility of the project, conscious that many other villages had spent money to resurrect bakeries only to see them rapidly wither away. “It’s a gamble for us,” Ms. Villedieu said. But it was a gamble that she felt she had to take. “In the French spirit, for a long time, we had to provide bread,” Ms. Villedieu said of elected officials. Two months ago, some 80 people gathered in front of the old bakery to call for its reopening. The group’s leader, Nicolas Bourdier, said that the mayor’s office was moving too slowly — a charge that annoyed Ms. Villedieu. Some villagers stayed away from the demonstration for fear of offending the mayor. “Things got a little tense,” said Monique Vigot, who is married to Gérard Vigot. Mr. Bourdier agreed with the mayor on at least one point. “We consider the bakery a municipal service,” he said. “We feel that it’s something that’s owed to us.” Melissa Godin contributed reporting.']","In a country where it is said: “Without bread, there is no more life,” local bakeries are disappearing quickly.

"Behind Hong Kong’s Protesters, an Army of Volunteer Pastors, Doctors and Artists",2019-11-11,By Andrew Jacobs,"['HONG KONG — The pastor pulled on his respirator and ran directly into the fog of tear gas in central Hong Kong. He was trailed by a homemaker, a retired accountant and a middle-school teacher. Undaunted by the pandemonium of gasping protesters, they pointed people to safety and poured saline into the eyes of those overcome by the fumes. With their yellow vests and portable loudspeakers, Pastor Ka-Kit Ao and his volunteers are an unmistakable presence at the antigovernment protests that have upended this semiautonomous Chinese territory. They form human cordons between protesters and advancing police. They beg baton-swinging officers to go easy. And they solicit the names of those being hustled away in handcuffs so pro bono lawyers can follow up with assistance. “I sometimes wonder whether we are doing anything of value, but we can’t just sit at home,” Pastor Ao, 34, said one recent afternoon before heading into the maelstrom with members of his group, Protect the Children. Now entering their sixth month, Hong Kong’s protests have been notable for their longevity, and for the huge throngs willing to defy the authorities with their demands for democracy and police accountability. Thousands of protesters, including office workers, descended Tuesday on Central, the main business and shopping district, forcing businesses to close and paralyzing traffic and the city’s fabled tram service. Behind the scenes, this largely leaderless movement has been sustained by a vast network of ordinary people who hand out bottled water and red bean soup at marches, drive home stranded protesters late at night and donate the gas masks that fortify demonstrators during their pitched battles with police. Hong Kong professionals have been especially vital. Graphic artists create the eye-catching protest posters across the city. Psychologists provide free counseling to the emotionally distressed. And emergency room doctors, working in clandestine clinics, set shattered bones. One measure of community spirit can be heard many nights at 10 p.m., when residents in densely packed neighborhoods open their windows and shout protest slogans to the heavens. Another is expressed through the crowdfunding campaigns that have raised millions of dollars for medical treatment, legal defense funds and other expenses. “Without this public support, the movement would have lost steam a lot sooner,” said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and the author of a book about the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 pro-democracy protests that fizzled after 10 weeks. “It encourages young people to keep going, giving them the sense they are not alone and that what they are doing is righteous.” Although actions like setting the man on fire risk eroding support, the protest movement so far has enjoyed broad backing among Hong Kong’s seven million people. A recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of the protesters’ violent tactics, agreeing that they were justified in the face of an increasingly aggressive police response and a government unwilling to compromise. This public support presents a thorny challenge to the authorities, who have been hoping to quell the protests by driving a wedge between the increasingly radical agitators and those sympathetic to their cause. “The more the government suppresses this movement and tries to scare people, the more people will step out and stand up,” said Pastor Roy Chan, a founder of Protect the Children, which has nearly 200 members. The encrypted messaging app Telegram serves as the town hall for the support network, with dozens of channels that match volunteers to those in need. Most prolific are the channels offering rides to protesters affected by the subway shutdowns that the authorities impose to dampen protest turnout. The rides also help protesters avoid the police sweeps that target public buses. Like many drivers, Patrick Chan, 38, a garment factory manager, said fear of arrest kept him away from the protests, most of which the police have deemed illegal. Guilt and shame, though, are powerful motivators. Mr. Chan spends hours in his beat-up BMW sedan ferrying weary, sweat-drenched protesters to housing complexes across the city. “These young people are trying to right the wrongs that we have long been avoiding,” he said, referring to Beijing’s two-decade effort to chip away at the vaunted liberties that differentiate this former British colony from mainland China. “They are paying with their futures, risking the possibility of being locked up for years. We owe them.” The sense of public service has also mobilized dozens of doctors, nurses and medics. Much of their work takes place in secret. That is because all but the most grievously injured protesters avoid Hong Kong’s hospitals following the arrest in June of several people who had sought care for broken bones and blunt trauma. These days, the injured are sometimes treated at clandestine clinics that provide X-rays and rudimentary surgery. Dr. Tim Wong works the protests after his regular hospital shift. An emergency room doctor, he decided to act after the police made a number of arrests at his hospital, which he declined to name for fear that it might endanger his employment. “Since then, no one has come to our emergency room for treatment, unless they are escorted by the police,” he said. “It’s outrageous. Hospitals should be sanctuaries.” One recent evening, he hovered near the front lines of a skirmish as Molotov cocktails, bricks and tear gas canisters arced overhead. Many of those needing medical treatment were bystanders caught up in the mayhem. Just then, Pastor Ao and another member of his group rushed by carrying a man injured by a tear-gas canister. All three of them were weeping. “I can’t believe this is happening to our city,” the pastor wailed as they dragged the man to a first aid clinic inside a Methodist Church that has become a beacon for protesters. Earlier that afternoon, Pastor Ao and scores of volunteers had gathered at a subway station to plot the day’s movements. After dividing up into teams of seven, he reminded everyone to refrain from chanting slogans and urged them to be polite to law enforcement authorities. “They might call us cockroaches but we should refer to them as police officers,” he said. Then everyone bowed their heads in prayer. “May we have God’s protection and the patience, love and wisdom to deal with the police,” Pastor Ao said. Volunteers say the police rarely return the favor, treating them as antagonists. In September, the police were widely criticized after a video emerged that appeared to show a knot of officers kicking a Protect the Children member as he lay on the ground. The man, wearing the group’s trademark yellow vest, was later arrested. At a news conference, a senior police official dismissed allegations of abuse, suggesting that the video had been doctored and that what many saw as a person was actually “a yellow object.” In the weeks that followed, the group’s ranks swelled with new recruits, Pastor Ao said. Many of the group’s volunteers are retirees like Ah Lin He. A fiery, reed-thin woman, Ms. He, 68, was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and swam to Hong Kong in 1972 to escape the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She doggy-paddled for 10 hours with five other people. Only three of them made it to shore. “I’ve seen the repression and madness that can be unleashed by the Communists in China,” she said as the group trudged to a protest that had turned violent. Walking beside her was Joe Pao, a 29-year-old pastor, who joined the group after a brief stint as a protester. “I realized I could do something more useful than throwing bricks,” Pastor Pao said. He acknowledged that his role as a putative peacemaker was rarely gratifying. Most of his work involves urging the police to exercise restraint. “When they catch people, we tell them to please respect the powers they have and not abuse them,” he said. “The impact is definitely small.” The majority of protest supporters operate more independently. Nam Kwan, a cultural foundation administrator, has fed, housed and comforted scores of youths whose parents, enraged by their participation in the protests, tossed them out of their homes. She traces her transformation from silent sympathizer to frenetic den mother to June 12, when the police escalated their tactics by firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at unarmed protesters. “When I heard the first gunshot, a bell rang inside me and I automatically found my place,” she said. “Nowadays my phone is on 24 hours a day because I’m afraid I might miss urgent messages or calls for help.” In addition to buying protective gear for protesters, she coordinates financial support and car pools from wealthy friends eager to help but reluctant to do so publicly. Oftentimes, she finds herself on the street, dispensing hugs or patiently listening to the worries of young protesters. “Every time these kids go to the front lines, they fear for their lives,” she said. “But what they fear more is abandonment, that one day we will all turn our backs and leave them alone.”']",
Hong Kong Police Shoot Protester Amid Clashes,2019-11-10,"By Elaine Yu, Mike Ives and Edward Wong","['HONG KONG — A Hong Kong police officer shot an antigovernment demonstrator on Monday, an escalation that quickly inflamed tensions in the city already jittery over the recent death of a student involved in the protests.  The officer fired several shots on Monday morning toward two black-clad protesters in a neighborhood where traffic had been snarled by roadblocks. One of the protesters crumpled to the ground after being hit at point-blank range, video footage from the scene shows, and appeared conscious afterward. The shooting on Monday came as pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong blocked roads and scuffled with riot police officers across the city as part of what had been billed as a citywide general strike.  It has been 23 weeks since protests began in the semiautonomous Chinese city over a contentious, but since-withdrawn, extradition bill. The demonstrations have since morphed into calls for greater democracy and police accountability. Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests: The video shows a police officer in a white shirt and neon vest pulling his gun on a group of protesters surrounding him at an intersection in the Sai Wan Ho neighborhood. He fires several live rounds.  “One round hit a man’s body, and he immediately fell to the ground, and there was blood on the ground,” Chan Cheuk-hin, a reporter for Cupid Producer who shot the video, told The New York Times. He said the shooting took place after 7 a.m. as the protesters blocked roads.  The officer then tackles the protester he shot. The protester is seen lying quietly on the ground, surrounded by what appear to be pools of his own blood. Mr. Chan described him as seeming to be “semiconscious.”  The police confirmed the shooting and said that front-line officers followed strict guidelines when discharging their firearms. The man who was shot was in critical condition, the city’s hospital authority said.  Police officers were also out in force in the central business district, as protesters angry over the morning’s shooting snarled traffic on streets near City Hall. Some officers fired tear gas, sending pedestrians fleeing into luxury malls, gasping for air.  Thousands of people gathered, many of them in suits and other office attire, and faced off with the police. “Die, cockroaches,” they yelled at a dozen officers who were walking toward a subway entrance. Nearby, other protesters shouted a popular slogan: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!”  Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood outside a Giorgio Armani store with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police.  “The gun wasn’t necessary, let alone firing shots,” he said, referring to the morning’s shooting. “You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It’s just very ridiculous.”  Later, thousands of protesters and office workers set off on a march around the business district. Antigovernment demonstrators blocked roads in several districts and appeared to force the suspension of some light rail services and delays on subway lines. The protesters had said that the demonstration was aimed at paralyzing public services to express their anger over the death of a student last week from a fall at a parking garage near a protest.  The disruptions on Monday appeared to have less of an impact than a citywide general strike in August that sank the city into chaos. The actions were also timed to coincide with “Singles Day,” an annual shopping event in mainland China that generates billions of dollars in sales. The protesters urged a boycott of online shopping. In an internal memo on Monday, the bank HSBC, said that while it was still operating normally, it encouraged employees to “leave the office early and under safe conditions to your commute.”  There were clashes across the city on Monday, including on some leafy university campuses, where protesters threw Molotov cocktails and riot police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets.  In Ma On Shan, a rural part of northeastern Hong Kong, video footage circulating on Monday showed a man who appeared to be a government supporter being doused with flammable liquid and set on fire after arguing with a group of critics.  “Go back to the Greater Bay Area!” the crowd shouted, using Beijing’s term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The Hospital Authority later said that the man was in critical condition. Farther south, in the Tseung Kwan O neighborhood, police officers in black uniforms and black masks chased activists from an intersection. The officers were carrying weapons marked with neon orange — presumably rifles loaded with sponge grenades.  One officer raised his gun and fired at the back of a protester he was chasing. Onlookers started shouting at the officer. “Don’t open fire! You’re actually firing on people?” they said. Nathan Tam, 53, a businessman who lives in Tseung Kwan O and was driving to Hong Kong Island on Monday morning, said he was commuting despite the disruptions because he had an afternoon meeting he couldn’t afford to miss. Mr. Tam said he was thankful that his son was studying abroad in Britain. “Otherwise, with his personality, he would probably be protesting and getting shot at right now,” he said. Video footage circulating on social media Monday showed a police officer on a motorcycle swerving into a crowd of protesters on an otherwise deserted street, clipping at least one of them.  In the video, which local news outlets said had been recorded on Monday morning in the Kwai Fong district of northern Hong Kong, a crowd of black-clad protesters were seen retreating as the motorcycle wove through them at a slow speed.  On Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered at a park outside the Hong Kong government headquarters in memory of Chow Tsz-lok, 22, who died after falling from a parking garage amid protests last Monday. A constant stream of people left paper cranes and white flowers at a stage where speakers gave emotional addresses. Mr. Chow, a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, suffered head and pelvic injuries when he fell one story. Some protesters have blamed the police for his death, but the circumstances of his fall remain unclear.

Hillary Clinton Raps Boris Johnson Over His Suppression of a Russia Report,2019-11-11,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Russia’s influence in British politics has resurfaced as a potentially explosive issue in the country’s general election, with Hillary Clinton joining a parade of critics in castigating Prime Minister Boris Johnson for withholding a secret parliamentary report on Russia until after Britain goes to the polls. Mr. Johnson’s decision to delay the politically sensitive report until after the Dec. 12 election has not prevented the leak of unsavory details, which, if confirmed, would paint a damning portrait of Russian oligarchs funneling money to Conservative Party politicians. By adding her voice, Mrs. Clinton, whose presidential bid in 2016 was undermined by systematic Russian interference, could thrust the dispute over Russia to the center of the campaign. “Who do they think they are that they would keep information like that from the public, especially before an election?” Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. “Well, I’ll tell you who they think they are. They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling.” Based on the details that have emerged so far, the report could end up being less damaging than Downing Street’s refusal to release it. The veil of secrecy has spawned conspiracy theories, as well as criticism that it deprives British voters of vital information about Russian meddling before another election. “It’s certainly pertinent to an election,” Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general who was chairman of the parliamentary committee that compiled the report, said last week on Sky News. “There has been a lot of disquiet about the possibility of Russian interference, and part of our report looks at that.” It is not clear that Russia is planning to meddle in the Dec. 12 election as it did in 2016 in the United States or the 2016 referendum on Brexit. The short-fuse nature of the vote — Mr. Johnson won Parliament’s approval to hold it only in late October — would make it difficult for Russia to mount a full-scale social-media campaign, election experts said. Still, the lack of evidence of an election operation does not mean Britain is not still vulnerable to Russian interference. Delaying the report, critics say, leaves British voters in the dark about the nature and gravity of the threat. “We don’t know how serious it is,” said Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Institute for Government, a think tank in London. “That’s the value of the report — it would tell us. They should have published it.” In the United States, the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provided a vivid road map of how Russia mounted a sophisticated operation to flood Facebook and other social-media outlets with messages in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, and against Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton, who was in London on a book tour with her daughter, Chelsea, said she planned to keep highlighting the issue.  “Someone said to me, ‘Quit with the Russians,’” she said to The Guardian. “I said, ‘I’ll quit with the Russians when the Russians quit with us.’ That’s how I feel.”  In Britain, the secret report has become fodder on the campaign trail. Mr. Grieve, who was purged from the Conservative Party after clashing over Brexit with Mr. Johnson, said the government had no valid reasons for delaying its release. He said it fit into a pattern of spreading “propaganda and disinformation.” Mr. Johnson’s ministers attributed the delay to the need for normal vetting and other procedures, not to any political motives. They also denied that Russian money was backing the Conservative Party’s campaign, which is built around securing a swift exit from the European Union. “No Russian money is pulling the strings of this election,” the chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, said in an interview with the BBC. “I’m very confident about how we’re funded and we’re very transparent about that.” Still, new questions about the party’s funding sources bubbled up after The Sunday Times reported on Nov. 10 that the parliamentary report named nine wealthy Russians who gave money to the Conservatives. It was not clear, the paper said, whether the Russians were listed in the public section of the report or a classified annex, which is not scheduled to be released at any time. It is illegal in Britain for campaigns to accept money from abroad, but there is no law against taking funds from wealthy Russians who have established residency in the country.  Some links between Russians and Conservative Party figures are well established. In April 2018, Mr. Johnson, who was then Britain’s foreign secretary, was photographed at an airport in Italy after traveling to a weekend party at a converted castle owned by a Russian-British press baron, Evgeny Lebedev. Mr. Johnson traveled without the security detail normally assigned to the foreign secretary, and fellow passengers told The Guardian that Mr. Johnson looked as though “he had slept in his clothes.” He did not comment on the purpose of the trip. Mr. Lebedev, the son of Alexander Lebedev, a one-time KGB intelligence officer, is a majority owner of The Evening Standard and The Independent. Among those who testified before Parliament’s Intelligence and Security committee was William F. Browder, a London-based, American-born financier who fell afoul of the Russian government and has campaigned against its corruption of foreign officials. He painted a picture of Russian influence that goes beyond any single party to permeate the entire British establishment. Mr. Browder cited the case of Peter Goldsmith, a lawyer who served as attorney general in the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Browder said, was retained by the lawyer for a Russian oligarch who was trying to avoid being sanctioned by the European Parliament. President Vladimir V. Putin “has deployed vast resources from criminal proceeds, as well as misappropriation of assets from the regime’s opponents and random victims, to fund and develop a non-Russian, Western ‘buffer network’ which has enabled the Russian state to infiltrate UK society and to conceal the underlying Russian controllers and their agendas,” he said in written testimony, which was first reported by CNN and obtained by The New York Times. In an interview, Mr. Browder said the government’s decision was self-defeating. “From a P.R. strategy, it’s pretty dumb,” he said. “If they release it, they would get a day’s worth of bad headlines. Now, there are these conspiracy theories running around in London.” In 2016, there was evidence that Russia tried to tip the referendum in favor of Britain leaving the European Union. More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging people to vote “leave.” In an echo of the Russian campaign in the United States, many of those messages stoked fears about Muslims and other immigrants. There was already some evidence of troubling activity in this election, said Martin Innes, the director of the crime and security research institute at Cardiff University. But he said it was difficult to determine who was behind it.  “Given the current political situation in the U.K., there is a clear opportunity for a disinformation actor to further their geopolitical interests by destabilizing the European Union or destabilizing NATO,” Mr. Innes said. The political dynamics this time are somewhat different. Mr. Johnson has promised a swift Brexit, which would appeal to Russia, given its desire to weaken the European Union. But Mr. Johnson also favors close ties to the United States. His opponent, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, might delay or even reverse Brexit. But he, too, is a euroskeptic and would be likely to keep Washington at arm’s length. “The unanswered question is whether in the Russian calculation, Britain is worth running an interference operation for,” said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a form that specializes in mapping social media. Given that the referendum has already happened, he said, “you could envisage a scenario where the conclusion is ‘Let them get on with it.’”']",The document on Moscow’s meddling in British politics prepared by Parliament last year is becoming a hot issue as bits and pieces begin to leak out.
Turkey Starts Sending Captured Foreign Fighters Home From Syria,2019-11-11,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey on Monday started making good on its vow to send foreign fighters who were captured in Syria back to their home countries, including one it sent to the United States, the Interior Ministry told the state-run news agency. “One American foreign terrorist fighter whose proceedings are completed has been deported,” a ministry spokesman, Ismail Catakli, was quoted as saying by the agency, Anadolu. Procedures to deport 11 French citizens and seven Germans, along with others from Denmark and Ireland, were underway, Mr. Catakli added, with the German citizens scheduled to be sent back on Thursday. He described the detainees as “foreign terrorist fighters.” Western countries have strongly resisted taking back fighters for the Islamic State, or their wives and children.  It was not immediately clear where the American had been detained but it had been rumored in the first days of Turkey’s incursion against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria that an American fighter had been captured. Turkish officials denied any knowledge of such a capture at the time.  The Turkish Interior Ministry identified the American who was deported on Monday as an Islamic State fighter.  The Turkish news media reported that the American was deported at the land crossing into Greece, but that the Greek immigration authorities refused him entry and sent him back to Turkey.  The Turkish authorities refused to let him re-enter the country and the American was photographed stranded in the buffer zone between the two borders. A State Department spokesperson said only that the United States was “aware of reports of the detainment of a U.S. citizen by Turkish authorities. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.” During the recent military operation in Syria, Turkish-backed militias announced that they had captured people affiliated with the Islamic State — most of them women and children who had escaped from a camp in Ain Issa — and pro-Kurdish fighters. Several Americans and Europeans traveled to Syria to join the Kurdish-led forces that wrested control of northeastern Syria from the Islamic State. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces became allied with the United States to combat the Islamic State, and opposed Turkey’s incursion last month. Turkey regards the Syrian Kurdish militia as a terrorist organization because of its ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for three decades. Turkey also considers the Islamic State a terrorist organization and has detained several hundred members of that organization in Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government said last week that Turkey would start to repatriate Islamic State members and urged Western countries to take responsibility for their citizens. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that 10 people were to be deported to Germany during the course of the week. Among them were women suspected of having fought for the Islamic State and their children, the spokesman, Christofer Burger, told reporters in Berlin on Monday. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']",One of the first repatriated was an American said to be an Islamic State fighter. Western countries have strongly resisted taking back militants who went to fight in the region.
Tunisia’s #MeToo Started Outside a High School. Will It End in Court?,2019-11-09,By Lilia Blaise,"['TUNIS — The imbalance of power seemed unmistakable. On one side, a prominent politician, freshly elected to Parliament. On the other, a 19-year-old student who accused him of sexually harassing her outside her high school. The student’s accusation — initially posted, with photographic evidence, to a private Facebook group — prompted not just shock and disgust, but also an outpouring of support on social media that is quickly becoming Tunisia’s answer to the #MeToo movement. Many of the posts carried the hashtag #EnaZeda, Tunisian dialect for #MeToo. Women of every age and social background started to share their experiences of harassment and abuse, sometimes anonymously, often for the first time, in a private #EnaZeda group that has grown to have more than 17,000 members and through a public Facebook page with more than 70,000 posts and comments.  But whether the #EnaZeda movement will have a long-term impact to match its rapid rise may depend on the fate of the legal case around the student’s accusation, which remains at an early stage, with formidable obstacles ahead. In Nabeul, the coastal city where the student took the photographs on Oct. 10, the public prosecutor opened a public indecency and sexual harassment case without waiting for a formal complaint, citing the prominence of the accused.  The politician, Zouheir Makhlouf, denies doing anything untoward and has not been charged with a crime. And with no charges or hearing date announced, the case may soon run out of time: Once lawmakers take their seats, expected on Nov. 13, Mr. Makhlouf may be able to claim parliamentary immunity. “It is truly a race to get something from the judge before the abuser takes his seat,” said Naima Chabbouh, one of the lawyers for the student, whose name has not been made public, as is common in such cases in Tunisia.  Tunisia’s Constitution gives lawmakers immunity from prosecution only on issues connected to their parliamentary function, Ms. Chabbouh added, “but, depending on the judge, the interpretation of the article can be broadened.”  Malek Ben Jaafar, another of the student’s lawyers, said, “We are pushing for it to be considered as an issue of sexual harassment and not just public indecency because it could set a legal precedent and actually encourage other women to file a complaint.” Tunisia has a proud recent tradition of spontaneous protest leading to real change. The Arab Spring revolts began here in late 2010 after a suicide protest by a fruit seller.  The uprising led to the replacement of the country’s longtime autocrat, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, with a democracy that recently completed its second set of free presidential elections.  Tunisia has also been one of the most progressive countries in the Arab world on women’s rights. Measures such as a law combating violence against women, passed in 2017, provide a safety system for women who want to denounce abuse, harassment and violence based on their gender.  But in 97 percent of sexual harassment cases, either the victim does not file an official complaint or the alleged attacker avoids punishment, according to a 2017 report by the Tunisian Center for Research, Studies, Documentation and Information on Women, which operates under the Ministry of Women and Family Affairs. More recent statistics are not available.  “It is still really difficult to prove there was sexual harassment,” said Fadoua Braham, a lawyer who has handled several harassment cases. “Even if the law punishes it and gives several definitions for it, the most difficult for women is to get the proof and also to stay strong during the judicial process, which is often an ordeal,” she added. “In the cases of sexual harassment in the workplace, for instance, women who speak out are often not supported by their employer, who fears for the reputation of their company,” she said. “Worse than that, women can be targeted by their own abusers for defamation when they had the courage to file a complaint.” The photographic evidence could make such an outcome less likely in this case. As she was walking back to school from her lunch break, the 19-year-old student wrote on Facebook, she noticed that a car appeared to be following her. She took out her cellphone.  As she moved closer, snapping photographs of the license plate, she saw who was inside the car: a local politician, elected to Parliament days earlier, with his trousers down and ointment or cream on one hand. Mr. Makhlouf, who made his reputation as a human rights advocate, maintains there is an innocent explanation: He says he is diabetic and frequently needs to urinate while on the move and that he was applying cream to treat an irritation.  The #EnaZeda hashtag began appearing on Twitter shortly after the student posted the pictures. Later, her supporters created a Facebook page with the same hashtag inviting women to publish their experiences, anonymously if they wished. Aswat Nissa, a women’s rights organization, then created a private Facebook group that receives accounts from women daily. The association is an administrator of the group; it checks the accounts sent in private messages and publishes them publicly, anonymously if requested. “We did not expect so many testimonies to arrive and so many requests to join the group,” said Sonia Ben Miled, the communication manager of Aswat Nissa. “It has been overwhelming but at the same time so rewarding. It shows how much women needed to talk and the fact that it was to support the victim in the first place created a real strength based on solidarity.”  Hajer L, 25, a director’s assistant who did not want her last name published because she feared reprisals in her workplace, was among those who spoke out for the first time on the group.  “Since the scandal, I wanted to share what I lived as well on a daily basis,” she said: “A man in the subway touching him near me or a director making comments about my breasts looking like leeks in front of a crew during shooting, or another assistant taking my hands in his and mimicking a fellation while I hand him work documents.” “It could go on forever,” she added. “#EnaZeda made me feel not alone for the first time. Some of us got used to daily harassment in the street — #EnaZeda showed that this is not O.K., and we should not get used to it at all.” Both the Facebook page and the private group are open to men. The idea is to include anyone who wants to testify about abuse. “The beauty of the movement is its spontaneity and the fact that it belongs to no one,” said Najma Kousri Labidi, one of the founders of the EnaZeda Facebook page. “It is not just about #MeToo but more about women being fed up all over the world with the way their access to a male public space is limited. Women in Egypt spoke up about this issue years ago, for instance.” “We also talked about this before in Tunisia,” she said. “We made awareness campaigns for sexual harassment in public transportation, but #EnaZeda has managed what no feminist association could do by gathering so many testimonies and a national outcry in a short time.” It remains an open question, however, whether the accounts revealed by #EnaZeda will result in legal cases, and how much of a cultural shift the movement can create in what is generally a conservative country. Adel Dhahri, 34, a policy researcher, posted a message of support in the group.  “EnaZeda and similar initiatives will not have a real impact on sexual harassment unless we start targeting men, educating them and changing their behavior,” he said. Aswat Nissa is planning an #EnaZeda demonstration in front of Parliament on Nov. 13, to protest the prospect of Mr. Makhlouf taking his seat without a court judgment.']",Outrage over photographs of a politician appearing to sexually harass a student led hundreds of women to speak out about abuse. But how much change results may depend on a legal case.
"India’s Soundtrack of Hate, With a Pop Sheen",2019-11-10,By Kai Schultz,"['RAIPUR, India — The Indian pop star, swaddled in gold-trimmed tulle, stepped to the front of the stage at a neighborhood concert. Thunder effects crackled through speakers stacked near an electronics store.  “Every house will be saffron!” the singer, Laxmi Dubey, yelled into her microphone, referring to the color representing Hinduism. “We have to make terrorists run from our blessed land!” The crowd cheered when she added a throat-slitting hand gesture.  Ms. Dubey is one of the biggest stars driving the rise of Hindutva pop music in India over the past few years. Hindutva is a word describing a devout Hindu culture and way of life, and the music that bears its name sets traditional Hindu religious stories or Bollywood clips to dance beats — with added lyrics that in some cases openly call for the slaughter of nonbelievers, forced conversions, or attacks on Pakistan. The songs are amassing huge numbers of views on YouTube — Ms. Dubey’s most popular song has more than 50 million on its own — and a growing fan base among the young. It is the music of the times in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s India. Muslims and other minorities fear that some of Mr. Modi’s Hindu-nationalist supporters are damaging the country’s secular foundation and making life dangerous for any who do not display extreme patriotism or Hindu religious fervor. These concerns were only heightened with a court decision Saturday in favor of Hindus over a contested holy site. During Hindu festivals, the processions have started blasting the music in Muslim neighborhoods in shows of intimidation. Most of the songs prominently feature the call of “Jai Shri Ram!” Meaning “Hail Lord Ram,” a major Hindu god, it has become the battle cry for Hindu nationalists. Mobs have attacked Muslims who refuse to chant it along with them.  “Hate bundled with so-called faith has become par for the course today,” said T.M. Krishna, one of India’s most renowned traditional singers. “The masks are off, and what we are seeing should deeply worry us.” Ms. Dubey, a gleeful provocateur, travels India with a 28-person troupe and is in such demand that families invite her to their homes to bless newborn babies. Her goal, she said in an interview with The New York Times, is to recruit foot soldiers to make India a Hindu nation. At least one state government dominated by Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has used public money to stage her performances.  “Hindus used to be too innocent and docile to understand that Muslims are the biggest threat,” Ms. Dubey said. “They needed someone like Laxmi Dubey to wake them up.” Some of the most violent expressions in Hindutva pop focus on Kashmir, the Muslim-majority territory that is disputed by Pakistan and that was stripped of its autonomy by Mr. Modi’s government in August. Popular lyrics call for harsher action against Pakistan and separatist Kashmiri militants, and for forced conversions and a Hindu settlement campaign in Kashmir.  For some of the millions of Indian Muslims, those hyper-patriotic expressions are seen as carrying a personal threat. In one music video, Sanjay Faizabadi, another popular Hindutva pop artist, lunges toward the camera in military fatigues. Footage of Indian troops, exploding planes and a pack of lions punctuates the song, called “Kashmir Is Our Life.” “I will come to Pakistan and play marbles with your eyes!” he sings, boasting in a subsequent verse of waging a campaign of sexual conquest there.  In an interview, Mr. Faizabadi conceded that his lyrics could give the impression that he supported violence. But the singer insisted that he had nothing against Muslims, only those who spread terrorism. “I’m Modi’s devotee, but I’m not anybody’s adversary,” he said. “You can label me Hindutva, but I don’t spite those who are not.” The far right has never been more emboldened in India. Some of the top figures in Mr. Modi’s government have repeatedly referred to immigrants as termites, threatened the citizenship status of hundreds of thousands of Muslims and encouraged vigilante violence against those accused of slaughtering cows, a sacred animal for Hindus. (Most butchers in India are Muslims or from lower castes.) This summer, the police arrested several musicians for recording a song urging Hindus to kill those who do not chant, “Jai Shri Ram!”  Ms. Dubey’s biggest hits feature that chant prominently, and she is outspoken about her intention to incite a revolution through Hindutva pop. In her songs, Ms. Dubey exhorts Hindus to “perform ceremonies with bullets,” “fight proudly against ungodly religions” and “cut off the tongues of enemies who talk against Ram.”  Ms. Dubey, 30, said she did not always feel as strongly about Hindu supremacy. She is originally from the city of Bhopal, in central India, and grew up in a musical family regularly singing songs that urged sectarian harmony, like “Hindu Muslim, Brother Brother,” she said. But she said that as a teenager, she grew increasingly irate at an Anglicized political elite — embodied in the scandal-prone Indian National Congress party of the Gandhis — who had, in her mind, allowed Muslim terrorist groups to attack India. Ms. Dubey drew closer to extremist Hindu circles and began subscribing to a belief that Muslims planned to take over India by marrying and converting Hindu women. To show her devotion, she vowed to remain single and moved away from estranged relatives to the nearby city of Jabalpur, where she persuaded 11 girls living in poverty to make a home with her and become disciples. She spent a few years making music and putting it on YouTube, then found a surging popularity after Mr. Modi rose to power in 2014. Ms. Dubey and several people who work for her said she regularly performs for officials from his Bharatiya Janata Party. “We go wherever B.J.P. leaders invite us to perform,” Ms. Dubey said. “That’s because the B.J.P. is helping to propagate Hindutva.” In the state of Chhattisgarh, where Ms. Dubey often sings, Rahul Singh, a director in the culture department, confirmed that his office had paid for some of her concerts. But he said he did not know much about her. Two state politicians from the B.J.P. said they knew the singer but denied support, though party leaders promoted her music ahead of national elections this year. Her performances draw thousands of people. One show in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, was marketed as a jagrata, an all-night vigil dedicated to deities.   For a couple of hours, she sang about the goddess Durga. Performers dressed as Hindu gods twirled a giant gold trident and lit torches. Much of the audience came for the free, religious-oriented entertainment and did not know Ms. Dubey specifically. But the singer’s tone shifted after midnight, when most of the youngest children had gone to bed. Turning her attention to the beef industry, which employs many Muslims, Ms. Dubey encouraged the crowd to take action to protect cows, echoing comments by Hindu mobs that have killed dozens of minorities accused of slaughtering cattle. “People who I give milk to have become my butcher,” she said, channeling the animal. “Become a cow protector and fulfill your promise.” Ms. Dubey transitioned to one of her most popular songs, “Every House Will Be Saffron,” a YouTube juggernaut that has inspired covers sung by children. During interludes, the singer promised to target those “living in Kashmir, exploding things” and to “spill blood in mother’s holy court.”  The song’s tempo picked up. Clusters of men rose and danced. Ms. Dubey drew her arm back and let go of an imaginary arrow. “People who don saffron will rule!” she screamed. “Only one slogan, only one name: Jai Shri Ram! Jai Shri Ram!”   Surabhi Singh contributed reporting from Raipur, and Suhasini Raj and Kritika Sony from New Delhi.']","Mixing dance tracks with calls for religious warfare, Hindutva pop amplifies a wave of Hindu nationalism in Narendra Modi’s India.

Spain’s Far Right Emerges as a Force by Tapping a New Nationalism,2019-11-11,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — The leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, made his name as an opponent of separatism in his home Basque region. But it is the secessionist conflict in Catalonia that has provided his real opportunity. As the Catalan turmoil confronts Spain with an existential crisis that threatens its territorial integrity, Mr. Abascal, who prides himself on owning a Smith & Wesson handgun, has presented himself as the fiercest defender of Spanish sovereignty.  That appeal has tapped into a new nationalism in Spain. Over the last 11 months, his party has gone from a non-factor to being the country’s third most powerful political force, as Vox doubled its representation to 52 seats in the 350-seat Parliament in elections on Sunday.  The election results have left Spain looking at more uncertainty and deadlock. Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, now faces another round of complicated negotiations to form a government. But the results also left Spain to contend with something it has not had to countenance in a long time, something more familiar to its European Union neighbors: a growing far-right presence. Mr. Abascal, 43, emerged as the only clear winner Sunday. Vox, he said, may now push forward with what he called a “patriotic alternative,” acting as a counterweight to Catalan separatism.  That agenda not only includes strong doses of nationalism, but also the sort of xenophobic messages used by other far-right parties that have advanced elsewhere in Europe. Until now, Spain had remained among the few European countries without a powerful far-right element, even after its two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape in 2015. Since then, no single party has been close to winning a parliamentary majority. The country has faced four elections in four years. That instability, combined with the threat of Catalan secession, has provided the perfect culture for Vox to thrive.  Vox has tapped into nationalist feelings that had been long tainted by the linkage with Franco’s dictatorship, which ended in 1975, but have recently been revived by the challenge to Spanish sovereignty presented by Catalan separatists.  “The longer Spanish politics remain unstable, the more reason it gives for Catalan separatists to continue raising tensions,” said Astrid Barrio, a politics professor at the University of Valencia.  “That is a good environment for Vox,” she added. Vox led the right wing’s condemnations of Mr. Sánchez, blaming him for allowing the Catalan political conflict to spiral into violence on the streets of Barcelona, following the recent prison sentencing by the Supreme Court of former separatist leaders. Vox has benefited from intense media coverage, and Mr. Abascal, who broke ranks from the conservative Popular Party in 2013, made the most of his first television election debate last Monday.  As Mr. Abascal called for a return to direct rule from Madrid over Catalonia, he reminded viewers that he had risked his life fighting for the unity of Spain, as a Basque politician targeted by a terrorist campaign mounted by ETA, the separatist group. During the debate, Mr. Abascal presented Islamic migration as a threat. Mr. Sánchez, his Socialist opponent, produced data to defend his government’s track record against illegal migration, rather than reminding Mr. Abascal that Spain protects religious freedom. Until this year, Mr. Abascal was sometimes ridiculed in the mainstream media for some of his campaign gimmicks, including a video that showed him leading a group on horseback accompanied by triumphant music, in a re-enactment of the medieval battles waged by Spain’s Roman Catholic kings to end the Muslim occupation.  More recently, Mr. Abascal has fired back at the media. Last week, Vox closed its doors to reporters from the media group Prisa after its flagship newspaper, El País, wrote an editorial warning that Mr. Abascal’s xenophobia and other comments in the television debate “should raise all alarm bells without delay.” Yet Mr. Abascal’s focus on migration seemed to pay off for Vox on Sunday.  Vox got seven of its parliamentary seats in Madrid, but also gained significantly in poorer agrarian regions like Andalusia and Murcia that have been the main landing spots for migrants who have reached Spain by boat from northern Africa.  Vox also benefited from the collapse of Ciudadanos, a center-right party whose parliamentary representation fell to 10 from 57 seats and whose leader, Albert Rivera, resigned on Monday. Over the past year, both the conservative Popular Party and the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party struggled to adjust to Mr. Abascal’s challenge, not unlike the way Donald Trump’s rise disconcerted the Republican Party in the United States.  Establishment politicians wavered between distancing themselves from him or competing with Mr. Abascal’s hard-line views, particularly toward Catalan separatism.  Vox’s rapid rise also brings new challenges of self-definition for a party that has presented itself as an anti-establishment force. It has particularly denounced corruption scandals in Mr. Abascal’s former Popular Party.  In the run-up to the election, Mr. Abascal’s campaign became “more populist, far right, with more focus on migration,” Lluís Orriols, a professor of politics at the Carlos III university in Madrid, told La Sexta, a Spanish television channel, on Monday.  “We now need to establish exactly what Vox is,” he said. While other party leaders are now blaming each other for allowing Vox’s rise, some analysts suggested that the two traditional parties of Spain had each helped Vox. The conservative Popular Party could have isolated Vox earlier by denouncing some of its excesses, but instead adopted part of Vox’s rhetoric, according to José Ignacio Torreblanca, who heads the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.  On the other hand, Prime Minister Sánchez’s wavering over Catalonia and his exhumation last month of Franco’s corpse from his underground basilica perhaps benefited more Vox than his own Socialist party “because it reawakened the history of the civil war as a narrative of good versus bad, which is something that feels unacceptable to many people,” Mr. Torreblanca argued. On Monday, Mr. Abascal said that his party would never help Mr. Sánchez stay in office, accusing him of failing to bring order back to Catalonia and “reviving the old hatreds among Spanish people.”  But he offered little clue about whether he would support any other government leader. “Governance is not the responsibility of Vox,” Mr. Abascal told a news conference. “The responsibility is for those who promised during the campaign to unblock the situation.”']","Sunday’s election did little to help end the government deadlock. But it yielded one clear winner, the far-right Vox party, which has thrived amid a conflict over Catalonia. "
Myanmar Genocide Lawsuit Is Filed at United Nations Court,2019-11-11,By Marlise Simons,"['PARIS — An arsenal of international laws has failed to confront the impunity of Myanmar’s government and security forces for their deadly purge of the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee a campaign of rape, arson and killing.  But on Monday, Gambia filed a lawsuit accusing Myanmar of genocide, summoning the case before the United Nations’ highest court in an effort to open a legal path against the country’s authorities. In the suit, filed at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Gambia requested that the court condemn Myanmar for violating the Genocide Convention with its campaign of ethnic cleansing.  [Read: U.N. court orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya muslims.] Gambia, a small West African country with a largely Muslim population, was chosen to file the suit on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is also paying for the team of top international law experts handling the case. The filing amounts to a last-ditch effort to impose an international ruling against Myanmar: Despite a wide outcry over cruelty to the Rohingya, no other court has jurisdiction to pursue a genocide case against the country. Gambia also requested that the International Court of Justice issue an urgent temporary injunction ordering Myanmar to halt all actions that could aggravate or expand the existing situation. That could mean a demand to stop further extrajudicial killings, rape, hate speech, or leveling of the homes where Rohingya once lived in Rakhine State.   “It is clear that Myanmar has no intention of ending these genocidal acts and continues to pursue the destruction of the group within its territory,” the lawsuit said, adding that the government “is deliberately destroying evidence of its wrongdoings to cover up the crimes.’’ The court’s 15 judges rarely deal with genocide. Based in the stately Peace Palace in The Hague, the Court of Justice was set up by the United Nations to rule on disputes between nations. It acts more like a court of appeal, focusing on questions of international law, such as disputes over borders or disagreements over international conventions.  But that can also include disputes arising from the Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of Genocide, established in an earlier case when Bosnia sued Serbia for genocide. The convention covers “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.’’  In its suit, Gambia claims that applies to Myanmar. The novelty in this case, though, is that Gambia is not at war with Myanmar, as Bosnia and Serbia were. But the Genocide Convention treaty does establish a mandate for member nations to act against genocide, wherever they are.  Experts say that if the court accepts the case, whatever the outcome, it will draw renewed attention to the immense suffering of the Rohingya people, most of whom fled to Bangladesh and now live in refugee camps there.  It is not clear how Myanmar, which has always denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide and argues that it was defending itself against an insurgency, will respond to the case.  “Myanmar will ignore this at its peril,’’ said John Packer, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa who has long studied the Rohingya’s plight. If the court hears the case, he said, “there will be a sort of public truth-finding exercise. Myanmar’s simple denials will not stand up to scrutiny.’’ A different body, the International Criminal Court, was specifically created to prosecute genocide and other atrocities. But that court has no jurisdiction over cases in Myanmar because the country has not signed on to the court’s treaty. (Neither have the United States, China, India, Israel and several other countries.)  But the I.C.C. did set itself up to at least partly take up the case against Myanmar last year, when it ruled that it could prosecute for “deportation” and associated crimes against Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh, which is a court member. But judges have not yet approved a criminal investigation by the court’s prosecutor.  Gambia’s lawsuit against Myanmar was born out of a series of meetings of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at which the country’s attorney general, Abubacarr M. Tambadou, assumed a position of leadership because of his special expertise. He had worked more than a decade as a lawyer at the United Nations tribunal dealing with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. In a telephone interview, Mr. Tambadou said he had been very moved by his visit to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.  “The world failed Rwanda when the international community did not prevent the genocide while it was unfolding,’’ he said. “The treatment of the Rohingya is illustrative of the international community’s failure to prevent genocide in Myanmar. I thought this was not right. The world cannot stand by and do nothing.’’ The resulting lawsuit, seen by The New York Times, leans heavily on reports by United Nations fact-finding missions and what it calls other credible sources. Multiple United Nations investigations have underscored what they called a genocidal intent behind the campaign against the Rohingya. It says that all members of the Rohingya group in Myanmar are presently in grave danger of further genocidal acts because of Myanmar’s deliberate and intentional efforts to destroy them as a group. It also stresses that the remaining Rohingya communities and individuals in Myanmar continue to face daily threats of death, torture, rape, starvation and other deliberate actions aimed at their collective destruction, in whole or in part. The lawsuit notes that Rohingya Muslims have been subjected to persecution for decades in Myanmar, which denies that the Rohingya even exist as an established ethnic minority, despite hundreds of years of history in the country.  But pressure increased greatly in late 2016, according to the lawsuit. It cites examples of “attacks in which homes were set ablaze by security forces, in many cases with people trapped inside, and entire villages razed to the ground.”  One investigator documented cases where parents saw their young children being thrown into fires. The suit cites incidents of Myanmar’s “security forces calling families out of their homes, separating men and boys to be executed in front of their families or taken away.” It cites testimony about women and girls being raped and then killed.  The suit says that so-called “clearance operations’’ were genocidal acts, “intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part, by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses.” It said that from August 2017 onward, such “clearance operations’’ intensified. Paul Reichler, the lead lawyer on the Gambia team, said he hoped that the court would issue an injunction against Myanmar as soon as possible. “We are confident that genocide has been committed in this case, and we are very confident in the fairness of the court.’’']","Gambia, on behalf of Rohingya Muslims, opens an international dispute with Myanmar in an effort to have the country’s leadership tried for genocide."
The Hidden Cost of Gold: Birth Defects and Brain Damage,2019-11-09,By Richard C. Paddock,"['CIDAHU, Indonesia — Thousands of children with crippling birth defects. Half a million people poisoned. A toxic chemical found in the food supply. Accusations of a government cover-up and police officers on the take. This is the legacy of Indonesia’s mercury trade, a business intertwined with the lucrative and illegal production of gold. More than a hundred nations have joined a global campaign to reduce the international trade in mercury, an element so toxic there is “no known safe level of exposure,” according to health experts. But that effort has backfired in Indonesia, where illicit backyard manufacturers have sprung up to supply wildcat miners and replace mercury that was previously imported from abroad. Now, Indonesia produces so much black-market mercury that it has become a major global supplier, surreptitiously shipping thousands of tons to other parts of the world. Much of the mercury is destined for use in gold mining in Africa and Asia, passing through hubs such as Dubai and Singapore, according to court records — and the trade has deadly consequences. “It is a public health crisis,” said Yuyun Ismawati, a co-founder of an Indonesian environmental group, Nexus3 Foundation, and a recipient of the 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize. She has called for a worldwide ban on using mercury in gold mining. Mercury can be highly dangerous as it accumulates up the food chain, causing a wide range of disorders, including birth defects, neurological problems and even death. Today, despite the risks, small-scale miners using mercury operate in about 80 countries in Asia, Africa and the Americas. They produce up to 25 percent of all gold sold. As gold makes its way around the world, so too does mercury — poisoning the air and food of people thousands of miles away. Small-scale gold mining is the largest single source of mercury pollution. A recent study of women on 24 remote islands found that more than half displayed high mercury levels. The women lived far from sources of mercury pollution but ate a diet rich in fish. In the United States, contaminated fish is the No. 1 source of mercury poisoning. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, stands out for its huge number of outlaw gold miners and for concerns that some law enforcement officials assigned to police the trade are instead profiting from it. As much as anyone, Cece Rifa’i, a former miner, is responsible for Indonesia’s mercury boom and spreading the scourge of contamination across the country. But he has no regrets. “I don’t feel guilty about anything,” he said from the veranda of his two-story home on the island of Java. For years, Mr. Cece was a pioneer in a network of illegal mercury producers, traders and smugglers who supply gold miners across Indonesia with mercury, used to extract gold from crushed ore. On a single day, operating a furnace he constructed in his backyard, he could produce a ton of black-market mercury worth more than $20,000, he said. For decades, Indonesia got most of its mercury legally from the United States and Europe. But recognizing the harm it was doing, Western countries began reducing mercury exports six years ago. Since 2013, 114 countries, including Indonesia, have signed on to the Minamata Convention, a treaty that took effect in 2017 and that requires participating nations to reduce the export and use of mercury in a variety of industries. Nevertheless, United Nations trade data shows that Indonesia became a significant exporter of mercury from 2015 to 2017, peaking at more than 320 tons in 2016. Ms. Yuyun, the environmentalist, estimates that illicit manufacturers in Indonesia produce more than 10,000 tons of mercury a year. About a third is used in gold mining in Indonesia, she said, the rest smuggled overseas. The government banned the use of mercury in gold mining in 2014, but has done little to curb its use, clean up contaminated sites or warn the public of the danger. In surveys of 24 hot spots, the Nexus3 Foundation and a team of independent doctors found more than 700 cases of suspected mercury poisoning, including children with birth defects and villagers with irreversible neurological disorders. At least 45 have died. Based on these studies, the environmental group estimates that decades of mining have poisoned 500,000 people. The mercury trade is lucrative, but the gold business it supports is far more profitable. By some estimates, Indonesia’s illicit small-scale gold miners produce as much as $5 billion a year. Poverty is widespread in Indonesia, and many people, jobless and desperate, have flocked to the gold fields. As miners, they often live outside the law, digging for ore on land without permission or government permits, sometimes in national parks and protected areas. To extract gold, the miners mix liquid mercury with crushed ore. Gold in the ore binds with the mercury to produce an amalgam of the metals. The miners heat the small lump with a blowtorch, sending mercury vapors into the air and leaving the gold behind. Many miners like the method because it gives them a quick return. But in mining communities, airborne mercury levels can be dangerously high. Wastewater containing mercury finds its way into fields, streams and bays, contaminating rice, fruit and fish, studies show. Government officials have known about mercury-related health problems in the gold fields since at least 2012, Ms. Yuyun said, but they have not warned residents about the dangers of consuming potentially contaminated rice and fish. Last year, Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry conducted tests in seven mining communities and identified 558 adults and children with high mercury levels, many with severe exposure. The sampling also found high levels in rice. But the ministry has yet to notify subjects of their test results or issue a public warning for fear of setting off panic over the safety of the food supply. “It’s a crime to deliberately conceal the damning results,” said Ms. Yuyun, the lead researcher on small-scale mining at the International Pollutants Elimination Network. “People are dying and have little access to any effective treatment. The government has to stop the mercury trade and clean up the mess.” Environment Ministry officials declined to be interviewed and did not respond to written questions. Officials in the office of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, acknowledged that mercury contamination is a serious problem and said he had issued a national action plan that calls for cleaning up four hot spots. The president also has directed police and military commanders to take action against personnel found to be involved in the illegal metals trade. Officials said they were unaware of anyone being disciplined. Spokesmen for the national police and the military declined to be interviewed. Officials say the public has been warned about mercury’s dangers, but there is little evidence of this in mining areas. Many miners insist it is not hazardous. The role of corrupt officials in the gold and mercury trade is widely recognized but seldom addressed by the government. Some members of the police and military are said to finance gold mining operations, extort protection money, oversee their own mines and ensure the safe transit of mercury and gold. Many tons of mercury seized by the police have gone missing. “When we went to the field and talked to the people there, they admitted that the police gave them the mercury,” said Putu Selly Andayani, head of the West Nusa Tenggara Province Trade Agency. “They said the police helped them to set up the illegal mining.” Throughout the country, miners work with mercury in plain sight without fear of punishment. The occasional arrests of furnace workers and smugglers have barely dented the supply. Mercury remains cheap and plentiful in the gold fields, where it is sold in mining supply shops or by dealers who travel from village to village. Dozens of Indonesian websites offer mercury for sale. One international smuggler arrested last year was Chander Hass Khera, an Indian citizen. Seized documents show that he shipped 9.7 tons of mercury to South Africa, Thailand and India in 2017. Last year, he bought an additional 3.8 tons from a dozen traders, said Dyah Paramita, a researcher at the Center for Regulation Policy and Governance in West Java, who reviewed court records. Soon after the smuggler’s arrest, most of his confiscated mercury disappeared from police custody. The police told the court they were investigating. Mr. Khera was sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to ship mercury produced without proper permits. Like methamphetamine labs in rural America, mercury distillation often takes place in remote areas, far from prying eyes. Mr. Cece, 64, the prolific backyard mercury producer, began mining gold as a young man. In 2010, as wildcat mining boomed, he said he started searching for cinnabar, the ore from which liquid mercury is produced. Inspired by his years vaporizing mercury by blowtorch, he constructed a simple concrete furnace with a narrow trench in the center for a wood fire, steel buckets to heat the reddish ore and fixtures to capture the mercury as it cooled and liquefied. His home in Sukabumi Regency in western Java is an unlikely spot for this backyard industry. A picturesque area of rice paddies and simple villages, there is no cinnabar ore or nearby highway. There is not even a road to Mr. Cece’s house in Cidahu village. But on his patio, Mr. Cece built a furnace so large it could produce a ton of mercury in 24 hours. He arranged to have cinnabar shipped from distant islands, often using express courier services. He hired local men — “robbers, thieves and hit men,” he called them — to work the furnace. Local police officers and health officials visited frequently, sometimes taking water samples. On each visit, he said, he gave them “pocket money.” The inspectors found no health problems. On one occasion, he said, he demonstrated his furnace to a high-ranking police official from Jakarta. Soon dozens of copycat furnaces began appearing in Sukabumi and on islands closer to the cinnabar mines, helping flood the black market with cheap mercury. “We all know that he is the pioneer,” said, Alung, 35, who learned the business working for Mr. Cece. Like many Indonesians, he uses one name. The police cracked down on mercury producers in Sukabumi in 2017, shutting down three dozen furnaces and arresting about 100 people, including Mr. Cece. He and nearly all the others avoided jail by agreeing to stop making mercury. Mr. Cece dismantled his furnace. The police seized nearly a ton of mercury from three furnaces in the village. Mr. Cece and Mr. Alung suspect the police sold it because they brought their own containers to haul it away. Before the crackdown, mercury production meant jobs. Whatever the health hazard, the work paid better than anything else, and they were disappointed when the furnaces were shut down. “We know it’s dangerous,” Mr. Alung said. “But we’re sad. We no longer have the income.”']",
Spain’s Far Right Gains in Election,2019-11-11,By Raphael Minder,"['A Spanish far-right party doubled its standing in a national election Sunday that made clear just how polarized Spanish politics has become and did little to help end the government’s long deadlock. The results were a setback for Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, who had hoped the election might strengthen his hand as he tries to form a new government. The election — the fourth in four years — came after months of fruitless coalition talks between Mr. Sánchez’s party and a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos. Though Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists came out on top again, they won only 120 of the 350 seats in Parliament — three fewer seats than in April, when the last election was held. The biggest gains Sunday were made by the ultranationalist and anti-migration Vox party. It is now Spain’s third-largest party after doubling its seats to 52 from 24, according to preliminary results, with more than 99 percent of the votes counted. With the rise of a powerful far-right party, Spain now mirrors other countries in Europe.  “We used to talk about Spain being the European exception, but that is now clearly gone,” said Astrid Barrio, a professor of politics at the University of Valencia. Spanish politics, she said, long defined by a left-right and two-party split, was now “very clearly shaped by the ideology of nationalism, with Vox as the clearest answer to the Catalans.” Sunday’s election confirmed the impact of the Catalan secessionist conflict on national politics, particularly after tensions recently spilled over into violence on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities.  Speaking in Madrid after the polls closed, a triumphant Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, thanked more than three million voters for choosing the “patriotic alternative” offered by his party. And he told supporters that Vox would “not take a step back” in pushing for a program that includes stripping the regions of Spain of their administrative autonomy.  “We have managed to open up all the prohibited debates,” he said.  Earlier this month, Mr. Abascal used his first election television debate to demand the banning of separatist parties as “criminal organizations.” He called for another period of direct rule over Catalonia by Madrid, tougher than the one imposed in late 2017 after separatist leaders made a failed attempt to declare independence. Mr. Abascal also peppered his remarks with xenophobic comments about migrants and Islam. His party has called for building walls around two Spanish enclaves in Africa, to stop migrants from entering illegally.  Mr. Sánchez could still form a new government if he manages to get the support of not only Unidas Podemos but also other smaller parties, including Basque and Catalan ones. Help might come from the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party. It has long been opposed to Mr. Sánchez, but its disastrous showing on Sunday, when its representation fell to 10 seats from 57, might lead to a change in party leadership. Addressing his supporters from the balcony of his party headquarters just before midnight, Mr. Sánchez celebrated his party’s victory, however diminished, and promised to form a new government. He called on his rivals to show “generosity and responsibility” to help end the deadlock, but offered no indication of exactly how he might win them over in a new round of negotiations. Other parties did not seem well disposed to the prime minister. Pablo Iglesias, leader of Unidas Podemos, accused him of “leaving us with one of the strongest far-right parties in Europe.” And Íñigo Errejón, leader of another small left-wing party, said the rise of Vox was “the symptom of a democratic attrition and the result of a historic responsibility” — Mr. Sánchez’s decision to risk another election rather than forming a left-wing coalition. In April, when Mr. Sánchez mobilized left-wing voters to stop Vox’s rise, he was greeted with a near-record turnout of 76 percent. On Sunday, the turnout fell to 70 percent, reflecting frustration among voters about their party leaders’ inability to form a government, let alone resolve the lengthy conflict in Catalonia. The main opposition, the conservative Popular Party, won 87 seats, up from 66 in April, which was its worst-ever result. Its leader, Pablo Casado poured cold water on Mr. Sánchez’s chances of forming a new government. “Why did he want to convene another election if it was meant to create more stability, when now he has it much harder to form a government?” Mr. Casado asked. “Spain cannot remain in a blockade much longer.” Last month’s prison sentencing of former separatist leaders set off an outburst of street violence in Catalonia that raised concerns over whether the long-simmering conflict was spinning out of control. That led right-wing parties to put pressure on Mr. Sánchez to use the executive’s emergency powers to restore law and order in Catalonia. Catalan society remains split down the middle by secessionism, with three separatist parties winning on Sunday a combined 23 of the 48 Catalan seats in the Spanish Parliament. Four years ago, Spain’s two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape, and since then no single party has come close to winning a parliamentary majority. Spain spent most of 2016 in political limbo, after two elections failed to break the deadlock, and has found itself facing a similar scenario this year. The repeat election on Sunday, and its result, confirmed “the irresponsibility and short-term strategies of the party leaders,” said Ms. Barrio, the politics professor.']","As the Vox party doubled its seats, a longstanding government deadlock appeared no closer to an end."
Bolivian Leader Clings to Power as Police Join Protesters,2019-11-09,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Ernesto Londoño and Mónica Machicao","['The Bolivian president’s grip on power grew shakier on Saturday as police units in major cities flipped their allegiance and joined anti-government demonstrations, key allies resigned and protesters forced the state broadcaster to halt news programming.  The developments were the most serious threat yet to President Evo Morales’s attempts to hold on to power after last month’s disputed elections. “A coup is underway,” Mr. Morales declared in a televised address on Saturday from his traditional stronghold in the city of El Alto, outside La Paz. Looking tired and deflated, he called on supporters to take to the streets while asking political rivals to sit down for talks to resolve the crisis. The dramatic escalation of tensions over the weekend raised the question whether the security forces more broadly were abandoning the president, something that would make it virtually impossible for him to remain in power. [Update: Evo Morales flies to Mexico but vows to return to Bolivia “with force.”] In a blow to Mr. Morales’s chances of regaining control, the country’s armed forces responded to the president’s speech by issuing a statement professing neutrality and promising to “not clash with the people.” The commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, said Saturday afternoon that the military would not crack down on protesters. But the statement suggested that top military leaders were hedging their bets as the crisis escalated: It did not clearly signal support for either Mr. Morales or those seeking to oust him. “The country’s current problems generated in the political arena must be resolved bearing in mind the nation’s highest interests before we reach an irreversible moment,” General Kaliman said. Military leaders are no doubt mindful of the last time the armed forces were deployed to restore order during a period of social unrest in 2003. After those confrontations turned deadly, some military personnel were accused of committing human rights abuses and prosecuted. By Saturday evening, Mr. Morales lost a key propaganda tool, the state-run Television Boliviana, after protesters forced its employees to abandon the broadcaster. The station then switched from pro-government news bulletins to old documentaries. Bolivia erupted in violent protests after Mr. Morales claimed to have won an unprecedented fourth term last month despite concerns from electoral observers over the validity of the results. The head of a vote auditing company contracted by the Bolivian government said Friday that ballot counting had revealed irregularities that prevented him from certifying the results. Police units defected in La Paz and in at least five other major cities, and officers were reported to have abandoned their posts outside the presidential palace. State television broadcast images of throngs of police, many still in uniform, marching with protesters in La Paz and in the country’s business capital Santa Cruz. In La Paz, crowds of protesters cheered the rebelling officers. Rebel police officers claimed to have taken over at least one regional governor’s office by Saturday, and one ruling party mayor joined the opposition. In the city of Oruro, defecting policemen dispersed government supporters with tear gas, according to local media. As unrest spread across the nation, one of Mr. Morales’s key political allies, Juan Carlos Cejas, the governor of the Potosí region, resigned because, he said, he feared for his life. “I’m not going to hold on to this job,” he said, according to a report in the Página Siete newspaper. “I’m not going to put myself and my family at risk.” Mr. Morales in his address cast himself as a victim of a conspiracy by people who “don’t respect democracy, and don’t respect the results of the last elections.” He called on the police to “uphold their duty to safeguard the safety of the Bolivian people.” It was his strongest direct acknowledgment of the spreading rebellion.  He said the talks he was proposing should involve members of four parties that won legislative seats in the latest election, a criteria that would exclude some of the main leaders who have been mobilizing against him in recent days. “We hope tonight to find peaceful solutions through dialogue,” the president said. “We’ll have an open agenda with the goal of pacifying Bolivia.” Leaders of Bolivia’s main opposition parties swiftly rejected his proposal. Mr. Morales also called on supporters to come out to defend his government, raising fears that clashes could intensify. On Saturday, eight anti-government protesters were injured when their convoy was ambushed by government allies on the way to a demonstration in La Paz, opposition leaders said.  Isabel Mercado, the director of Página Siete, one of the country’s main newspapers, said Saturday that Mr. Morales’s hold on power appeared to be slipping as the police mutiny grew and the leaders of the armed forces remained out of sight. “Without the police and the armed forces, I think it’s very hard for him to hold on,” she said.  Local news media reported that police defections had spread to at least four cities outside La Paz. The police have demanded better working conditions, the resignation of their commander and guarantees they won’t be used for political ends, The Associated Press reported.  Police guards outside the presidential palace in La Paz left their posts on Saturday, the A.P. reported, allowing anti-government protesters to walk up to the doors of the building. Mr. Morales was not in the compound when police retreated to their barracks. Officials in the palace in La Paz were evacuated, leaving only a military presidential guard. Protesters moved peacefully to the doors of the compound, and later left the area. Some police guards have abandoned their posts at several ministerial buildings and officers took over the old presidential palace, hanging national flags from its walls. Bolivia’s postelection unrest has so far claimed the lives of three people. Protesters have clashed with security forces across the country and burned public buildings. A pro-government mayor in a small city in central Bolivia was kidnapped and marched through the streets barefoot and drenched with red paint in the past week. Carlos Mesa, the former president who came second in the Oct. 20 election, said Mr. Morales is to blame for the unrest that has rattled the country in recent weeks. “The government is condemning itself to a disastrous exit,” Mr. Mesa told reporters on Saturday. “That’s what they deserve for not listening to the people.” The opposition claims the vote on October 20 was rigged. When initial vote tallies showed Mr. Morales had to face an uncertain second round of elections, the ballot count suddenly stopped. Election officials didn’t provide updates for nearly 24 hours without giving an explanation. When the results were finally updated, the initial trends were reversed, giving Mr. Morales just enough of a lead to avoid a runoff and spurring the opposition to take to the streets. “We want President Evo Morales to go,” the leader of Bolivia’s civic opposition, Luis Fernando Camacho, told reporters in La Paz on Friday. “We need him to go because we have decided so, because he has laughed at all of us.” Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Caracas, Venezuela; Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro; and Mónica Machicao reported from La Paz, Bolivia.']",Key allies resigned and anti-government protesters took over government offices in anger over last month’s disputed election.
"The City That Cycles With the Young, the Old, the Busy and the Dead",2019-11-09,By Peter S. Goodman,"['COPENHAGEN — By the standards operative on most of planet Earth, this is not an especially wonderful day for a bicycle ride. The temperature reads 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and a vengeful breeze forces damp chill to the bone. Sullen gray clouds occupy the sky, dispensing an apathetic drizzle. Natalie Gulsrud scoffs at these details. It is nearing 4 p.m., darkness already bringing finality to this bleak November afternoon. She has to go to the child care center to pick up her 5-year-old son — “5 and a half,” he quickly corrects, later. She has to stop for groceries, and then head home for dinner. Like tens of thousands of other people in Denmark’s elegant yet frequently dank capital, she pedals her way through her daily rounds, relying on the world’s most advanced and widely used network of bicycle lanes. She does not own a car. She does not want a car. She settles her bag into the front compartment of her cargo bike — a three-wheeled contraption built for hauling children and groceries that is something like the S.U.V. of local family transportation. She climbs aboard the saddle, gathers her overcoat around her, and leans into the uncompromising wind. “People here say there’s no such thing as bad weather,” said Ms. Gulsrud, 39. “Only bad clothing.” On the other side of the Atlantic, New York has just proclaimed intentions to spend $1.7 billion to dramatically expand the city’s now-convoluted and treacherous patchwork of bicycle lanes. Local leaders speak of dismantling car culture and replacing it with a wholesome dependence on human-powered vehicles. The mission is draped in high-minded goals — addressing climate change, unclogging traffic and promoting exercise. Copenhagen’s legendary bicycle setup has been propelled by all of these aspirations, but the critical element is the simplest: People here eagerly use their bicycles — in any weather, carrying the young, the infirm, the elderly and the dead — because it is typically the easiest way to get around. “It’s A to B-ism,” said Mikael Colville-Andersen, a raffish bicycle evangelist who preaches the gospel of Copenhagen to other cities. “It’s the fastest way from point to point.” The bicycle is liberation from municipal buses and their frequent stops. The bicycle spares people from having to worry about where to park cars. The bicycle puts people in control of when they leave and when they arrive. “Some people ride their bikes to the hospital to give birth,” said Ms. Gulsrud, who is herself pregnant with her second child. “I’m not going to do that.” A former neighbor operates a bicycle mortuary service, pedaling the departed to their final destinations in caskets. Mail carriers use bicycles to deliver parcels. People use bicycles to get to the airport, sometimes pushing wheeled suitcases alongside them while they roll. Some 49 percent of all journeys to school and work now transpire by bicycle, according to the city, up from 36 percent a decade ago. When the municipal government recently surveyed Copenhagen’s bikers on what inspires them to bike, 55 percent said it was more convenient than the alternatives. Only 16 percent cited environmental benefits. “It’s not in the morning, when you’re late for work, that you want to save the planet,” said Marie Kastrup, who heads the city’s bicycle program. On weekday mornings, some 42,000 people traverse the Queen Louise’s bridge in central Copenhagen, bringing residents from fashionable neighborhoods in the north into the city’s medieval center. On a recent soggy Monday, a woman in high heels and a trench coat pedaled a cargo bike decked out like a city taxi, her three toddlers in the front compartment. A plumber traversed the traffic in a cargo bike, his tools stashed in the compartment. Bicycles vastly outnumber cars. Most of the bicycles were old-school upright varieties distinguished by their utility and lack of appeal to thieves, whose ubiquity is a gnawing source of worry among the pedaling class.  But on the opposite side of the thoroughfare, in a shopfront done up like a Parisian boutique, a retailer, Larry vs. Harry, displayed its sleek, shiny two-wheeled cargo bike, The Bullitt, which sells for as much as 43,450 Danish kroner, about $6,500. Three models are parked in the front window, green, yellow and red, glinting like Ferraris. Nearby at Nihola, a cargo bike brand that is more like the Toyota of the pedaling scene, a showroom displays compartments big enough to fit four children. One can carry a wheelchair. Front doors swing open, allowing toddlers and dogs to climb in. Copenhagen’s status as a global exemplar of bicycle culture owes to the accommodating flatness of the terrain and the lack of a Danish auto industry, which might have hijacked the policy levers. Trouble also played a role.  The global oil shock of the 1970s lifted the price of gasoline, making driving exorbitantly costly. A dismal economy in the 1980s brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy, depriving it of finance to build roads, and making bicycle lanes an appealingly thrifty alternative. The city focused on making biking safe and comfortable, setting lanes apart from cars on every street. As biking captured mass interest, improving the infrastructure became good politics. When it snows in Copenhagen, bike lanes are typically plowed first. This was the situation that drew Ms. Gulsrud to Copenhagen from her native United States. Raised in the Pacific Northwest, she was pursuing graduate studies in public policy and working to promote bicycle commuting in Seattle when she opted for a semester in Copenhagen in 2009. She fell hard for the city, transferred her studies here, and now teaches natural resources management at the University of Copenhagen. She and her husband, Kasper Rasmussen, his 9-year-old daughter, Pixie, and their son Pascal, live in a sixth-story walk-up apartment in Vesterbro, a former warren of leatherworks shops that has rapidly gentrified, yielding peculiar contrasts. Prostitutes trawl for customers at night, walking past shops that sell Tibetan mandala paintings, organic produce and essential oils. “The other day, I heard people talking about whether their dogs were vegan,” Ms. Gulsrud said. She picked up Pascal in the handsome yet fading villa that is his child care center. He balked at putting on his coat despite the chill. She strapped him into a harness inside her compartment as he pulled on his helmet. She zipped shut a clear plastic cover, shielding him from the weather.  Then she rode through puddles to the grocery store, where she scanned dozens of bicycles lining the sidewalk until she found a spot big enough to accommodate hers. Emerging from the market, she deposited her groceries — kale, milk, Greek yogurt — into the compartment in front of Pascal and rode a few blocks to her apartment. She pulled open the gate and wheeled into the courtyard. The walls there were lined with bicycles — the cargo bike her neighbor, a medical student, uses to transport her three children, including her 6-month-old in a bassinet; her husband’s cargo bike, which includes an electric engine to help with hills; and standard bicycles used by the Pakistani immigrant family upstairs, by the Argentine-Brazilian couple and their two small children, and by her neighbor from Sweden and her wife and their two children. Not long ago, modernity felt bound for something like the Jetsons, with families zipping around via jet packs. But maybe this is the future, a resumption of the past, upgraded by contemporary design. “The infrastructure is there and it’s safe,” said Mr. Rasmussen, as he prepared a comforting dinner of squash soup and home-baked sourdough bread. “Why wouldn’t you bike? It’s stupid not to bike.”']",Nearly half of all journeys to school and work in Copenhagen take place on bicycles. And people like it that way.
The Fall of the Berlin Wall in Photos: An Accident of History That Changed The World,2019-11-09,By Katrin Bennhold,"['The Communist regime was prepared for everything “except candles and prayers.” East Germany’s peaceful 1989 revolution showed that societies that don’t reform, die. By Katrin Bennhold BERLIN — When Werner Krätschell, an East German pastor and dissident, heard that the Berlin Wall was open, he did not quite believe it. But he grabbed his daughter and her friend and drove to the nearest checkpoint to see for himself.  It was the night of Nov. 9, 1989. As their yellow Wartburg advanced unimpeded into what had always been an off-limits security zone, Mr. Krätschell rolled down the window and asked a border guard: “Am I dreaming or is this reality?” “You are dreaming,” the guard replied. It had long been a dream for East Berliners like Mr. Krätschell to see this towering symbol of unfreedom running like a scar of cement and barbed wire through the heart of their home city ripped open.  And when it finally became reality, when the Cold War’s most notorious armed border opened overnight, and was torn apart in the days that followed, it was not in the end the result of some carefully crafted geopolitical grand bargain.  It was, at the most basic level at least, the wondrous result of human error, spontaneity and individual courage.  “It was not predestined,” said Anne Applebaum, the historian and columnist. “It was not a triumph of good over evil. It was basically incompetence — and chance.” In the early evening of that fateful November day, a news conference took a historic turn. Against the backdrop of mass protests and a wave of eastern German refugees that had already fled the country via Hungary and what was then Czechoslovakia, Günter Schabowski, the leader of the East Berlin Communist Party, convened journalists to announce a series of reforms to ease travel restrictions. When asked when the new rules would take effect, Mr. Schabowski paused and studied the notes before him with a furrowed brow. Then he stumbled through a partially intelligible answer, declaring, “It takes effect, as far as I know... it is now... immediately.” It was a mistake. The Politburo had planned nothing of the sort. The idea had been to appease the growing resistance movement with minor adjustments to visa rules — and also to retain the power to deny travel. But many took Mr. Schabowski by his word. After West Germany’s main evening news, popular with East Germans who had long stopped trusting their own state-controlled media, effectively declared the wall open, crowds started heading for checkpoints at the Berlin Wall, demanding to cross. At one of those checkpoints, a Stasi officer who had always been loyal to the regime, was working the night shift. His name was Lt. Col. Harald Jäger. And his order was to turn people away. As the crowd grew, the colonel repeatedly called his superiors with updates. But no new orders were forthcoming. At some point he listened in to a call with the ministry, where he overheard one senior official questioning his judgment. “Someone in the ministry asked whether Comrade Jäger was in a position to assess the situation properly or whether he was acting out of fear,” Mr. Jäger recalled years later in an interview with Der Spiegel. “When I heard that, I’d had enough.” “If you don’t believe me, then just listen!” he shouted down the line, then took the receiver and held it out the window. Shortly after, Mr. Jäger defied his superiors and opened the crossing, starting a domino effect that eventually hit all checkpoints in Berlin. By midnight, triumphant easterners had climbed on top of the wall in the heart of the city, popping champagne corks and setting off fireworks in celebration. Not a single shot was fired. And no Soviet tanks appeared.  That, said Axel Klausmeier, director of the Berlin Wall Foundation, was perhaps the greatest miracle of that night. “It was a peaceful revolution, the first of its kind,” he said. “They were prepared for everything, except candles and prayers.” Through its history more than 140 people had died at the Berlin Wall, the vast majority of them trying to escape.  There was Ida Siekmann, 58, who became the first victim on Aug. 22, 1961, just nine days after the wall was finished. She died jumping from her third-floor window after the front of her house on Bernauer Strasse had become became part of the border, the front door filled in with bricks.  Peter Fechter, 18, became the most famous victim a year later. Shot several times in the back as he scaled the wall, he fell back onto the eastern side where he lay for over an hour, shouting for help and bleeding to death, as eastern guards looked on and western cameras whirled. The youngest victim was 15-month-old Holger H., who suffocated when his mother tried to quiet him while the truck his family was hiding in was being searched on Jan. 22, 1971. The parents made it across before realizing that their baby was dead. For the first half of 1989, it was still nearly impossible to get out of East Germany: The last killing at the wall took place in February that year, the last shooting, a close miss, in April.  The Soviets had squashed an East German uprising in June 1953 and suppressed similar rebellions in Hungary in 1956 and Prague in 1968.  In June 1989, just five months before the Berlin Wall fell, the Communist Party of China committed a massacre against democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. “They had been shooting people for 40 years,” said Ms. Applebaum, the historian. “No one knew what they would do in 1989.” But 1989 proved different. In the end, what gave people courage to resist were a series of shocks that had already shaken Soviet Communism to the core. Poland’s successful Solidarity movement, which had culminated in a semi-free election that year, was one. Others included a series of social and political reforms across Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe with which the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev hoped to preserve — not end — his Communist Party’s control. And perhaps most important, Ms. Applebaum said, belief in the system had long evaporated.  “The ideology had collapsed and people just didn’t believe in it anymore,” she said.  That is how the little things that culminated in this historic moment could become big things, said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at Oxford University. But that is sometimes misunderstood. “We took one of the most non-linear events and turned it into a linear version of history,” said Mr. Garton Ash.  The fall of the Berlin Wall became the end of history and liberalism the unchallenged model of modernity. Now illiberalism, Chinese-style, is challenging the West. Complacency is dangerous, said Ms. Applebaum: “The lesson is: Societies that don’t reform, die.” Mr. Krätschell, the pastor, had been among those demanding reforms and protesting the system with peaceful means. He held dissident meetings in his home and was harassed by the Stasi, East Germany’s fearsome secret police, for years. The churches played an important role in the resistance movement against East Germany’s Communist authorities.  “We knew: All the phone calls were bugged,” said Mr. Krätschell, now 79. Years later, after reading his own Stasi file, he learned that special commandos had bugged his home, updating the technology whenever he was on holiday with his family.  Soon after Mr. Krätschell, the pastor, had driven across the border on Nov. 9, 1989, a friend of his daughter who was also in the car asked him to pull over. She was 21 and pregnant and had never set foot in the West before.  Once Mr. Krätschell had parked, she opened the door, stuck her leg out, and touched the floor with her foot. Then she smiled triumphantly. “It was like the moon landing,” recalled Mr. Krätschell, “a kind of Neil Armstrong moment.”  Later, back in the East, she had called her parents and said, “Guess what, I was in the West.” Christopher F.

Another Election in Spain Threatens to Deepen the Political Deadlock,2019-11-09,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — In September, Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s caretaker Socialist prime minister, called off coalition talks with a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos, saying that he “could not have slept at night” if he had allowed its more radical politicians into his government. It is unclear, however, that Mr. Sánchez has been able to sleep better since. The acrimonious breakdown of talks to form a government is forcing Spain to hold its fourth national election in four years, a vote that will take place on Sunday. And the latest opinion polls suggest that the outcome is too close to call, with no single party likely to come near to winning a parliamentary majority.  The vote could plunge Spain into another round of tortuous coalition talks that would prolong the political sclerosis. Mr. Sánchez and his Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party remain in the lead, according to pollsters, but the repeat election provides an unexpectedly early opportunity for right-wing parties to benefit from the bickering among left-wing politicians. One of the parties most likely to reap such gains is the anti-migration and ultranationalist Vox party, which entered Parliament after winning 10 percent of the vote in the last election, in April.  Writing in El Confidencial, Ignacio Varela, a columnist, warned that the new election was likely to result in a lower turnout, more deadlock and more extremism. “Right now,” he wrote, “the only party that has reasons to celebrate is Vox.” The election in April produced a near-record turnout of 76 percent, which helped Mr. Sánchez, who had mobilized left-wing voters to oppose the far-right threat of Vox. But most pollsters warn that in the election on Sunday, about one-third of the electorate is undecided about whom to vote for. That could lead to even lower participation, especially when coupled with increasing frustration among voters about their party leaders’ inability to form a government, let alone resolve the lengthy separatist conflict in Catalonia.  Four years ago, Spain’s two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape. Five parties, led by younger leaders, won at least 10 percent of the vote in the April election. But this new generation of politicians has shown little inclination to work together in a coalition government, leaving Spain in deadlock at a time when Europe’s economy is showing worrying signs of a slowdown. “Spain would benefit from having a stronger government capable of confronting problems, but I don’t see any rapid end to our crisis of governance,” said Jaime Pastor, a professor of politics at the UNED University.  “We have a paradoxical situation in which the leaders have gained almost absolute control over their own parties, but are mostly losing the trust of voters and seem unwilling to compromise and unable to negotiate any kind of agreement,” he added.  When the talks with Unidas Podemos collapsed, Mr. Sánchez gambled that voters would give him a stronger negotiating mandate, after his Socialists won the election in April but did not gain a parliamentary majority. Mr. Sánchez was also comforted at the time by a further splintering among politicians on his left, as one of the founders of Podemos broke away to set up his own formation. But then nine former separatist leaders of Catalonia were sentenced to prison last month for sedition, and the backlash in the northeastern region has returned Spain’s territorial conflict to the top of the agenda.  The sentencing unleashed not only peaceful mass protests, but also nights of violence during which the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters who set off bomb fires and threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers. In view of the violence on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities, right-wing parties have raised the pressure on Mr. Sánchez to use his executive emergency powers to restore law and order in the region. “It seems to me that the Spanish government no longer really knows what it should be doing in Catalonia,” said Manuel Valls, a former prime minister of France who sits on the municipal council of Barcelona. “The polls are looking worse, Vox is rising, and this is turning into a very uncertain situation.” Calm has returned to Catalonia this month, but, 4,500 Spanish police officers have been dispatched to the region to monitor the weekend election and avoid further turmoil. And the Catalan question is not going away, with candidates homing in on the issue during the only televised election debate between the main candidates, on Monday. Albert Rivera, the leader of the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party, held up a paving stone that he suggested had been thrown in Barcelona against the police, warning that the uncontrolled situation in Catalonia presented a “threat to democracy.”  Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, used his first televised election debate to demand that the Spanish government impose another period of direct rule from Madrid over Catalonia and ban all separatist parties for being “criminal organizations.” He also peppered his remarks with xenophobic comments about migrants and Islam, which mostly went unanswered.  In defense of the constitutional values of Spain, the newspaper El País wrote in an editorial that Mr. Abascal’s intervention “should raise all alarm bells without delay.” Before the April election, Pablo Casado, the leader of the Popular Party, called Mr. Sánchez a traitor and a felon for suggesting that a mediator could help resolve the Catalan conflict. But the party had its worst-ever showing in April, and Mr. Casado recently toned down his rhetoric in order to draw more moderate voters in Sunday’s election.  After the violence in Barcelona, Mr. Sánchez toughened his stance against the leaders of the independence movement. During the debate on Monday, he also promised to return to Spain Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan leader who fled to Brussels in 2017 and is fighting another extradition request. While the relationship between the governing politicians in Madrid and Barcelona has reached another low point, the separatist parties hope to turn the election on Sunday into an opportunity to strengthen their presence within the Spanish Parliament.  A good result will confirm “the failure of the Spanish government’s strategy to clamp down on Catalan Republican progress,” said Alfred Bosch, who oversees foreign affairs within the Catalan separatist government. On Monday, Mr. Sánchez called on his rivals to accept the idea that whichever party wins the most votes on Sunday should be allowed to form the next administration.  But Mr. Casado reminded Mr. Sánchez that he himself had blocked the re-election of the previous Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, forcing Spain into another repeat election in 2016 and 10 months of political stalemate.

Jordan Reclaims Land Israelis Used Under ’94 Peace Accord,2019-11-10,By Rana F. Sweis and Isabel Kershner,"['AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan’s king on Sunday reclaimed border lands that Israel was allowed access to under  a 1994 peace treaty reached between the neighboring countries. Jordanians applauded the step but for many Israelis, the failure to negotiate an extension of the border area-land access was disappointing, and attested to the sorry state of relations 25 years after the peace accord was signed. Annexes to the peace treaty had allowed Israeli farmers to continue working the lands and tourists to visit them.  But in a speech to Parliament, King Abdullah II said Jordan was reclaiming “full sovereignty over every inch of those lands.”   Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, “Israel regrets Jordan’s decision to terminate the annexes.” Though the peace treaty has proved firm and lasting, and has led to tight security coordination, it remains unpopular with ordinary Jordanians.  Years of impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has not helped. Israeli-Jordanian tensions have flared periodically because of disputes with the Israelis over the handling of security at the Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, a hotly contested holy site over which Jordan has official custodianship. “Israel’s repeated violations and actions have left the king with no choice except to cancel the land lease,” said Hassan Barari, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the University of Jordan. He said, “There were multiple steps that Israel took in the past few years that were extremely provocative.”  Among them, Mr. Barari cited Israel’s placement of metal detectors at the entrances to the mosque compound in 2017, which were removed under Jordanian pressure. More broadly, he said, Jordanians felt sidelined from the Israeli-Palestinian process, “like they had no say.”  A more recent dispute between the countries was resolved last week, when Israel released two Jordanians, Hiba Labadi and Abdul Rahman Miri, who had been held in Israeli administrative detention for two months without charges on vague security grounds. In return, Jordan agreed to return its ambassador to Tel Aviv after he had been recalled for consultations. King Abdullah, under internal political pressure, had given a year’s notice of his intention not to renew the special arrangement giving Israelis free access to the lands. On Sunday, the Jordanian Army raised the country’s flag in Baqura, a pocket of land some 10 miles south of the Sea of Galilee, sandwiched between the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers. In Hebrew, it is known as “the Island of Peace.” Recognizing Israeli private property rights there, Jordanian officials said Israeli farmers would be allowed continued access to the lands if they applied for visas through the Jordanian Embassy in Tel Aviv and passed through official border crossings. Israelis in the area said such an arrangement was impractical, and they cast the handover of the land to full Jordanian control as a diplomatic failure. “There is a feeling of frustration and disappointment,” said Eli Arazi, a member of  a nearby kibbutz, or communal farm, who sat on the negotiating team for the 1994 agreement and on the committee that was set up to oversee the special arrangement. “Our feeling is that this could have been prevented if there had been more effort on both sides for a proper dialogue,” he said. Speaking by telephone on Sunday, Mr. Arazi said Jewish farmers had worked about 175 acres of  land there for 70 years, growing fruit and vegetables. He said he hoped that in the future, the farmers would be able to return to the agricultural lands via the simple old, yellow gate separating them from Israeli territory, even if it meant showing a passport. On Saturday, about 1,000 Israelis made farewell visits to the “Island of Peace,” with the last group returning toward dusk from a final coordinated tour of the site across the Jordanian lines.  A much-loved nature spot with a rich history, the area has an emotional pull for many Israelis. In 1997, less than three years after the signing of the peace treaty, a Jordanian soldier went on a shooting rampage that killed seven Israeli schoolgirls visiting the border site.  There were no official ceremonies to mark the handover on the Israeli side. Over the weekend, the Israeli news media merely broadcast images of two Israeli soldiers closing the yellow gate for one last time. At the second tract of land, known as Al Ghamr, Israeli farmers from the nearby cooperative village of Zofar have long worked about 370 acres of agricultural land on the Jordanian side of the line. Officials on both sides said the farmers would be allowed to harvest the crops that were planted before the annex to the peace agreement expired.  Rana Sweis reported from Amman, Jordan, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.']",Israelis see the step as a reflection of the dismal state of relations a quarter century after the treaty was reached.
At Least 3 Dead as Fires Rage Across Eastern Australia,2019-11-09,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Wildfires surging across Australia’s drought-ravaged East Coast have left three people dead and destroyed more than 150 homes, officials said on Saturday, sounding the alarm for what is expected to be one of the country’s worst recorded fire seasons. With summer heat waves still several weeks away, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires across New South Wales, mostly north of Sydney, where massive clouds of smoke drifted east, turning skies orange. The smoke clouds were large enough to create their own weather systems, experts said. Officials said it was unprecedented to see so many fires so out of control this early in spring. “The consequences are absolutely apparent and evident over the last few weeks and particularly highlighted in the last 24 hours,” said Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “We have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We’re not even in summer yet.” The dire assessment from both firefighters and meteorologists — who warned of dry, windy conditions to come — confirmed what scientists have been predicting: Australia’s bush fires will become more frequent and more intense as climate change worsens. Few if any other developed countries in the world are as vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate as Australia, according to independent scientific reports. The country’s ecology combines a vast arid interior with rapidly-heating ocean currents that make it a global hot spot for warming seas. And over the past year, the urgency of the issue has increased because of a drought that’s settled across swaths of the country’s most productive agricultural areas — including some of those now ablaze. Farmers and residents in the areas that are now burning have reported being surprised by both the intensity and speed of the fires’ spread. Some residents reported seeing flames that were 60 feet tall. Others drove through conditions that looked apocalyptic.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Defense Force would help where needed, and financial assistance would be made available to people affected by the fires. “The devastating and horrific fires that we have seen particularly in New South Wales but also in Queensland have been absolutely chilling,” Mr. Morrison told reporters in Sydney. Two of the people who were killed died near Glen Innes, a small town of around 6,000 people northeast of Coffs Harbour.  Firefighters said they found a body on Saturday in a burned car. Another woman, found on Friday unconscious and with serious burns, later died in a hospital. At least seven more people have been reported missing near the same fire. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, described the terrifying scene.  “People were burned, lives were lost,” she told reporters. “People battled to save their houses and then had to walk out because their cars had blown up — it was just horrific.” Commissioner Fitzsimmons said more deaths and damage were likely to be on the way. “Not only is it about next week,” he said, “but, unfortunately, the forecast for the balance of the season continues to be driven by above-normal temperatures, below-average rainfall.”']","Firefighters warned of dry, windy conditions to come, signaling an early start for what could be the country’s worst fire season in decades.

"As Deaths Mount in Iraq Protests, a Rocket Attack Raises New Questions",2019-11-09,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — At least two people were killed Friday as antigovernment protests entered their fifth week amid rising concern that security forces continue to use lethal force in defiance of senior military officials. The deaths, which occurred in clashes between protesters and security forces in the southern city of Basra, raised the number of dead to nearly 300 since demonstrations calling for an end to corruption and a change in leadership began last month. And as protests gripped the country’s south and the capital, Baghdad, a rocket attack in the north created a new level of uncertainty.  Seventeen rockets struck inside and near the Gayara military base south of Mosul on Friday, said Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, the spokesman for the Joint Command in Baghdad.  Most of the troops at the base are Iraqi but some American personnel are also stationed there.  No one was killed or wounded at the base, General al-Khafaji said, and an American counterstrike killed three people. It was not clear who launched the rocket attack,  although the Islamic State has been active in the area for the past year, largely targeting small villages that have failed to comply with its demands for shelter, food and support.  Northern Iraq has been largely untouched by the political turbulence in Baghdad and the south. Human rights groups have issued increasingly worried statements about the tactics being used against unarmed, largely peaceful protesters.  A banner unfurled near the main protest site in Baghdad cried out for international intervention. “To the whole world, to the United Nations, to the European Union, to the Security Council, to the Arab League: They stole my country and killed our young men and destroyed our Iraq.”  Since the demonstrations began, 294 Iraqis have been killed and 9,800 wounded, according to a survey of hospitals by the Iraqi government.  United Nations officials in Geneva said Friday that the Iraqi government was not doing enough to defuse the protests and had failed to rein in security forces and militias, some of which have fired live ammunition at protesters. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, told reporters that the Iraqi government had not started any meaningful dialogue with protesters. “To get out of that cycle they clearly need to do more than they are now,” he said. United Nations officials are also alarmed by reports that protesters have been abducted by unknown people, Mr. Colville said, and that demonstrators, bloggers and social media commentators have been arrested. Human rights groups have criticized the tear gas canisters and the tactics  of the security forces. The canisters are larger than those used in many urban crowd-control operations, and they are sometimes shot directly at protesters, causing lethal head injuries.    “We lost so many brothers and friends, we have so many martyrs,” said Ali Hassan, 30, who has a master’s degree in business administration but has been unable to find a job.  He said the government was behaving “like a mafia.” “They are killing so many unarmed people, so we are asking for help from the United Nations, from the European Union,” he said. “Please, please help bring peace between our security forces and all of our unarmed people.”  Nick Cummings Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.  ']",Nearly 300 Iraqis have died in antigovernment demonstrations in the south and in the capital. A rocket attack in the north has added yet another level of uncertainty.
"How Russia Meddles Abroad for Profit: Cash, Trolls and a Cult Leader",2019-11-11,By Michael Schwirtz and Gaelle Borgia,"['ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar — The Russians were hard to miss. They appeared suddenly last year in Madagascar’s traffic-snarled capital, carrying backpacks stuffed with cash and campaign swag decorated with the name of Madagascar’s president. It was one of Russia’s most overt attempts at election interference to date. Working from their headquarters in a resort hotel, the Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term. Skirting electoral laws, they bought airtime on television stations and blanketed the country with billboards. They paid young people to attend rallies and journalists to cover them. They showed up with armed bodyguards at campaign offices to bribe challengers to drop out of the race to clear their candidate’s path. At Madagascar’s election commission, officials were alarmed. “We all recall what the Russians did in the United States during the election,” said Thierry Rakotonarivo, the commission’s vice president. “We were truly afraid.” Of all the places for Russia to try to swing a presidential election, Madagascar is perhaps one of the least expected. The island nation off the coast of southeastern Africa is thousands of miles away from Moscow and has little obvious strategic value for the Kremlin or the global balance of power. But two years after the Russians’ aggressive interference in the United States, here they were, determined to expand their clout and apply their special brand of election meddling to a distant political battleground. The operation was approved by President Vladimir V. Putin and coordinated by some of the same figures who oversaw the disinformation around the 2016 American presidential election, according to dozens of interviews with officials in Madagascar, local operatives hired to take part in the Russian campaign and hundreds of pages of internal documents produced by the Russian operatives.  The meddling in Madagascar began just a few weeks after Mr. Putin sat down with the nation’s president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, in Moscow last year. The meeting, which has never been reported, also included Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close confidant of Mr. Putin who was indicted in the United States for helping to orchestrate Russia’s effort to manipulate the 2016 American election, according to Mr. Rajaonarimampianina and another government minister present on the trip to Moscow. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any official effort to tamper with foreign elections. But his sit-down with Madagascar’s president — Mr. Prigozhin by his side — points to his involvement in Russia’s electoral interference in even the smallest, most remote countries. In some vital ways, the Madagascar operation mimicked the one in the United States. There was a disinformation campaign on social media and an attempt to bolster so-called spoiler candidates. The Russians even recruited an apocalyptic cult leader in a strategy to split the opposition vote and sink its chances. “What surprised me is that it was the Russians who came over to my house without me contacting them,” said the cult leader, known as Pastor Mailhol. “They said, ‘If you ever need money, we are going to pay all the expenses.’” But while Russia’s efforts in the United States fit Moscow’s campaign to upend Western democracy and rattle Mr. Putin’s geopolitical rivals, the undertaking in Madagascar often seemed to have a much simpler objective: profit. Before the election, a Russian company that local officials and foreign diplomats say is controlled by Mr. Prigozhin acquired a major stake in a government-run company that mines chromium, a mineral valued for its use in stainless steel. The acquisition set off protests by workers complaining of unpaid wages, canceled benefits and foreign intrusion into a sector that had been a source of national pride for Madagascar. It repeated a pattern in which Russia has swooped into African nations, hoping to reshape their politics for material gain. In the Central African Republic, a former Russian intelligence officer is the top security adviser to the country’s president, while companies linked to Mr. Prigozhin have spread across the nation, snapping up diamonds in both legal and illegal ways, according to government officials, warlords in the diamond trade and registration documents showing Mr. Prigozhin’s growing military and commercial footprint.  Last year, three Russian journalists were gunned down while investigating his activities there. “Prigozhin had tremendous success in 2016, and he is now the guy everyone is watching,” said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s got some boots on the ground, people peddling stuff in different countries in Africa. These are countries with authoritarian-style leaders who need a little extra help to win. And in return, he gets access to some of the goodies.” But Russia’s forays abroad have been far from flawless. For all its efforts, the operation in Madagascar missed its mark at first, plagued by a startling incompetence and corruption that undercuts Russia’s image as a master political manipulator. Campaign materials were riddled with grammatical mistakes. Ballpoint pens meant as election giveaways misspelled Mr. Rajaonarimampianina’s name. Some operatives appeared to undermine the campaign for their own personal gain, demanding fake receipts with double the actual price of publishing the newspaper so they could pocket the difference.  “They paid well, but they were messing around,” said the printing house owner, Lola Rasoamaharo. One person working for the campaign described packets of gold and precious stones piled on the bed in the room of a Russian operative, another sign that the people entrusted with the mission were often more interested in profit than politics. They also chose the wrong candidate. As it became clear that Mr. Rajaonarimampianina had little hope of winning, even with their help, the Russian operatives pivoted quickly, dumping the incumbent, whom they referred to as “the piano,” and shifting their support to the eventual winner, Andry Rajoelina. “The piano is very weak,” Yaroslav Ignatovsky, a manager of the operation, wrote to a colleague in a text exchange obtained by the Dossier Center, a London-based research organization. “He’ll never make it. But we have to make it somehow.” The maneuver worked. After the Russians pirouetted to help Mr. Rajoelina — their former opponent — win the election, Mr. Prigozhin’s company was able to negotiate with the new government to keep control of the chromium mining operation, despite the worker protests, and Mr. Prigozhin’s political operatives remain stationed in the capital to this day.  It all started with a secret meeting. News reports described Mr. Rajaonarimampianina’s three-day trip to Moscow in March, 2018, as mundane: He attended an investment forum, met a foreign ministry official and received an honorary degree from a local university. But at some point, his plans veered from the published itinerary. Slipping away from the press pool, he made his way to the Kremlin. There, in the private office of the Russian president, he met for no more than 30 minutes with Mr. Putin and Mr. Prigozhin. In an interview, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina explained that Mr. Prigozhin had set up the meeting, and even met him at the airport in Moscow. But he insisted that the presidential election, scheduled for that fall, was not discussed. Others remembered things differently. Harison E. Randriarimanana, a former agriculture minister who accompanied the president to Moscow, said that after the meeting his boss proudly announced that Mr. Putin had agreed to assist with his re-election campaign. “Putin said he wanted to help him,” Mr. Randriarimanana recalled the president saying. “He was going to help us with the election.” Just weeks later, local residents were startled by the sudden appearance of Russian operatives in Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital. The operation happened alongside an aggressive push by the Kremlin to revive relations with a number of African countries. For Moscow, Africa had been an important ideological battlefield during the Cold War, and Mr. Putin, who makes no secret of his nostalgia for the Soviet Union, views the continent as an important front for combating the West’s global influence. Last month, Mr. Putin played host to more than 40 African heads of state, including Madagascar’s, at a summit meeting in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi to showcase Russia’s growing stature as a player in the region and present his country as a partner preferable to the West.  “We see how a number of Western governments have resorted to pressuring, bullying and blackmailing the governments of sovereign African countries,” Mr. Putin said before the meeting. By contrast, he added, “Our African agenda has a positive, aspirational character.”  In recent years, a parade of African leaders have paid visits to the Kremlin, seeking lucrative deals with Russia’s giant state-run companies, including for weapons. In dollar terms, Russia is no match for China or the United States, which have tens of billions of dollars worth of economic investment in the continent. But for some leaders in search of a political edge, Russia has developed a handy tool kit, which is where Mr. Prigozhin comes in. After being indicted on charges of intervening in the 2016 American election, he has traveled the world, proffering his services. In Africa, he has found a highly receptive market. He and his operatives have been active in nearly a dozen African countries, including Libya, Sudan and Zimbabwe, analysts say. In the interview, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina described his meeting with Mr. Putin as run-of-the-mill for someone of his stature. During his tenure, he had met with the leaders of China and India, and twice visited the White House. But unlike those encounters, the meeting with Mr. Putin and Mr. Prigozhin was kept secret. Mr. Rajaonarimampianina insisted that he took “not one penny from the Russians” for his campaign, though he did not rule out that the Kremlin worked to assist him without his knowledge. “Everything is possible in politics,” he said. He stumbled a bit when shown a letter with his signature written to a Russian political operative named Oleg Vasilyevich Zakhariyash. In the letter, written in French and stamped “PROJET CONFIDENTIEL,” the president requests the Russian’s help “to resist attempts by international institutions to interfere” in Madagascar’s election. Western diplomats had, in fact, been concerned that the president was trying to delay the vote. “I am convinced,” the president’s letter said, “that certain forces will attempt to call into doubt” the election. Mr. Rajaonarimampianina confirmed that the signature on the letter was his and acknowledged meeting Mr. Zakhariyash in Madagascar, but he said he did not recall writing the letter. Mr. Zakhariyash, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, was later quoted by RIAFAN, a Russian news outlet connected to companies owned by Mr. Prigozhin, blaming the United States, Britain and France for interfering in the Madagascar elections. Local residents hired by the Russian operation in Madagascar described Mr. Zakhariyash as “the boss.” Likewise, one of the Russian unit’s internal spreadsheets identified him as the “head of department.” He is also one of two authors of a confidential report detailing plans for the Madagascar campaign, including the creation of a “troll factory” to focus on social media, echoing the tactics Mr. Prigozhin is accused of unleashing on the United States. The documents — along with text exchanges and emails between Russian operatives — were obtained and analyzed by the Dossier Center, a London-based investigative organization founded by Mr. Putin’s longtime nemesis, the former oil billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Through interviews with officials, candidates and local operatives in Madagascar, The New York Times independently confirmed much of the information in the documents, which the Dossier Center said were provided by moles working within Mr. Prigozhin’s organization. The spreadsheets name more than 30 Russians working in the country ahead of the election, calling them media managers, lawyers, translators and a “counterpropaganda technologist.” People in Madagascar hired by the Russians to work on the campaign verified many of the operatives’ identities.  Many of them appear to be from St. Petersburg, where Mr. Prigozhin’s so-called troll factory is based. But not all. Several worked for the Russian-backed separatist government in eastern Ukraine. One attracted attention earlier this year when his wife posted a photo of her battered and bruised face on Facebook, accusing her husband of beating her. Few appeared to have much expertise on Madagascar, or on Africa at all — and it showed, locals said. They often used a translation application on their phones to communicate and had little understanding of local politics. “They’re always going around with money, they’re always going around with women,” said one Malagasy man who worked with the Russians and feared reprisals. “They just thought it was all very simple in Madagascar. They arrived and that’s it, let’s go. That’s why it all fell apart.” Nearly two decades ago, André Christian Dieudonné Mailhol, the founder and pastor of the Church of the Apocalypse, said he received a message from God that he would be president of Madagascar one day. He did not predict, however, that three Russians would turn up like Magi on his doorstep 18 years later with an offer to help fulfill that prophecy. “They said that they came here to help me with the presidential election,” he said. The three gathered in his brightly painted living room in 2018, peppering him with questions: “How old are you? Why do you want to run for the presidency?” Pastor Mailhol explained God’s plan for him, and they offered him cash, promising to fully fund his campaign. They never fully explained who they were, he said, beyond giving their first names — Andrei, Vladimir and Roman — and never said what they wanted in return. Pastor Mailhol didn’t ask. “I just thought, a powerful country came to my house and suggested helping me. Why would I bother them with questions like, ‘Who are you? What are you here for?’” the pastor, 59, recalled. “No other foreign countries came to help me. They were the only ones, so I did not want to ask much. I was O.K. with that.” The strategy of supporting so-called spoiler candidates is another echo of the 2016 plot to subvert the American election, in which Russian social media bots encouraged support for figures like Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate — as a way, officials say, to draw votes away from Hillary Clinton. Pastor Mailhol said his Russian team wrote some of his speeches and paid for campaign posters and television advertising. On one internal spreadsheet, the “Pastor Group” is identified as Andrei Kramar, Vladimir Boyarishchev and Roman Pozdnyakov. Shown photos of the men from Facebook, Pastor Mailhol and his assistants confirmed they were the men who worked with his campaign. They made for a curious team. A photo of Mr. Boyarishchev posted to a Russian social media site in 2012 shows him shirtless, flexing his biceps and wearing the blue beret of a United Nations peacekeeper. Other social media posts suggest he served in a United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Pastor Mailhol said he spoke excellent French, which many educated Malagasy know well. The other two have equally colorful histories. In a Facebook post from a decade ago, Mr. Kramar describes himself as a member of Mr. Putin’s political party, United Russia, but later he popped up in eastern Ukraine as a functionary in a Kremlin-backed separatist enclave that has been fighting a war against Ukraine since 2014. Ukrainian authorities say the third operative, Mr. Pozdnyakov, is also involved with the pro-Kremlin rebels. His wife, once a United Russia member of Parliament, is the head of the separatist government’s election commission. Other presidential candidates in Madagascar gave similar accounts of Russians turning up out of the blue, some with bags of cash. Onja Rasamimanana, who worked for a history professor-turned-candidate named Jean Omer Beriziky, said she coordinated with a Maksim, an Anastasia and a Margo, who was the interpreter. “And then a Grigori showed up,” she said. “They were looking for fresh faces,” she said. “They didn’t explain anything. They didn’t mention anything regarding their motivations.” She said that her candidate, Mr. Beriziky, later told her the Russians offered $2 million in campaign funding, but ultimately provided less than half a million. Two Russians also approached a pop megastar running for president, Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo, also known as Dama. Over four meetings, Mr. Zafimahaleo said, the Russians tried to pressure him to support a delay in the election so that the incumbent had more time to campaign. “They made big promises,” Mr. Zafimahaleo said. “‘If you do what we want you to do, we’ll help your campaign,’” he said they told him. He refused, he said, suspecting that the Russians had come to exploit Madagascar’s natural resources. Only three of the Russian operatives identified by local hires of the campaign responded to requests for comment. All acknowledged visiting Madagascar last year, but only one admitted working as a pollster on behalf of the president. The others said they were simply tourists. Pyotr Korolyov, described as a sociologist on one spreadsheet, spent much of the summer of 2018 and fall hunched over a computer, deep in polling data at La Résidence Ankerana, a hotel the Russians used as their headquarters, until he was hospitalized with the measles, according to one person who worked with him.  In an email exchange, Mr. Korolyov confirmed that he had come down with the measles, but rejected playing a role in a Russian operation. He did defend the idea of one, though. “Russia should influence elections around the world, the same way the United States influences elections,” he wrote. “Sooner or later Russia will return to global politics as a global player,” he added. “And the American establishment will just have to accept that.” As the election approached, the Russians grew nervous and frustrated. In one text message, Mr. Ignatovsky, who helped oversee the operation, describes Madagascar as a “black hole.” One of his colleagues complains that “everything is ass-backward,” and that the “unhappy locals” were impeding the team’s work. But the Russians were setting off alarms, too. An op-ed in a local newspaper warned that after meddling in the United States, Russia had set its sights on Madagascar. “Russia badly wants to make good use of its impressive experience in destabilization” by intervening in Madagascar, the article said. “Vodka will flow like water if they achieve their goal.” Relations with the various candidates the Russians were backing began to sour. By September, they had dumped the incumbent, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina, deciding he was too unpopular to win, according to internal communications. In the interview in Paris, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina said he was aware the Russians were supporting other candidates and became indignant when told of the Russians’ conclusion that he was a losing bet. “How could they know that I will lose the election?” he said. In the first round, he received less than 9 percent of the vote, finishing a distant third. The Russians shifted their support to Mr. Rajoelina, a young former mayor who had been Madagascar’s transitional president after a coup in 2009. In the campaign’s final weeks, Pastor Mailhol said, the team of Russians made a request: Drop out of the race and support Mr. Rajoelina. He refused. The Russians made the same proposal to the history professor running for president, saying, “‘If you accept this deal you will have money,’” according to Ms. Rasamimanana, the professor’s campaign manager.  When the professor refused, she said, the Russians created a fake Facebook page that mimicked his official page and posted an announcement on it that he was supporting Mr. Rajoelina. The members of the so-called Pastor Group — Mr. Kramar, Mr. Pozdnyakov and Mr. Boyarishchev — were arrested and deported last year after organizing a protest in front of the French Embassy. They left without fully paying what they owed their local operatives, said Niaina Rakotonjanahary, the pastor’s campaign spokeswoman. “It happened to all of us who worked there,” she said. “We were so dumb.” As in the American election, it is not clear whether the Russians directly colluded with the eventual winner, Mr. Rajoelina, or simply operated a parallel campaign to support him. Before switching sides, the Russians had local hires write articles disparaging Mr. Rajoelina, according to one of the people who worked for them. “They asked me to write bad things about Andry Rajoelina — that he sold our lands to the Chinese,” said the person, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. “During the second round of the presidential election, though, they asked me to write good things about Andry Rajoelina.” Mr. Rajoelina declined to comment, but an official from his campaign said that his team was aware of Russian payments to other candidates. In the end, the Russians retained their prize — control over the chromium operation. They now maintain a staff of 30 in the country, including engineers and geologists. The contract gives them a 70 percent stake in the venture, said Nirina Rakotomanantsoa, the managing director of the Malagasy company that owns the remaining share. “The contract is already signed,” he said. “I am thankful the Russians are here.” Not all the Russian operatives appeared satisfied. In a moment of doubt, Yevgeny Kopot, a Prigozhin functionary who appears to play a coordinating role for operations in different African countries, sent a text message to a colleague in Madagascar in January. “Do you think that we’re disgracing our country?” he asked, according to texts obtained by the Dossier Center. “Or devaluing her name?” The colleague told him not to worry. “If you think about it,” she replied, “the whole planet is disgraced. Not the planet, precisely, but humanity.”  Gaelle Ramamonjisoa and Prisca Rananjarison contributed reporting.']",
Ugly From the Outset: Hong Kong’s Day of Widespread Violence,2019-11-11,"By Mike Ives, Elaine Yu and Edward Wong","['HONG KONG — Hong Kong was a city on edge on Monday following escalating violence, in which one demonstrator was shot point blank by a police officer and one man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters. At nightfall, both men were fighting for their lives in a city seething with resentments. Protesters have voiced outrage at police officers they see as increasingly resorting to force, and at a government they say has allowed them to act with impunity. Government supporters are embittered over the protesters themselves turning to violence and the damage it has done to their city. Months of unrest have thrown the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, and if Monday was any indication, there is no end in sight. Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled chief executive, said the mayhem could “take Hong Kong to the road of ruin” and denounced those who had set the man on fire as “enemies of the people.” The shooting of the protester set off outrage among many Hong Kongers. The young man was shot as commuters, snarled by roadblocks set up by demonstrators, looked on in disbelief. One moment, he was standing on a corner staring into the end of the police officer’s handgun. The next, after several shots rang out, he lay crumpled on the ground in the middle of an eerily deserted intersection. As blood pooled on the asphalt, a crowd of angry citizens surrounded riot police officers who had arrived as reinforcements. “Murderer!” some of them cried. An officer doused the crowd with pepper spray. Anger quickly unspooled across several districts in the city of more than seven million people, and the protests drew in both suit-clad office workers in the central business district and residents in working-class neighborhoods. The other spasm of violence Monday took place on an overpass across town from the shooting. There, a middle-aged man reprimanded a group of protesters, accusing them of lacking patriotism for the Chinese motherland. He was set ablaze. “Go back to the Greater Bay Area!” protesters shouted at him, using Beijing’s term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The Hospital Authority said that both the protester who had been shot and the man who had been set on fire were in critical condition. On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemns “violence on all sides” and believes “the increased polarization within Hong Kong society underscores the need for a broad-based and sincere dialogue between the government, protesters, and citizenry writ large.” Ms. Ortagus also suggested the United States may no longer grant Hong Kong a favorable trade status different from that of mainland China: “Hong Kong’s autonomy, its adherence to the rule of law, and its commitment to protecting civil liberties are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,” she said. Tensions in Hong Kong had been building for days, following the death of a student  who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. Many protesters see the student as a martyr, casting his death as more evidence of excessive use of force by the police. They called for citizens to join in a strike on Monday, and to disrupt transit en masse during the morning commute. Events across the city, including classes at most of its universities, were canceled. The scale of the transit disruptions was not as large as a citywide strike that protesters staged on a weekday in early August. But the clashes between protesters and the police were intense by any measure; it was only the third time the police have shot a protester since the demonstrations began. Notably, some clashes occurred on the fringes of university campuses that have in recent months generally been off limits to such violence. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and glass bottles at police lines, while officers responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Thousands of black-clad protesters also turned up for a flash mob-style demonstration in Hong Kong’s central business district around lunchtime, creating a starkly surreal scene in an area filled with luxury malls. Some used orange traffic cones, bricks and wooden poles to set up barricades on main roads. On the side of a Giorgio Armani store, a video screen with an ad showing models parading down a runway was defaced with graffiti: “They shoot, they murder, they are well-paid.” Protesters, some of them office workers in full face masks, yelled insults at police officers along the same lines. “Shooting everywhere — you think you’re so cool?” one said to an officer, adding an expletive. “Have you killed someone yet today? Have you met your killing quota?” Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police. “The gun wasn’t necessary, let alone firing shots,” he said, referring to the morning’s shooting. “You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It’s just very ridiculous.” In the Kwai Fong district, one video showed a police officer on a motorcycle swerving into a crowd of protesters, clipping at least one of them. The police later said the officer had been suspended from front-line duties. As many Hong Kong residents prepared for their evening commute, the smell of tear gas lingered outside their office buildings. In an internal memo, the bank HSBC said that while it was still operating normally, its employees should “leave the office early and under safe conditions.” The months of protests started as a fight over an extradition bill that many residents of the onetime British colony feared made them too vulnerable to mainland China, which resumed control over Hong Kong in 1997. The protests morphed into a broader call for democracy and police accountability. Now, neither side seems to agree on what the future should look like — and neither seems willing to compromise. On Monday afternoon, the police urged protesters to stop threatening public safety. And they defended their actions. The authorities said that the officer who fired the three live rounds in the Sai Wan Ho area had acted in self-defense against protesters who had been trying to steal his revolver. “We certainly believe our officer did not have bad intention to hurt anyone,” John Tse, a top police official, told reporters. Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, said the protesters were engaging in “wishful thinking” if they thought they could pressure the government into making concessions with violence. “I am making this statement clear and loud here,” she said. “That will not happen.”']",
U.K. Minister Apologizes for Case of Teen With Autism Kept in Seclusion,2019-11-10,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Bethany is 18 years old. She also lives with autism. And, for most of the last three years, she has been locked away in tiny rooms of psychiatric hospitals across Britain, with almost no human contact. Matt Hancock, Britain’s health secretary, publicly apologized to her on Saturday “for the things that have gone wrong in her care.” Calling her case “incredibly difficult and complex,” he said that she was set to be moved to “a more appropriate setting before Christmas.” The case has drawn national attention to the detention of hundreds of young people with autism or learning disabilities in Britain, and prompted an inquiry into the mental health system by a committee in Parliament. The conditions were so dire, the committee said, that the lawmakers had “lost confidence” in the system and its regulators. “The brutal truth is that we are failing to protect some of the most vulnerable young people,” the Joint Committee of Human Rights said in a report released this month. “Indeed, we are inflicting terrible suffering on those detained in mental health hospitals and causing anguish to their distraught families.” The lawmakers called for an overhaul of the system, citing the testimony of parents and detained young people who described bruises and broken limbs, long stretches in total isolation and hours without treatment for physical injuries. As of July, more than 2,000 people with severe learning difficulties or autism were being held in institutions, including 680 people ages 0 to 24, the report said. “It feels like some sort of nightmare,” testified one unnamed witness, a young man with learning disabilities. “It was not a safe place. It was not a treatment room. I got no assessment or treatment done. There was no care.” Bethany’s case was also cited: Lawmakers said she had “spent most of her time in conditions that amounted to solitary confinement, with no access to treatment or therapy.”  Neither Bethany nor her father, Jeremy, can be fully named because of a court order in the case. Many details of the case are not publicly known, including why officials declared Bethany a risk to herself and others in December 2016. She has spent most of the past three years in near total seclusion.  Her autism manifests with “all-round anxiety,” her father, Jeremy, said by phone on Sunday. “Imagine you are walking through a multistory car park, late at night, it’s dark, suddenly the lights go out and you hear footsteps behind you — that anxiety level is Bethany’s baseline of anxiety,” he said.  He recalled the first time he saw her after she was taken to St. Andrew’s Healthcare in Northampton, England, in December 2016 under the Mental Health Act, which allows the authorities to mandate detention in some cases. “I wasn’t even told she was in seclusion,” he said. “I was led through a series of corridors, it was one locked door after another down these corridors,” he said, adding the scene resembled one from the Hollywood thriller “The Silence of the Lambs.”  He then saw his daughter behind a window.  “I had to kneel down at the hatch to talk to her,” he said. “It was horrific, barbaric.” The local authorities said she was taken to St. Andrew’s temporarily, so that her medication could be reviewed and she could receive therapeutic intervention.  But within 10 days she was put into what her father had previously described as a “cell.” And, in accordance with the Mental Health Act, she was stripped of her legal rights to freedom, he said on Sunday.  She was briefly moved to a “community placement,” funded by the local council. But after having lived in isolation for more than two years, she was quickly overwhelmed by having to run a house on her own, her father wrote in a post on his blog.  After that she went to a temporary setting in an adolescent psychiatric intensive care unit. She grew to trust the staff there, visited the grounds, and eventually was allowed outside the unit in a car.  A few months after she turned 18, she was moved to a medium-secure hospital in Wales. She has lived there since June, in a single room 10 feet wide, with green-tinted walls and fluorescent lighting, her father said. There is no furniture — just a four-inch mattress, an en-suite toilet and a shower.  A window allows sunlight to filter in, but it’s too high for her to look out, Jeremy added. He sued the National Health Service England, the local authorities and St. Andrew’s hospital to challenge her detention at St. Andrew’s from December 2016 to February 2019.  The parties reached an agreement at mediation in September, and both N.H.S. England and St. Andrew’s Healthcare accepted that the care that Bethany received had not always complied with standards.  “This affected her well-being and made it harder for her to return to live in the community,” they said in a joint statement that was posted in Jeremy’s blog. She remains in the medium-secure facility in Wales.  Mr. Hancock, the health secretary, called Bethany’s case “heart-rending” and said on Saturday that he has insisted on “a case review of every single person in those conditions.” An N.H.S. investigation report, released last month, found that “psychological harm and Beth’s human rights” were “inadequately considered” during her seclusion and segregation, adding that her physical environment was “inappropriate.” Jeremy said Sunday that he had first heard of the health secretary’s new plan to move his daughter the day before on British television, as Mr. Hancock apologized to Bethany during an interview with Sky News.  He said the last time he had spoken with the health secretary was last year; he accused him of making up the pledge “on the spot” and of “electioneering” ahead of Britain’s general election on Dec. 12.  “Any move for Bethany needs to be properly planned, properly resourced, but, more importantly, properly transitioned,” he said. “You cannot just lift her on one day from a surrounding and drop her stone-cold into a new one,” he said, adding that she would need to learn to trust the staff, and they would need to learn how to work with her.  Since Jeremy started speaking to the British news media again in the last 10 days, there has been a dramatic change in Bethany’s care, he said. She is now allowed to go to the courtyard, sometimes for two to three hours a day. Harriet Harman, a lawmaker for the Labour Party and the chair of the parliamentary committee, said that regulators had failed to sufficiently check the system. “It has been left to the media and desperate, anguished parents to expose the brutal reality of our system of detention of people with learning disabilities or autism,” she said. “The horrific reality is of whole lives needlessly blighted, and families in despair.” The committee has recommended legal changes that would narrow the Mental Health Act criteria to lessen the risk of inappropriate detention. About one in 100 people in Britain have autism spectrum disorder, according to the N.H.S.  Jeremy, a former teacher who became a truck driver to devote more time to his daughter, is hopeful that, given the right support, Bethany will be able to lead “as near a normal life as anybody else.” “Beth wants to learn to drive, she wants to go to work, she wants to have relationships,” he said. “We just need to get her back into the community.”']","Matt Hancock, the British health secretary, publicly apologized to a teenager with autism who has spent close to three years in near total seclusion."
"Russian Professor, Found With Bag of Severed Arms, Admits He Killed Student",2019-11-11,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Oleg Sokolov, a Russian historian who made a career studying and impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte, liked to be called “Sire.” He also had a long history of seducing and being violent toward female students at a prestigious  university. “He thought he could do anything and looked down on the world around him as if he really were Napoleon,” said Lydia Nevzorova, the wife of a prominent Russian television personality who met Mr. Sokolov socially in St. Petersburg, Russia’s imperial-era capital. On Monday, however, the once haughty Mr. Sokolov, 63, sobbed uncontrollably as he appeared in a St. Petersburg court to express “deep repentance” for killing and dismembering his 24-year-old student and lover, Anastasia Yeshchenko. “I am devastated,” he said. On Saturday, Mr. Sokolov was fished out of the frigid Moika River in St. Petersburg — he had fallen in, drunk — along with a backpack containing the severed arms of Ms. Yeshchenko. A search of his apartment uncovered her decapitated corpse, and local news media said he had planned to dispose of his victim’s body parts in the river and then commit suicide, dressed as Napoleon, outside a St. Petersburg fortress. The gruesome saga, while echoing the dark passions of Russia’s second city explored by the 19th-century novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, has commanded huge attention in Russia as a very modern tale of crime and impunity. As former fans, including members of a military history society sponsored by the Kremlin, scrambled to distance themselves from Mr. Sokolov, Russia grappled with a troubling question: How did a man dogged for years by detailed accusations of violent bullying manage to keep his job as an assistant professor at St. Petersburg University, President Vladimir V. Putin’s alma mater and one of Russia’s most prestigious academic institutions? An online petition collected more than 20,000 signatures within minutes on Monday from Russians outraged that Mr. Sokolov had not been held to account earlier for his well-documented history of abuse. The petition demanded that university authorities be punished for failing to act on earlier complaints against him. These include a 2008 complaint by another female student turned lover, E.V. Ivanova, who detailed how Mr. Sokolov, furious that she wanted to end their relationship, had tied her to a chair in a rented Moscow apartment, beaten her repeatedly and threatened to disfigure her with a hot iron. She escaped and reported what she described as a murder attempt to the authorities. Nothing was done. Asked on Monday about the murder in St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the president had been informed about what he described as “this mad case.” Mr. Peskov said that “it looks like insanity,” adding that it was now up to investigators to determine whether anyone other than Mr. Sokolov was to blame. Many others, however, are blaming a law enforcement system that cracks down hard and swiftly on political opponents of the president but moves sluggishly, if at all, in response to reports of violence against women and other crimes. Alena Popova, a Russian campaigner against domestic violence, said in an angry statement posted on Facebook that Ms. Yeshchenko would not have been killed if Mr. Sokolov had been held responsible for his past abusive behavior. “If an abuser is certain that he can do everything, that ‘they will get him off even for murder,’ he will go berserk. We must not wait until a victim is killed, but prevent violence,” Ms. Popova said. There was also outrage over reports that Mr. Sokolov’s lawyer, Alexander Pochuyev, wanted to get his client to plead temporary insanity, which could limit his time in jail to just three years — less than the sentence recently handed down against a middle-aged Muscovite convicted of taking part in an illegal protest against Mr. Putin. The lawyer told Interfax, a Russian news agency, that Mr. Sokolov had confessed to murder but had killed his student “under some sort of strong influence.” In a brief court appearance on Monday, however, Mr. Sokolov indicated that he would claim self-defense, not insanity. The court ordered that he be held in custody until January. Fontanka, a St. Petersburg news site, reported that the historian told the court that Ms. Yeshchenko, with whom he had lived for several years and co-authored articles about Napoleon, had flown into a rage after being told that Mr. Sokolov would need to spend the weekend with his children.  “I have never seen such a stream of aggression,” he said, referring to an alleged “attack with a knife.” Russian police officers and judges are often sympathetic to claims by men accused of abuse that they were provoked into violence by their girlfriends or wives. Despairing of their country’s own legal system, in recent months Russian women have increasingly turned to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. The court, in its first such decision, this summer ruled in favor of a Russian woman, Valeriya Volodina, who had complained that police officers repeatedly ignored her pleas for protection from a violent former boyfriend. The Investigative Committee, Russia’s version of the F.B.I., released a video on Monday that showed a man said to be Mr. Sokolov crossing a dark street with a garbage bag containing some of Ms. Yeschchenko’s remains and then tossing it into the river. It also showed his apartment — filled with books, old military uniforms and other Napoleonic paraphernalia — and a sawed-off shotgun found there, which is believed to have been used to kill her. Mr. Sokolov has been accused of violence against male students, too. When a student asked him during a public lecture last year about plagiarism claims by a rival Napoleon expert, the historian ordered burly young men in the audience to drag the questioner from the lecture hall. The student said he was beaten and complained to the university, which declined to discipline Mr. Sokolov. After surviving years of scandal, however, Mr. Sokolov, who was awarded France’s Legion of Honor in 2003, has now been abandoned by even his strongest supporters. The Russian Military Historical Society, headed by Russia’s culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, removed Mr. Sokolov from its scientific council. The society, created by a Kremlin order in 2012, has played a leading role in promoting a nationalistic — and, critics say, highly slanted — version of Russian history. A French organization founded by a far-right politician, Marion Maréchal, a former member of Parliament and the niece of Marine Le Pen, the right-wing nationalist leader, announced over the weekend that Mr. Sokolov had been stripped of his membership of its own scientific committee. The organization, the Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics, was set up in 2018 by Ms. Maréchal, who visited St. Petersburg earlier this year to explore cooperation with Mr. Sokolov’s university. Ms. Nevzorova said she was not qualified to judge whether the historian was medically insane but added that he had always struck her as very strange and at times seemed to believe that he really was Napoleon.  “The dividing line between Napoleon and Sokolov disappeared a long time ago,” she said. “How did such a person keep his position? Who has been protecting him and why?” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.']","Oleg Sokolov, a Russian historian known for impersonating Napoleon, was dogged for years by complaints of abuse.

"Nigel Farage, Brexit Party Leader, Lends Hand to Boris Johnson. Mostly.",2019-11-11,By Stephen Castle,"['In a tactical retreat that could have important ramifications, Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s populist Brexit Party, on Monday promised not to run candidates in areas held by the ruling Conservatives. The move was expected to bolster Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s prospects in a topsy-turvy general election next month. Mr. Farage had been under pressure from his own supporters who worried that, by splitting the pro-Brexit vote, he might deprive Mr. Johnson of the victory he needs to pull Britain quickly out of the European Union.  However, the Brexit Party is still planning to fight seats currently held by the opposition Labour Party, and in doing so could draw away Conservative voters in the electoral battlegrounds of the middle and north of England. The Conservatives desperately need to grab Labour seats in areas there that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. So, while the partial pact helps the Conservatives, analysts do not think it will do so enough to decide the outcome of an election likely to determine whether Britain leaves the European Union at the end of January, as Mr. Johnson wishes, or holds another Brexit referendum next year.  Mr. Farage, who formerly led the U.K. Independence Party, has failed seven times to win a seat in the British Parliament, and said earlier this month that he would not make an eighth attempt himself, but would instead campaign in support of candidates around the country.  That will now be in significantly fewer parliamentary constituencies. “The Brexit party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservatives won at the last election,” Mr. Farage said in Hartlepool, a struggling town in the northeast of England that voted to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. “We will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party,” he said. The Brexit Party will also take on smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats that oppose withdrawal from the European Union, he said. Britain operates a winner-takes-all system for general elections with members of Parliament elected when they have the highest vote in a constituency. Mr. Farage had threatened to contest around 600 seats but on Monday said that he had been reassured by a “change of direction” from Mr. Johnson, who has ruled out any extension, beyond the end of 2020, of talks on future trade ties with the European Union. Most analysts predict that it would take significantly longer to put in place a trade agreement, and Britain has retained the right to extend the negotiations. This would mean staying under European Union trade rules and paying into the bloc. Though it helps Mr. Johnson, it is unclear how big a difference the Brexit Party leader’s new tactic will make. Analysts believe it could allow the Tories to hold more of the seats in south and west of the country where the centrist, anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats are challenging. The worry for Mr. Johnson was that, in these areas, the Brexit Party would siphon off some of his Conservative voters, providing the Liberal Democrats with a path to victory. But Mr. Farage will not help Mr. Johnson in the crucial electoral battleground, the so-called red wall of seats in the middle and north of England where a majority voted for Brexit. In these areas, where the Labour Party is strong, the Conservatives need to make gains — and Mr. Farage’s Brexit Party gives traditional Labour voters who want to leave the European Union an alternative to the Tories. It was never likely that Brexit Party, formed earlier this year, would have been able to make a credible challenge all around the country. The tactical retreat helps it concentrate its firepower.  Mr. Johnson told Sky News he had “absolutely not” made a deal with Mr. Farage, but did say he was “glad that there is a recognition that there is only one way to get Brexit done, and that is to vote for the Conservatives.” Critics seized on the Brexit Party’s announcement to suggest that the two parties were now umbilically tied. “A vote for Boris Johnson’s Conservatives is a vote for Nigel Farage’s politics,” wrote Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, on Twitter. Nick Boles, a lawmaker who was expelled from the Conservative Party for opposing Mr. Johnson’s Brexit policy, wrote that “there are millions of Conservative Remainers who, like me, were willing to back a soft Brexit. How will they react on discovering that Johnson’s Brexit deal is hard enough for Nigel Farage?” Ducking out of a national campaign means the Brexit Party can expect less media coverage than its bigger competitors. And Mr. Farage’s decision could increase pressure for anti-Brexit parties to increase their cooperation. So far, the smaller anti-Brexit parties have agreed to work together in a limited number of regions, though Labour — which is not committed to remaining in the European Union but wants a second referendum — has stood aloof. Patrick English, an associate lecturer at the University of Exeter, said Mr. Farage’s decision left  an uncertain picture.  “Brexit Party candidates standing in Labour-held Conservative targets will make it much harder for Johnson to flip them,” he said. “Therefore, Johnson’s quest for a majority still remains very much up in the air despite this announcement.” ']",Mr. Farage won’t run candidates in seats held by Mr. Johnson’s Tories. But his party may still hurt the Tories in other races. 
Military Calls on President to Step Down After Election Dispute in Bolivia,2019-11-10,"By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Mónica Machicao and Ernesto Londoño","['Bolivia’s military chief on Sunday called on President Evo Morales to resign, dealing what was likely a fatal blow to his efforts to cling to power in the face of widespread unrest over last month’s fraud-marred presidential elections.  The commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, said the military chiefs believed Mr. Morales should step down to restore “peace and stability and for the good of our Bolivia.”  Earlier in the day, facing mounting opposition from political rivals, mutinous police groups and outraged protesters, Mr. Morales called for a new election. It was an extraordinary concession in the face of mounting evidence of electoral fraud — but it appeared to accomplish little.  Unappeased, demonstrators and opposition leaders renewed demands that Mr. Morales step down.  “Mr. Evo has ruptured the constitutional order — he needs to leave,” said Luis Fernando Camacho, one of the main protest leaders. The president’s hold on power appeared more and more tenuous as the day drew on. Several leading figures in his party resigned, and the military launched operations that appeared intended to protect protesters from violent bands of Morales supporters who have killed several protesters and wounded scores.  [Update: Bolivian senator Jeanine Añez Chavez has declared herself leader.] Mr. Morales, the first Indigenous president in a country where two-thirds of the population is Indigenous, has been in power longer than any other current head of state in Latin America. Once widely popular, he has become increasingly authoritarian. But over the weekend, the power he had amassed since coming to office in 2006 appeared to be slipping out of his hands. As protesters occupied the streets, the disarray edged close to his inner circles, with senior figures in his own party resigning and even police officers switching sides. The unrest has turned Bolivia into the latest flash point in a series of upheavals that have shaken Latin America over the last month. In Bolivia, the president’s pleas for peace have done little to quell the violence.  In recent days, evidence has mounted that Mr. Morales’ party rigged last month’s presidential election. But even before the vote was cast, the opposition was accusing the president of acting illegally by changing the Constitution so he could run for an unprecedented fourth term. The Organization of American States, which monitored the Oct. 20 election, issued a preliminary report on Sunday that outlined irregularities and said the vote should be annulled. Carlos Mesa, the former president who came in second in the disputed election, has said that the country’s political parties should come together and organize a new vote. On Sunday, he lashed out at the president and the vice president on Sunday for “this fraud, and the social unrest that has led to several deaths and hundreds of people wounded.” Michael Kozak, the top diplomat at the State Department overseeing Latin America policy on Sunday endorsed the call for a new election. “All those implicated in the flawed process should step down,” he wrote on Twitter, without addressing the question of whether Mr. Morales should be eligible to run again. Demonstrations calling for the president to step down and allow for new elections appeared to reach critical mass on Saturday, when groups of police officers across the country broke ranks with the government and joined anti-government protests.  In his televised address Sunday, Mr. Morales called for peace and said he would replace the Electoral Tribunal and hold a new vote, though he did not specify a date. The opposition had accused the tribunal favoring Mr. Morales and taking part in election fraud. Mr. Morales said the new election would be a “vote that will allow the Bolivian people to democratically elect their new leaders, incorporating new political actors.” “I want to ask everyone to lower all the tension,” he said. But in Bolivia’s snowballing crisis, Mr. Morales’s offer was overtaken by events just hours later, when the formerly loyal Attorney General’s Office said it had begun investigating the Electoral Tribunal for ballot fraud. Local television then showed images of police rounding up electoral officials. Martha Yujra, a member of a workers union in El Alto, the municipality adjacent to La Paz that had been a traditional Morales stronghold, said Sunday that protesters would remain in the streets until Mr. Morales steps down. “He has to resign,” she said. “He can’t call for a new election.” Mr. Morales’ speech came hours after the Organization of American States released its preliminary report outlining widespread irregularities.  The O.A.S. report bolsters the widely held view among Bolivians critical of Mr. Morales that the president and his allies, facing the toughest electoral battle since he came to power in 2006, engaged in a concerted effort to rig the vote. Election officials said Mr. Morales received slightly more votes than he needed on Oct. 20 to avoid a runoff. But the legitimacy of that victory was called into question almost immediately because that finding contradicted early results, which showed he had not won by more than 10 percentage points, the threshold needed for a runoff. The company that provided vote-counting machines for the election also disavowed the results. By Saturday night, the unrest had spread to Mr. Morales’s stronghold of El Alto, where government supporters and protesters clashed on the streets, according to local news reports. In the countryside, where Mr. Morales remains popular with poor farmers, government supporters blocked and attacked with stones and firearms several caravans of protesters heading to demonstrations in La Paz.  Calla Hummel, a political scientist at the University of Miami who has done extensive field research in Bolivia, said Mr. Morales was unlikely to weather this crisis.  “His actions have undermined his reputation as a democratic leader,” Ms. Hummel said on Sunday. “The opposition is now more unified and mobilized now than the disparate groups were during the election.” Ms. Hummel said the military’s hands-off approach — at least until now — was unsurprising, because the generals fear being dragged into the kind of street clashes that roiled the country in 2003. In the aftermath of those confrontations, several soldiers were prosecuted for killing demonstrators. “The military does not want to be handed this situation,” Ms. Hummel said. “Anything is possible in Bolivia right now, but a military coup is very, very unlikely.” Cesar Del Castillo contributed reporting.']","Evo Morales defied term limits to run for president again last month, then declared victory in an election widely seen as rigged."
Iraq Cracks Down on Protests as Prime Minister Gains Support,2019-11-09,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['Iraqi security forces moved Saturday to take ground back from anti-government demonstrators in Baghdad, forcing a confrontation that turned violent and filled the streets with careening vehicles rushing the wounded to first aid stations and hospitals.  The melee, which killed six people on Saturday, followed blanket crackdowns in the southern city of Basra on Friday and in the shrine city of Karbala. As the Iraqi government pushed broadly to constrain the protests, it sought in Baghdad, the capital, to restrict them to a smaller public space.  However, with more than 100 people injured, the mounting casualties could make that tactic backfire, and draw back to the streets those protesters who had begun to go home. “What has been taken by force, we will take back by force,” said Mohammed Juhi, a civil society activist whose organization — I Am Here to Take My Rights — has been on the front line since the demonstrations began in October.  “I do not know why the government and international community have not responded to us,” he added. The demonstrators are demanding a change in the system of government. They would like a presidential system instead of a parliamentary one, no more corruption and the end of political parties as well as the division of ministries among them.  The repressive moves angered the influential Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. He had been careful until now to calibrate his encouragement of the demonstrators, many of whom are from Sadr City, a vast slum in eastern Baghdad which is a wellspring of support for the Sadr family.  Some of his supporters have been disappointed at the moderate tone of his previous messages. But Mr. al-Sadr has hesitated to confront other Shiite leaders, many of whom support the prime minister and his Shiite-dominated government. However, he is unambivalently opposed to Iraqi security forces’ shooting Iraqi protesters. Five of those killed were hit by live ammunition, The Associated Press reported, while the sixth died after being shot in the head with a tear-gas canister. “Sayid Moqtada Sadr wants people to exercise their right to protest, to say what they want,” said Sheikh Saleh al-Obeidi, his spokesman. “Regarding the massacre that happened today in Baghdad and yesterday in Basra — the killing in cold blood with live bullets — there’s no justification for it.” In Basra, a Sadr stronghold, the security forces also burned the tents of demonstrators near the provincial council building, effectively demolishing the main sign of their presence.  It was not yet clear whether Mr. al-Sadr would call on his supporters to come to Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protests in Baghdad. But his statements appeared to be inching toward that — an outcome that could add considerable manpower and energy to those who have been protesting for weeks.  The backdrop to the security force offensive is a newfound clarity on the part of the Shiite political elite and allied groups regarding support for Prime Minister Adil Mehdi.  Three weeks ago, Mr. Medhi was on the brink of resigning. Every day brought new discussions of what would happen if he left and how his successor might be chosen.  As the protests became entrenched and broadened, the political parties with parliamentary blocs began to look hard at possible candidates to replace him. Both Iran and the United States — two countries that have been heavily involved in Iraq since the 2003 fall of Saddam Hussein — weighed in.  Although the two countries could hardly be more different in their foreign policy in Iraq, they both feared a vacuum and found none of the other candidates terribly appealing.  Earlier this week, at a meeting of most of the political blocs, almost everyone agreed to support Mr. Mehdi for the foreseeable future, said Izzat Shahbendar, an informal adviser to Mr. Mehdi who has been trying to open the way for discussions between the protesters and the government.  “Now Adil Mehdi feels bolstered; he’s encouraged to stay,” Mr. Shahbendar said. “Who would he resign for? It would be chaos if he resigned.” It remains unclear whether Mr. Mehdi is up to the job of charting a course to resolve the demonstrations constructively. The security force pushback on Saturday night appeared designed to shrink the demonstrations, but without offering protesters a reason to retreat, it seemed more likely to strengthen antagonism toward the government.  “From the protesters’ point of view, it is a now-or-never situation,” said Abbas Kadhim, who leads the Atlantic Council’s Iraqi Initiative. “They have invested so much — so much in lives and injuries — and they are afraid if they go home, they will get nothing.”  The government, for its part, wants the country to remain functional. It has already lost millions of dollars because of the protesters’ closing of the port at Um Qasr, which ships much of Iraq’s crude oil.  “The only way for it to end is for the government to be creative and give the demonstrators something they can go home with, and they also need to bring in a third party to be the guarantor of the agreement,” Mr. Kadhim said.  But with every person killed, it gets harder to bridge the gap.  “As much as they try to oppress us, we are just as determined to resist them,” said Mohammed Qassim Mohammed, 25, an engineering student who was protesting near a bridge in Baghdad that the security forces retook on Saturday. One of those killed was a friend his age, he said.  “Is this acceptable to the government or the international community that a 25-year-old man would be killed asking for his rights?”  he asked, adding, “I have decided from today that even if all the protesters return home, I will not return until I get my rights and the rights for my friend.”  Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","With six demonstrators killed, the government’s tough tactic could backfire.

Australian Fire Officials Say the Worst Is Yet to Come,2019-11-11,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — More than 85 fires burned across Australia’s east coast on Tuesday, 40 of them out of control, as officials warned that catastrophic conditions would worsen through the afternoon and evening, with intensifying winds blowing flames toward larger cities and towns.  More than 100,000 homes are at risk over the coming days as a combination of drought, heat and blustery winds bears down on New South Wales, the country’s most populated state.  “The conditions are expected to get worse,” Shane Fitzsimmons, the Rural Fire Service commissioner, said on Tuesday afternoon in Sydney. “There’s still a way to go before they reach the potential of the forecast.”  “Complacency kills,” he added. “We cannot afford to be complacent.”  The fires, which began burning in earnest over the weekend, have caused four deaths and destroyed more than 150 properties, with a handful more added every few hours.  Maps from fire officials showing the areas likely to burn showed blazes potentially doubling in size over the next 24 hours, with Coffs Harbour, a coastal city of 70,000 people, looking especially vulnerable, along with Sydney’s outer suburbs.  And as an especially hot day wore on, with temperatures far above seasonal norms, the fires also continued to set off emotional arguments about climate change.  A day after the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said that only leftist “lunatics” were linking the blazes to climate change, mayors from the areas already burning demanded that lawmakers pay attention to common-sense science and public outrage. “They need to get out and have a real look at what’s happening to this country,” said Claire Pontin, the deputy mayor of the MidCoast Council.  Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, where two people died over the weekend, said: “It is not a political thing — it is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. I think that Michael McCormack needs to read the science.” Across the region, the day began with preparations for the increased fire risk.  More than 600 schools and education centers across New South Wales, and a number in neighboring Queensland, canceled classes Tuesday. Several other schools evacuated students Tuesday as the threat of fire approached. Commissioner Fitzsimmons said there were around 100 aircraft ready to help the roughly 1,500 firefighters already posted at blazes across New South Wales. The equipment includes Australian Defense Force helicopters that will fly night missions over Sydney and the wider area to help firefighter movement and possible civilian rescues. Some larger planes have come from California under a sharing deal that’s been in place since 2001.  In Sydney’s suburbs near the Blue Mountains, where a devastating fire destroyed hundreds of homes and left two people dead in 2013, residents reported packing their cars with clothes, water and essentials in case they needed to flee. Farther north, where fires continued to rage, evacuation centers have been filling up with residents fleeing to safety.  Conditions were expected to ease somewhat on Wednesday in New South Wales, with temperatures cooling and winds slowing, but the fire threat was expected to remain for several days.  An omen for the current fire season came in September, when a historic lodge in a rain forest burned nearly to the ground. The areas where fires were raging as of Tuesday morning, north of Sydney near Port Macquarie and the Queensland border, have been suffering from a lengthy drought. But scientists note that moisture levels of live trees and shrubs around Sydney are also at record lows — even lower than the levels during the Black Christmas fires of 2001, which destroyed more than 500 buildings on the edge of Sydney and burned for three weeks. Given the drier-than-normal conditions, there is fuel both on the ground, with dry leaves, and in the branches of trees that are dying or dead. And if something ignites, high winds threaten to carry the flames far and wide.  On Tuesday, the federal Bureau of Meteorology reported that winds were already starting to reach 70 kilometers per hour, or 43 miles per hour, with gusts in excess of 90 kilometers per hour.  “It’s not just out in the bush, because many people in cities are right on that edge,” said Lesley Hughes, a biology professor at Macquarie University who works with the Climate Council of Australia. “Everybody loves to live in the bush and around the bush — it’s becoming an increasingly dangerous place.” Despite several months of mass protests drawing attention to the Australian public’s concerns about climate change, the country’s deputy prime minister on Monday dismissed questions about its role in the fires.  In an interview with ABC Radio National, the official, Michael McCormack, said it “galls” him when people raise climate change in relation to bush fires. He said global warming was a concern of “raving inner-city lunatics.” Scientists, firefighters and mayors immediately responded. Many pointed out the clear connections between climate change and the extended and more intense fire seasons in Australia, California and other places around the world.  “Fires are burning in places and at intensities never before experienced,” Greg Mullins, a former fire and rescue commissioner in New South Wales, wrote in an op-ed article for The Sydney Morning Herald, citing rain forests in northern New South Wales, tropical areas of Queensland and the “formerly wet old-growth forests” of Tasmania.  He also said that thunderstorms caused by fires — known as “pyro-convective” events — were rare in the past but were now happening regularly.  Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and writer from the Australian National University, said it was clear that “there’s a human fingerprint on the temperature increases since 1950 — all the weather patterns are occurring in a planet that is warming and warming because of human activity.” By dismissing the role of climate change, she said, the government was choosing immediate disaster response over long-term needs.  “We’re really missing the opportunity to prepare for future life in Australia,” Dr. Gergis said.  “It’s going to be a lot warmer, and we’re going to see a lot of prevalence of extreme fire conditions,” she added. “The further we kick the can down the road and avoid these conversations, we’re really missing the opportunity to get the Australian public ready for what is upon us.” Jamie Tarabay, Isabella Kwai and Sasha Gattermayr contributed reporting.']","Dozens of blazes, many of them out of control, are burning from the Sydney suburbs to areas hundreds of miles north around Byron Bay."
Roman Polanski Accused of 1975 Rape,2019-11-09,By Liz Alderman and Elian Peltier,"['PARIS — A French photographer has accused the director Roman Polanski of violently raping her in 1975 in his ski chalet in Switzerland when she was 18, adding to the list of several women who have publicly accused Mr. Polanski of sexually abusing them as teenagers. The director, who is preparing to release a film on Wednesday dealing with themes of injustice, “firmly denied” the latest accusation, his lawyer said. In a letter published online Friday by the French newspaper Le Parisien, the photographer, Valentine Monnier, 62, said she was breaking 44 years of silence after a recent interview by Mr. Polanski. In it, the director suggested that he was a victim of persecution, like the main subject of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish military officer wrongly convicted of treason in what remains France’s most notorious miscarriage of justice. “Is it credible to hear somebody say, ‘I accuse’ when they have branded you and forbidden you, the victim, to accuse him?” Ms. Monnier said in an interview published by the same newspaper.  A lawyer for Mr. Polanski, Hervé Temime, said on Saturday: “For 45 years, these accusations have never been reported to judicial authorities. I strongly deplore their publication a few days before the release of his film.” Ms. Monnier told Le Parisien that she went to Mr. Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, in the winter of 1975 with friends, but had not known him personally. When the group went skiing, she said, he propositioned her in vulgar terms while they were seated together on a ski lift, and she declined. Later that evening, after returning to the chalet from dinner, Mr. Polanski called her upstairs, she said. “Life had not yet trained me to be suspicious,” she told the paper. When Ms. Monnier arrived on the top landing, she continued, Mr. Polanski emerged naked and threw himself on her, striking her, tearing off her clothes and then raping her. “I was totally shocked,” she told the paper. “I weighed 50 kilos. Polanski was small but muscular and at 42 was in the prime of his life. He got the upper hand in two minutes.” She said she remembered fearing she would die. “I said to myself, this is Roman Polanski. He can’t take the risk that this would be known, so he will have to kill me.”  Mr. Polanski later apologized to her in tears, she said. Ms. Monnier said she wanted to speak publicly in order to bring an end to “idolizing the guilty ones.” Mr. Polanski has lived in France since 1978, when he fled the United States before sentencing after pleading guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. Because the statute of limitations for rape is 20 years in France, her accusation cannot lead to an investigation or prosecution. “I denounce this crime knowing that there can’t be any punishment, in an attempt to end exceptions, impunity,” she said in Le Parisien. In an email to The New York Times on Saturday, Ms. Monnier declined to comment further. Le Parisien reported that it had spoken with members of Ms. Monnier’s entourage, including a close friend, family members and her then-boyfriend, who corroborated her story. Mr. Polanski’s new film, known in English as “An Officer and a Spy,” is titled “J’Accuse” in French, after the famous open letter in which the writer Émile Zola accused the French establishment of anti-Semitism and deception over the jailing of Dreyfus. In an interview published in August with a French writer discussing “An Officer and a Spy,” which is scheduled to be released in French theaters in the coming week, Mr. Polanski said: “There are moments of this story that I feel I’ve lived myself.  “Every season there’s a new accusation, a new absurd story from a woman I’ve never seen in my life and who accuses me of things that supposedly happened a half century ago.”  In 2017, a German former actress, Renate Langer, accused Mr. Polanski of raping her in 1972, when she was 15, also in his Gstaad chalet. Swiss prosecutors declined to pursue a rape investigation in that case, citing statute of limitations laws. Mr. Polanski has also been accused of sexual abuse by the British actress Charlotte Lewis, who said in 2010 that the director abused her in 1983, when she was 16; and by a woman publicly identified only as Robin, who in 2017 said that he had “sexually victimized” her in 1973, when she was 16.  Also in 2017, an artist, Marianne Barnard, accused Mr. Polanski of molesting her in 1975, when she was 10. The director said at the time that he rejected the “unfounded allegations.” He remains wanted in the United States over the case involving the 13-year-old, Samantha Geimer, but France does not extradite its citizens. Judges have denied multiple requests from the director to drop the decades-old case. Feminist groups in France have regularly staged protests against Mr. Polanski, including outside a retrospective of his career at the prestigious Cinémathèque in October 2017. Although Ms. Monnier first spoke publicly on Friday, she had long made her story known to those close to her, she told Le Parisien. She said she also written about her accusation to France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, to the culture minister and to the junior minister for gender equality, Marlène Schiappa, in 2018. Ms. Schiappa, in turn, wrote a letter to Ms. Monnier in March of that year, which The New York Times has obtained. In the letter, she praised Ms. Monnier for “breaking a 42-year-old silence,” and said she empathized with her pain, adding, “I understand your indignation.”  Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Elian Peltier from London.']",A French photographer said the director hit her and assaulted her when she was 18. She is the sixth woman to publicly accuse him of sexual abuse.
"James Le Mesurier, Backer of Syrian White Helmets, Is Found Dead in Turkey",2019-11-11,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — A British man who was a critical player in creating and sustaining the Syrian civil defense group known as the White Helmets was found dead in Istanbul on Monday, a group official said. The Briton, James Le Mesurier, was the founder and director of Mayday Rescue, a nonprofit group that has supported, funded and trained the White Helmets, a volunteer group that has gained international renown for rescuing wounded civilians during Syria’s civil war. Mr. Le Mesurier’s body was found early Monday in the Beyoglu neighborhood of Istanbul, outside a building where he kept an apartment and office, said Raed Saleh, the lead organizer of the White Helmets. “James was a real friend, and it’s a big loss,” Mr. Saleh said. He said that Mr. Le Mesurier’s wife had told the organization about his death. “His death doesn’t mean the White Helmets will stop,” he added. “It will continue.” The circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Le Mesurier, who has been the target of repeated online disinformation campaigns about his ties to the White Helmets, were unclear Monday afternoon. Turkish news outlets reported that the police suspected he had died after falling from a height.  The Istanbul authorities said they had started an investigation. Mr. Le Mesurier, a former British soldier and intelligence officer, arrived in Turkey in late 2012 as the Syrian civil war was raging across the border, hoping to help establish emergency response and civil police groups in areas held by rebels fighting to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad. He created Mayday Rescue, which took volunteers from Syria to southern Turkey for medical and emergency response training, provided them with equipment and supplied financial support. According to its website, Mayday, a nonprofit group, receives funding from the United Nations and international donors including Britain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States and the Qatar Fund for Development. The volunteers formed Syria Civil Defense, which came to be known as the White Helmets, with the aim of providing lifesaving services in areas that were being bombed and shelled, like operating ambulances, fighting fires, and clearing rubble and ordnance. After Russia threw its air force behind Mr. al-Assad in 2015, the White Helmets’ work in the aftermath of Russian airstrikes drew international attention, becoming the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary in 2016. The group has won several humanitarian awards. After documenting and publicizing Russian and Syrian government strikes — including chemical attacks against rebel-held areas for which Western governments blamed Mr. al-Assad — the group became the target of sustained disinformation campaigns, often repeated and amplified by the Kremlin. Unfounded conspiracy theories latched onto the White Helmets’ foreign funding and ties to Mr. Le Mesurier, and held that the rescuers were a Qaeda-linked terrorist group responsible for staging the very same chemical attacks. As recently as Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry sowed doubt about Mr. Le Mesurier’s background as a British intelligence officer, saying on Twitter that he “has been spotted all around the world” and that Mr. Le Mesurier’s “connections to terrorist groups were reported back to his mission in #Kosovo.” A week earlier, the ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, had accused the White Helmets, “together with terrorists,” of “plotting to stage new chemical weapons ‘incidents’” in Syria, according to a tweet from the Russian Embassy in London. Perhaps sensitive to such accusations, Mr. Saleh insisted on Monday that Mr. Le Mesurier had not founded the White Helmets, despite Mr. Le Mesurier’s role in conceiving, financing and training the Syrian volunteers. Mayday Rescue did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London declined to comment, saying it did not confirm the deaths of British nationals.

"Court Backs Hindus on Ayodhya, Handing Modi Victory in His Bid to Remake India",2019-11-09,By Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — India’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hindus on Saturday in a decades-old dispute over a holy site contested by Muslims, handing the prime minister and his followers a major victory in their quest to remake the country as Hindu and shift it further from its secular foundation. The ruling greenlighted construction of a Hindu temple on a site where a mosque had stood before Hindu devotees destroyed it in 1992 with sledgehammers and their bare hands. The demolition of the Babri Mosque in the city of Ayodhya set the tone for sectarian tensions that haunt India today.  The prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party swept India’s elections in May by campaigning on a Hindu nationalist agenda, and the court case became an emotionally charged flash point. The party cast its quest to build a temple as a key step in establishing India as Hindu, wiping away centuries of oppression at the hands of the Muslim Mughal Empire and British colonialists.  Many Hindus believe that the disputed site was the birthplace of their revered god Ram and that an earlier temple was demolished during Mughal rule to build the mosque. The case has been in Indian courts since the 1950s, but when it reached the Supreme Court in 2010, the deity Ram was given legal standing, awkwardly pitting the god Hindus revere most against the country’s Muslim population. Many of India’s Muslims fear that the court’s decision will relegate them to second-class citizenship and empower Hindu extremists. Though many appeared to accept the ruling with sullen resignation, they see an India where mob lynchings of Muslims are seldom condemned by the government and where members of the governing party are implicated in sectarian violence. Mr. Modi tried to calm those fears in an address to the nation on Saturday night. “Today’s message is to unite, to associate and to live together,” Mr. Modi said. “In the new India, fear, animosity and negativity should have no place.”  In its highly anticipated ruling, the five-judge panel unanimously decided that the sliver of barren land in question — barely three acres — would be placed in a government-run trust. The decision allows Hindus to construct a temple, which they have planned since the Babri Mosque was destroyed.  The court also ruled that Muslims would be given five acres to build a mosque at a prominent site in Ayodhya, the town at the center of the dispute, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. When the Babri Mosque was demolished by Hindu extremists, it set off riots across the country that killed around 2,000 people in some of the worst violence India had seen since its bloody partition in 1947. In place of the mosque, Hindus erected a tent resembling a temple, which still stands and draws thousands of tourists every day. The mosque was built in the 1500s during Mughal rule, a period that many right-wing Hindus believe serves as a reminder of their humiliation under Muslim occupation. Although sites like the Taj Mahal — also built under the Mughals — are considered famous symbols of India, right-wing Hindus see them as testaments to past oppression.  Some Hindu nationalists want to erase that history and replace it with symbols that reinforce India as a Hindu nation. About 80 percent of India’s population is Hindu. “Post the independence of our country, we have erased all the symbols of British imperialism,” said Ram Madhav, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. “The names of our roads have been changed, the statues of Queen Elizabeth and all of them have been removed.” India should undergo a similar exorcism of certain symbols of Mughal rule, including the Babri Mosque, Mr. Madhav said, calling the 300-year reign of the Mughal Muslim emperors “cruel.”  “It’s as simple as that,” he said. “This is not about religion. We are not against any religion. India is one of the most religiously diverse places in the world.” When the Supreme Court announced its decision, lawyers outside the court yelled, “Hail Lord Ram” while Hindu devotees blew conch shell horns, a celebratory tradition.  In Ayodhya, just yards from the disputed site, Indian sadhus shouted, “Praise mother India,” while devotees passed out sweets to mark the victory. But not all pockets of Ayodhya were filled with jubilation.  Much of the town’s Muslims kept off the streets and tried to keep their heads down. Some appeared to hope that now that the decades-long court decision had been settled, the sectarian tensions that have become a way of life in Ayodhya would finally ease. Iqbal Ansari, a resident of Ayodhya whose father was a litigant in the case and had demanded the Babri Mosque be restored, said he welcomed the decision and hoped it would end years of sectarian strife. “We should stop seeing each other from the religious prism,” he said. “The court’s verdict is final, and we will not appeal against it.”  Mr. Modi’s government praised the ruling but was quick to call for unity and warned Hindus against boisterous celebrations for fear they would set off clashes. While India under Mr. Modi has adopted a Hindu tilt, the prime minister has also focused on raising India’s profile on the international stage.  Officials in Delhi have been dismayed by the persistent news coverage of India’s sectarian disharmony, including antigovernment protests in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was stripped of its autonomy in August.  In the hours after Saturday’s ruling, India’s Muslims were divided between those who want to contest the decision and those who want to move on for the sake of sectarian harmony. Those who want to contest it have come to see the restoration of the Babri Mosque as a proclamation of Muslims’ place in India, and they fear that more religious sites will be targeted for destruction. After the court announced its verdict, senior government officials were quick to call journalists in and promise — anonymously — that no more mosques would be destroyed and that they, too, wanted to move on and focus on building the nation. Before this year’s election, Mr. Modi promised to deliver ambitious growth, to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. But growth so far has been sluggish, with unemployment reaching a 45-year high.  “There is short-term fear about communal tensions,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s South Asia program. “The soil is pretty fertile for conflict.” “The longer term fear,” he added, “is do Muslims and other minorities of India begin to feel resigned to a permanent status as second-class citizens? The genius of India in the way it was constructed is that it avoided that tension eating away at the state, unlike its neighbors.”  The ruling comes just three months after Mr. Modi’s government achieved another goal written into his party’s manifesto by stripping the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir of its autonomy, increasing central government control over the territory, which Pakistan also claims.  Many in the B.J.P. say they believe that Muslims and other minorities in India, including Christians, have been given a special status that has set them apart from their Hindu peers, creating a nation with a tiered structure that they would like to flatten. Hindu temples, for example, are controlled by the government, while Christians and Muslims control their own churches and mosques.  Ahead of the verdict, schools were shut and 4,000 security officers were deployed to the area in case of sectarian violence. Rallies were banned, shops barred from selling kerosene and people prevented from collecting bricks or stones.  A rush of Hindu pilgrims had visited Ayodhya ahead of the verdict. Sudarshan Jain and his family, pilgrims from Rajasthan, a state hundreds of miles away, visited an open-air workshop where craftsmen chiseled floral designs and figurines of Ram on pink sandstone slabs that will form the temple. Its first floor is ready to be fixed in place, the craftsmen said. Hindus from around the world have donated hundreds of bricks carved with the inscription “Sri Ram,” hoping that the court would rule in favor of building the temple. The bricks have sat in organized piles next to the contested site, numbered and ready to be fixed and shaped into a temple, which devotees say can be constructed within hours once they get the green light.  “These are not stones, but feelings of millions of Hindus,” Mr. Jain said. “Now the dream is going to be a reality.” Sitting in the courtyard of his home in Ayodhya, Haji Mahboob Ahmad, a litigant who had wanted the mosque to be rebuilt, said that Muslims would accept a ruling against them but that he feared that right-wing Hindu forces would be emboldened and more mosques would be destroyed. “Violence against Muslims will rise, and it will become institutionalized,” said Mr. Ahmad, 75, who had to flee the town for a month after the mosque was demolished nearly 30 years ago. Maria Abi-Habib reported from New Delhi, and Sameer Yasir from Ayodhya, India. Suhasini Raj and Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.

U.K. Scholars Back Cambridge Researcher’s Efforts to Avoid Deportation,2019-11-11,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — Britain’s academic community has mobilized in support of a Cambridge University scholar whose request for permanent residency was denied, she says, because she spent too much time outside of the country working on her doctoral thesis.  The scholar, Asiya Islam, a junior research fellow in the University of Cambridge’s sociology department who has lived legally in Britain for a decade, is facing the prospect of being ejected from the country by the end of January. More than 1,000 professors, lecturers and Ph.D. candidates have signed an open letter to the Home Office — the government department that handles immigration, security, and law enforcement — urging that the decision be reconsidered. Ms. Islam says the time she spent abroad was essential to her academic research. Britain’s immigration rules require that people applying for the type of permanent residency she sought — also called indefinite leave to remain — spend no more than 180 days at a time or 540 days in total outside of the country over the course of a decade. Ms. Islam spent nearly a year in New Delhi between 2016 and 2017 doing research for her doctoral thesis, and despite supplying letters from Cambridge affirming that her fieldwork was necessary for her studies, the Home Office ruled that she had “failed to provide any exceptional reasons” to support a time-abroad exemption. Instead, she was told in a letter that the 647 days she had spent outside of Britain over the past 10 years — of which 330 were for her Ph.D. research — meant she had surpassed the limit, and her application was duly rejected.  “The letter from the Home Office seemed like it was a copy and paste of some standard language, filled in with my details,” Ms. Islam said in an interview on Monday. “I am highly skilled and bringing my expertise to U.K. academia and value to the U.K. economy, and that does not seem to have been considered at all in the decision-making process.”  Professor Sarah Franklin, the head of the sociology department at Cambridge, called the Home Office’s decision an “outrageous breach of common sense.” She said that the government’s immigration policy was damaging the very institutions it was trying to safeguard. “The government, with its explicit policy of creating a hostile environment, is not having the intended effect of protecting the U.K., but it is having the opposite effect of undermining core institutions such as universities,” Professor Franklin said, citing a strategy put in place in 2012 by Theresa May, who was the home secretary at the time, that was meant to create “a hostile environment for illegal migration” in Britain.  Ms. Islam, 31, is originally from Aligarh, in northern India, and has lived in Britain since 2009. She has a string of academic successes to her name, including an award from the London School of Economics for her master’s degree and a Gates scholarship for her Ph.D. at Cambridge on gender and class in urban India. Ms. Islam, whose student visa expires at the end of January, said she had been shocked and very upset by the rejection and would appeal the decision.  “For me, there are personal, professional, emotional and financial consequences that I am still in the process of taking account of,” Ms. Islam said. “Living with this kind of uncertainty is not nice at all.”  The Home Office did not comment directly on her case but said that each application was considered on an individual basis. The agency said that applications for permanent residency would be refused if an individual exceeded the 540-day limit. Ms. Islam found out about the rejection last week and decided to speak out about her case by posting on Twitter.  Outrage about the decision spread quickly among the academic community and by Monday, the open letter had garnered more than 1,000 signatures. Ms. Islam said the outpouring of support was “heartening.”  In the open letter, Ms. Islam’s research was called “an asset to the U.K. and its academic community, yet her very success in academic fieldwork is now being held against her.” Elise Burton, a close friend of Ms. Islam’s and a fellow researcher at Cambridge, who drafted the open letter last Friday, said in an interview that she was not surprised at how quickly many in the academic world had taken the opportunity to voice their disapproval. “I know many others who have struggled with similar issues,” she said. “We are hoping to see broader change in the immigration system.” The letter said that the reputation and competitiveness of British academic institutions could suffer because of decisions made by the Home Office in Ms. Islam’s case and in others like hers. Harriet Truscott, a spokeswoman for Newnham College, Cambridge, where Ms. Islam studies, issued a similar warning. “Without talented academics like Dr. Islam, the University of Cambridge would not be a global leader in research,” she said.']","More than 1,000 academics have signed an open letter in support of Asiya Islam, a research fellow who has lived legally in Britain for a decade."
Quebec Reverses Decision on French Citizen’s Immigration Application,2019-11-11,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — A French woman whose desire to immigrate to Quebec was upended because she wrote a chapter of her doctoral thesis in English will receive a document necessary to remain in the province, she said on Monday. The woman, Émilie Dubois, a 31-year-old Francophone from Burgundy, had applied for a certificate required to settle permanently in Quebec.  But Quebec authorities, alluding to the chapter of her biology doctorate written in English, initially rejected her application on the grounds that she had not demonstrated sufficient proficiency in French. After an international outcry, the authorities called Ms. Dubois to let her know they had reversed their decision, she said on Monday. “I am happy and relieved, but I hope my case has raised awareness about the government’s immigration policies,” she said by phone from Quebec City. “It is not a good strategy to turn away the best and brightest students if Quebec wants to improve its economy.” The right-leaning government of the Quebec premier, François Legault, came to power last year with a promise to limit immigration. It has been exploring policies that would narrow the criteria for newcomers, including students, to gain residency.  Immigrants coming to Quebec will also soon have to pass a values test to assure they understand Quebec’s approach to issues such as gender equality. The government’s efforts to rein in immigration have prompted concerns that Quebec, home to some of the country’s leading universities, will no longer be as attractive to talented international students who once viewed studying in the province as a pathway to gaining Canadian residency and eventual citizenship. The province is determined to uphold French, the language of government, commerce and the courts. Mr. Legault has made clear that while he wants to reduce the number of immigrants coming to Quebec, he is eager to attract skilled labor from France. Nevertheless, Ms. Dubois’s initial application was turned down despite the fact that she completed a biology doctorate at Laval University in Quebec City, a French-language university. She also started a scientific graphic design company.']",
The French Theaters Where the iPhone Is No Match for Guignol,2019-11-11,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — The children hurried with their parents past tree-lined promenades and sparkling fountains toward a jewel-box puppet theater in Luxembourg Gardens, the popular  park at the center of Paris. Around 40 pint-size spectators, ages 2 to 8, swarmed around a tiny ticket window, then clambered into a brightly lit hall with black walls and red leather benches, licking lollipops and pulling at cotton candy.  iPhones were stowed and forgotten as they faced a miniature stage with red velvet curtains and posters of colorfully costumed French marionettes. Françis-Claude Desarthis, 73, the theater’s rotund, cherub-faced owner, ambled down the aisles, swinging a brass bell to signal the start of the show. “Silence!” cried a 4-year-old girl, raising a finger to her lips. “Guignol is coming! Mr. Desarthis, who had slipped behind the stage, pulled a three-foot tall wooden puppet with arched eyebrows, cherry-red cheeks and a  brown coat on his arm. Guignol, a talkative, impulsive character who is a cultural icon in France, was instantly recognizable to this boisterous crowd. Guignol defeats bad guys — on this day, an evil French chef — and defends the oppressed. On a starry set with Montmartre and the Eiffel Tower painted into the background, he dispensed justice to other wooden marionettes as the children cheered him on. “The kids are completely transfixed,” said Patrice Seme, 54, who had brought his grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, from their home in Versailles to the Théâtre des Marionnettes du Luxembourg, one of the oldest in Paris.  “You can’t get this from an iPhone,” he added. “We are opening the doors to their imagination.” In an era of limitless on-demand entertainment, the timeworn art of French marionette theater continues to capture minds and hearts in this country in ways that smartphones, video games and the most seducing technologies can’t. About 600 marionette companies operate in France, with the biggest concentration of theaters — known as châtelets, or little castles — found in parks around Paris. Many operations, like Le Guignol de Paris, inaugurated in 1892 in the Buttes des Chaumont park, are run by the descendants of marionettists who passed down their savoir-faire. Mr. Desarthis is one of them. A second-generation puppeteer, he began learning from his father at age 6.  “The marionette is an essential part of our culture,” said Mr. Desarthis, as he settled onto a theater bench after a show.  “They engage with the public, which feels connected to their stories,” he added, flexing his arms to get the blood flowing after wielding several six-pound puppets for an hour. “It’s a collective experience.” In France, the culture of the puppet is complex. From Cinderella to working-class caricatures like Gnafron, a poor shoemaker, puppets in elaborate costumes animated by hand, string or stick keep audiences of every age rapt. They sing familiar songs, defy authority and confront life’s dramas in performances that mirror the nation’s psyche. Marionettes have also branched into the avant-garde, morphing into unconventional sizes, forms and materials. A sugar cube arranged on a chair may be considered a marionette if someone animates it with hands and voice. Fantastical creations appear in operas, musicals and plays, and are feted at the biennial World Puppet Theater Festival in the  town of Charleville-Mézières. But they haven’t knocked Guignol from center stage. Mr. Desarthis’s atelier near the Luxembourg Gardens is filled with 2,500 Guignol figures, from chimney sweeps to poodles, that he has lovingly fashioned over the decades. With four employees, he also paints the sets, records voices and arranges special effects on 80 projectors.  “Rain, snow, flames — we do it all,” he said. Mr. Desarthis was smitten by marionettes as a boy, inspired by his father, Robert, a former toy seller and clown who built Paris’s first stand-alone puppet theater in 1933. Back then, the Luxembourg Gardens, owned by the French Senate, swarmed with three times as many visitors as today. “There were almost no cars, and people didn’t leave on vacations and holidays,” he said. “Le tout Paris went there, and every puppet show was packed.” When Françis-Claude was born in 1946, his parents put marionettes in his crib. At 6, he said, he told his teacher: “It’s no use teaching me to read. I want to do puppets.” His father enrolled him in diction and acting courses, and sent him to a top marionette training school in Czechoslovakia at age 16. These days, Mr. Desarthis said, children have more distractions.  “They have technology, videos, TV, phones,” he said. “But once they come inside my theater, they have a direct interaction with the Guignols, and they forget about all that.” He slipped his hand into a floppy piece of brown fabric topped with a wooden ball. Suddenly, Guignol sprang up, waving his arms and pointing around the theater. “People don’t understand how much of an art it is, to make a puppet come to life,” he said. “The magic is in the wrist,” he continued. “If you know the craft, you give him energy, vibrancy and a real personality.” The marionette dates to the Middle Ages, when icons of the Virgin Mary were paraded in religious processions. “Marion,” a diminutive for Mary, took on a life of its own in the 17th century, when puppets inspired by the commedia dell’arte in Italy appeared in street shows, just as the French playwright Moliere popularized traveling plays in villages around France. The characters were aimed at adults, and grew more satirical after the French Revolution. The most popular was Guignol, created in 1808 by Laurent Mourguet, an illiterate silk weaver-turned tooth-puller in Lyon who used marionettes to attract clients in the city’s central square. Guignol quickly struck a chord among Lyon’s working class. He railed against misery and injustice, mocked authority and beat police puppets who harassed the poor. The message was so pointed that Napoleon III briefly censored Guignol plays. “People identified with Guignol,” said Lucile Bodson, the former director of the International Institute of Marionettes. “He entered the popular culture and gave them power to express themselves against the powerful.” So enduring is Guignol’s satire that a television show, “Les Guignols d’Info,” featuring life-size  puppets, aired on France’s Canal+ channel for 20 years before ending last year. President Emmanuel Macron was depicted as a penguin while running for office, and a gun-toting Sylvester Stallone symbolized America. These days, Guignol is a toned-down version of his former self, playing to a generation of parents that eschews spanking and violence.  “Today, there’s no brutality or beatings,” Mr. Desarthis said. “We shouldn’t be teaching children that — au contraire.” But the message remains the same. “It’s the tension between good and evil, and that justice rewards the good,” Mr. Desarthis said. He stepped backstage to prepare for another show. As a new group of children toddled in, a ballad about the puppeteer played on a video. “He’s hot, and his arms hurt,” the song went. “But he makes the children laugh. What a beautiful thing, my friends, to be a child forever!” In a moment, dozens of motionless puppets would spring to life on Mr. Desarthis’s arms. An 80-year-old Parisienne and her cat, Minouchette, who lived under the rooftops of Montmartre. A heartless chef, Lustucru, who planned to butcher innocent rabbits — and the cat — for dinner. And, of course, Guignol. He would free the oppressed, save the old lady and kick the chef down a chimney — much to the delight of his young audience.']",
Ukraine’s President Seeks Face-to-Face Meeting With Putin,2019-11-12,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — As the formal peace process for the Ukraine war bogged down last month, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, reached out for a direct meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, an intermediary in the talks revealed on Tuesday. The United States does not participate directly in the negotiations, which are overseen by France and Germany. But Mr. Zelensky had pressed for a more robust American role, in part by seeking a meeting with President Trump in the White House. That effort became entangled in a request for political favors in exchange for the White House meeting — a request that is now a focus of the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. There has been no sign of United States pressure on Russia to sit down for the peace talks, and since September, five American officials who dealt with Ukraine have resigned.  With the negotiations delayed, Mr. Zelensky in late October offered a direct meeting, a former president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, said on Tuesday. Mr. Nazarbayev, who is acting as an intermediary, said he had conveyed the offer to Mr. Putin. “I think we need a separate, personal meeting of the presidents of Russia and Ukraine,” Mr. Nazarbayev said at a policy conference in Kazakhstan.  In announcing the offer, Mr. Nazarbayev also summed up the stalemate in settlement talks for the Ukraine war, which has ground on for five years and killed more than 13,000 people. He suggested that Russia was not seeking to seize territory but rather to trade its de facto occupation of Ukrainian land for “other things.” Most analysts say Russia, which arms and supports the separatist rebels who control parts of eastern Ukraine, wants changes to Ukraine’s domestic political system that would give Moscow a greater say over the country’s affairs. “I already received agreement from Zelensky for a tête-à-tête,” Mr. Nazarbayev said. “I have told the president of Russia. Now we will see.” Mr. Nazarbayev suggested the leaders might meet in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan, which was recently renamed after him. The Kremlin’s response on Tuesday was lukewarm. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, suggested in a conference call with reporters that the Russian leader would not immediately accept. Mr. Putin would not hold “a meeting just for the sake of a meeting,” he said. Russia has for years denied involvement in the war, saying its soldiers in Ukraine are “on vacation” or otherwise not really in military service.  Mr. Zelensky ran on a promise to negotiate an end to the war. One tactic was an effort to maneuver Russia into negotiations that would recognize the Kremlin as a party to the conflict; one-on-one talks with Mr. Putin would signal a Russian role in the war. The Kremlin has delayed the French- and German-led talks as it demanded ever more concessions. Mr. Zelensky agreed to a Russian-approved political formula for settlement and withdrew troops from the front in some locations — even pulling back some troops under fire, something he had said he would not do. “He keeps rising the price, because he sees that Zelensky is interested,” John E. Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said of Mr. Putin. “There are limits to the price Zelensky is willing to pay.” One limit is domestic opposition. Concessions are inflaming Ukrainian nationalists, who deride his policies as capitulation. On a trip to the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil earlier this month, Mr. Zelensky was met by a crowd chanting “Shame! Shame!” for caving in to Russia’s demands. Some Russians also see the concessions as signs of weakness from a Ukrainian president whose hopes for American support have evaporated. Mr. Putin “is not saying directly that Ukraine will have to negotiate because it lost support in the West,” Konstantin B. Gaaze, a politics professor at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Science, said in a telephone interview. “But he could say that.”']","President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed direct talks with President Vladimir V.

Hong Kong Protesters Stage Fiery Clash With Police,2019-11-12,"By Mike Ives, Ezra Cheung and Katherine Li","['HONG KONG — Antigovernment demonstrators angered by the shooting of a Hong Kong demonstrator fanned out across the city on Tuesday, blocking major transit arteries and staging a fiery standoff against riot police officers on the fringes of a university campus. Protesters disrupted the morning commute and brought parts of the central business district to a standstill around lunchtime. At the gates of the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday evening, they set a giant blaze and threw gasoline bombs at police lines under a barrage of tear gas canisters. The protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city began in June over a contentious, but since-withdrawn, extradition bill. The demonstrations have since morphed into calls for greater democracy and police accountability. Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests. Black-clad student demonstrators have been making a concerted effort to defend their campuses against what they see as unwarranted police encroachment. On Tuesday, protesters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong built roadblocks outside an entrance while police officers elsewhere tackled demonstrators to the ground and fired tear gas at a group gathered on a sports field.  As the clashes escalated in the evening, the university’s vice chancellor, Rocky Tuan, met with students in hopes of brokering a cease-fire between protesters and the police.  “The deal is that we each need to take a step back,” he said as he urged the students not to escalate the confrontation. In response, the students shouted: “We don’t believe you!” They repeatedly interrupted him and called for the release of students who had been arrested. Barely minutes after Mr. Tuan left the site, the police fired tear gas at the protesters.  The protesters poured more fuel onto a large barricade that they had already set ablaze. They hurled gasoline bombs, set off fireworks and chanted: “Reclaim Hong Kong, a revolution of our times,” a popular protest slogan.  Officers fired a barrage of tear gas over the blockade, sending protesters scrambling. At least 30 people were being treated Tuesday night in a makeshift first-aid center on campus, apparently for exposure to tear gas and injuries from rubber bullets.  Around 10 p.m., police cannons briefly sprayed blue-dyed water at protesters. Groups of officers began to retreat soon afterward, with the smell of tear gas and pepper spray still heavy on the air.  Even though many confrontational protesters are undergraduates, violence on the campuses of Hong Kong’s universities has been rare. The university said that classes would be canceled on Wednesday for a third straight day in light of road blockages, “severe damage” to campus facilities and the “high risk of ongoing confrontation between protesters and the police.” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, criticized protesters on Tuesday for disrupting transit, saying that they were “extremely selfish” for wanting to paralyze Hong Kong. Mrs. Lam told reporters that the protesters were out to “create a phenomenon in which Hong Kong seems to have come to a standstill and people are not able to go to work and go to school.”  School administrators should urge students to stop taking part in illegal activities, she said, adding that her government would do its “very best” to ensure that local elections planned for Nov. 24 were held in a “fair, just, safe, orderly” manner. Separately, People’s Daily, an official government newspaper in mainland China, said in a commentary: “Only by supporting the police force to decisively put down the riots can a peaceful environment be restored and fair elections be held, and help Hong Kong start again.” Hundreds of protesters, including many office workers, stormed Hong Kong’s central business district at lunchtime. Some formed human chains to pass along bags of bricks that front line activists were using to block traffic. Across the harbor, activists in the Mong Kok neighborhood placed barricades in front of buses and punctured their tires.  The city’s subway operator said on Tuesday morning that services were also delayed after gasoline bombs had been thrown onto the tracks of a major rail line that runs to the border of the Chinese mainland.  Large groups of commuters were seen walking along the line’s tracks — a rare scene in a city known for its efficiency and order. The demonstrations on Monday brought some of the worst violence that the city has seen in recent months. Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, called the combative protesters “enemies of the people” and warned that the city’s escalating unrest could take it on the “road of ruin.” A police officer shot a black-clad protester at point-blank range on Monday morning in a neighborhood where traffic had been snarled by roadblocks. Elsewhere, a man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters, video footage shows. The police have said they are treating the immolation as an attempted murder. The medical status of the protester who was shot had improved to serious from critical condition by Tuesday morning, the Hospital Authority said. But the man who had been set on fire remained in critical condition. Tensions in Hong Kong had been building after the death last week of a student who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. The police said that 287 people were arrested on Monday, the majority of them students.  On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemned “violence on all sides"" in Hong Kong and urged the government to “address the underlying concerns driving the protests.” Ms. Ortagus also reminded the Hong Kong government that the United States grants it a favorable trade status unlike that of mainland China, but only under specific conditions. Congress and President Trump could enact a bill that mandates that the executive branch impose sanctions on Hong Kong officials who violate human rights and also review the special status of Hong Kong each year.  Many protesters have called for the bill to be passed, thinking the new law would give them leverage, but Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and Senate leader, has not held a floor vote, even though the bill passed the House by unanimous consent. Edward Wong, Paul Mozur, Elaine Yu, and Tiffany May contributed reporting.']","Protesters angry over the shooting of a young demonstrator blocked roads, forced train delays and threw gasoline bombs under thick clouds of tear gas."
Erdogan Warns That Turkey Will Keep Deporting ISIS Detainees,2019-11-12,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey warned Western nations that he would continue to release people who were thought to be members of the Islamic State and send them back to their home countries if governments continued to pressure Turkey with sanctions. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday shortly before leaving Ankara for a visit to the United States, Mr. Erdogan was mostly aiming the remarks at the European Union, which has proposed a system for imposing sanctions on Turkey over its unauthorized gas drilling in the eastern Mediterranean. The comments came a day after Turkey said it had begun deporting Islamic State fighters it had captured, starting a program to repatriate the detainees that has strained ties with European countries. Mr. Erdogan also took a tough line toward an American detainee who was deported by the Turkish authorities on Monday and became stranded at the Greek-Turkish border after being turned back by the Greek border police. Turkish officials said on Monday that the American was an Islamic State fighter captured last month in northeastern Syria. “We have started returning Daesh members to their countries and of course there is a serious rush, things are flaring up,” Mr. Erdogan told reporters, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. He added that the onus had been on Turkey to handle the exodus of Islamic State fighters from Syria, and that now their home countries must decide what to do. “It does not concern us if they are stuck at the border or not,” Mr. Erdogan said, referring to the American detainee. “We will continue sending them, so if they take them or do not take them doesn’t really concern us.” According to a statement by the Greek police, the man was escorted to a Greek border post on Monday by Turkish officers who cited the expiration of his visa. The man, however, said he did not wish to enter Greece and was sent back to Turkey, the police said.  Later in the day, the man returned alone to the Greek border post and asked to enter Greece, but he was turned back by Greek border guards. Turkish officials denied that the man had been forcibly deported and said in comments to the Turkish media that he had requested to go to Greece rather than return to the United States. On Monday and again on Tuesday, Turkish news outlets aired images of the man pacing up and down and waving at the camera from the buffer zone between the two countries.  The man was identified as Muhammad Darwish B. in Turkish news reports, which did not reveal his surname. He is of Jordanian descent but carries an American passport, the reports said. Turkish officers at the border used a police van to block the view of the buffer zone and to prevent the American from talking to journalists through the fence. A spokesman at the United States Embassy in Ankara said he was aware of the case but could not provide further details. He added that consular services for the man were being arranged. The American is one of a number of people whom Turkey has vowed to deport, citing suspected ties to the Islamic State. The procedures to deport 11 French citizens and seven Germans, along with others from Denmark and Ireland, began this week, according to the Turkish Interior Ministry. The French citizens are four women and seven children, according to French news reports. Five of the children are younger than 4, according to their lawyer, Marie Dosé, who said the women had asked for years to be repatriated and wanted to be tried in France.  “They have risked their lives and their children’s to join Turkey and be expelled to France,” Ms. Dosé said. Three of the women escaped last month from the Ain Issa camp in northeastern Syria after the facility was abandoned by Kurdish forces. The women fled to the Turkish border, 25 miles north, and were under an international arrest warrant, according to Ms. Dosé.  It is not the first time that French citizens have been deported from Turkey. Hundreds of Islamic State fighters and their families have been returned to France since the countries signed an agreement in 2014.  In September, Turkey deported three women and nine children, including the niece of Fabien and Jean-Michel Clain, two high-profile jihadists who were reportedly killed in Syria in February.  Mr. Erdogan’s threats to continue releasing Islamic State prisoners and also to open the gates to Europe more generally for Syrian refugees have caused alarm in Europe, the Turkish leader will face different pressures on his visit to the United States.  He is scheduled to meet President Trump in Washington on Wednesday. At the top of the agenda will be Turkey’s purchase of the Russian S400 defense missile system. American officials have pressed Turkey to walk away from the Russian system or face a raft of sanctions.  Mr. Erdogan had initially floated the idea of buying the American-made Patriot missile system as well, but it is not clear if the move would be enough to avoid sanctions. Mr. Erdogan told Turkish reporters on Tuesday that he would again raise his longstanding demand for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher whom Mr. Erdogan has accused of instigating a failed coup.  The Turkish president will also continue to press complaints against the American support of a Kurdish militia in Syria that Turkey considers a terrorist organization.

Evo Morales of Bolivia Accepts Asylum in Mexico,2019-11-11,By Clifford Krauss,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia who resigned under pressure from street protests and the military, was granted asylum in Mexico on Monday, departing from the country at a time when it is deeply polarized and leaderless.  Mr. Morales, who stepped down on Sunday, was granted refuge “for humanitarian reasons and in light of the urgent situation Bolivia is facing,” said Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, in a televised address. Mr. Morales flew out late Monday on a Mexican government plane, according to a statement from the Mexican foreign minister.  Mr. Morales left office after weeks of growing unrest over a disputed presidential election and after the military indicated it would support the people in the streets calling for him to step down. Bolivia now faces a power vacuum because several politicians in the line of succession resigned after Mr. Morales did. Lawmakers in La Paz, the country’s most important city, scrambled to take charge as the streets emptied out, with residents leaving work early and heading indoors, fearing for their safety.  [Update: Bolivian senator Jeanine Añez Chavez has declared herself leader.] Hundreds of supporters of Mr. Morales made their way on late afternoon Monday toward the center of La Paz from the mountains surrounding the city, some of them armed with sticks. As they approached, their chants of “here we go, civil war” could be heard echoing above the city. The police said the armed group had vandalized police offices, causing panic in some neighborhoods where people blocked their doors with old furniture to protect stores and houses.  After receiving requests for help from the national police and civilian politicians, the armed forces announced Monday night they would mobilize to defend gas, water and electricity services around the capital. Army and police units will also begin joint patrols around the city, according to the national police. Mr. Morales, who said he was forced to resign in what he called a “coup,” softened his language by Monday afternoon and urged an end to violence in Twitter messages posted from an undisclosed location. “We can’t have a confrontation between Bolivian brothers,” he said. “I am making an urgent appeal to resolve any differences with dialogue.” Late on Monday night, Mr. Morales posted a message on Twitter acknowledging that he was on his way out of the country, thanking Mexico for giving him asylum and expressing sorrow that he had to abandon the country “for political reasons.” But he added: “I will return soon with more strength and energy.” After the resignations by top government officials in the line of succession, a leading opposition politician said she was ready to take the reins of power until new elections could be held. The politician, Jeanine Añez Chavez, the Senate’s second vice president, appeared on television Monday morning before boarding a plane for La Paz, sobbing as she described the chaos of the night before. “Bolivia doesn’t deserve this, all these deaths and destruction,” she said, before promising a quick transition “that is absolutely necessary to return to a democracy.” But it is unclear if she would get the necessary approval from the national assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Morales’s supporters Mr. Morales appeared to be in hiding in a province where he has traditionally had much support. Late Sunday he said on Twitter that the police were seeking to arrest him “illegally” and that “violent groups” had broken into his house. He was not home at the time. A video circulating on social media showed dozens of people exploring what was reported to be Mr. Morales’s ransacked home, with furniture toppled, items broken and political slogans spray painted on walls in red.  Ms. Añez, a senator from the opposition Democratic Union party, said she would need a quorum in the assembly to approve a transfer of power, and Mr. Morales’s party, the Movement for Socialism, controls both houses. His supporters in the assembly may try to block the appointment of an interim president using procedural rules, leaving a vacuum at the top of the government. Carlos Mesa, a former president who was the losing candidate in the recent presidential election — widely considered fraudulent — said members of the opposition were attempting to appeal to the patriotism of lawmakers who have backed Mr. Morales. “They have no reason to believe they will be persecuted,” Mr. Mesa said at a news conference Monday morning. One of the principal leaders of the demonstrators, Luis Fernando Camacho, in a video distributed over social media, rejected the description that what had happened in Bolivia was a coup, insisting that what took place was peaceful resistance in the streets. He also said constitutional procedure would be followed to bring Bolivia back to normal. “We don’t bring down government,” he said. “We liberated a people.” Voice and text messages asking members of Mr. Morales’s party for comment were not returned.  On Monday morning, much of downtown was blockaded by demonstrators peacefully demanding that the assembly select an interim president. Lawmakers from around Bolivia attempted to return to La Paz to approve the resignation of Mr. Morales and his vice president, and begin the process of selecting a caretaker government. The military attempted to speed up the process by offering helicopter transport to some legislators. Opposition leaders said they were working for a rapid transition. “We need an expeditious resolution,” said Luis Vasquez, a former Social Democratic senator. But the country’s rugged geography made travel difficult, and as the day progressed, tension escalated in La Paz and around Congress. By Monday afternoon, the assembly was cleared of lawmakers and their staff as reports circulated that pro-Morales activists were heading downtown from El Alto, a working-class, largely Indigenous city adjacent to La Paz that had been a bastion of support for Mr. Morales. More than 400 police equipped with tear gas launchers and a water cannon truck stood guard around Congress and surrounding government buildings, which were also empty. A few civilian supporters of the opposition patrolled their own barricades of wire and corrugated metal around the downtown, saying they were guarding against a counter-coup by the Morales forces. Otherwise, the downtown are was empty and quiet. By nightfall the police and army had apparently been able to block the El Alto protesters from reaching the center of the city, though sirens and small explosions rang out across the city. Drinking water was cut off to parts of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia’s second-largest city, but the reason for the cutoff was not known. There was little to no violence in Santa Cruz, a center of the opposition. A festival-like mood prevailed there, with people celebrating on the streets and waving flags.  The political crisis began when Mr. Morales, a leftist who came to power more than a decade ago and was once widely popular, claimed victory in the Oct. 20 election, which protesters and international observers suspected was rigged. In 2016, a court packed with loyalists allowed him to do away with the Constitution’s two-term limit, allowing him to run for office indefinitely.  For weeks after the disputed election results, demonstrations paralyzed much of the country, and groups supporting the president have roughed up protesters. But Friday night, some police units broke from the government and joined the protesters. On Sunday, the rebellion spread to the military, with the commander of Bolivia’s armed forces, Gen. Williams Kaliman, calling for Mr. Morales to step down.  While several left-leaning governments across the region, including Venezuela’s, Cuba’s, and Mexico’s, joined Mr. Morales in denouncing the pressure that led to his resignation as a coup, President Trump welcomed the news, saying “Morales’s departure preserves democracy and paves the way for the Bolivian people to have their voices heard.” Daniel Victor contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']","The former president, who faced weeks of protest, said he had been forced out in a “coup.” He leaves Bolivia in a power vacuum, with politicians scrambling to form a caretaker government.

"Behind Hong Kong’s Protesters, an Army of Volunteer Pastors, Doctors and Artists",2019-11-11,By Andrew Jacobs,"['HONG KONG — The pastor pulled on his respirator and ran directly into the fog of tear gas in central Hong Kong. He was trailed by a homemaker, a retired accountant and a middle-school teacher. Undaunted by the pandemonium of gasping protesters, they pointed people to safety and poured saline into the eyes of those overcome by the fumes. With their yellow vests and portable loudspeakers, Pastor Ka-Kit Ao and his volunteers are an unmistakable presence at the antigovernment protests that have upended this semiautonomous Chinese territory. They form human cordons between protesters and advancing police. They beg baton-swinging officers to go easy. And they solicit the names of those being hustled away in handcuffs so pro bono lawyers can follow up with assistance. “I sometimes wonder whether we are doing anything of value, but we can’t just sit at home,” Pastor Ao, 34, said one recent afternoon before heading into the maelstrom with members of his group, Protect the Children. Now entering their sixth month, Hong Kong’s protests have been notable for their longevity, and for the huge throngs willing to defy the authorities with their demands for democracy and police accountability. Thousands of protesters, including office workers, descended Tuesday on Central, the main business and shopping district, forcing businesses to close and paralyzing traffic and the city’s fabled tram service. Behind the scenes, this largely leaderless movement has been sustained by a vast network of ordinary people who hand out bottled water and red bean soup at marches, drive home stranded protesters late at night and donate the gas masks that fortify demonstrators during their pitched battles with police. Hong Kong professionals have been especially vital. Graphic artists create the eye-catching protest posters across the city. Psychologists provide free counseling to the emotionally distressed. And emergency room doctors, working in clandestine clinics, set shattered bones. One measure of community spirit can be heard many nights at 10 p.m., when residents in densely packed neighborhoods open their windows and shout protest slogans to the heavens. Another is expressed through the crowdfunding campaigns that have raised millions of dollars for medical treatment, legal defense funds and other expenses. “Without this public support, the movement would have lost steam a lot sooner,” said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and the author of a book about the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 pro-democracy protests that fizzled after 10 weeks. “It encourages young people to keep going, giving them the sense they are not alone and that what they are doing is righteous.” Although actions like setting the man on fire risk eroding support, the protest movement so far has enjoyed broad backing among Hong Kong’s seven million people. A recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of the protesters’ violent tactics, agreeing that they were justified in the face of an increasingly aggressive police response and a government unwilling to compromise. This public support presents a thorny challenge to the authorities, who have been hoping to quell the protests by driving a wedge between the increasingly radical agitators and those sympathetic to their cause. “The more the government suppresses this movement and tries to scare people, the more people will step out and stand up,” said Pastor Roy Chan, a founder of Protect the Children, which has nearly 200 members. The encrypted messaging app Telegram serves as the town hall for the support network, with dozens of channels that match volunteers to those in need. Most prolific are the channels offering rides to protesters affected by the subway shutdowns that the authorities impose to dampen protest turnout. The rides also help protesters avoid the police sweeps that target public buses. Like many drivers, Patrick Chan, 38, a garment factory manager, said fear of arrest kept him away from the protests, most of which the police have deemed illegal. Guilt and shame, though, are powerful motivators. Mr. Chan spends hours in his beat-up BMW sedan ferrying weary, sweat-drenched protesters to housing complexes across the city. “These young people are trying to right the wrongs that we have long been avoiding,” he said, referring to Beijing’s two-decade effort to chip away at the vaunted liberties that differentiate this former British colony from mainland China. “They are paying with their futures, risking the possibility of being locked up for years. We owe them.” The sense of public service has also mobilized dozens of doctors, nurses and medics. Much of their work takes place in secret. That is because all but the most grievously injured protesters avoid Hong Kong’s hospitals following the arrest in June of several people who had sought care for broken bones and blunt trauma. These days, the injured are sometimes treated at clandestine clinics that provide X-rays and rudimentary surgery. Dr. Tim Wong works the protests after his regular hospital shift. An emergency room doctor, he decided to act after the police made a number of arrests at his hospital, which he declined to name for fear that it might endanger his employment. “Since then, no one has come to our emergency room for treatment, unless they are escorted by the police,” he said. “It’s outrageous. Hospitals should be sanctuaries.” One recent evening, he hovered near the front lines of a skirmish as Molotov cocktails, bricks and tear gas canisters arced overhead. Many of those needing medical treatment were bystanders caught up in the mayhem. Just then, Pastor Ao and another member of his group rushed by carrying a man injured by a tear-gas canister. All three of them were weeping. “I can’t believe this is happening to our city,” the pastor wailed as they dragged the man to a first aid clinic inside a Methodist Church that has become a beacon for protesters. Earlier that afternoon, Pastor Ao and scores of volunteers had gathered at a subway station to plot the day’s movements. After dividing up into teams of seven, he reminded everyone to refrain from chanting slogans and urged them to be polite to law enforcement authorities. “They might call us cockroaches but we should refer to them as police officers,” he said. Then everyone bowed their heads in prayer. “May we have God’s protection and the patience, love and wisdom to deal with the police,” Pastor Ao said. Volunteers say the police rarely return the favor, treating them as antagonists. In September, the police were widely criticized after a video emerged that appeared to show a knot of officers kicking a Protect the Children member as he lay on the ground. The man, wearing the group’s trademark yellow vest, was later arrested. At a news conference, a senior police official dismissed allegations of abuse, suggesting that the video had been doctored and that what many saw as a person was actually “a yellow object.” In the weeks that followed, the group’s ranks swelled with new recruits, Pastor Ao said. Many of the group’s volunteers are retirees like Ah Lin He. A fiery, reed-thin woman, Ms. He, 68, was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and swam to Hong Kong in 1972 to escape the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She doggy-paddled for 10 hours with five other people. Only three of them made it to shore. “I’ve seen the repression and madness that can be unleashed by the Communists in China,” she said as the group trudged to a protest that had turned violent. Walking beside her was Joe Pao, a 29-year-old pastor, who joined the group after a brief stint as a protester. “I realized I could do something more useful than throwing bricks,” Pastor Pao said. He acknowledged that his role as a putative peacemaker was rarely gratifying. Most of his work involves urging the police to exercise restraint. “When they catch people, we tell them to please respect the powers they have and not abuse them,” he said. “The impact is definitely small.” The majority of protest supporters operate more independently. Nam Kwan, a cultural foundation administrator, has fed, housed and comforted scores of youths whose parents, enraged by their participation in the protests, tossed them out of their homes. She traces her transformation from silent sympathizer to frenetic den mother to June 12, when the police escalated their tactics by firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at unarmed protesters. “When I heard the first gunshot, a bell rang inside me and I automatically found my place,” she said. “Nowadays my phone is on 24 hours a day because I’m afraid I might miss urgent messages or calls for help.” In addition to buying protective gear for protesters, she coordinates financial support and car pools from wealthy friends eager to help but reluctant to do so publicly. Oftentimes, she finds herself on the street, dispensing hugs or patiently listening to the worries of young protesters. “Every time these kids go to the front lines, they fear for their lives,” she said. “But what they fear more is abandonment, that one day we will all turn our backs and leave them alone.”']",
Spain’s Left Comes Up With Tentative Deal to Form a Government,2019-11-12,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Two days after elections weakened his hand, Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s caretaker Socialist prime minister, made an abrupt U-turn on Tuesday and agreed to partner with a hard-left party he had previously rejected to form a government. The preliminary deal between the Socialists and the smaller party, Unidas Podemos, came after five months of fruitless talks between them. Their partnership requires the support of several smaller parties in Parliament and still would leave Spain with a minority coalition government. But the step was a breakthrough for a country where national parties, left and right, have been reluctant to compromise and come together, and it had the potential to break Spain’s long political deadlock.  It would also make Spain a standout in Europe, as one of the few countries with a left-wing government.  Mr. Sánchez’s reversal was clearly intended to salvage his political position after he made the misstep of forcing Spain’s fourth election in four years in hopes of strengthening his mandate.  That did not happen. Instead, the elections elevated the far-right Vox party as Spain’s third-most powerful political force. Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists lost three seats, ending with 120 in the 350-seat Parliament. And Podemos ended up with 35, down from 42 since Spain’s last elections in April. The results provided a sobering warning to Spain’s squabbling parties on the left that their position was not improving, and it gave them new motivation to overlook their differences and reconcile.  In contrast to the acrimony displayed during their talks earlier this year, Mr. Sánchez and the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, smiled and hugged for the cameras on Tuesday.  Mr. Sánchez, 47, said the deal opened the door for “a progressive government” that he forecast would last for a full mandate of four years, despite its fragile minority situation. He thanked Mr. Iglesias for his generosity and said that he was “aware of the disappointment” that the breakdown of their previous talks had provoked.  Mr. Iglesias said that Sunday’s election had converted what in April could have been “a historical opportunity” into “a historical necessity” to form a left-wing coalition.  The deal is a personal victory for Mr. Iglesias, a 41-year old former university politics professor. Four years ago, Spain’s two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape, in part because of the emergence of Mr. Iglesias and his party.  Podemos, which modeled itself on the fleeting success of the hard-left Syriza party in Greece, once seemed like a rising insurgent threat to Spain’s political establishment. But Spain’s accelerating political fragmentation caught up with Podemos, too.  Until Tuesday’s announcement, Mr. Iglesias’ own leadership appeared to be under threat. One of the co-founders of Podemos broke ranks earlier this year to lead his own party, but to little success in Sunday’s election.  Podemos has called for a sweeping fiscal overhaul that would raise taxes on corporations and the rich, while increasing Spain’s minimum wage. It has promoted a 34-hour workweek and caps for property rental prices. The party also wants banks to reimburse the government for the bailout money they received during Spain’s 2012 financial crisis while keeping Bankia, the main rescued bank, under state control.  Mr. Iglesias has argued that another independence referendum in Catalonia — with terms set by Madrid — could help end Spain’s territorial conflict.  Catalonia could be one of several sticking points between Mr. Sánchez and Mr. Iglesias if they end up working together, with Mr. Iglesias serving as deputy prime minister, as they agreed Tuesday.  It also remains to be seen whether the two leaders have overcome their personal animosity. In July, Mr. Iglesias agreed to keep himself out of a coalition in order to overcome Mr. Sánchez’s personal veto. That offer proved insufficient at the time to break the deadlock and avoid another election. After Sunday’s election, Mr. Sánchez found himself under intense criticism for his miscalculated election strategy and for risking another lengthy period of deadlock. In 2016, Spain also held a repeat election, but then spent 10 months without an elected government.  The pressures on Mr. Sánchez have only mounted with the latest flare-up of the secessionist conflict in Catalonia. After former Catalan separatist leaders were sentenced to prison last month, mass protests spilled over into violence on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities. Right-wing politicians accused Mr. Sánchez of failing to guarantee law and order in Spain’s restive northeastern region. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, which doubled its representation in Parliament to 52 seats, denounced the left-wing government deal. Mr. Iglesias and his party, he stressed, had supported “Bolivarian Communism” and several far-left politicians in Latin America.  He also accused Mr. Iglesias of supporting separatist politicians in what he described as an attempted coup in Catalonia.   “We will hold them responsible for every damage that they provoke to cohabitation and the constitutional order,” Mr. Abascal warned on Twitter. To continue in office, Mr. Sánchez will now hope to get the support of several smaller parties, including Basque and Catalan ones. That is the same unwieldy alliance that allowed Mr. Sánchez in 2018 to unexpectedly win a vote of no confidence against the conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and replace him.  The leader of the Basque Nationalist Party, Andoni Ortuzar, indicated on Tuesday that his party would back Mr. Sánchez, as it did last year. Pablo Casado, the conservative leader who took over from Mr. Rajoy last year, said on Tuesday that his Popular Party would vote against a left-wing coalition government, alongside Vox.  Mr. Casado told a news conference that it was “very worrying” that Spain’s government could include “radicals” like Mr. Iglesias and other members of his party. Mr. Sánchez and Mr. Iglesias made public on Tuesday a list of government priorities in which Catalonia placed second-to-last among 10 items, even though tensions over Catalonia’s future dominated much of the election campaign. In the text, the two leaders said they would work to promote dialogue in Catalonia, without giving details.  To get enough support in Parliament, Mr. Sánchez will most likely have to rely on at least some of the Catalan separatist parties abstaining from the vote.  During the final days of the election campaign, Mr. Sánchez hardened his stance toward the Catalan government significantly, which may now complicate his task.  On Tuesday, the spokeswoman for the current Catalan government, Meritxell Budó, said that Mr. Sánchez should assume responsibility for forcing a repeat election.

Hillary Clinton Raps Boris Johnson Over His Suppression of a Russia Report,2019-11-11,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Russia’s influence in British politics has resurfaced as a potentially explosive issue in the country’s general election, with Hillary Clinton joining a parade of critics in castigating Prime Minister Boris Johnson for withholding a secret parliamentary report on Russia until after Britain goes to the polls. Mr. Johnson’s decision to delay the politically sensitive report until after the Dec. 12 election has not prevented the leak of unsavory details, which, if confirmed, would paint a damning portrait of Russian oligarchs funneling money to Conservative Party politicians. By adding her voice, Mrs. Clinton, whose presidential bid in 2016 was undermined by systematic Russian interference, could thrust the dispute over Russia to the center of the campaign. “Who do they think they are that they would keep information like that from the public, especially before an election?” Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. “Well, I’ll tell you who they think they are. They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling.” Based on the details that have emerged so far, the report could end up being less damaging than Downing Street’s refusal to release it. The veil of secrecy has spawned conspiracy theories, as well as criticism that it deprives British voters of vital information about Russian meddling before another election. “It’s certainly pertinent to an election,” Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general who was chairman of the parliamentary committee that compiled the report, said last week on Sky News. “There has been a lot of disquiet about the possibility of Russian interference, and part of our report looks at that.” It is not clear that Russia is planning to meddle in the Dec. 12 election as it did in 2016 in the United States or the 2016 referendum on Brexit. The short-fuse nature of the vote — Mr. Johnson won Parliament’s approval to hold it only in late October — would make it difficult for Russia to mount a full-scale social-media campaign, election experts said. Still, the lack of evidence of an election operation does not mean Britain is not still vulnerable to Russian interference. Delaying the report, critics say, leaves British voters in the dark about the nature and gravity of the threat. “We don’t know how serious it is,” said Bronwen Maddox, the director of the Institute for Government, a think tank in London. “That’s the value of the report — it would tell us. They should have published it.” In the United States, the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provided a vivid road map of how Russia mounted a sophisticated operation to flood Facebook and other social-media outlets with messages in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, and against Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton, who was in London on a book tour with her daughter, Chelsea, said she planned to keep highlighting the issue.  “Someone said to me, ‘Quit with the Russians,’” she said to The Guardian. “I said, ‘I’ll quit with the Russians when the Russians quit with us.’ That’s how I feel.”  In Britain, the secret report has become fodder on the campaign trail. Mr. Grieve, who was purged from the Conservative Party after clashing over Brexit with Mr. Johnson, said the government had no valid reasons for delaying its release. He said it fit into a pattern of spreading “propaganda and disinformation.” Mr. Johnson’s ministers attributed the delay to the need for normal vetting and other procedures, not to any political motives. They also denied that Russian money was backing the Conservative Party’s campaign, which is built around securing a swift exit from the European Union. “No Russian money is pulling the strings of this election,” the chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, said in an interview with the BBC. “I’m very confident about how we’re funded and we’re very transparent about that.” Still, new questions about the party’s funding sources bubbled up after The Sunday Times reported on Nov. 10 that the parliamentary report named nine wealthy Russians who gave money to the Conservatives. It was not clear, the paper said, whether the Russians were listed in the public section of the report or a classified annex, which is not scheduled to be released at any time. It is illegal in Britain for campaigns to accept money from abroad, but there is no law against taking funds from wealthy Russians who have established residency in the country.  Some links between Russians and Conservative Party figures are well established. In April 2018, Mr. Johnson, who was then Britain’s foreign secretary, was photographed at an airport in Italy after traveling to a weekend party at a converted castle owned by a Russian-British press baron, Evgeny Lebedev. Mr. Johnson traveled without the security detail normally assigned to the foreign secretary, and fellow passengers told The Guardian that Mr. Johnson looked as though “he had slept in his clothes.” He did not comment on the purpose of the trip. Mr. Lebedev, the son of Alexander Lebedev, a one-time KGB intelligence officer, is a majority owner of The Evening Standard and The Independent. Among those who testified before Parliament’s Intelligence and Security committee was William F. Browder, a London-based, American-born financier who fell afoul of the Russian government and has campaigned against its corruption of foreign officials. He painted a picture of Russian influence that goes beyond any single party to permeate the entire British establishment. Mr. Browder cited the case of Peter Goldsmith, a lawyer who served as attorney general in the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Browder said, was retained by the lawyer for a Russian oligarch who was trying to avoid being sanctioned by the European Parliament. President Vladimir V. Putin “has deployed vast resources from criminal proceeds, as well as misappropriation of assets from the regime’s opponents and random victims, to fund and develop a non-Russian, Western ‘buffer network’ which has enabled the Russian state to infiltrate UK society and to conceal the underlying Russian controllers and their agendas,” he said in written testimony, which was first reported by CNN and obtained by The New York Times. In an interview, Mr. Browder said the government’s decision was self-defeating. “From a P.R. strategy, it’s pretty dumb,” he said. “If they release it, they would get a day’s worth of bad headlines. Now, there are these conspiracy theories running around in London.” In 2016, there was evidence that Russia tried to tip the referendum in favor of Britain leaving the European Union. More than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts posted tens of thousands of messages in English urging people to vote “leave.” In an echo of the Russian campaign in the United States, many of those messages stoked fears about Muslims and other immigrants. There was already some evidence of troubling activity in this election, said Martin Innes, the director of the crime and security research institute at Cardiff University. But he said it was difficult to determine who was behind it.  “Given the current political situation in the U.K., there is a clear opportunity for a disinformation actor to further their geopolitical interests by destabilizing the European Union or destabilizing NATO,” Mr. Innes said. The political dynamics this time are somewhat different. Mr. Johnson has promised a swift Brexit, which would appeal to Russia, given its desire to weaken the European Union. But Mr. Johnson also favors close ties to the United States. His opponent, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, might delay or even reverse Brexit. But he, too, is a euroskeptic and would be likely to keep Washington at arm’s length. “The unanswered question is whether in the Russian calculation, Britain is worth running an interference operation for,” said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a form that specializes in mapping social media. Given that the referendum has already happened, he said, “you could envisage a scenario where the conclusion is ‘Let them get on with it.’”']",The document on Moscow’s meddling in British politics prepared by Parliament last year is becoming a hot issue as bits and pieces begin to leak out.
Turkey Starts Sending Captured Foreign Fighters Home From Syria,2019-11-11,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey on Monday started making good on its vow to send foreign fighters who were captured in Syria back to their home countries, including one it sent to the United States, the Interior Ministry told the state-run news agency. “One American foreign terrorist fighter whose proceedings are completed has been deported,” a ministry spokesman, Ismail Catakli, was quoted as saying by the agency, Anadolu. Procedures to deport 11 French citizens and seven Germans, along with others from Denmark and Ireland, were underway, Mr. Catakli added, with the German citizens scheduled to be sent back on Thursday. He described the detainees as “foreign terrorist fighters.” Western countries have strongly resisted taking back fighters for the Islamic State, or their wives and children.  It was not immediately clear where the American had been detained but it had been rumored in the first days of Turkey’s incursion against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria that an American fighter had been captured. Turkish officials denied any knowledge of such a capture at the time.  The Turkish Interior Ministry identified the American who was deported on Monday as an Islamic State fighter.  The Turkish news media reported that the American was deported at the land crossing into Greece, but that the Greek immigration authorities refused him entry and sent him back to Turkey.  The Turkish authorities refused to let him re-enter the country and the American was photographed stranded in the buffer zone between the two borders. A State Department spokesperson said only that the United States was “aware of reports of the detainment of a U.S. citizen by Turkish authorities. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.” During the recent military operation in Syria, Turkish-backed militias announced that they had captured people affiliated with the Islamic State — most of them women and children who had escaped from a camp in Ain Issa — and pro-Kurdish fighters. Several Americans and Europeans traveled to Syria to join the Kurdish-led forces that wrested control of northeastern Syria from the Islamic State. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces became allied with the United States to combat the Islamic State, and opposed Turkey’s incursion last month. Turkey regards the Syrian Kurdish militia as a terrorist organization because of its ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., which has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for three decades. Turkey also considers the Islamic State a terrorist organization and has detained several hundred members of that organization in Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government said last week that Turkey would start to repatriate Islamic State members and urged Western countries to take responsibility for their citizens. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that 10 people were to be deported to Germany during the course of the week. Among them were women suspected of having fought for the Islamic State and their children, the spokesman, Christofer Burger, told reporters in Berlin on Monday. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']",One of the first repatriated was an American said to be an Islamic State fighter.

Hong Kong Protest Photos: Tear Gas and Fires on a Day of Campus Clashes,2019-11-12,By Lam Yik Fei and The New York Times,"['Angry demonstrators spread out across Hong Kong on Tuesday, disrupting transportation and the central business district and setting fires on a college campus, while riot police officers sprayed tear gas and water cannons to try to stop them. The clashes came a day after the nearly six-month-old protests turned particularly violent. On Monday, a police officer shot a  protester at point-blank range, and a man who scolded protesters was  set on fire. Both victims were in critical condition on Tuesday morning. Protesters are calling for greater democracy and policy accountability and have not been satisfied by concessions made by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.  The city is scheduled to hold elections on Nov. 24. Protesters hope  to convert deep public anger  into electoral gains, but the authorities have barred a prominent democracy activist from running. Ms. Lam told reporters on Tuesday that her government would do its “very best” to ensure the elections were held in a “fair, just, safe, orderly” manner.

"In Struggle Over Parthenon Marbles, Greece Gets Unexpected Ally: Xi Jinping",2019-11-13,By Iliana Magra,"['For almost two centuries, Greece and Britain have tussled over who should possess the Parthenon Marbles, the crowning prize of timeless beauty and ancient civilization taken from Athens and now displayed at the British Museum in London. But Greece had an unexpected ally put its finger on the scale on Tuesday, when President Xi Jinping of China expressed support for the return of the works during his first state visit to the country.  Mr. Xi’s support is just one measure of the growing affinity between the countries, underscored by a two-day visit during which their leaders signed 16 new agreements, and China committed millions more in investments in Greece. On his second day in Athens, Mr. Xi was given a tour of the Acropolis Museum in Athens by President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who asked for the Chinese leader’s “support in this struggle for the Parthenon sculptures to return here where they belong.” “I not only agree with you,’’ Mr. Xi replied in comments broadcast on Greek national television. “Not only will you have our support, but we thank you because we, too, have a lot of our sculptures abroad and we try as much we can, as soon as we can for these things to return to their homeland.”  The sculptures are also known as the Elgin Marbles, after the 19th-century British lord who brought the collection to Britain. China has its own longstanding grievances with cultural relics and artworks that were lost when colonial powers dominated China, and Mr. Xi has described himself as a proud defender of his country’s heritage, often referring to its 5,000 years of civilization. With nationalism on the rise at home, China has stepped up calls in recent years to repatriate its ancient artifacts, even sending teams of researchers to overseas museums to catalog the more than one million Chinese antiquities it estimates are on display abroad.  Over the years, China has successfully wielded its growing economic might to recover a number of artifacts said to have been looted from the Old Summer Palace. Notably, several bronze animal heads are now back in the country after being bought or recovered from their foreign owners by the state-owned China Poly Group Corporation. On Wednesday, China’s National Cultural Heritage Administration announced that another bronze animal head had been recovered and would be displayed alongside the other repatriated relics in an exhibition at the National Museum of China. For many Chinese, such artifacts are reminders of what the Chinese Communist Party still calls the country’s “century of humiliation” at the hands of Western powers.  These similarities in their history provided a unifying narrative for Chinese and Greek leaders during Mr. Xi’s visit.  In welcoming Mr. Xi, Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis said that the Greek and Chinese people are “carriers of great ancient civilizations that sealed the course of humanity.”  Mr. Xi, in an article in the Greek newspaper Kathimerini preceding his visit, wrote: “Confucius and Socrates are two masks that cover the same face: the brightest face of human logic,” borrowing a line from the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis. But it is the two countries’ economic ties that have brought them closer in recent years, and Mr. Xi’s visit made clear that Chinese investment was there for the long term.  In 2016, COSCO, the Chinese state-owned shipping group, bought more than half of Piraeus, Greece’s biggest port, turning it into the busiest port in the Mediterranean, according to the port.  On Tuesday Mr. Xi, Mr. Mitsotakis, and the chairman of COSCO and the Piraeus Port Authority oversaw a deal between the port authority and the European Investment Bank, which agreed on a 20-year, 140-million-euro loan for Piraeus’s expansion and upgrade. Greece’s new center-right government under Mr. Mitsotakis welcomed the Chinese investment as well as China’s huge export market for its agricultural goods, according to experts.  China, in return, experts say, is keen to deepen its influence in NATO and the European Union, of which Greece is part. “Greece is the one country in ‘old Europe’ that is most open to Chinese investments,” Steve Tsang, the director of the School of Oriental African Studies China Institute, said in an email on Wednesday. “In a world that is becoming more uncomfortable with Xi’s policy in asserting China, Greece seems like a reassuring, welcoming place for Xi to visit and show his domestic audience how much he is loved by a European country with the oldest civilization,” he said.  The Parthenon Marbles include an 80-meter frieze depicting the Great Panathenaia, the ancient Greek feast in honor of the goddess Athena, the muscled body of an ancient Greek river god lounging in midair and voluptuous female figures.  They were obtained by the British Museum after the British Parliament bought them in 1816 from Lord Elgin, who was a British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire when Greece was still a part of it.  Greece argues that Lord Elgin stole the marbles, making the sale illegitimate, and that the artifacts should be returned to their place of origin. Mr. Xi’s support for the repatriation did not make for one of the official agreements between the two countries. But Mr. Mitsotakis has made the return of the works one of his administration’s priorities, and raised the issue in his opening remarks to the Chinese president during their official dinner on Monday. Mark Stephens, a British lawyer who has been advocating for the repatriation of the marbles, called Mr. Xi’s support an “enormous boon.” “You have a major power weigh in,” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.  “It was a very low cost gesture of good will to Greece,” Thanos Dokos, Greece’s alternate national security adviser, said in an email on Wednesday.  For many Greeks, the fact that the Parthenon Marbles remain at the British Museum is a travesty, said Tatiana Flessas, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics.  “It is a real cause célèbre,” she said by phone on Wednesday, as both sides want “actual ownership” of the marbles.  Neither seems ready to budge.  “The museum’s collections represent the whole world,’’ said Hannah Boulton, a spokeswoman for the British Museum, in a statement on Wednesday. ‘‘It is a unique resource to explore the richness, diversity and complexity of all human history.”  “The Parthenon Sculptures are a vital element in this interconnected world collection,” she said, adding that the museum had “lent objects to various museums, including the Acropolis Museum.” The Parthenon Sculptures in the British Museum are available for free to six million visitors a year, she added.  Christopher Buckley and Amy Qin contributed reporting from Beijing. ']",China pledged big investments in Greece and signed 16 agreements. But it turns out that the repatriation of artifacts is also drawing the nations closer.
Spain’s Far Right Emerges as a Force by Tapping a New Nationalism,2019-11-11,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — The leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, made his name as an opponent of separatism in his home Basque region. But it is the secessionist conflict in Catalonia that has provided his real opportunity. As the Catalan turmoil confronts Spain with an existential crisis that threatens its territorial integrity, Mr. Abascal, who prides himself on owning a Smith & Wesson handgun, has presented himself as the fiercest defender of Spanish sovereignty.  That appeal has tapped into a new nationalism in Spain. Over the last 11 months, his party has gone from a non-factor to being the country’s third most powerful political force, as Vox doubled its representation to 52 seats in the 350-seat Parliament in elections on Sunday.  The election results have left Spain looking at more uncertainty and deadlock. Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, now faces another round of complicated negotiations to form a government. But the results also left Spain to contend with something it has not had to countenance in a long time, something more familiar to its European Union neighbors: a growing far-right presence. Mr. Abascal, 43, emerged as the only clear winner Sunday. Vox, he said, may now push forward with what he called a “patriotic alternative,” acting as a counterweight to Catalan separatism.  That agenda not only includes strong doses of nationalism, but also the sort of xenophobic messages used by other far-right parties that have advanced elsewhere in Europe. Until now, Spain had remained among the few European countries without a powerful far-right element, even after its two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape in 2015. Since then, no single party has been close to winning a parliamentary majority. The country has faced four elections in four years. That instability, combined with the threat of Catalan secession, has provided the perfect culture for Vox to thrive.  Vox has tapped into nationalist feelings that had been long tainted by the linkage with Franco’s dictatorship, which ended in 1975, but have recently been revived by the challenge to Spanish sovereignty presented by Catalan separatists.  “The longer Spanish politics remain unstable, the more reason it gives for Catalan separatists to continue raising tensions,” said Astrid Barrio, a politics professor at the University of Valencia.  “That is a good environment for Vox,” she added. Vox led the right wing’s condemnations of Mr. Sánchez, blaming him for allowing the Catalan political conflict to spiral into violence on the streets of Barcelona, following the recent prison sentencing by the Supreme Court of former separatist leaders. Vox has benefited from intense media coverage, and Mr. Abascal, who broke ranks from the conservative Popular Party in 2013, made the most of his first television election debate last Monday.  As Mr. Abascal called for a return to direct rule from Madrid over Catalonia, he reminded viewers that he had risked his life fighting for the unity of Spain, as a Basque politician targeted by a terrorist campaign mounted by ETA, the separatist group. During the debate, Mr. Abascal presented Islamic migration as a threat. Mr. Sánchez, his Socialist opponent, produced data to defend his government’s track record against illegal migration, rather than reminding Mr. Abascal that Spain protects religious freedom. Until this year, Mr. Abascal was sometimes ridiculed in the mainstream media for some of his campaign gimmicks, including a video that showed him leading a group on horseback accompanied by triumphant music, in a re-enactment of the medieval battles waged by Spain’s Roman Catholic kings to end the Muslim occupation.  More recently, Mr. Abascal has fired back at the media. Last week, Vox closed its doors to reporters from the media group Prisa after its flagship newspaper, El País, wrote an editorial warning that Mr. Abascal’s xenophobia and other comments in the television debate “should raise all alarm bells without delay.” Yet Mr. Abascal’s focus on migration seemed to pay off for Vox on Sunday.  Vox got seven of its parliamentary seats in Madrid, but also gained significantly in poorer agrarian regions like Andalusia and Murcia that have been the main landing spots for migrants who have reached Spain by boat from northern Africa.  Vox also benefited from the collapse of Ciudadanos, a center-right party whose parliamentary representation fell to 10 from 57 seats and whose leader, Albert Rivera, resigned on Monday. Over the past year, both the conservative Popular Party and the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party struggled to adjust to Mr. Abascal’s challenge, not unlike the way Donald Trump’s rise disconcerted the Republican Party in the United States.  Establishment politicians wavered between distancing themselves from him or competing with Mr. Abascal’s hard-line views, particularly toward Catalan separatism.  Vox’s rapid rise also brings new challenges of self-definition for a party that has presented itself as an anti-establishment force. It has particularly denounced corruption scandals in Mr. Abascal’s former Popular Party.  In the run-up to the election, Mr. Abascal’s campaign became “more populist, far right, with more focus on migration,” Lluís Orriols, a professor of politics at the Carlos III university in Madrid, told La Sexta, a Spanish television channel, on Monday.  “We now need to establish exactly what Vox is,” he said. While other party leaders are now blaming each other for allowing Vox’s rise, some analysts suggested that the two traditional parties of Spain had each helped Vox. The conservative Popular Party could have isolated Vox earlier by denouncing some of its excesses, but instead adopted part of Vox’s rhetoric, according to José Ignacio Torreblanca, who heads the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.  On the other hand, Prime Minister Sánchez’s wavering over Catalonia and his exhumation last month of Franco’s corpse from his underground basilica perhaps benefited more Vox than his own Socialist party “because it reawakened the history of the civil war as a narrative of good versus bad, which is something that feels unacceptable to many people,” Mr. Torreblanca argued. On Monday, Mr. Abascal said that his party would never help Mr. Sánchez stay in office, accusing him of failing to bring order back to Catalonia and “reviving the old hatreds among Spanish people.”  But he offered little clue about whether he would support any other government leader. “Governance is not the responsibility of Vox,” Mr. Abascal told a news conference. “The responsibility is for those who promised during the campaign to unblock the situation.”']","Sunday’s election did little to help end the government deadlock. But it yielded one clear winner, the far-right Vox party, which has thrived amid a conflict over Catalonia. "
Myanmar Genocide Lawsuit Is Filed at United Nations Court,2019-11-11,By Marlise Simons,"['PARIS — An arsenal of international laws has failed to confront the impunity of Myanmar’s government and security forces for their deadly purge of the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee a campaign of rape, arson and killing.  But on Monday, Gambia filed a lawsuit accusing Myanmar of genocide, summoning the case before the United Nations’ highest court in an effort to open a legal path against the country’s authorities. In the suit, filed at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Gambia requested that the court condemn Myanmar for violating the Genocide Convention with its campaign of ethnic cleansing.  [Read: U.N. court orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya muslims.] Gambia, a small West African country with a largely Muslim population, was chosen to file the suit on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is also paying for the team of top international law experts handling the case. The filing amounts to a last-ditch effort to impose an international ruling against Myanmar: Despite a wide outcry over cruelty to the Rohingya, no other court has jurisdiction to pursue a genocide case against the country. Gambia also requested that the International Court of Justice issue an urgent temporary injunction ordering Myanmar to halt all actions that could aggravate or expand the existing situation. That could mean a demand to stop further extrajudicial killings, rape, hate speech, or leveling of the homes where Rohingya once lived in Rakhine State.   “It is clear that Myanmar has no intention of ending these genocidal acts and continues to pursue the destruction of the group within its territory,” the lawsuit said, adding that the government “is deliberately destroying evidence of its wrongdoings to cover up the crimes.’’ The court’s 15 judges rarely deal with genocide. Based in the stately Peace Palace in The Hague, the Court of Justice was set up by the United Nations to rule on disputes between nations. It acts more like a court of appeal, focusing on questions of international law, such as disputes over borders or disagreements over international conventions.  But that can also include disputes arising from the Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of Genocide, established in an earlier case when Bosnia sued Serbia for genocide. The convention covers “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.’’  In its suit, Gambia claims that applies to Myanmar. The novelty in this case, though, is that Gambia is not at war with Myanmar, as Bosnia and Serbia were. But the Genocide Convention treaty does establish a mandate for member nations to act against genocide, wherever they are.  Experts say that if the court accepts the case, whatever the outcome, it will draw renewed attention to the immense suffering of the Rohingya people, most of whom fled to Bangladesh and now live in refugee camps there.  It is not clear how Myanmar, which has always denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide and argues that it was defending itself against an insurgency, will respond to the case.  “Myanmar will ignore this at its peril,’’ said John Packer, a professor of law at the University of Ottawa who has long studied the Rohingya’s plight. If the court hears the case, he said, “there will be a sort of public truth-finding exercise. Myanmar’s simple denials will not stand up to scrutiny.’’ A different body, the International Criminal Court, was specifically created to prosecute genocide and other atrocities. But that court has no jurisdiction over cases in Myanmar because the country has not signed on to the court’s treaty. (Neither have the United States, China, India, Israel and several other countries.)  But the I.C.C. did set itself up to at least partly take up the case against Myanmar last year, when it ruled that it could prosecute for “deportation” and associated crimes against Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh, which is a court member. But judges have not yet approved a criminal investigation by the court’s prosecutor.  Gambia’s lawsuit against Myanmar was born out of a series of meetings of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at which the country’s attorney general, Abubacarr M. Tambadou, assumed a position of leadership because of his special expertise. He had worked more than a decade as a lawyer at the United Nations tribunal dealing with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. In a telephone interview, Mr. Tambadou said he had been very moved by his visit to the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.  “The world failed Rwanda when the international community did not prevent the genocide while it was unfolding,’’ he said. “The treatment of the Rohingya is illustrative of the international community’s failure to prevent genocide in Myanmar. I thought this was not right. The world cannot stand by and do nothing.’’ The resulting lawsuit, seen by The New York Times, leans heavily on reports by United Nations fact-finding missions and what it calls other credible sources. Multiple United Nations investigations have underscored what they called a genocidal intent behind the campaign against the Rohingya. It says that all members of the Rohingya group in Myanmar are presently in grave danger of further genocidal acts because of Myanmar’s deliberate and intentional efforts to destroy them as a group. It also stresses that the remaining Rohingya communities and individuals in Myanmar continue to face daily threats of death, torture, rape, starvation and other deliberate actions aimed at their collective destruction, in whole or in part. The lawsuit notes that Rohingya Muslims have been subjected to persecution for decades in Myanmar, which denies that the Rohingya even exist as an established ethnic minority, despite hundreds of years of history in the country.  But pressure increased greatly in late 2016, according to the lawsuit. It cites examples of “attacks in which homes were set ablaze by security forces, in many cases with people trapped inside, and entire villages razed to the ground.”  One investigator documented cases where parents saw their young children being thrown into fires. The suit cites incidents of Myanmar’s “security forces calling families out of their homes, separating men and boys to be executed in front of their families or taken away.” It cites testimony about women and girls being raped and then killed.  The suit says that so-called “clearance operations’’ were genocidal acts, “intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part, by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses.” It said that from August 2017 onward, such “clearance operations’’ intensified. Paul Reichler, the lead lawyer on the Gambia team, said he hoped that the court would issue an injunction against Myanmar as soon as possible. “We are confident that genocide has been committed in this case, and we are very confident in the fairness of the court.’’']","Gambia, on behalf of Rohingya Muslims, opens an international dispute with Myanmar in an effort to have the country’s leadership tried for genocide."
Dueling Camps Vie for Control of Venezuela’s Embassy in Brazil,2019-11-13,By Letícia Casado and Ernesto Londoño,"['BRASÍLIA — Venezuela’s embassy in Brazil’s capital became the scene of a tense and at times violent standoff on Wednesday that lasted more than 12-hours and began when a group of Venezuelans seeking the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro tried to gain control of the diplomatic compound.  Representatives of Juan Guaidó, a Venezuelan politician who seeks to depose Mr. Maduro and proclaimed himself the rightful leader of Venezuela in January, entered the diplomatic compound saying they were doing so at the invitation of some of the diplomats assigned there by the Maduro government. Around 5 p.m. Mr. Guaidó’s supporters left the embassy, according to local press reports in Brasília. The confrontation lasted more than 12 hours, and led to screaming and shoving matches at the gate that drew a large police presence. It played out as Brazil was hosting the Chinese, Indian, Russian and South African leaders for a summit of an alliance known as BRICS. The head of the mission,  denounced the entry of Mr. Guaidó’s supporters as an invasion and a breach of diplomatic norms.  Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attempted takeover of the embassy in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. It called for the “immediate expulsion” of those who had sought to take control of the compound and denounced the “passive” response by the Brazil police. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon that the government was “taking the necessary measures to restore public order and avoid acts of violence.”   The standoff underscored the diplomatic conundrum facing many governments in the region since Mr. Guaidó’s bid to take power.  Brazil was among several countries that promptly recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader, arguing that Mr. Maduro’s autocratic conduct had rendered him an illegitimate leader. Brazil’s government has recognized Mr. Guaidó’s diplomatic envoy to the country, María Teresa Belandria, as Venezuela’s ambassador in Brazil. But it has not expelled diplomats appointed by Mr. Maduro, who have been in control of the diplomatic facility. This has created an awkward and legally dubious situation for countries like Brazil, which in practice have retained diplomatic relations with two camps that are battling for power.  Critics of Mr. Maduro in the region hoped that robust international support for Mr. Guaidó would prompt the armed forces to turn on Mr. Maduro. But the military did not budge, leaving Mr. Maduro in power while many in the international community, including the United States, continue to nominally regard Mr. Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. The Wednesday confrontation began in the early morning. The leader of it, Tomas Silva, a deputy to Ms. Belandria, posted a video on social media saying that diplomatic representatives of Mr. Maduro had welcomed the Guaidó allies and handed over control of the facility, which includes an embassy and an adjacent residence. “We’re thrilled, we’re happy,” Mr. Silva said, standing in front of the embassy emblem. “Dignity has been restored.” Mr. Silva said the Guaidó team’s presence at the embassy should galvanize a protest that opposition leaders have organized for Saturday in Venezuela. But Freddy Meregote, Mr. Maduro’s top diplomat in Brasília, called the takeover “an irresponsible invasion” that had violated diplomatic norms. Brazilian leftist politicians called the attempted takeover of the embassy a serious breach of diplomatic norms. “We can’t accept this,” said Jandira Feghali, an opposition leader in Congress. “It sets a very serious precedent.” Paulo Pimenta, another leftist lawmaker who was inside the facility on Wednesday, said the people who strode into the premises “had no idea what they were doing.” He said the group included “bodybuilders and jujitsu fighters who were hired.” Brazil’s presidency said in a statement that it had not encouraged the takeover of the compound and that it was hoping the standoff could be resolved peacefully. “As usual, there are unscrupulous individuals trying to take advantage of events to generate disorder and instability,” said the statement, in an apparent reference to Brazilian sympathizers of Mr. Maduro. Letícia Casado reported from Brasília and Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro.']","The standoff, which unfolded while Brasília is hosting several heads of state for a summit, underscores the diplomatic conundrum created by competing claims to Venezuela’s presidency."
"Girl, 5, Is 6th Child Killed by Stray Bullet in Rio de Janeiro This Year",2019-11-13,By Ernesto Londoño and Lis Moriconi,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — A 5-year-old girl who died Wednesday morning in Rio de Janeiro was the sixth child in the city slain this year after being struck by a stray bullet. Ketellen Umbelino de Oliveira Gomes was walking to school with her mother on Tuesday when she was shot in the leg in the Realengo district of western Rio de Janeiro, according to police officials and witnesses. Investigators believe she was caught in the crossfire of one of the gun battles waged routinely in the city by drug trafficking gangs vying for control of neighborhoods. As her mother rushed her to a nearby clinic, Ketellen reportedly tried to comfort her. “Even as she lay on the floor, she said: ‘Mom, don’t cry, don’t, Mom,’” a relative, Daise da Costa, told reporters. The killing comes as police in Rio de Janeiro have intensified operations against drug gangs in the city, a crackdown that has left hundreds of people dead and scrambled turf wars among heavily armed gangs. Since the beginning of the year, at least 21 children have been struck by stray bullets in Rio de Janeiro, according to Fogo Cruzado, or Crossfire, an organization that monitors violence in the city. Eleven of them were hit during police operations. Ketellen is the youngest of the six fatal victims. The other five children killed this year ranged in age from 8 to 12. Rio de Janeiro’s governor, Wilson Witzel, said he asked the police to carry out a “rigorous investigation of this crime and the others.” Mr. Witzel, a former federal judge who has presidential aspirations and an acrimonious relationship with President Jair Bolsonaro, blamed the federal government for the bloodshed. “Impeding the entry of drugs and weapons to the country is the responsibility of the federal government,” he said in a statement on Twitter. “The failure to combat, at the federal level, the trafficking of drugs and weapons, ends up fueling this insane war playing out in the states.” Investigators believe the target of the shooting was another minor, Davi Gabriel Martins do Nascimento, 17, who was standing nearby. He was also fatally shot. Witnesses told police that two men walked out of a car around noon on Tuesday, took aim at the teenager and opened fire. Ketellen underwent surgery overnight. She died Wednesday after losing too much blood.  Her father, Augusto de Oliveira, an unemployed painter, told reporters on Wednesday that the family was devastated. “The feeling we’re left with is to go grab the jerk that did this and do the same thing to him,” he told reporters. “My daughter was only 5-years-old.”']","Police operations targeting drug gangs have put children in the crossfire in the Brazilian city, where at least 21 minors have been struck by stray bullets in 2019."
Spain’s Far Right Gains in Election,2019-11-11,By Raphael Minder,"['A Spanish far-right party doubled its standing in a national election Sunday that made clear just how polarized Spanish politics has become and did little to help end the government’s long deadlock. The results were a setback for Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, who had hoped the election might strengthen his hand as he tries to form a new government. The election — the fourth in four years — came after months of fruitless coalition talks between Mr. Sánchez’s party and a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos. Though Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists came out on top again, they won only 120 of the 350 seats in Parliament — three fewer seats than in April, when the last election was held. The biggest gains Sunday were made by the ultranationalist and anti-migration Vox party. It is now Spain’s third-largest party after doubling its seats to 52 from 24, according to preliminary results, with more than 99 percent of the votes counted. With the rise of a powerful far-right party, Spain now mirrors other countries in Europe.  “We used to talk about Spain being the European exception, but that is now clearly gone,” said Astrid Barrio, a professor of politics at the University of Valencia. Spanish politics, she said, long defined by a left-right and two-party split, was now “very clearly shaped by the ideology of nationalism, with Vox as the clearest answer to the Catalans.” Sunday’s election confirmed the impact of the Catalan secessionist conflict on national politics, particularly after tensions recently spilled over into violence on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities.  Speaking in Madrid after the polls closed, a triumphant Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, thanked more than three million voters for choosing the “patriotic alternative” offered by his party. And he told supporters that Vox would “not take a step back” in pushing for a program that includes stripping the regions of Spain of their administrative autonomy.  “We have managed to open up all the prohibited debates,” he said.  Earlier this month, Mr. Abascal used his first election television debate to demand the banning of separatist parties as “criminal organizations.” He called for another period of direct rule over Catalonia by Madrid, tougher than the one imposed in late 2017 after separatist leaders made a failed attempt to declare independence. Mr. Abascal also peppered his remarks with xenophobic comments about migrants and Islam. His party has called for building walls around two Spanish enclaves in Africa, to stop migrants from entering illegally.  Mr. Sánchez could still form a new government if he manages to get the support of not only Unidas Podemos but also other smaller parties, including Basque and Catalan ones. Help might come from the anti-secessionist Ciudadanos party. It has long been opposed to Mr. Sánchez, but its disastrous showing on Sunday, when its representation fell to 10 seats from 57, might lead to a change in party leadership. Addressing his supporters from the balcony of his party headquarters just before midnight, Mr. Sánchez celebrated his party’s victory, however diminished, and promised to form a new government. He called on his rivals to show “generosity and responsibility” to help end the deadlock, but offered no indication of exactly how he might win them over in a new round of negotiations. Other parties did not seem well disposed to the prime minister. Pablo Iglesias, leader of Unidas Podemos, accused him of “leaving us with one of the strongest far-right parties in Europe.” And Íñigo Errejón, leader of another small left-wing party, said the rise of Vox was “the symptom of a democratic attrition and the result of a historic responsibility” — Mr. Sánchez’s decision to risk another election rather than forming a left-wing coalition. In April, when Mr. Sánchez mobilized left-wing voters to stop Vox’s rise, he was greeted with a near-record turnout of 76 percent. On Sunday, the turnout fell to 70 percent, reflecting frustration among voters about their party leaders’ inability to form a government, let alone resolve the lengthy conflict in Catalonia. The main opposition, the conservative Popular Party, won 87 seats, up from 66 in April, which was its worst-ever result. Its leader, Pablo Casado poured cold water on Mr. Sánchez’s chances of forming a new government. “Why did he want to convene another election if it was meant to create more stability, when now he has it much harder to form a government?” Mr. Casado asked. “Spain cannot remain in a blockade much longer.” Last month’s prison sentencing of former separatist leaders set off an outburst of street violence in Catalonia that raised concerns over whether the long-simmering conflict was spinning out of control. That led right-wing parties to put pressure on Mr. Sánchez to use the executive’s emergency powers to restore law and order in Catalonia. Catalan society remains split down the middle by secessionism, with three separatist parties winning on Sunday a combined 23 of the 48 Catalan seats in the Spanish Parliament. Four years ago, Spain’s two-party system turned into a much more fragmented landscape, and since then no single party has come close to winning a parliamentary majority. Spain spent most of 2016 in political limbo, after two elections failed to break the deadlock, and has found itself facing a similar scenario this year. The repeat election on Sunday, and its result, confirmed “the irresponsibility and short-term strategies of the party leaders,” said Ms. Barrio, the politics professor.']","As the Vox party doubled its seats, a longstanding government deadlock appeared no closer to an end."
Pneumonic Plague Is Diagnosed in China,2019-11-13,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['BEIJING — Two people in China were diagnosed with plague, setting off a panic on Tuesday about the potential spread of the highly infectious and fatal disease and prompting China’s government to warn citizens to take precautions to protect themselves. Beijing officials said the two infected people came from Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated region of northern China. They sought treatment on Tuesday in a hospital in Beijing’s Chaoyang District, where they were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, according to the government office of the district. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on Weibo, the microblogging site, that there was no need for Beijing residents to panic and that the risks of further transmission are “extremely low.” The authorities quickly isolated the patients, conducted epidemiological investigations on the people who could have been exposed and disinfected all the relevant sites, the CDC said. They have also strengthened monitoring of patients with fever, it added. Pneumonic plague is one of three types of infectious disease known as plague caused by the same bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Patients diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which causes high fevers and shortness of breath, sometimes first contract the closely related and more well-known disease, bubonic plague.  Fears are mounting in China over a possible outbreak of the disease, once known as the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in medieval Europe, and spread through Asia and Africa.   Last month, the authorities in China said they would strengthen quarantine measures to prevent plague from entering the country after Madagascar was struck by a fast-spreading outbreak of the disease. It is unclear when the cases were first detected in China but residents are asking why the authorities took so long to diagnose and disclose the problem.  Li Jifeng, a doctor at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital where the two people sought treatment, wrote on WeChat, a social media platform, that the patients sought treatment on Nov. 3. That post, which has since been deleted, was published by CN-Healthcare, a website that covers health care news in China. Dr. Li could not be reached for comment and Beijing Chaoyang Hospital declined to comment.  Dr. Li wrote that the patient she saw was a middle-aged man, who had a fever and complained of breathing difficulties for 10 days. He sought treatment at a hospital in Inner Mongolia but his condition did not improve. His wife also developed a fever and respiratory problems.  “After so many years of specialist training, I’m familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of most respiratory diseases,” wrote Dr. Li. “But this time, I looked and looked at it. I couldn’t guess what pathogen caused this pneumonia. I only knew it was rare.” On why the authorities took so long to make the announcement, Dr. Li wrote that signs of any infectious disease need to be repeatedly verified and investigated, and such announcements cannot be “transmitted casually.” The police quarantined the emergency room in the Chaoyang Hospital on Monday night, the news outlet Caixin reported, citing residents.  On Tuesday, Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to “block and control” online discussion related to news about the plague, according to a directive seen by The New York Times.  Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time. “The plague is not the most terrifying part,” one user wrote on Weibo. “What’s even scarier is the information not being made public.”  If left untreated, pneumonic plague is always fatal, according to the World Health Organization. But recovery rates are high if detected and treated with antibiotics, within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, the agency said.  Another user on Weibo called on the government to disclose how the patients arrived in Beijing from Inner Mongolia. If the patients traveled on their own using public transportation they could have spread the disease to many people.  “How many people have they encountered potentially?” the user wrote. “Only 2 kilometers away from Chaoyang Hospital. I’m shaking and trembling.” According to China’s health commission, six people have died in the country from the plague since 2014. The most recent case was recorded earlier this year. Officials have warned people to avoid traveling to infected areas and contact with rodents.  Elsie Chen and Zoe Mou contributed research.

Chile’s President Says He Will Support a New Constitution,2019-11-12,By Pascale Bonnefoy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — After three weeks of nationwide protests against the government, President Sebastián Piñera of Chile said he would initiate a process to draft a new Constitution for the country. The president’s announcement, made on Sunday, came hours after meeting with lawmakers from his coalition, and was the first time the government expressed a willingness to replace the current Constitution. But for many, it was too little, too late. “Piñera has characteristically reacted late to the crisis, but I value that he is now open to a new Constitution,” said Jaime Quintana, the president of the Senate.  The demand for a new Constitution has been a recurring theme throughout the protests, which were set off by a 4 cent hike in the subway fare, but quickly turned into widespread demonstrations by thousands against persistent inequality and the free market policies inherited from the Pinochet dictatorship.  As of Nov. 10, five people have been killed by either the police or the military, while 1,000 have been injured in police shootings since the protests began in mid-October, according to the National Institute for Human Rights, an independent state institution. Another 767 have been injured through beatings, tear gas or other means, the institute said, and more than 5,600 people have been arrested since the protests began. Rubber pellets shot by the police directly at people’s faces have left almost 200 with serious injuries or blind in one eye. On Saturday, Gustavo Gatica, a 21-year-old student, was shot in both eyes, prompting protests outside the clinic where he was treated. The human rights institute has sent observers to the protests and received over 2,800 reports of police beatings, threats, rape and other forms of sexual violence, verbal and physical abuses and simulated executions. On Sunday, John Cobin, a United States citizen, fired several shots at demonstrators, and injured one, during a peaceful march in the upscale beach resort of Reñaca, near the city of Viña del Mar, where he lives. He moved to Chile in 1996. Mr. Cobin is in detention and charged with attempted murder. The shooting spurred violent protests in Reñaca for hours. Chile’s Constitution was designed behind closed doors during the Pinochet dictatorship and provides a limited role for the state in the economy. Gonzalo Blumel, the interior minister, said on Sunday that the government hoped to set up a “constituent congress,” in which a group of legislators would decide on a new text “with participation from citizens,” and submit it for approval through a plebiscite. But this proposed method for a new Constitution is a far cry from demonstrators’ demands for direct citizen participation in creating a new Constitution. Self-convened local assemblies, or cabildos, are being held all over the country, often in parks, plazas and even on sidewalks, to analyze the roots of the discontent, to prioritize issues and to discuss how to create a new Constitution.  Over 15,000 such assemblies have taken place since October and their conclusions are being collected by Unidad Social, a coalition of nearly 130 labor, professional and social organizations, as a way to set forth a coherent, unified set of national demands. Earlier this month, 330 of the 345 local municipal governments resolved to organize a national vote next month, in which people will be asked about different issues, including the need for a new Constitution and the way to achieve it. Congress has responded to the crisis by pushing through bills aimed at reducing inequality and the cost of living and enhancing democracy. These include new laws to lower the workweek from 44 to 40 hours, to raise real estate taxes for properties worth over $1 million and to reduce prices for medicine, among other measures. This week, legislators plan to debate lowering their own salaries. Since Oct. 18, there has not been one day without some sort of demonstration in Santiago, the capital, or elsewhere, rarely organized by any particular group, with word spreading by social media postings.  Often they end violently, with exchanges between stone-throwing protesters who set up barricades and police forces using water cannons, tear gas, batons and rubber pellets. Sometimes the situation devolves into looting and arson attacks.']",Five people have been killed and thousands injured in weeks of protests.
His 22-Pound Cat Was Too Fat to Fly. So He Called In an Understudy.,2019-11-13,By Anna Schaverien,"['A man who tricked his way into getting his overweight cat into the passenger cabin of a plane has been penalized by a Russian airline. Aeroflot stripped the passenger, Mikhail Galin, of his air miles and removed him from their frequent-flier program after he bragged on social media about sneaking his hefty pet onboard by switching him for a lighter cat during check-in. When airline employees told Mr. Galin that his 22-pound cat, Viktor, was simply too heavy to fly in the passenger cabin on a flight to Vladivostok, in eastern Russia, he devised a plan to ensure his kitty did not wind up in the cargo hold. Mr. Galin said in a post on Facebook that he delayed his flight  and used air miles to secure a business class seat for himself and Viktor. After asking friends for help, he then sourced a 15-pound feline called Fibi, describing her as an “understudy cat.” When he presented the slimmer pet at check-in, she came under the airline’s limit of eight kilograms, or about 17 pounds, for animals flying in the passenger cabin. Mr. Galin and Fibi were approved for takeoff.  But unknown to Aeroflot and its staff, Mr. Galin swapped Fibi for his real pet, Viktor, before boarding the plane. Mr. Galin, unable to resist the temptation to capture the moment, took photographs and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.  Viktor, a brown cat with black stripes and long white whiskers, was snapped in a pet carrier in front of a glass of what appears to be sparkling wine. He was also shown being held up to the plane window by Mr. Galin, with Aeroflot’s branding clearly visible on the headrest. Those images eventually played a role in his downfall. The airline told Agence France-Presse that it opened an investigation after Mr. Galin’s post caught their attention, and that it eventually found video surveillance footage of the cat swap at check-in. “Aeroflot has taken the decision to take this passenger out of its frequent flier program,” Aeroflot told the agency. “All of the miles collected during his time in the program will be annulled.” According to news reports, Mr. Galin had nearly 400,000 miles on his account.  Aeroflot did not respond to requests for comment. In a message, Mr. Galin confirmed that his frequent flier account had been blocked, and said he found out about the penalty through news reports. The story of the cat swap became so widespread in Russia that it was even mentioned on Wednesday in a daily call between President Vladimir V. Putin and Russian journalists.  Mr. Putin said that the Kremlin did not comment about cats.  Mr. Galin justified his actions in his social media posts, saying that Viktor had become ill on the first leg of his trip, from Riga, Latvia, to Moscow. Two days later, before the second flight, from Moscow to Vladivostok, a fastidious employee weighed Viktor and declared him too tubby to continue to fly in the cabin. Mr. Galin was then offered the chance to check the cat into the hold. He said he had engineered the swap because he feared Viktor would be traumatized by such an experience and might not survive the eight-hour flight. Last year, a French bulldog named Kokito died after a flight attendant placed the animal in an overhead compartment on a United Airlines flight. The same airline faced questions in 2017 when an apparently healthy giant rabbit died in the cargo hold. Mr. Galin said he had spent the last two years working in Latvia and was flying home to Vladivostok with Viktor. He explained the cat’s unusual size was because of its breed, though he did not specify which one. And added that he had asked the person sitting next to him if they had any allergies. At the end of his post, Mr. Galin rewarded the thousands of people who had followed the story with a throwback snap to when Viktor was a kitten. “A photo of young Viktor,” he wrote. “When his weight still met the requirements of the airline.” Andrew Higgins contributed reporting.']",The airline found out about the trick after the Russian man posted photographs on social media.

Evo Morales and Bolivia: What We Know About the President’s Resignation,2019-11-12,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['Evo Morales was once regarded as Bolivia’s transformative leader, a defender of workers and Indigenous people and an icon to the global left.  Now, Mr. Morales has resigned, abandoned by most of his allies and countrymen — his tenure as Latin America’s longest-serving head of state suddenly cut short. His fall from power began with his pursuit this year of an unprecedented fourth presidential term in this landlocked South American nation. By bending election rules and declaring victory after a disputed election last month, he provoked weeks of nationwide unrest that reached a tipping point on Sunday, when a mutiny at a police station spread to nearly every major city. Formerly loyal unions, Indigenous groups and — crucially — the armed forces withdrew their support for Mr. Morales, and his seemingly iron grip on the Bolivian state crumbled in hours. He at first tried to quell the tensions by offering the opposition talks, and then new elections. But the offers fell on deaf ears. Isolated and visibly shaken, Mr. Morales on Sunday read a brief resignation letter. By Tuesday morning he had landed in Mexico. His departure from Bolivia, and the resignation of several top officials, had left his country polarized and leaderless. A member of the Aymara Indigenous group, Mr. Morales was born in a remote town in southern Bolivia. He rose to prominence as a labor union leader among coca leaf growers, promoting the rights of Bolivia’s Indigenous majority. His passionate defense of the growers — and of coca leaf farming as an intrinsic part of Bolivia’s Indigenous culture — led to clashes with the country’s conservative and overwhelmingly white political elite.  In 2006, he became Bolivia’s first Indigenous president since the country’s independence from Spain two centuries ago. He quickly moved to empower Indigenous people, redistribute the nation’s natural gas wealth and bring infrastructure to poor communities, measures that made him the most popular Bolivian politician in decades. Benefiting from the commodity boom in the 2000s, Mr. Morales transformed Bolivia, one of South America’s poorest nations, into one of its most dynamic economies, lifting millions out of poverty. Unlike his high-spending left-wing allies in Venezuela and Argentina, however, Mr. Morales combined redistribution with maintaining a balanced budget and wooing international investors. He easily won two re-elections, bringing political order to Bolivia, which had suffered chronic instability for decades. In recent years, Mr. Morales’s economic success was marred by increasingly authoritarian measures. He steadily tightened his grip on power, prosecuting opposition figures, packing the courts and electoral boards with allies and unleashing bands of his supporters to intimidate opponents. And he sought time and again to hold onto power. By 2016, when he had already spent 10 years in office, a majority of Bolivians decided Mr. Morales had overstayed his welcome, voting in a legally binding referendum to prevent him from running for another term. His party took the case to Bolivia’s Constitutional Court, which ruled that term limits would violate the president’s human rights. As he embarked on his fourth presidential election campaign this year, his formerly unassailable approval ratings began to melt, diminished by his aloof handling of disastrous wildfires and disdain for democratic procedures. The popular discontent finally erupted into protests after the vote on Oct. 20, when officials abruptly stopped releasing results and stayed silent for 24 hours. When the count resumed, electoral authorities declared that Mr. Morales had won outright and did not need to face a runoff.  The Organization of American States and the company contracted to count the votes both reported widespread irregularities in the election, and urged Bolivia to annul the results and take a new vote. Protesters filled the streets in most of Bolivia’s major cities, and strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. When security forces refused to confront them, Mr. Morales’s hold on power began to slip. After weeks of protests, the armed forces called on Sunday for Mr. Morales to quit to restore peace. Minutes later, he boarded the presidential plane with eight close aides and flew to the coca-growing region of Cochabamba, where his political career began four decades ago. After formally resigning in a national address, he disappeared from public view. In a few tweets, he accused the opposition of staging a coup. On Tuesday, he landed in Mexico, where he had been granted asylum.  Mr. Morales’s resignation provoked swift and polarized responses from leaders around the world, highlighting his complex legacy as a champion of the poor who later subverted democracy to cling to power. His international allies condemned his resignation as a coup by Bolivia’s bitter traditional elites; his detractors saw it as a victory for democracy. Prominent leftist leaders in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, who had formed a close relationship with Mr. Morales during Latin America’s “pink tide” of the 2000s, still professed their unwavering support. On Monday, the foreign minister of Mexico, which is led by a leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said that Mr. Morales had accepted an offer of asylum. Leading Western left-wing politicians, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, and former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece also sent strong messages of support. “To see Evo Morales who, along with a powerful movement, has brought so much social progress forced from office by the military is appalling,” said Mr. Corbyn. But the right-leaning governments in the region applauded his fall from power, describing it as the will of the Bolivian people. The United States voiced hope that Mr. Morales’s resignation would lead to new elections that are free and fair. Mr. Morales’s resignation left the country leaderless and in a constitutional crisis. One by one, many of the officials in the line of succession — those who could legally form a caretaker government — have resigned. The challenge has fallen to Jeanine Añez Chavez, an opposition politician and the Senate minority leader, who promised to call new elections swiftly and restore stability.  On Tuesday, she declared herself the president in front of the National Assembly, although Mr. Morales’s supporters, who hold a majority of the seats, were not present for her announcement. “I assume the presidency immediately and will do everything necessary to pacify the country,” Ms. Añez  told members of the assembly. Minutes after she spoke, Bolivia’s highest constitutional court issued a ruling that backed her assumption of power. In the streets, fears rose of increased violence by looters or by Mr. Morales’s supporters. On Monday night, the army was deployed in some cities — an action that reminded some Bolivians of the region’s history of military dictatorships. By Tuesday the country was calmer, but it was uncertain that Ms. Añez would be able to end the political standoff in the deeply polarized nation. From his exile in Mexico, Mr. Morales urged his supporters in the legislature to battle on, and members of his party said they would hold another legislative session on Wednesday to nullify Ms. Añez’s assumption of power.']","Mr. Morales was once a hugely popular leader, hailed by the nation’s Indigenous majority and the global left. Now, he’s been ousted from office, and it is unclear who will replace him."
Israel Kills Senior Islamic Jihad Commander in Gaza,2019-11-12,"By Isabel Kershner, Iyad Abuheweila and David M. Halbfinger","['JERUSALEM — In a surprise airstrike before dawn on Tuesday, Israeli forces killed a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group in the Gaza Strip, setting off waves of retaliatory rocket attacks that immediately raised fears of an escalating new conflict.  The timing of the attack, after a period of relative calm along the border and amid a protracted, high-stakes negotiation over who will lead Israel’s next government, led some critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to charge that it was politically motivated. Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the timing was dictated by Israel’s security chiefs, whose recommendation he had merely endorsed. Israel described the Gaza commander, Baha Abu al-Ata, as a “ticking bomb” who was “responsible for most of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s activity in the Gaza Strip.” Islamic Jihad said that the commander’s wife, Asmaa Abu al-Ata, was also killed in the 4 a.m. missile strike.  Before 6 a.m., militants in Gaza began firing barrages of rockets toward southern and central Israel from the Palestinian coastal enclave. Islamic Jihad called the Israeli strike “a declaration of war against the Palestinian people” and said, “Our response to this crime will have no limits.”  Schools were closed in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area as air-raid sirens blared and Iron Dome missiles intercepted dozens of rockets. Tens of thousands of Israelis took cover in bomb shelters.  Islamic Jihad also blamed Israel for another missile attack at dawn on Tuesday on the Damascus home of Akram al-Ajouri, describing him as a member of the group’s political bureau in Syria. Mr. al-Ajouri was reported to have survived. Sana, the official Syrian news agency, reported that a son of Mr. al-Ajouri and another person were killed. Mr. al-Ajouri is said to be the direct superior of Mr. Abu al-Ata. The Israeli military would not  comment on the Damascus airstrike. The fighting on Tuesday created an awkward situation for Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. While Hamas functions as the local government, with a strong political base, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has fewer followers and no responsibilities except to its patrons in Iran, has taken a harder line toward Israel. Hamas has tried for months to enforce informal cease-fire understandings with Israel — which Palestinian Islamic Jihad has often disrupted with rogue rocket or sniper attacks — in return for cash from Qatar. It now has to decide whether to raise the stakes by joining the group in avenging Mr. Abu al-Ata’s death, or to stand down in hopes of restoring calm. Hamas said that it, too, mourned Mr. Abu al-Ata’s death and that his killing would not go unpunished, but the group stopped short of saying it would join the fighting.   The Israeli military said Mr. Abu al-Ata was to blame for rocket fire on Nov. 1 and in August, and said he was being closely monitored recently because he was planning a specific new attack against Israel.  His name had cropped up frequently in the reporting of Israeli military correspondents — which an army spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said was no accident, and was meant as a warning. But some Israeli analysts suggested that an incident on Sept. 10, a week before the last Israeli election, may have sealed Mr. Abu al-Ata’s fate: When Mr. Netanyahu made a campaign stop in Ashdod — at a location announced in advance, breaking with customary security precautions — a rocket attack sent the prime minister and his entourage scurrying offstage to shelter. Amit Segal, a commentator on Israel’s Channel 12, wrote on Twitter that there had been an “invisible laser marker” on the heads of both Mr. Abu al-Ata and his Damascus superior from that moment. Militant groups in Gaza have clashed with Israel several times in recent years, with the last deadly conflagration taking place over several days in May. A devastating war in the summer of 2014 lasted 50 days and ended with a fragile cease-fire that has since been broken many times. Targeted strikes against militant leaders have led to war before, and Israel has sworn them off in the past. In 2012, an Israeli airstrike that killed Ahmed al-Jabari, the Hamas military commander at the time, became the opening shot of an eight-day war.  Colonel Conricus said the attack on Tuesday was timed to minimize the chance of other deaths or injuries. Some 190 rockets were fired on Israel over the course of the day. Dozens were intercepted by air-defense systems, the military said. At least one man was wounded by shrapnel, officials said, but most casualties were minor and involved people hurt as they raced to shelters or treated for panic or fainting.  Gaza health officials put the casualties there at 10 dead, eight of them militants, and 45 wounded. Israel refrained for several hours from additional strikes, saying it wanted to avoid an escalation, though it struck what it said were two Islamic Jihad operatives preparing to launch a rocket around 11 a.m. But with rocket launches continuing, Israel began more broadly attacking Islamic Jihad targets in the early afternoon, announcing the strikes on Twitter with the hashtag #JiHadEnough.   Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli general and former national security adviser, said he believed that the Damascus attack was also carried out by Israel, and said that Islamic Jihad personnel in Syria had a direct connection with Iran and gave instructions to the group’s members in Gaza. In the hours after the attack, masked militants of Islamic Jihad surrounded the two-story building where Mr. Abu al-Ata and his wife were killed. It is in Shejaiya, a neighborhood east of Gaza City that saw fierce battles during the 2014 war.  Mutassem Hilis, 23, a university student and a neighbor of the Abu al-Ata family in Shejaiya, said he was woken up by the blast, came out of his building and saw Mr. Abu al-Ata’s body on the sidewalk. One of Mr. Abu al-Ata’s young sons lay injured on the ground and was later driven off to the hospital, he said. The body of Mr. Abu al-Ata’s wife was found in a school opposite the family house. Within Israel, the violence Tuesday occurred in a moment of heightened political tension, as Mr. Netanyahu fights for his political life. He is leading a caretaker government after two elections, in April and September, ended inconclusively. He also faces a looming indictment in three graft cases, possibly by the end of this month. Benny Gantz, a centrist former Israeli army chief of staff who defeated Mr. Netanyahu in the September election, now is seeking to form a government and possibly force Mr. Netanyahu from power for the first time in a decade.  Mr. Gantz and others in his Blue and White party expressed support for the Gaza strike, about which he said he had been briefed in advance. He called it “a correct decision tonight for the security of Israel’s citizens and the residents of the south.” But other Netanyahu opponents charged that the Gaza strike was aimed mainly at aiding the prime minister’s bid to stay in power.  Omer Barlev, a Labor Party legislator, said Mr. Abu al-Ata had been in the military’s sights for a long time, adding: “Why did Netanyahu change his position now?”  And the leader of the mainly Arab Joint List, Ayman Odeh, wrote on Twitter: “A cynical man who lost two consecutive elections will leave only scorched earth in a desperate attempt to remain in office.” Tacitly acknowledging the need to address those allegations, Mr. Netanyahu appeared publicly alongside Israel’s military and internal-security chiefs. He said they had both recommended killing Mr. Abu al-Ata, and that his Cabinet had authorized it 10 days ago. “We tried to prevent his activity in various ways, but without success,” said Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the army chief of staff, explaining his recommendation to attack Mr. Abu al-Ata. In rare public remarks, the chief of the Israel Security Agency, Nadav Argaman, said Israel had been tracking Mr. Abu al-Ata’s movements for days as he moved from safe house to safe house. “He acted like a wanted man,” Mr. Argaman said. With Mr. Gantz running out of time to form a government, meanwhile, the flare-up, and his support for the government’s actions, appeared to raise the likelihood of a unity government in which he would join forces with Mr. Netanyahu, perhaps even with Mr. Netanyahu remaining prime minister for a limited period. The two met later Tuesday for what was described as a “security update.” Avi Benayahu, a former army spokesman, wrote on Twitter that Tuesday’s fighting amounted to “concentrated baking powder for a national unity government.” “Add in the early tip-off Gantz received about the action and the unreserved support for the operation from Blue and White leaders,” he added, “and you have a perfectly baked cake ready for eating.” Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger reported from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City. Ibrahim El-Mughraby contributed reporting from Gaza City.']",The Israeli strike prompted a wave of rocket attacks by Gaza militants after a period of relative calm.
A Ukrainian Billionaire Fought Russia. Now He’s Ready to Embrace It.,2019-11-13,By Anton Troianovski,"['KIEV, Ukraine — In the last five years, more than 13,000 people have died in a de facto war between Ukraine and Russia — a fight, many here say, to shake off the shackles of a colonial master and to move closer to the West. A crucial figure in the effort was a billionaire named Ihor Kolomoisky, who spent millions of dollars to field and equip fighters and helped stop the Russian advance in 2014. But Mr. Kolomoisky, widely seen as Ukraine’s most powerful figure outside government, given his role as the patron of the recently elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, has experienced a remarkable change of heart: It is time, he said, for Ukraine to give up on the West and turn back toward Russia. “They’re stronger anyway. We have to improve our relations,” he said, comparing Russia’s power to that of Ukraine. “People want peace, a good life, they don’t want to be at war. And you” — America — “are forcing us to be at war, and not even giving us the money for it.” His comments appeared to reflect, at least in part, his self-interested frustration that Western diplomats and the International Monetary Fund have been leaning on the president to prevent Mr. Kolomoisky from regaining control of the bank seized from him and a co-owner in 2016 amid allegations of a multibillion-dollar embezzlement. But whatever his motivations, Mr. Kolomoisky’s geopolitical views matter, because analysts and Western diplomats believe he has extensive sway with the administration of Mr. Zelensky, a comedian whose television shows were carried on Mr. Kolomoisky’s channel. While Mr. Zelensky continues to pursue closer ties with the West, he also appears to be prepared to engage with Russia more directly than his predecessor. Mr. Zelensky recently offered to meet with Mr. Putin without Western leaders present, the former president of Kazakhstan said Tuesday. In the impeachment hearings in recent weeks, American officials have described Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence as one of the biggest problems facing Mr. Zelensky’s new administration. The I.M.F. is reportedly holding up financing for Ukraine in part because of concerns that Mr. Zelensky is not doing enough to recover funds that Mr. Kolomoisky is accused of stealing from his Ukrainian bank, Privatbank, which cost the government in Kiev $5.6 billion to bail out in 2016. Mr. Kolomoisky, who denies any wrongdoing and says the government illegally seized his bank, has previously criticized the I.M.F. and what he sees as an excessively assertive Western role in Ukraine, insisting in an emotional interview — as he has in the past — that Mr. Zelensky should be prepared to default on the fund’s loans. But he described the impeachment proceedings now gripping Washington as a last straw, and he spoke in blunt terms about the logic of embracing Russia as a partner. It has become clear that the European Union and NATO will never take in Ukraine, he said, so it would be best to accept reality and not even try. “You all won’t take us” in the alliance, Mr. Kolomoisky said in the interview, in a conference room at his offices in Kiev. “There’s no use in wasting time on empty talk. Whereas Russia would love to bring us into a new Warsaw Pact.” Five years ago, Mr. Kolomoisky, now 56, had a far different perspective. With Ukraine under attack from Russian-backed separatists, the billionaire accepted an offer to become governor of his home Dnipropetrovsk region near the war’s front line. He financed a pro-government militia that held the battle lines before the regular army could deploy enough troops to keep the separatists at bay. As a fixture in Ukraine’s Jewish community, he countered the notion advanced by the Kremlin that the new pro-Western government in Kiev was run by neo-Nazis. In 2017, Mr. Kolomoisky left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government under then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized Privatbank and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy. He returned this past May after the election of Mr. Zelensky, the comedian whose hit sitcom about a good-at-heart teacher turned president of Ukraine appeared on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel. Mr. Kolomoisky now insists he still has no love lost for Russia, mentioning the mass famine in the 1930s as one of the tragedies that befell Ukraine because of its association with Moscow. But, he told The Times in a profanity-laced discussion, the West has failed Ukraine, not providing enough money or sufficiently opening its markets. Instead, he said, the United States is simply using Ukraine to try to weaken its geopolitical rival. “War against Russia,” he said, “to the last Ukrainian.” Rebuilding ties with Russia has become necessary for Ukraine’s economic survival, Mr. Kolomoisky argued. He predicted that the trauma of war will pass. “Give it five, 10 years, and the blood will be forgotten,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “I showed in 2014 that I don’t want to be with Russia,” he added. “I’m describing, objectively, what I’m seeing and where things are heading.” He said financing from Russia could replace loans from the I.M.F., which has pushed for anticorruption reforms that annoy Ukraine’s entrenched business interests. “We’ll take $100 billion from the Russians. I think they’d love to give it to us today,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “What’s the fastest way to resolve issues and restore the relationship? Only money.” For Mr. Kolomoisky, the enmity toward the United States is personal. He says he believes he is a target of the F.B.I., which is reported to have started a financial-crimes probe into his activities. Fiona Hill, the former Europe and Russia adviser at the White House, told lawmakers that she was “extremely concerned” by Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence with Mr. Zelensky. George D. Kent, a senior State Department official, said he had told Mr. Zelensky that his willingness to break with Mr. Kolomoisky — “somebody who had such a bad reputation” — would be a litmus test for his independence. And William Taylor, the acting ambassador in Kiev, said he had warned Mr. Zelensky: “He, Mr. Kolomoisky, is increasing his influence in your government, which could cause you to fail.” Mr. Kolomoisky said that if he were Ukraine’s president, he would proceed with the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. Asked if that risked exposing Ukraine to blowback if a Democrat were to win next year’s presidential election, Mr. Kolomoisky responded: “If they get smart with us, we’ll go to Russia.” “Russian tanks will be stationed near Krakow and Warsaw,” he said. “Your NATO will be soiling its pants and buying Pampers.” Mr. Zelensky campaigned on an anticorruption platform, pledging to rid Ukraine of the influence of the business tycoons who seized control of the country’s key assets after the breakup of the Soviet Union. He pledged that Mr. Kolomoisky would have no special sway over his administration. But there are mounting signs that Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence is rising, and the oligarch’s comments about the importance of rebuilding ties with Russia are likely to increase concern among critics of Mr. Zelensky who already believe that the president is prepared to undermine Ukrainian interests in his pursuit of a Kremlin peace deal. Mr. Kolomoisky said he was feverishly working out how to end the war, but he refused to divulge details because the Americans “will mess it up and get in the way.” Mr. Kolomoisky said he remains intent on regaining ownership of Privatbank or being compensated. He said those like Mr. Poroshenko responsible for the bank’s seizure must be punished, “and the death penalty must be brought back for them.” With international investors jittery over Mr. Kolomoisky’s role, Mr. Zelensky has insisted publicly that he will not return the bank to its former owners. “He knows it wasn’t stolen,” Mr. Kolomoisky countered, referring to the money Mr. Kolomoisky and his partner were accused of embezzling from the bank, which both deny. “He’s saying what you all want to hear.” Mr. Kolomoisky rejected the reports about his hidden influence on Mr. Zelensky’s government. But he warned that he was starting to believe that depiction of himself, and that he had the ability to make it come to life. “If I put on glasses and look at myself like the whole rest of the world, I see myself as a monster, as a puppet master, as the master of Zelensky, someone making apocalyptic plans,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “I can start making this real.”']",
Bolivia’s Interim Leader Pledges to ‘Reconstruct Democracy’,2019-11-13,By Clifford Krauss,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — The lawmaker who has assumed Bolivia’s interim presidency addressed her violence-torn nation on Wednesday and pledged to “reconstruct democracy,” even as the ousted Bolivian president called her government unconstitutional and his backers vowed to disrupt it. In her first televised address to Bolivia, Jeanine Añez Chavez, the senator who declared herself interim president on Tuesday, urged citizens to resume their normal lives after weeks of violence set off by a disputed election. She promised to seek “a national consensus.” And Ms. Añez rejected accusations from Evo Morales, who stepped down as president on Sunday with his country in turmoil, that her assumption of the presidency was illegitimate. Mr. Morales has taken refuge in Mexico. On Wednesday, with the backing of the military, Ms. Añez met with advisers to appoint a new cabinet. But outside, in the streets of La Paz, a scene of chaos was playing out, and it was clear that Bolivia remained deeply polarized and volatile four days after Mr. Morales, the nation’s first Indigenous leader, resigned amid claims of election fraud.  On Wednesday afternoon, after using tear gas to break up a peaceful protest by supporters of Mr. Morales, the police blocked about a dozen senators allied with the former president from entering the legislature. “Dictatorship! Dictatorship!” chanted the crowd accompanying the lawmakers. Less than an hour later, as tear gas wafted outside the government palace, the armed forces announced a shake-up of the high command. An army general, Carlos Orellana Centellas, became the new top commander of the armed forces and promised to take orders from Ms. Añez.  “We will guarantee the security of the constitutional government,” General Orellana Centellas said. Ms. Añez’s assumption of the interim presidency has won the backing of the country’s Constitutional Court. And Wednesday night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the United States “applauds” Ms. Anez for “stepping up” as Bolivia’s interim leader.  But Mario Galindo, a noted Bolivian political science professor, said the political situation was confusing and in flux. “At this moment, it is not clear who is in charge of whom,” he said. Under Bolivian law, he said, the senators who were barred from entering the legislature “had all the right to enter the senate and meet with whomever they wanted.” Supporters of Mr. Morales remained skeptical of Ms. Añez, accusing her and the opposition of having staged a coup. “We want Morales to return,” said one protester, Graciela Argollo, a radio station worker from Cochabamba, Mr. Morales’s stronghold. “Añez must resign. She’s not with the farmers and poor people.” Ms. Añez declared herself interim leader of Bolivia’s government before a special session of the legislature on Tuesday night. She had been next in line of succession after the resignation of Mr. Morales and a series of high-ranking officials on Sunday. Ms. Añez has said she intends to stay in power only until new elections can be held, in 90 days. But the session at which she claimed power was boycotted by supporters of Mr. Morales, who hold a majority. In Mexico City, Mr. Morales told reporters that Ms. Añez’s government was unconstitutional because the legislature had not approved his resignation.  Mr. Morales said he would return to Bolivia “if the people ask me to return to pacify” it, but he also said he was willing to bow out if it would unite the country and end the violence.  “Without Evo if they want, but without violence, because that isn’t the solution,” he said. “But it doesn’t depend just on Evo.” Mr. Morales also offered a defense of his record, citing the rise from poverty made by many members of Bolivia’s long-repressed Indigenous communities. He listed economic statistics to prove his success, down to the miles of roads that were paved under his presidency. “Continuity is important for the economic development of the country,” he said. Bolivia’s political crisis and widespread protests were set off by the recent election in which Mr. Morales, 60, declared victory in his quest for a fourth term.  His grip on power swiftly eroded amid accusations that the vote had been rigged. The Organization of American States, which monitored the elections, said that the Oct. 20 vote was marred by irregularities and that it could not validate Mr. Morales’s claim of victory. As the protests went on, some police units defected and joined the protests, and military officials called on Mr. Morales to resign.  A former media executive and conservative legislator, Ms. Añez quickly gained the support of the Bolivian Army’s high command, who visited her on Tuesday for a planning meeting at the government palace. Her backers released photos of members of the high command saluting her. The new government was welcomed enthusiastically by crowds in Santa Cruz, a longtime center of dissent against Mr. Morales, and other localities, though it appeared that few people know much about Ms. Añez, who had served in an obscure legislative post. “I can’t say that I like her or not,” Victor Pusari, the son of an apartment building porter, who was guarding the entrance of his central La Paz building, said on Wednesday. “But we need a leader, someone to be in charge.” Ms. Anez swore in an 11-member cabinet Wednesday evening in a ceremony at the government palace, in which she promised “an inclusive government.”  The cabinet included three women but no Indigenous people. Perhaps the most important member will be the new Economy Minister, Jose Luis Parada, an energy specialist, who will be responsible for reviving an economy weakened low natural gas prices and by recent road blockages and violent protests. Looting and clashes between the police and demonstrators across the country have left at least eight dead in recent weeks, according to Bolivian news reports. On Wednesday, Morales supporters descended on La Paz for a third day in a row from El Alto, a nearby mountain city with a heavily Indigenous population.  Chaos gripped the downtown as protesters set bonfires in the street and the police launched tear gas at groups of demonstrators. A mix of tear gas and smoke made the air difficult to breath. Stores were shut, and hotel employees handed out vinegar-drenched rags for guests who had been gassed. Some Bolivians said they were prepared to back the interim government. “When they come, we’re here to defend,” said Jarameel Armas, a university student who joined the police at a barricade of corrugated metal and heavy chains, referring to Morales supporters. “We will defend the new government and the democracy we have won.” Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.']","The leader, Jeanine Añez Chavez, appointed a new cabinet, but backers of the ousted Evo Morales have promised to disrupt the new government."
"Deal With Taliban Will Free American and Australian Professors, Officials Say",2019-11-12,By Adam Goldman and David Zucchino,"['WASHINGTON — The Afghan government and the Taliban agreed on a prisoner exchange that would free American and Australian professors who were abducted by the insurgents more than three years ago, officials on both sides said Tuesday. President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan said Tuesday that in return, the government would release three senior Taliban figures, including Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s military operations leader. The exchange — both government and Taliban officials said Tuesday that the transfer was imminent — would be a major step toward reopening peace talks between the United States and the insurgents. And some Afghan officials held out hope that the release would make the Taliban more likely to agree to an eventual truce. In a nationally televised address, Mr. Ghani said the exchange was intended to “facilitate direct peace negotiations.” But the Taliban have refused to negotiate with the Afghan government, which announced in October that it would not take part in negotiations with the Taliban unless a cease-fire had held for at least a month. The American, Kevin C. King, 63, and the Australian, Timothy J. Weeks, 50, both professors at the American University of Afghanistan, apparently were to be released after intensive efforts by the American special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, officials said. Mr. Khalilzad, an Afghan-born American diplomat, once served on the board of the university where the men taught. Mr. Ghani did not discuss the whereabouts of the two professors, who were abducted in Kabul in 2016, except to say that their health had deteriorated while being held. But it is unlikely that he would publicly commit to releasing Taliban prisoners unless the Taliban had provided evidence that professors were alive and had agreed to release them. Mr. Ghani said the decision had been a “tough but important decision.” His administration made it clear to the Taliban that any continued negotiations required the release of the hostages as a show of good faith as both sides look to end at least one chapter of the 18-year-old conflict. In addition to Anas Haqqani, Mr. Ghani said his government would release Hafiz Rashid, a senior Taliban commander who had equipped suicide bombers, chosen their targets and moved them from safe houses in Pakistan across the border into Afghanistan. Mr. Rashid, a brother of a member of the Taliban negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, was captured along with Mr. Haqqani in 2014. The third Taliban member to be released was identified by Mr. Ghani as Hajji Mali Khan, a senior commander and an uncle of the deputy leader of the Taliban. Taliban officials in the group’s leadership council said Tuesday that pending the actual exchange, more releases could soon follow from both sides. Afghan officials did not immediately confirm or deny that claim. As part of the negotiations, the Haqqani network’s main demand was the release of Mr. Haqqani, a young but prominent operative captured in a Persian Gulf country in 2014 and turned over to the Afghan government, which sentenced him to death. Mr. Haqqani is the brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is the deputy leader of the Taliban and also heads the Haqqani network, known for conducting suicide bombings. Though the Taliban and American negotiators had finalized a peace deal “in principle” in September, the insurgent group continued attacks across the country. This schism — between diplomatic assurances and what was happening on the ground — raised serious questions among American officials, who soon believed that Taliban leadership was either divided over the deal or could not control their lower-ranking fighters and commanders. While some have said those divisions are overplayed, and that not just the Taliban but both sides of the war were intensifying the violence, there remains an underlying uncertainty about the Haqqani network’s support of the negotiations. Some officials who have argued in favor of trading Anas Haqqani hope the move would be seen as a dramatic enough concession that the Haqqani wing would fully consent to scaling back their attacks across Afghanistan. The Haqqani network is based in the tribal areas of Pakistan, which may have played a role in the prisoner negotiations. Mr. Ghani’s announcement Tuesday came a day after a visit to Kabul by Faiz Hameed, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, Pakistan’s military intelligence service, and Suhail Mahmood, Pakistan’s deputy foreign secretary. The two professors were abducted in August 2016 by gunmen while they were traveling in their car. Shortly after they were kidnapped, Navy SEAL team members tried to rescue them from a remote compound in eastern Afghanistan. But the commandos missed the hostages by hours, officials said. In April, the military made another rescue attempt along Afghanistan’s eastern border with Pakistan but narrowly missed them again, officials said. In a 2017 statement, the Taliban said Mr. King had heart and kidney problems. In a video, one of two that the militants released, Mr. Weeks pleaded with President Trump to save him: “If we stay here for much longer, we will be killed. I don’t want to die here.” Mr. King’s illness was worsening, and he sometimes lost consciousness, according to the Taliban. “We have tried to treat from him time to time, but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” the statement said. Mr. Trump has made freeing American hostages a priority. The administration has managed to free about 10 hostages held in captivity overseas, using diplomatic leverage or relying on countries such as France and the United Arab Emirates to carry out high-risk military raids in Africa and Yemen. Robert C. O’Brien, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, continues to ensure these cases receive a high level of attention. Mr. O’Brien was previously the State Department’s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. But other high-profile hostages remain intractable problems for this administration, as they were in previous ones. The White House has been unable to win the freedom of Robert Levinson, the former F.B.I. agent and C.I.A. analyst who was abducted in Iran in 2007, or Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Another American held hostage, Caitlan Coleman, and her family were rescued by the Pakistani military in October 2017. She and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, had been held for five years. The two were abducted by the Haqqani network while backpacking in Afghanistan. Ms. Coleman had three children while in captivity, but a fourth apparently died. Another American, Paul E. Overby Jr., who disappeared in Afghanistan, is believed to be dead. Mr. Overby, who was 76 at the time and from Massachusetts, disappeared in Khost Province in May 2014 while trying to interview the leader of the Haqqani network. Mr. Overby had traveled repeatedly to Afghanistan and had written a book, “Holy Blood,” about the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Last year, the F.B.I. offered a $1 million reward for information about Mr. King and Mr. Overby. Officials are also hoping as part of the peace talks that the Taliban might be able to provide information about Cydney Mizell, an aid worker. She was abducted in Kandahar in 2008 as she drove to work, and was later killed. Her body was never recovered. Mr. King was born in Norristown, Pa., and grew up in suburban Philadelphia, a family member said. He attended the University of Miami, where he wrote for the school newspaper and studied communications. He later taught in Cambodia, Libya and Iraq. He first worked at the American University in Kabul in 2008, spending two years teaching English and returned to the country in 2014.']",
"How Russia Meddles Abroad for Profit: Cash, Trolls and a Cult Leader",2019-11-11,By Michael Schwirtz and Gaelle Borgia,"['ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar — The Russians were hard to miss. They appeared suddenly last year in Madagascar’s traffic-snarled capital, carrying backpacks stuffed with cash and campaign swag decorated with the name of Madagascar’s president. It was one of Russia’s most overt attempts at election interference to date. Working from their headquarters in a resort hotel, the Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term. Skirting electoral laws, they bought airtime on television stations and blanketed the country with billboards. They paid young people to attend rallies and journalists to cover them. They showed up with armed bodyguards at campaign offices to bribe challengers to drop out of the race to clear their candidate’s path. At Madagascar’s election commission, officials were alarmed. “We all recall what the Russians did in the United States during the election,” said Thierry Rakotonarivo, the commission’s vice president. “We were truly afraid.” Of all the places for Russia to try to swing a presidential election, Madagascar is perhaps one of the least expected. The island nation off the coast of southeastern Africa is thousands of miles away from Moscow and has little obvious strategic value for the Kremlin or the global balance of power. But two years after the Russians’ aggressive interference in the United States, here they were, determined to expand their clout and apply their special brand of election meddling to a distant political battleground. The operation was approved by President Vladimir V. Putin and coordinated by some of the same figures who oversaw the disinformation around the 2016 American presidential election, according to dozens of interviews with officials in Madagascar, local operatives hired to take part in the Russian campaign and hundreds of pages of internal documents produced by the Russian operatives.  The meddling in Madagascar began just a few weeks after Mr. Putin sat down with the nation’s president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, in Moscow last year. The meeting, which has never been reported, also included Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close confidant of Mr. Putin who was indicted in the United States for helping to orchestrate Russia’s effort to manipulate the 2016 American election, according to Mr. Rajaonarimampianina and another government minister present on the trip to Moscow. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any official effort to tamper with foreign elections. But his sit-down with Madagascar’s president — Mr. Prigozhin by his side — points to his involvement in Russia’s electoral interference in even the smallest, most remote countries. In some vital ways, the Madagascar operation mimicked the one in the United States. There was a disinformation campaign on social media and an attempt to bolster so-called spoiler candidates. The Russians even recruited an apocalyptic cult leader in a strategy to split the opposition vote and sink its chances. “What surprised me is that it was the Russians who came over to my house without me contacting them,” said the cult leader, known as Pastor Mailhol. “They said, ‘If you ever need money, we are going to pay all the expenses.’” But while Russia’s efforts in the United States fit Moscow’s campaign to upend Western democracy and rattle Mr. Putin’s geopolitical rivals, the undertaking in Madagascar often seemed to have a much simpler objective: profit. Before the election, a Russian company that local officials and foreign diplomats say is controlled by Mr. Prigozhin acquired a major stake in a government-run company that mines chromium, a mineral valued for its use in stainless steel. The acquisition set off protests by workers complaining of unpaid wages, canceled benefits and foreign intrusion into a sector that had been a source of national pride for Madagascar. It repeated a pattern in which Russia has swooped into African nations, hoping to reshape their politics for material gain. In the Central African Republic, a former Russian intelligence officer is the top security adviser to the country’s president, while companies linked to Mr. Prigozhin have spread across the nation, snapping up diamonds in both legal and illegal ways, according to government officials, warlords in the diamond trade and registration documents showing Mr. Prigozhin’s growing military and commercial footprint.  Last year, three Russian journalists were gunned down while investigating his activities there. “Prigozhin had tremendous success in 2016, and he is now the guy everyone is watching,” said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s got some boots on the ground, people peddling stuff in different countries in Africa. These are countries with authoritarian-style leaders who need a little extra help to win. And in return, he gets access to some of the goodies.” But Russia’s forays abroad have been far from flawless. For all its efforts, the operation in Madagascar missed its mark at first, plagued by a startling incompetence and corruption that undercuts Russia’s image as a master political manipulator. Campaign materials were riddled with grammatical mistakes. Ballpoint pens meant as election giveaways misspelled Mr. Rajaonarimampianina’s name. Some operatives appeared to undermine the campaign for their own personal gain, demanding fake receipts with double the actual price of publishing the newspaper so they could pocket the difference.  “They paid well, but they were messing around,” said the printing house owner, Lola Rasoamaharo. One person working for the campaign described packets of gold and precious stones piled on the bed in the room of a Russian operative, another sign that the people entrusted with the mission were often more interested in profit than politics. They also chose the wrong candidate. As it became clear that Mr. Rajaonarimampianina had little hope of winning, even with their help, the Russian operatives pivoted quickly, dumping the incumbent, whom they referred to as “the piano,” and shifting their support to the eventual winner, Andry Rajoelina. “The piano is very weak,” Yaroslav Ignatovsky, a manager of the operation, wrote to a colleague in a text exchange obtained by the Dossier Center, a London-based research organization. “He’ll never make it. But we have to make it somehow.” The maneuver worked. After the Russians pirouetted to help Mr. Rajoelina — their former opponent — win the election, Mr. Prigozhin’s company was able to negotiate with the new government to keep control of the chromium mining operation, despite the worker protests, and Mr. Prigozhin’s political operatives remain stationed in the capital to this day.  It all started with a secret meeting. News reports described Mr. Rajaonarimampianina’s three-day trip to Moscow in March, 2018, as mundane: He attended an investment forum, met a foreign ministry official and received an honorary degree from a local university. But at some point, his plans veered from the published itinerary. Slipping away from the press pool, he made his way to the Kremlin. There, in the private office of the Russian president, he met for no more than 30 minutes with Mr. Putin and Mr. Prigozhin. In an interview, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina explained that Mr. Prigozhin had set up the meeting, and even met him at the airport in Moscow. But he insisted that the presidential election, scheduled for that fall, was not discussed. Others remembered things differently. Harison E. Randriarimanana, a former agriculture minister who accompanied the president to Moscow, said that after the meeting his boss proudly announced that Mr. Putin had agreed to assist with his re-election campaign. “Putin said he wanted to help him,” Mr. Randriarimanana recalled the president saying. “He was going to help us with the election.” Just weeks later, local residents were startled by the sudden appearance of Russian operatives in Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital. The operation happened alongside an aggressive push by the Kremlin to revive relations with a number of African countries. For Moscow, Africa had been an important ideological battlefield during the Cold War, and Mr. Putin, who makes no secret of his nostalgia for the Soviet Union, views the continent as an important front for combating the West’s global influence. Last month, Mr. Putin played host to more than 40 African heads of state, including Madagascar’s, at a summit meeting in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi to showcase Russia’s growing stature as a player in the region and present his country as a partner preferable to the West.  “We see how a number of Western governments have resorted to pressuring, bullying and blackmailing the governments of sovereign African countries,” Mr. Putin said before the meeting. By contrast, he added, “Our African agenda has a positive, aspirational character.”  In recent years, a parade of African leaders have paid visits to the Kremlin, seeking lucrative deals with Russia’s giant state-run companies, including for weapons. In dollar terms, Russia is no match for China or the United States, which have tens of billions of dollars worth of economic investment in the continent. But for some leaders in search of a political edge, Russia has developed a handy tool kit, which is where Mr. Prigozhin comes in. After being indicted on charges of intervening in the 2016 American election, he has traveled the world, proffering his services. In Africa, he has found a highly receptive market. He and his operatives have been active in nearly a dozen African countries, including Libya, Sudan and Zimbabwe, analysts say. In the interview, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina described his meeting with Mr. Putin as run-of-the-mill for someone of his stature. During his tenure, he had met with the leaders of China and India, and twice visited the White House. But unlike those encounters, the meeting with Mr. Putin and Mr. Prigozhin was kept secret. Mr. Rajaonarimampianina insisted that he took “not one penny from the Russians” for his campaign, though he did not rule out that the Kremlin worked to assist him without his knowledge. “Everything is possible in politics,” he said. He stumbled a bit when shown a letter with his signature written to a Russian political operative named Oleg Vasilyevich Zakhariyash. In the letter, written in French and stamped “PROJET CONFIDENTIEL,” the president requests the Russian’s help “to resist attempts by international institutions to interfere” in Madagascar’s election. Western diplomats had, in fact, been concerned that the president was trying to delay the vote. “I am convinced,” the president’s letter said, “that certain forces will attempt to call into doubt” the election. Mr. Rajaonarimampianina confirmed that the signature on the letter was his and acknowledged meeting Mr. Zakhariyash in Madagascar, but he said he did not recall writing the letter. Mr. Zakhariyash, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, was later quoted by RIAFAN, a Russian news outlet connected to companies owned by Mr. Prigozhin, blaming the United States, Britain and France for interfering in the Madagascar elections. Local residents hired by the Russian operation in Madagascar described Mr. Zakhariyash as “the boss.” Likewise, one of the Russian unit’s internal spreadsheets identified him as the “head of department.” He is also one of two authors of a confidential report detailing plans for the Madagascar campaign, including the creation of a “troll factory” to focus on social media, echoing the tactics Mr. Prigozhin is accused of unleashing on the United States. The documents — along with text exchanges and emails between Russian operatives — were obtained and analyzed by the Dossier Center, a London-based investigative organization founded by Mr. Putin’s longtime nemesis, the former oil billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Through interviews with officials, candidates and local operatives in Madagascar, The New York Times independently confirmed much of the information in the documents, which the Dossier Center said were provided by moles working within Mr. Prigozhin’s organization. The spreadsheets name more than 30 Russians working in the country ahead of the election, calling them media managers, lawyers, translators and a “counterpropaganda technologist.” People in Madagascar hired by the Russians to work on the campaign verified many of the operatives’ identities.  Many of them appear to be from St. Petersburg, where Mr. Prigozhin’s so-called troll factory is based. But not all. Several worked for the Russian-backed separatist government in eastern Ukraine. One attracted attention earlier this year when his wife posted a photo of her battered and bruised face on Facebook, accusing her husband of beating her. Few appeared to have much expertise on Madagascar, or on Africa at all — and it showed, locals said. They often used a translation application on their phones to communicate and had little understanding of local politics. “They’re always going around with money, they’re always going around with women,” said one Malagasy man who worked with the Russians and feared reprisals. “They just thought it was all very simple in Madagascar. They arrived and that’s it, let’s go. That’s why it all fell apart.” Nearly two decades ago, André Christian Dieudonné Mailhol, the founder and pastor of the Church of the Apocalypse, said he received a message from God that he would be president of Madagascar one day. He did not predict, however, that three Russians would turn up like Magi on his doorstep 18 years later with an offer to help fulfill that prophecy. “They said that they came here to help me with the presidential election,” he said. The three gathered in his brightly painted living room in 2018, peppering him with questions: “How old are you? Why do you want to run for the presidency?” Pastor Mailhol explained God’s plan for him, and they offered him cash, promising to fully fund his campaign. They never fully explained who they were, he said, beyond giving their first names — Andrei, Vladimir and Roman — and never said what they wanted in return. Pastor Mailhol didn’t ask. “I just thought, a powerful country came to my house and suggested helping me. Why would I bother them with questions like, ‘Who are you? What are you here for?’” the pastor, 59, recalled. “No other foreign countries came to help me. They were the only ones, so I did not want to ask much. I was O.K. with that.” The strategy of supporting so-called spoiler candidates is another echo of the 2016 plot to subvert the American election, in which Russian social media bots encouraged support for figures like Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate — as a way, officials say, to draw votes away from Hillary Clinton. Pastor Mailhol said his Russian team wrote some of his speeches and paid for campaign posters and television advertising. On one internal spreadsheet, the “Pastor Group” is identified as Andrei Kramar, Vladimir Boyarishchev and Roman Pozdnyakov. Shown photos of the men from Facebook, Pastor Mailhol and his assistants confirmed they were the men who worked with his campaign. They made for a curious team. A photo of Mr. Boyarishchev posted to a Russian social media site in 2012 shows him shirtless, flexing his biceps and wearing the blue beret of a United Nations peacekeeper. Other social media posts suggest he served in a United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Pastor Mailhol said he spoke excellent French, which many educated Malagasy know well. The other two have equally colorful histories. In a Facebook post from a decade ago, Mr. Kramar describes himself as a member of Mr. Putin’s political party, United Russia, but later he popped up in eastern Ukraine as a functionary in a Kremlin-backed separatist enclave that has been fighting a war against Ukraine since 2014. Ukrainian authorities say the third operative, Mr. Pozdnyakov, is also involved with the pro-Kremlin rebels. His wife, once a United Russia member of Parliament, is the head of the separatist government’s election commission. Other presidential candidates in Madagascar gave similar accounts of Russians turning up out of the blue, some with bags of cash. Onja Rasamimanana, who worked for a history professor-turned-candidate named Jean Omer Beriziky, said she coordinated with a Maksim, an Anastasia and a Margo, who was the interpreter. “And then a Grigori showed up,” she said. “They were looking for fresh faces,” she said. “They didn’t explain anything. They didn’t mention anything regarding their motivations.” She said that her candidate, Mr. Beriziky, later told her the Russians offered $2 million in campaign funding, but ultimately provided less than half a million. Two Russians also approached a pop megastar running for president, Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo, also known as Dama. Over four meetings, Mr. Zafimahaleo said, the Russians tried to pressure him to support a delay in the election so that the incumbent had more time to campaign. “They made big promises,” Mr. Zafimahaleo said. “‘If you do what we want you to do, we’ll help your campaign,’” he said they told him. He refused, he said, suspecting that the Russians had come to exploit Madagascar’s natural resources. Only three of the Russian operatives identified by local hires of the campaign responded to requests for comment. All acknowledged visiting Madagascar last year, but only one admitted working as a pollster on behalf of the president. The others said they were simply tourists. Pyotr Korolyov, described as a sociologist on one spreadsheet, spent much of the summer of 2018 and fall hunched over a computer, deep in polling data at La Résidence Ankerana, a hotel the Russians used as their headquarters, until he was hospitalized with the measles, according to one person who worked with him.  In an email exchange, Mr. Korolyov confirmed that he had come down with the measles, but rejected playing a role in a Russian operation. He did defend the idea of one, though. “Russia should influence elections around the world, the same way the United States influences elections,” he wrote. “Sooner or later Russia will return to global politics as a global player,” he added. “And the American establishment will just have to accept that.” As the election approached, the Russians grew nervous and frustrated. In one text message, Mr. Ignatovsky, who helped oversee the operation, describes Madagascar as a “black hole.” One of his colleagues complains that “everything is ass-backward,” and that the “unhappy locals” were impeding the team’s work. But the Russians were setting off alarms, too. An op-ed in a local newspaper warned that after meddling in the United States, Russia had set its sights on Madagascar. “Russia badly wants to make good use of its impressive experience in destabilization” by intervening in Madagascar, the article said. “Vodka will flow like water if they achieve their goal.” Relations with the various candidates the Russians were backing began to sour. By September, they had dumped the incumbent, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina, deciding he was too unpopular to win, according to internal communications. In the interview in Paris, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina said he was aware the Russians were supporting other candidates and became indignant when told of the Russians’ conclusion that he was a losing bet. “How could they know that I will lose the election?” he said. In the first round, he received less than 9 percent of the vote, finishing a distant third. The Russians shifted their support to Mr. Rajoelina, a young former mayor who had been Madagascar’s transitional president after a coup in 2009. In the campaign’s final weeks, Pastor Mailhol said, the team of Russians made a request: Drop out of the race and support Mr. Rajoelina. He refused. The Russians made the same proposal to the history professor running for president, saying, “‘If you accept this deal you will have money,’” according to Ms. Rasamimanana, the professor’s campaign manager.  When the professor refused, she said, the Russians created a fake Facebook page that mimicked his official page and posted an announcement on it that he was supporting Mr. Rajoelina. The members of the so-called Pastor Group — Mr. Kramar, Mr. Pozdnyakov and Mr. Boyarishchev — were arrested and deported last year after organizing a protest in front of the French Embassy. They left without fully paying what they owed their local operatives, said Niaina Rakotonjanahary, the pastor’s campaign spokeswoman. “It happened to all of us who worked there,” she said. “We were so dumb.” As in the American election, it is not clear whether the Russians directly colluded with the eventual winner, Mr. Rajoelina, or simply operated a parallel campaign to support him. Before switching sides, the Russians had local hires write articles disparaging Mr. Rajoelina, according to one of the people who worked for them. “They asked me to write bad things about Andry Rajoelina — that he sold our lands to the Chinese,” said the person, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. “During the second round of the presidential election, though, they asked me to write good things about Andry Rajoelina.” Mr. Rajoelina declined to comment, but an official from his campaign said that his team was aware of Russian payments to other candidates. In the end, the Russians retained their prize — control over the chromium operation. They now maintain a staff of 30 in the country, including engineers and geologists. The contract gives them a 70 percent stake in the venture, said Nirina Rakotomanantsoa, the managing director of the Malagasy company that owns the remaining share. “The contract is already signed,” he said. “I am thankful the Russians are here.” Not all the Russian operatives appeared satisfied. In a moment of doubt, Yevgeny Kopot, a Prigozhin functionary who appears to play a coordinating role for operations in different African countries, sent a text message to a colleague in Madagascar in January. “Do you think that we’re disgracing our country?” he asked, according to texts obtained by the Dossier Center. “Or devaluing her name?” The colleague told him not to worry. “If you think about it,” she replied, “the whole planet is disgraced. Not the planet, precisely, but humanity.”  Gaelle Ramamonjisoa and Prisca Rananjarison contributed reporting.']",
Ugly From the Outset: Hong Kong’s Day of Widespread Violence,2019-11-11,"By Mike Ives, Elaine Yu and Edward Wong","['HONG KONG — Hong Kong was a city on edge on Monday following escalating violence, in which one demonstrator was shot point blank by a police officer and one man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters. At nightfall, both men were fighting for their lives in a city seething with resentments. Protesters have voiced outrage at police officers they see as increasingly resorting to force, and at a government they say has allowed them to act with impunity. Government supporters are embittered over the protesters themselves turning to violence and the damage it has done to their city. Months of unrest have thrown the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, and if Monday was any indication, there is no end in sight. Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled chief executive, said the mayhem could “take Hong Kong to the road of ruin” and denounced those who had set the man on fire as “enemies of the people.” The shooting of the protester set off outrage among many Hong Kongers. The young man was shot as commuters, snarled by roadblocks set up by demonstrators, looked on in disbelief. One moment, he was standing on a corner staring into the end of the police officer’s handgun. The next, after several shots rang out, he lay crumpled on the ground in the middle of an eerily deserted intersection. As blood pooled on the asphalt, a crowd of angry citizens surrounded riot police officers who had arrived as reinforcements. “Murderer!” some of them cried. An officer doused the crowd with pepper spray. Anger quickly unspooled across several districts in the city of more than seven million people, and the protests drew in both suit-clad office workers in the central business district and residents in working-class neighborhoods. The other spasm of violence Monday took place on an overpass across town from the shooting. There, a middle-aged man reprimanded a group of protesters, accusing them of lacking patriotism for the Chinese motherland. He was set ablaze. “Go back to the Greater Bay Area!” protesters shouted at him, using Beijing’s term for the region of southern China that includes Hong Kong and neighboring cities. The Hospital Authority said that both the protester who had been shot and the man who had been set on fire were in critical condition. On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemns “violence on all sides” and believes “the increased polarization within Hong Kong society underscores the need for a broad-based and sincere dialogue between the government, protesters, and citizenry writ large.” Ms. Ortagus also suggested the United States may no longer grant Hong Kong a favorable trade status different from that of mainland China: “Hong Kong’s autonomy, its adherence to the rule of law, and its commitment to protecting civil liberties are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,” she said. Tensions in Hong Kong had been building for days, following the death of a student  who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. Many protesters see the student as a martyr, casting his death as more evidence of excessive use of force by the police. They called for citizens to join in a strike on Monday, and to disrupt transit en masse during the morning commute. Events across the city, including classes at most of its universities, were canceled. The scale of the transit disruptions was not as large as a citywide strike that protesters staged on a weekday in early August. But the clashes between protesters and the police were intense by any measure; it was only the third time the police have shot a protester since the demonstrations began. Notably, some clashes occurred on the fringes of university campuses that have in recent months generally been off limits to such violence. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and glass bottles at police lines, while officers responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Thousands of black-clad protesters also turned up for a flash mob-style demonstration in Hong Kong’s central business district around lunchtime, creating a starkly surreal scene in an area filled with luxury malls. Some used orange traffic cones, bricks and wooden poles to set up barricades on main roads. On the side of a Giorgio Armani store, a video screen with an ad showing models parading down a runway was defaced with graffiti: “They shoot, they murder, they are well-paid.” Protesters, some of them office workers in full face masks, yelled insults at police officers along the same lines. “Shooting everywhere — you think you’re so cool?” one said to an officer, adding an expletive. “Have you killed someone yet today? Have you met your killing quota?” Marcus Lee, a 26-year-old lawyer in a charcoal gray suit with a blue face mask, stood with a group of protesters who were shouting at the police. “The gun wasn’t necessary, let alone firing shots,” he said, referring to the morning’s shooting. “You can see how people are reacting to this. They are angry. It’s just very ridiculous.” In the Kwai Fong district, one video showed a police officer on a motorcycle swerving into a crowd of protesters, clipping at least one of them. The police later said the officer had been suspended from front-line duties. As many Hong Kong residents prepared for their evening commute, the smell of tear gas lingered outside their office buildings. In an internal memo, the bank HSBC said that while it was still operating normally, its employees should “leave the office early and under safe conditions.” The months of protests started as a fight over an extradition bill that many residents of the onetime British colony feared made them too vulnerable to mainland China, which resumed control over Hong Kong in 1997. The protests morphed into a broader call for democracy and police accountability. Now, neither side seems to agree on what the future should look like — and neither seems willing to compromise. On Monday afternoon, the police urged protesters to stop threatening public safety. And they defended their actions. The authorities said that the officer who fired the three live rounds in the Sai Wan Ho area had acted in self-defense against protesters who had been trying to steal his revolver. “We certainly believe our officer did not have bad intention to hurt anyone,” John Tse, a top police official, told reporters. Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, said the protesters were engaging in “wishful thinking” if they thought they could pressure the government into making concessions with violence. “I am making this statement clear and loud here,” she said. “That will not happen.”']",
"Turkey Detains a Top Journalist Again, Signaling a Continuing Crackdown",2019-11-12,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — A Turkish judge ordered a prominent journalist detained again on Tuesday — only a week after he was released — signaling President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s intention to continue his government’s crackdown on dissent. The journalist, Ahmet Altan, was found guilty of terrorism charges last week and sentenced to more than 10 years in jail, but he was released for time served while his case was under appeal. Mr. Altan, 69, a former newspaper editor who wrote a novel during nearly three years of incarceration, was accused, along with the television journalist Nazli Ilicak, of sending a subliminal message during a televised interview to signal the start of the 2016 coup attempt. Mr. Altan’s brother, Mehmet, was acquitted in the case. They were among the most prominent journalists to be detained and charged with terrorism in the widespread government crackdown that followed the failed coup: Tens of thousands of people were arrested and 150,000 public servants were purged from their jobs. The journalists have been supported by an international campaign that has highlighted the lack of press freedom and freedom of speech in Turkey. Mr. Altan was taken by the police from his home in Istanbul Tuesday night. His lawyer, Figen Calikusu, said that neither she nor her client had been informed of the latest court decision to detain him again.  “We again learned about the decision from the media,” Ms. Calikusu wrote on Twitter. “The law is buried under cement.” A newly appointed judge in Istanbul sided with prosecutors on Tuesday and ordered Mr. Altan’s rearrest, a day after another court had rejected the prosecutors’ arguments. Mr. Erdogan has been accused of using the coup as an excuse to imprison political and social opponents. Turkey has been named by human rights organizations as responsible for imprisoning the largest number of journalists of any country alongside China.']","Ahmet Altan is one of the most prominent journalists to be detained in the widespread, and heavily criticized, government crackdown that followed a failed 2016 coup."
"Russian Professor, Found With Bag of Severed Arms, Admits He Killed Student",2019-11-11,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Oleg Sokolov, a Russian historian who made a career studying and impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte, liked to be called “Sire.” He also had a long history of seducing and being violent toward female students at a prestigious  university. “He thought he could do anything and looked down on the world around him as if he really were Napoleon,” said Lydia Nevzorova, the wife of a prominent Russian television personality who met Mr. Sokolov socially in St. Petersburg, Russia’s imperial-era capital. On Monday, however, the once haughty Mr. Sokolov, 63, sobbed uncontrollably as he appeared in a St. Petersburg court to express “deep repentance” for killing and dismembering his 24-year-old student and lover, Anastasia Yeshchenko. “I am devastated,” he said. On Saturday, Mr. Sokolov was fished out of the frigid Moika River in St. Petersburg — he had fallen in, drunk — along with a backpack containing the severed arms of Ms. Yeshchenko. A search of his apartment uncovered her decapitated corpse, and local news media said he had planned to dispose of his victim’s body parts in the river and then commit suicide, dressed as Napoleon, outside a St. Petersburg fortress. The gruesome saga, while echoing the dark passions of Russia’s second city explored by the 19th-century novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, has commanded huge attention in Russia as a very modern tale of crime and impunity. As former fans, including members of a military history society sponsored by the Kremlin, scrambled to distance themselves from Mr. Sokolov, Russia grappled with a troubling question: How did a man dogged for years by detailed accusations of violent bullying manage to keep his job as an assistant professor at St. Petersburg University, President Vladimir V. Putin’s alma mater and one of Russia’s most prestigious academic institutions? An online petition collected more than 20,000 signatures within minutes on Monday from Russians outraged that Mr. Sokolov had not been held to account earlier for his well-documented history of abuse. The petition demanded that university authorities be punished for failing to act on earlier complaints against him. These include a 2008 complaint by another female student turned lover, E.V. Ivanova, who detailed how Mr. Sokolov, furious that she wanted to end their relationship, had tied her to a chair in a rented Moscow apartment, beaten her repeatedly and threatened to disfigure her with a hot iron. She escaped and reported what she described as a murder attempt to the authorities. Nothing was done. Asked on Monday about the murder in St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the president had been informed about what he described as “this mad case.” Mr. Peskov said that “it looks like insanity,” adding that it was now up to investigators to determine whether anyone other than Mr. Sokolov was to blame. Many others, however, are blaming a law enforcement system that cracks down hard and swiftly on political opponents of the president but moves sluggishly, if at all, in response to reports of violence against women and other crimes. Alena Popova, a Russian campaigner against domestic violence, said in an angry statement posted on Facebook that Ms. Yeshchenko would not have been killed if Mr. Sokolov had been held responsible for his past abusive behavior. “If an abuser is certain that he can do everything, that ‘they will get him off even for murder,’ he will go berserk. We must not wait until a victim is killed, but prevent violence,” Ms. Popova said. There was also outrage over reports that Mr. Sokolov’s lawyer, Alexander Pochuyev, wanted to get his client to plead temporary insanity, which could limit his time in jail to just three years — less than the sentence recently handed down against a middle-aged Muscovite convicted of taking part in an illegal protest against Mr. Putin. The lawyer told Interfax, a Russian news agency, that Mr. Sokolov had confessed to murder but had killed his student “under some sort of strong influence.” In a brief court appearance on Monday, however, Mr. Sokolov indicated that he would claim self-defense, not insanity. The court ordered that he be held in custody until January. Fontanka, a St. Petersburg news site, reported that the historian told the court that Ms. Yeshchenko, with whom he had lived for several years and co-authored articles about Napoleon, had flown into a rage after being told that Mr. Sokolov would need to spend the weekend with his children.  “I have never seen such a stream of aggression,” he said, referring to an alleged “attack with a knife.” Russian police officers and judges are often sympathetic to claims by men accused of abuse that they were provoked into violence by their girlfriends or wives. Despairing of their country’s own legal system, in recent months Russian women have increasingly turned to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. The court, in its first such decision, this summer ruled in favor of a Russian woman, Valeriya Volodina, who had complained that police officers repeatedly ignored her pleas for protection from a violent former boyfriend. The Investigative Committee, Russia’s version of the F.B.I., released a video on Monday that showed a man said to be Mr. Sokolov crossing a dark street with a garbage bag containing some of Ms. Yeschchenko’s remains and then tossing it into the river. It also showed his apartment — filled with books, old military uniforms and other Napoleonic paraphernalia — and a sawed-off shotgun found there, which is believed to have been used to kill her. Mr. Sokolov has been accused of violence against male students, too. When a student asked him during a public lecture last year about plagiarism claims by a rival Napoleon expert, the historian ordered burly young men in the audience to drag the questioner from the lecture hall. The student said he was beaten and complained to the university, which declined to discipline Mr. Sokolov. After surviving years of scandal, however, Mr. Sokolov, who was awarded France’s Legion of Honor in 2003, has now been abandoned by even his strongest supporters. The Russian Military Historical Society, headed by Russia’s culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, removed Mr. Sokolov from its scientific council. The society, created by a Kremlin order in 2012, has played a leading role in promoting a nationalistic — and, critics say, highly slanted — version of Russian history. A French organization founded by a far-right politician, Marion Maréchal, a former member of Parliament and the niece of Marine Le Pen, the right-wing nationalist leader, announced over the weekend that Mr. Sokolov had been stripped of his membership of its own scientific committee. The organization, the Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics, was set up in 2018 by Ms. Maréchal, who visited St. Petersburg earlier this year to explore cooperation with Mr. Sokolov’s university. Ms. Nevzorova said she was not qualified to judge whether the historian was medically insane but added that he had always struck her as very strange and at times seemed to believe that he really was Napoleon.  “The dividing line between Napoleon and Sokolov disappeared a long time ago,” she said. “How did such a person keep his position? Who has been protecting him and why?” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.']","Oleg Sokolov, a Russian historian known for impersonating Napoleon, was dogged for years by complaints of abuse.

"Nigel Farage, Brexit Party Leader, Lends Hand to Boris Johnson. Mostly.",2019-11-11,By Stephen Castle,"['In a tactical retreat that could have important ramifications, Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s populist Brexit Party, on Monday promised not to run candidates in areas held by the ruling Conservatives. The move was expected to bolster Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s prospects in a topsy-turvy general election next month. Mr. Farage had been under pressure from his own supporters who worried that, by splitting the pro-Brexit vote, he might deprive Mr. Johnson of the victory he needs to pull Britain quickly out of the European Union.  However, the Brexit Party is still planning to fight seats currently held by the opposition Labour Party, and in doing so could draw away Conservative voters in the electoral battlegrounds of the middle and north of England. The Conservatives desperately need to grab Labour seats in areas there that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. So, while the partial pact helps the Conservatives, analysts do not think it will do so enough to decide the outcome of an election likely to determine whether Britain leaves the European Union at the end of January, as Mr. Johnson wishes, or holds another Brexit referendum next year.  Mr. Farage, who formerly led the U.K. Independence Party, has failed seven times to win a seat in the British Parliament, and said earlier this month that he would not make an eighth attempt himself, but would instead campaign in support of candidates around the country.  That will now be in significantly fewer parliamentary constituencies. “The Brexit party will not contest the 317 seats the Conservatives won at the last election,” Mr. Farage said in Hartlepool, a struggling town in the northeast of England that voted to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. “We will concentrate our total effort into all the seats that are held by the Labour party,” he said. The Brexit Party will also take on smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats that oppose withdrawal from the European Union, he said. Britain operates a winner-takes-all system for general elections with members of Parliament elected when they have the highest vote in a constituency. Mr. Farage had threatened to contest around 600 seats but on Monday said that he had been reassured by a “change of direction” from Mr. Johnson, who has ruled out any extension, beyond the end of 2020, of talks on future trade ties with the European Union. Most analysts predict that it would take significantly longer to put in place a trade agreement, and Britain has retained the right to extend the negotiations. This would mean staying under European Union trade rules and paying into the bloc. Though it helps Mr. Johnson, it is unclear how big a difference the Brexit Party leader’s new tactic will make. Analysts believe it could allow the Tories to hold more of the seats in south and west of the country where the centrist, anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats are challenging. The worry for Mr. Johnson was that, in these areas, the Brexit Party would siphon off some of his Conservative voters, providing the Liberal Democrats with a path to victory. But Mr. Farage will not help Mr. Johnson in the crucial electoral battleground, the so-called red wall of seats in the middle and north of England where a majority voted for Brexit. In these areas, where the Labour Party is strong, the Conservatives need to make gains — and Mr. Farage’s Brexit Party gives traditional Labour voters who want to leave the European Union an alternative to the Tories. It was never likely that Brexit Party, formed earlier this year, would have been able to make a credible challenge all around the country. The tactical retreat helps it concentrate its firepower.  Mr. Johnson told Sky News he had “absolutely not” made a deal with Mr. Farage, but did say he was “glad that there is a recognition that there is only one way to get Brexit done, and that is to vote for the Conservatives.” Critics seized on the Brexit Party’s announcement to suggest that the two parties were now umbilically tied. “A vote for Boris Johnson’s Conservatives is a vote for Nigel Farage’s politics,” wrote Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, on Twitter. Nick Boles, a lawmaker who was expelled from the Conservative Party for opposing Mr. Johnson’s Brexit policy, wrote that “there are millions of Conservative Remainers who, like me, were willing to back a soft Brexit. How will they react on discovering that Johnson’s Brexit deal is hard enough for Nigel Farage?” Ducking out of a national campaign means the Brexit Party can expect less media coverage than its bigger competitors. And Mr. Farage’s decision could increase pressure for anti-Brexit parties to increase their cooperation. So far, the smaller anti-Brexit parties have agreed to work together in a limited number of regions, though Labour — which is not committed to remaining in the European Union but wants a second referendum — has stood aloof. Patrick English, an associate lecturer at the University of Exeter, said Mr. Farage’s decision left  an uncertain picture.  “Brexit Party candidates standing in Labour-held Conservative targets will make it much harder for Johnson to flip them,” he said. “Therefore, Johnson’s quest for a majority still remains very much up in the air despite this announcement.” ']",Mr. Farage won’t run candidates in seats held by Mr. Johnson’s Tories. But his party may still hurt the Tories in other races. 
Exchanges of Fire Continue Across Israel-Gaza Border,2019-11-13,By Isabel Kershner and Iyad Abuheweila,"['JERUSALEM — Gaza militants continued to bombard southern Israel with rockets on Wednesday and Israeli forces struck back against targets in the Palestinian coastal enclave in a clash set off by Israel’s assassination of a senior Islamic Jihad commander on Tuesday. Though the death toll rose in Gaza and much of southern Israel was paralyzed by air-raid warnings, both sides appeared to be carefully measuring their actions.  After a quiet night and a resumption of hostilities early Wednesday, Israel and Gaza teetered between a quick resolution to this round of violence and a possible escalation — either intentional or through a misstep — that could lead to a much broader conflict. In a speech on Wednesday night, Ziad al-Nakhala, the secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, said that Israel was seeking a cease-fire and he laid out his group’s conditions for one, including an end to Israel’s targeted killings and a commitment to previous understandings on easing the blockade on Gaza. By midnight, the death toll in Gaza over the two days of violence had risen to at least 26, according to Palestinian health officials, including several civilians. Palestinian officials said more than 80 people had been wounded. The Israeli military put the number of militants killed at about 20. No deaths have been reported in Israel as a result of the rocket fire, which triggered multiple sirens on Wednesday and sent residents running for bomb shelters. But the Magen David Adom emergency medical service said it had treated dozens of people as a result of the rocket fire that began on Tuesday. A few were lightly injured by shrapnel; the rest were wounded while running for cover or showed stress symptoms.  The fight remained between Israel and Islamic Jihad, with Hamas, the larger militant group that governs Gaza, having stayed out of the fray so far. If Hamas were to start firing, the conflict would likely spiral down sharply, with Israeli officials warning of harsh consequences. Hamas sent mixed messages, issuing statements in solidarity with Islamic Jihad and the “resistance” in the name of the Joint Operation Chamber, a committee of all the militant factions in Gaza that at least nominally is managing the battle.  Analysts put Hamas’s continued restraint down to its probable desire for a quick return to its understandings with Israel that have led to relative calm along the border in recent months, as well as injections of Qatari cash for the organization.  Hamas’s reticence perhaps also attested to frustrations with Islamic Jihad. Israeli officials said the smaller group had repeatedly tried to disrupt the cease-fire with sporadic, rogue rocket fire over the last year and had specifically accused Baha Abu al-Ata, the commander who was killed along with his wife in a missile strike as they slept in their apartment before dawn on Tuesday, of directing the attacks. But standing by could also have consequences. One Israeli minister, Yuval Steinitz, warned that Israel would broaden its assault if Hamas did not act to rein in Islamic Jihad. Issuing a stern warning to Islamic Jihad, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was not looking for an escalation but would respond harshly to each rocket attack. “Islamic Jihad would do well to understand this right now, instead of when it will be too late,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of a special cabinet meeting. “I believe that Islamic Jihad is starting to internalize this message. They understand that we will continue to strike them without mercy. They understand that Israel is very strong and that our will is very great.” The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, said his organization was working “to urgently de-escalate the situation.” “The indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars against population centers is absolutely unacceptable and must stop immediately,” Mr. Mladenov said in a statement.  Islamic Jihad’s military wing took responsibility for all the rocket fire in a statement on Wednesday. But Islamic Jihad appeared to have scaled back the range of its rocket fire, if not the intensity of its barrages, in response to the killing of Mr. Abu al-Ata. Most rockets and mortar shells appeared aimed at Israeli cities and communities within a few miles of the Gaza border, with the militants refraining from firing at the populous Tel Aviv area to the north, as they did initially on Tuesday.  In addition to the attack that killed Mr. Abu al-Ata, the group also blamed Israel for the attempted assassination of Akram al-Ajouri, an Islamic Jihad leader whose home in Damascus, Syria was also hit by an airstrike before dawn on Tuesday. The group said its “account with the Zionist enemy is still open,” adding, “our jihad is ongoing and our operations are continuing.” Israel has remained silent about the attack on Mr. al-Ajouri, which killed his son and another man, neither taking nor denying responsibility.  The Israeli military said on Wednesday that it was limiting its airstrikes to Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza, including infrastructure, weapons manufacturing facilities and rocket-launching crews. The military said it also struck one squad that was preparing to fire anti-tank missiles.  Still, the situation remained highly volatile. Islamic Jihad made it clear on Tuesday that its real revenge for the killing was yet to come, suggesting that the rocket fire was just a prelude. And the more the death toll rose in Gaza, the more likely that Hamas would come under pressure to get involved. In Gaza, schools and most businesses remained closed and people mostly kept indoors, wary of Israeli strikes and the danger of misfired rockets falling short of the border.  Three civilians, Rafat Ayyad and his two sons, Islam and Amir, one of them a young child, were killed in an airstrike as they rode on a motorcycle in a residential district of Gaza City on Wednesday morning, according to relatives. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said he did not have details of what happened in that case. But he added that the military was taking “extensive measures, both intelligence-wise and operationally, and in the choice of munitions we use, to minimize to the greatest extent possible any harm to noncombatants.” Many Gazans said they wanted to see the militant groups respond harshly to deter Israel from carrying out further assassinations after the killing of Mr. Abu al-Ata.  “This was a cowardly act,” said Ismail Al-Khour, 30, a mechanic in Gaza City. “The resistance must bomb them and the occupied lands.” Israeli schools within a 25-mile radius of the Gaza border were closed for a second day on Wednesday. After dusk, the authorities instructed the residents of communities close to the Gaza border to stay near their safe rooms and bomb shelters amid almost constant rocket fire.  Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system intercepted most of the rockets headed toward population centers, but one house in the coastal city of Ashkelon suffered a direct hit and a woman was moderately injured.  Israel’s newly appointed defense minister, Naftali Bennett, issued his own warning to enemies on all fronts on his first day in the post, saying, “Whoever plans to harm us by day will never be sure that they will make it though the night.”  Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City.

"Venezuela’s Ex-Spy Chief, Wanted in U.S., Is Missing in Spain",2019-11-13,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — The Spanish police said on Wednesday that they were searching for Hugo Carvajal, the former intelligence chief of Venezuela, after Spain’s national court reversed an earlier decision and ordered the extradition of Mr. Carvajal to the United States to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges. The search for Mr. Carvajal is the latest twist in an international game of cat and mouse since the Spanish police first detained him last April. He was released from a Spanish jail in September after the American extradition request was first rejected. The court ruled that the claims made against him were too “abstract” to establish his individual involvement in drug trafficking.  Last September, the Spanish court also accepted the defense’s argument that the American request was politically motivated, saying that the United States wanted to extradite Mr. Carvajal because the move would be “within the American political strategy toward Venezuela.” Spanish prosecutors appealed, however, and the ruling was reversed last week, reactivating the arrest warrant for Mr. Carvajal. A spokesman for the national court said that details of the ruling were not yet public, so it remains unclear why the decision was changed.  On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Spanish national police said that officers were trying to find Mr. Carvajal. Maria Dolores de Argüelles, a Spanish lawyer representing Mr. Carvajal, said that she had no idea where her client was and had also been unable to reach his wife by phone.  But Mr. Carvajal could not be considered a fugitive, Ms. de Argüelles said, since she had yet to receive a document from the court confirming that it had agreed to extradite him. “That some people should know about a court decision before the court even informs the parties is simply incredible,” she said by phone.  Mr. Carvajal, known by the nickname El Pollo, or “The Chicken,” served for several years as the military intelligence chief under Hugo Chávez, the former leader of Venezuela. He was also a lawmaker in the governing Socialist party before an abrupt fallout with the current leader, Nicolás Maduro.  In February, Mr. Carvajal urged the military to break with the president and instead side with Mr. Maduro’s main opponent, Juan Guaidó. Amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, Mr. Maduro has managed to hold on to power and has resisted pressure from Mr. Guaidó and other opponents, including the United States, to step down. Mr. Guaidó has been recognized as the legitimate president by the United States and several other Western governments.  The United States Justice Department said that in April 2006, Mr. Carvajal coordinated the transportation of about 6.2 tons of cocaine to Mexico from Venezuela, according to charges filed in federal court in New York.  He would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life if convicted. After Mr. Carvajal was detained in Spain last April, he claimed during his extradition hearing in Madrid that the drug charges against him had been fabricated.  Spain has become one of the main safe havens for members of the Venezuelan opposition and defecting members of the Socialist party who have fled their country as the political situation and economic problems there have spiraled out of control.']","A Spanish court ordered the extradition of Hugo Carvajal, who broke with Nicolás Maduro’s government.

Hong Kong Protests Roil City as Universities Cut Semester Short,2019-11-13,"By Mike Ives, Elaine Yu and Katherine Li","['HONG KONG — Two Hong Kong university campuses cut their semesters short on Wednesday because of widening unrest, as residents navigated severe transit disruptions and office workers brawled with the police in the heart of the financial district. This week’s disruptions are notable because they have strained the city’s infrastructure for three straight workdays, forcing commuters to choose whether to venture outside and risk being caught up in clashes and tear gas. The protests started in June over an extradition bill that has since been withdrawn, and have morphed into broader demands for democracy and police accountability. Schools and universities have become flash points. A day after young demonstrators staged a fiery standoff against the police on the fringes of a university campus, classes were called off there on Wednesday for the remainder of the fall semester. Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.  Student demonstrators with umbrellas, masks, bricks and shields geared up on Wednesday at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a campus that has become a focal point of the confrontation between protesters and the police. CUHK also became one of at least two Hong Kong universities to announce that on-campus classes would be canceled for the remainder of the fall semester. The other, Hong Kong Baptist University, said in an email to students and staff that on-campus classes would be postponed or conducted online. At the fringes of the CUHK campus on Tuesday night, police officers in riot gear on the fringes fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas at demonstrators who set a giant blaze and threw gasoline bombs. The clash lasted for hours and left dozens injured. Student activists at CUHK and other universities say they are defending their campuses from police intrusion. The police assert that they have to stop demonstrators from blocking roads, throwing bricks or trying to disrupt rail services.  John Tse, a top police official, told reporters on Wednesday that the police force believed CUHK was being used as a “factory” to manufacture gasoline bombs, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons for use against officers.  “This necessitates police response and the use of force, including rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and tear gas for dispersal,” he said.  Since the protests began, the movement has been driven in large part by high school and university-age students. But until recently, campuses were a relative safe zone from violent clashes. John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary for security, defended the police on Wednesday. Universities were not meant to be “breeding grounds for violence,” he told reporters. “If someone sees violence and does not stop it, then that person becomes an accomplice.” The Education Bureau said on Wednesday morning that it was up to parents whether their children attended school, and that schools should keep their campuses open regardless. The statement immediately prompted criticism from unions on opposite sides of the city’s political spectrum. The bureau later said that all classes at Hong Kong kindergartens, primary and secondary schools would be suspended on Thursday. Large groups of riot police officers disrupted a rally in the city’s financial district around lunchtime on Wednesday, making multiple arrests and beating protesters with batons.  Many of the protesters were there to support the students who had been battling the police at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday. Office workers in suits and ties formed a human supply chain to move water and umbrellas to front-line protesters. When the police swooped in and started beating protesters, the crowd fought back, and a brawl erupted outside a luxury mall that houses an Apple store.  By early afternoon, the streets around the mall had the feel of a militarized zone, and were deserted except for a handful of officers, workers and tourists taking pictures. After the police retreated, protesters spent much of the afternoon sprinkling the financial district with stone-and-bamboo barricades. The police began clearing those barricades in the evening, crushing some with an armored vehicle. But in other parts of town, protesters set fires, built more barricades and clashed with officers into the night. The Chinese central government’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong condemned the flare-up of protest violence, warning in a statement issued online late Tuesday that months of protests had “pushed Hong Kong into an extremely dangerous place.” “This murderous conduct in broad daylight is brazen terrorism,” the office said of a man who was set alight by protesters on Tuesday. “This shows absolutely no bottom line in behavior, absolutely no humanity or morality, and absolutely no fear of the law.” The most likely scenario now is that the Hong Kong government will more broadly invoke the city’s emergency regulations ordinance, said Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semiofficial advisory body set up by Beijing.  The Hong Kong government invoked the colonial-era ordinance last month to ban face masks at public gatherings. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Lau said it might be used again to enact a curfew, although the question of how the police would enforce it remained unclear. “If people defy a curfew, do you use live ammunition to enforce it?” he said. “That is the decision to be made — the government is still very reluctant to do it.” The Hong Kong police said on Wednesday that some of the city’s marine police officers had been deployed to help evacuate mainland Chinese students who attend CUHK. China’s Communist Youth League, the youth division of the ruling Communist Party, offered the students seven days of free accommodation at its lodgings in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city that lies just over the border from Hong Kong. The protesters who clashed with the police outside the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday were angry over the police shooting of a young demonstrator at point-blank range on a street corner a day earlier. (He was in serious condition as of Tuesday.) The police force said it had arrested 142 people across Hong Kong on Tuesday, and that officers fired 1,567 rounds of tear gas, 1,312 rubber bullets and 380 bean bag rounds. Tensions had been building after the death last week of a student who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. Many in the protest movement now see the student, Chow Tsz-lok, as a martyr. Hong Kong’s youth are angry over what they see as a steady erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule as well as the city’s sky-high cost of living. They also fear that their city’s unique culture and identity will be gradually subsumed by growing mainland Chinese influence. There were widespread transit disruptions across the Asian financial center Wednesday morning, marking the third straight day that protesters had impeded some of the city’s essential infrastructure. Tiffany May, Keith Bradsher, Ezra Cheung, Austin Ramzy, Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.']",There were severe public transit disruptions a day after demonstrators staged a fiery standoff against the police.
Australian Fire Officials Say the Worst Is Yet to Come,2019-11-11,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — More than 85 fires burned across Australia’s east coast on Tuesday, 40 of them out of control, as officials warned that catastrophic conditions would worsen through the afternoon and evening, with intensifying winds blowing flames toward larger cities and towns.  More than 100,000 homes are at risk over the coming days as a combination of drought, heat and blustery winds bears down on New South Wales, the country’s most populated state.  “The conditions are expected to get worse,” Shane Fitzsimmons, the Rural Fire Service commissioner, said on Tuesday afternoon in Sydney. “There’s still a way to go before they reach the potential of the forecast.”  “Complacency kills,” he added. “We cannot afford to be complacent.”  The fires, which began burning in earnest over the weekend, have caused four deaths and destroyed more than 150 properties, with a handful more added every few hours.  Maps from fire officials showing the areas likely to burn showed blazes potentially doubling in size over the next 24 hours, with Coffs Harbour, a coastal city of 70,000 people, looking especially vulnerable, along with Sydney’s outer suburbs.  And as an especially hot day wore on, with temperatures far above seasonal norms, the fires also continued to set off emotional arguments about climate change.  A day after the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said that only leftist “lunatics” were linking the blazes to climate change, mayors from the areas already burning demanded that lawmakers pay attention to common-sense science and public outrage. “They need to get out and have a real look at what’s happening to this country,” said Claire Pontin, the deputy mayor of the MidCoast Council.  Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, where two people died over the weekend, said: “It is not a political thing — it is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. I think that Michael McCormack needs to read the science.” Across the region, the day began with preparations for the increased fire risk.  More than 600 schools and education centers across New South Wales, and a number in neighboring Queensland, canceled classes Tuesday. Several other schools evacuated students Tuesday as the threat of fire approached. Commissioner Fitzsimmons said there were around 100 aircraft ready to help the roughly 1,500 firefighters already posted at blazes across New South Wales. The equipment includes Australian Defense Force helicopters that will fly night missions over Sydney and the wider area to help firefighter movement and possible civilian rescues. Some larger planes have come from California under a sharing deal that’s been in place since 2001.  In Sydney’s suburbs near the Blue Mountains, where a devastating fire destroyed hundreds of homes and left two people dead in 2013, residents reported packing their cars with clothes, water and essentials in case they needed to flee. Farther north, where fires continued to rage, evacuation centers have been filling up with residents fleeing to safety.  Conditions were expected to ease somewhat on Wednesday in New South Wales, with temperatures cooling and winds slowing, but the fire threat was expected to remain for several days.  An omen for the current fire season came in September, when a historic lodge in a rain forest burned nearly to the ground. The areas where fires were raging as of Tuesday morning, north of Sydney near Port Macquarie and the Queensland border, have been suffering from a lengthy drought. But scientists note that moisture levels of live trees and shrubs around Sydney are also at record lows — even lower than the levels during the Black Christmas fires of 2001, which destroyed more than 500 buildings on the edge of Sydney and burned for three weeks. Given the drier-than-normal conditions, there is fuel both on the ground, with dry leaves, and in the branches of trees that are dying or dead. And if something ignites, high winds threaten to carry the flames far and wide.  On Tuesday, the federal Bureau of Meteorology reported that winds were already starting to reach 70 kilometers per hour, or 43 miles per hour, with gusts in excess of 90 kilometers per hour.  “It’s not just out in the bush, because many people in cities are right on that edge,” said Lesley Hughes, a biology professor at Macquarie University who works with the Climate Council of Australia. “Everybody loves to live in the bush and around the bush — it’s becoming an increasingly dangerous place.” Despite several months of mass protests drawing attention to the Australian public’s concerns about climate change, the country’s deputy prime minister on Monday dismissed questions about its role in the fires.  In an interview with ABC Radio National, the official, Michael McCormack, said it “galls” him when people raise climate change in relation to bush fires. He said global warming was a concern of “raving inner-city lunatics.” Scientists, firefighters and mayors immediately responded. Many pointed out the clear connections between climate change and the extended and more intense fire seasons in Australia, California and other places around the world.  “Fires are burning in places and at intensities never before experienced,” Greg Mullins, a former fire and rescue commissioner in New South Wales, wrote in an op-ed article for The Sydney Morning Herald, citing rain forests in northern New South Wales, tropical areas of Queensland and the “formerly wet old-growth forests” of Tasmania.  He also said that thunderstorms caused by fires — known as “pyro-convective” events — were rare in the past but were now happening regularly.  Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and writer from the Australian National University, said it was clear that “there’s a human fingerprint on the temperature increases since 1950 — all the weather patterns are occurring in a planet that is warming and warming because of human activity.” By dismissing the role of climate change, she said, the government was choosing immediate disaster response over long-term needs.  “We’re really missing the opportunity to prepare for future life in Australia,” Dr. Gergis said.  “It’s going to be a lot warmer, and we’re going to see a lot of prevalence of extreme fire conditions,” she added. “The further we kick the can down the road and avoid these conversations, we’re really missing the opportunity to get the Australian public ready for what is upon us.” Jamie Tarabay, Isabella Kwai and Sasha Gattermayr contributed reporting.']","Dozens of blazes, many of them out of control, are burning from the Sydney suburbs to areas hundreds of miles north around Byron Bay."
Saudi Anti-Extremist Force Names Feminists as a Target. Briefly.,2019-11-13,By Megan Specia,"['Saudi Arabia’s state security agency released a video last week on an official government Twitter account that listed feminism, homosexuality and atheism among ideologies that fell into the category of “extremism.”  “Extremism in all its forms is a societal scourge,” read the message that accompanied the video, posted to the account of the General Department for Counter Extremism, which showed animated depictions of a long list of views subject to punishment. But the clip and tweet were abruptly removed on Tuesday, and the agency in charge of the department and the broader leadership attempted to walk its message back. The video and its removal are the latest signs of complications as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, attempts to present a sweeping overhaul of the social system in a country whose authorities have been steeped in ultraconservative policies for decades. Prof. Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi anthropologist at the London School of Economics, said the incident was emblematic of the internal power struggles and of changes being imposed from on high that have been slow to filter down. “It’s just symptomatic of the confusion that is taking place in Saudi Arabia,” she said. “It’s like for centuries we wanted you to be pious, religious and we imposed every restriction on you — now we want you to be open and we want to lift all of the restrictions.” The notoriously repressive nation has long drawn condemnation for governing based on an austere interpretation of Islam that includes strict social codes. But since 2017, Prince Mohammed has moved to ease some social restrictions, introduce a more moderate form of Islam and diversify the oil-driven economy. A ban on female drivers was lifted, parts of the kingdom’s restrictive guardianship system were rolled back to give women more freedom, and efforts have been made to expand the entertainment and tourism sectors.  But crackdowns on dissent have continued, with scores of activists detained, including a number of prominent women’s rights activists. Reports from their families indicate that they have been subject to torture. There are still strict norms around social conduct, and allegations of rights abuses are rife. The country also found itself at the center of international outrage after the killing of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi by operatives linked to Prince Mohammed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi Presidency of State Security — which is made up of the kingdom’s counterterrorism and domestic intelligence services — issued a statement on Tuesday calling the content in the video shared on Twitter “inaccurate” and said it “contained many mistakes in defining extremism.”  The agency also denounced as “untrue” a report in a state-run outlet, Al Watan, which said that feminists could be jailed and flogged. The government-run Saudi Human Rights Commission also issued a statement confirming that “feminism was not criminalized in Saudi Arabia and that the kingdom accorded the greatest importance to women’s rights.”  But many have accused the Saudi government of hypocrisy for denouncing the video while keeping women’s rights activists behind bars.  Iyad el-Baghdadi, a pro-democracy activist and vocal critic of Prince Mohammed, asked in a tweet: “If women’s rights are so important, why are Saudi Arabia’s top women’s rights activists in prison?” Professor al-Rasheed said that although it was nearly impossible to know why the initial video was so out of line with the later statement, the law could have been presented to offer an explanation for the harsh treatment of detained women’s rights activists. Loujain al-Hathloul and Aziza al-Yousef are among the women imprisoned over their activism. They are said to have been tortured and subjected to physical and sexual violence, and Professor al-Rasheed suggested that the video could be a way to justify their treatment.  Professor al-Rasheed disagreed with widespread speculation that the video had been removed because of international pressure, saying the reversal was more likely to be a sign of a bureaucratic rift.  “It’s about a confusion. It’s about forces in the government service who may be there to embarrass him. It’s not about the outside world making a big fuss about it,” she said. “I think it’s a serious problem symptomatic of perhaps a fomenting dissent against Mohammed bin Salman.” In a statement after the removal of the video, the security agency blamed a single person who prepared and published the video, saying he had “acted wrongly and on his own behalf.” “The person was brought in for investigation, and steps were taken to deal with the social media hierarchy in order to ensure that such mistakes were not made again,” the agency said. The initial article from Al Watan outlining punishments for feminists has also been removed.  But few believe the video and report could have been created and published without the knowledge of more senior figures in the government, and rights groups say the publication of the video showed an undercurrent of intolerance in Saudi Arabia.  Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa director, called the video “outrageous” in a statement on Tuesday.  “This announcement is extremely dangerous and has serious implications for the rights to freedom of expression and life, liberty and security in the country,” Ms. Morayef said. “It peels away the veneer of progress under Mohammed bin Salman and reveals the Kingdom’s true intolerant face which criminalizes people’s identities, as well as progressive and reformist thoughts and ideas at home.”']","The appearance and disappearance of an inflammatory official video is likely to reflect divisions within the government, experts said.

"James Le Mesurier, Backer of Syrian White Helmets, Is Found Dead in Turkey",2019-11-11,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — A British man who was a critical player in creating and sustaining the Syrian civil defense group known as the White Helmets was found dead in Istanbul on Monday, a group official said. The Briton, James Le Mesurier, was the founder and director of Mayday Rescue, a nonprofit group that has supported, funded and trained the White Helmets, a volunteer group that has gained international renown for rescuing wounded civilians during Syria’s civil war. Mr. Le Mesurier’s body was found early Monday in the Beyoglu neighborhood of Istanbul, outside a building where he kept an apartment and office, said Raed Saleh, the lead organizer of the White Helmets. “James was a real friend, and it’s a big loss,” Mr. Saleh said. He said that Mr. Le Mesurier’s wife had told the organization about his death. “His death doesn’t mean the White Helmets will stop,” he added. “It will continue.” The circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Le Mesurier, who has been the target of repeated online disinformation campaigns about his ties to the White Helmets, were unclear Monday afternoon. Turkish news outlets reported that the police suspected he had died after falling from a height.  The Istanbul authorities said they had started an investigation. Mr. Le Mesurier, a former British soldier and intelligence officer, arrived in Turkey in late 2012 as the Syrian civil war was raging across the border, hoping to help establish emergency response and civil police groups in areas held by rebels fighting to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad. He created Mayday Rescue, which took volunteers from Syria to southern Turkey for medical and emergency response training, provided them with equipment and supplied financial support. According to its website, Mayday, a nonprofit group, receives funding from the United Nations and international donors including Britain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States and the Qatar Fund for Development. The volunteers formed Syria Civil Defense, which came to be known as the White Helmets, with the aim of providing lifesaving services in areas that were being bombed and shelled, like operating ambulances, fighting fires, and clearing rubble and ordnance. After Russia threw its air force behind Mr. al-Assad in 2015, the White Helmets’ work in the aftermath of Russian airstrikes drew international attention, becoming the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary in 2016. The group has won several humanitarian awards. After documenting and publicizing Russian and Syrian government strikes — including chemical attacks against rebel-held areas for which Western governments blamed Mr. al-Assad — the group became the target of sustained disinformation campaigns, often repeated and amplified by the Kremlin. Unfounded conspiracy theories latched onto the White Helmets’ foreign funding and ties to Mr. Le Mesurier, and held that the rescuers were a Qaeda-linked terrorist group responsible for staging the very same chemical attacks. As recently as Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry sowed doubt about Mr. Le Mesurier’s background as a British intelligence officer, saying on Twitter that he “has been spotted all around the world” and that Mr. Le Mesurier’s “connections to terrorist groups were reported back to his mission in #Kosovo.” A week earlier, the ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, had accused the White Helmets, “together with terrorists,” of “plotting to stage new chemical weapons ‘incidents’” in Syria, according to a tweet from the Russian Embassy in London. Perhaps sensitive to such accusations, Mr. Saleh insisted on Monday that Mr. Le Mesurier had not founded the White Helmets, despite Mr. Le Mesurier’s role in conceiving, financing and training the Syrian volunteers. Mayday Rescue did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London declined to comment, saying it did not confirm the deaths of British nationals. Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Berlin, and Hwaida Saad from Beirut.']","The death of Mr. Le Mesurier, a Briton who provided training and equipment for the civil defense group, is under investigation."
"Denmark, Worried About Bombings by Swedish Gangs, Begins Border Checks",2019-11-13,By Martin Selsoe Sorensen,"['COPENHAGEN — More than 60 years of hassle-free travel from Sweden to Denmark has ended after the Danish authorities, struggling to quell a wave of bombings blamed on Swedish gangs, introduced passport checks for the first time since the 1950s.  The measures put in place on Tuesday are temporary and will be applied intermittently, but the Danish police said that most travelers should carry passports or national identification cards. Only air travelers from Sweden will be exempted. “To counter the threat from serious, cross-border crime, we are enforcing the protection of the border with Sweden,” the Danish minister of justice, Nick Haekkerup, said in a statement last month. Sweden has had border checks on travelers from Denmark since 2016. But the Danish passport checks come as its neighbor has been rocked by more than 100 explosions in the first 10 months of this year. Officials have blamed the blasts — up from 39 at the same time last year — on criminal gangs. The explosions have spread to Denmark, where at least 13 have occurred in Copenhagen this year, although the police have not linked them all to Sweden. In August, a bomb blew up the Danish tax authority in Copenhagen, causing substantial damage. No one was wounded, but two Swedes are in police custody on suspicion of carrying out the late-night attack. No one has died this year in the wave of bombings in the two countries, but the situation is highly unusual, not only for Sweden and Denmark, but also in comparison with the rest of the Western world during peacetime, according to Amir Rostami, a criminologist. “Unfortunately, we must look to war zones for something similar,” Mr. Rostami, an academic at Stockholm University, told Dagens Nyheter, a Swedish daily. To cope with the rising number of explosions, the Swedish police have bolstered their bomb squad. “During 2019, we’ve been at a level we’ve never seen before, and right now it’s constant,” the national bomb squad’s chief of operations, Jon Wahlander, told Swedish state television. “Almost every day, we’re responding to various incidents either of explosions or with relation to explosions.” The Danish police say they are also concerned about other crimes linked to Sweden: They have charged a Swede in connection with the killing of two other Swedes near Copenhagen in June. Last month, the police in Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, charged a 28-year-old man with gang ties in connection with two explosions in December 2018, the news site svt.se reported. Two other men where also charged in other explosions. One of them, an 18-year-old, apparently fell victim to his own device when it went off in his Malmo home, leaving him with life-threatening injuries. Some of the explosions were caused by grenades made for military purposes and smuggled in to supply gangs that have become more and more at ease with using extreme violence to reach their goals, experts said. Other devices are homemade, using everyday items such as thermos flasks, but strike with cruel precision.  In September, a 23-year-old woman in Lund, a university town in southern Sweden, suffered severe injuries to her face after a bomb went off in front of a shop as she was passing. Denmark and Sweden scrapped passport checks in 1958 to allow seamless passage between the two Scandinavian kingdoms. (Both countries are part of the visa-free Schengen zone, made up of 26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted movement of people.) The Scandinavian countries have similar political systems and related languages, and share a sometimes war-torn past. As well as a bridge, Denmark and Sweden are also joined by four ferry routes. Those connections will be subjected to the new border checks.  “We’re targeting organized crime, and it’s the aim that the border control’s effect on ordinary travelers is as minimal as possible,” the Danish national police director, Lene Frank, said in a statement. Experts argue that intermittent checks are unlikely to either stop criminals or deter them from entering Denmark, since the risk of being caught among the tens of thousands of law-abiding travelers every day is minimal. In response to the criticism, the Danish government pointed to a package of measures making its way through Parliament. They include allowing more CCTV in public places, increasing the monitoring of known criminals and heavier punishment for the illegal use and possession of explosives. Denmark has introduced temporary border controls before. In January 2016, checks were put in place at the border with Germany to deter undocumented migrants from exploiting travel across the Schengen Area. At the same time and for the same reason, Sweden introduced its border checks on travelers from Denmark. Both are still in place. Asylum seekers are required, under European Union law, to seek asylum in the first country in the bloc that they enter, but many try to leave the Mediterranean nations where they arrive from Turkey and North Africa and travel north in search of relatives or countries with more advanced asylum and integration systems.']","Struggling to quell a wave of explosions, the Danish authorities introduced passport controls for the first time since the 1950s."
Bolivia Crisis Shows the Blurry Line Between Coup and Uprising,2019-11-12,By Max Fisher,"['President Evo Morales’s resignation has provoked international debate about how to characterize the turmoil in Bolivia: Is it an uprising or a coup? Some highlight a narrative of popular revolt against a president drifting toward authoritarianism. Others underscore a brazen military intervention. Though much remains unknown, both sides have much evidence to point to. But the coexistence of the two interpretations hints at an important truth, scholars say: The line between coups and revolts can be blurry, even nonexistent.  Often, they are one and the same: mass public uprisings alongside military defections that compel the resignation or removal of a country’s leader.  But the overlapping terms often carry moral connotations that could not be more divergent: Coups, in today’s understanding, are to be condemned; revolts are to be championed.  “People who get hung up on whether or not something is a coup or a revolution are missing the point,” said Naunihal Singh, a leading scholar of power transitions and coups. “The question is what happens next.” That has opened space for a kind of linguistic warfare, in which a political takeover can be portrayed as legitimate by labeling it a revolt, or illegitimate by terming it a coup. The narrative-building “has consequences” for what kind of government comes next, Mr. Singh said. Transitions like Bolivia’s tend to be fluid and unpredictable. The perception of legitimacy, or a lack thereof, can be decisive.  But today’s world rarely fits the black-and-white narratives that emerged from the Cold War and that still shape expectations that coups and revolts are morality tales with clear heroes and villains.  Bolivia’s crisis, where the stakes of using the right label seem unusually high, also exemplifies why scholars consider the old binaries to be outdated, misleading, even harmful. Popular perceptions of coups, cemented in the Cold War era, still envision tanks on the streets and generals announcing a takeover.  Revolutions, likewise, are seen as stirring, even romantic, with the people uniting to demand change with one voice, until the leader has no choice but to resign in disgrace. That created global expectations that any leader’s removal could be slotted into one of those two archetypes, with the terms coup and revolt used to distinguish the legitimate transitions of power from the illegitimate. But the world has changed. Most military governments have transitioned to democracy. Global norms, once tolerant of coups, now treat them as taboo. Yet, at a time of rising global populism and authoritarianism, elected leaders feel increasingly secure in testing the boundaries of their powers.  As a result, coups and revolts have blurred.  Today, coups often come after mass uprisings calling for change, with generals describing their interventions as temporary measures to restore democracy. And few, if any, popular uprisings succeed without military support, if only in the form of generals refusing to come to the government’s aid.  The political scientist Jay Ulfelder has referred to that as a “Schrödinger’s coup,” after the Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrödinger, writing that such cases “exist in a perpetual state of ambiguity, simultaneously coup and not-coup” with no hope of forcing the events into a “single, clear” category. Attempts to impose a label often turn on unknowns and unknowables. When generals announce that the president should step down, are they threatening force or merely signaling that they will not disperse protesters? Does the distinction even matter? Bolivia may yet find itself more firmly planted in one category or the other, either because of new developments or the emergence of new information. But, so far, what is known helps to illustrate how modern uprisings can defy the urge to find a neat category. Seemingly, the events in Bolivia fit the popular conception of a street revolution: Citizens filled the streets to demand the resignation of a leader who refused to respect the limits on his power, eventually recruiting powerful institutions from the left and right to make that come about. The government remains in the hands of elected civilians, who have promised new elections, and Mr. Morales remains free. It also seemingly matched the popular conception of a coup, with the military calling on the president to step down and, sure enough, with that happening. Mr. Morales himself called his removal a coup. While he has since softened his language, he has also accepted asylum in Mexico.  In one conception, the people heroically saved democracy; in the other, a handful of elites cravenly betrayed it. Both cite the same set of facts. Venezuela’s protests this year offered a similarly blurry narrative, with mass rallies expressing outrage at the government’s brazen power grabs and championed by opposition leaders who argued that a military intervention was the only remaining avenue for forcing change. As distinctions become cloudy, Mr. Singh said, partisans invent ever-more-intricate definitions of revolution or coup to fit complex events into black-and-white narratives. He cited arguments dismissing Bolivia’s uprising as illegitimate because protesters had used violence — even though many revolutions are violent — or because many were right-wing. Others have pointed to violence by Mr. Morales’s supporters or abuses of power by Mr. Morales as proof that any military role was necessary and so does not constitute a coup.  Those arguments, Mr. Singh said, have little bearing on whether Bolivia’s events qualify as a coup, a popular uprising or both. Rather, they are moral appeals to see one side as good and the other as bad. “People are cooking the books when they have that conversation,” he said. In Latin America during the Cold War era, military interventions into politics tended to expel elected, left-wing leaders and impose right-wing dictatorships.  In the decades since, however, two things have changed. Elected leaders on the left and right have grown more willing to defy term limits and sidestep checks on their authority. And militaries have come to see themselves as political arbiters of last resort, rather than partisan actors or potential rulers.  In Ecuador, for instance, the military intervened on behalf of indigenous protests against the right-wing president in 2000, forcing his removal, and again in support of its center-left president this year. To political scientists, this looks like a structural problem. Strong presidents, strong militaries, polarized societies and weak institutions invite cases like Bolivia’s, with disputes increasingly resolved outside of the constitutional order.  But the Cold War-era language of coups and revolutions demands that such cases fit into clear narratives. Latin American crises tend to play out along the left-right divides common across the Western Hemisphere, including in the United States, giving an added incentive to identify heroes and villains. And the messiness inherent in Latin America’s democratic order, with leaders likely to accrue extra-constitutional power and to be removed by extra-constitutional methods, means that both sides will see plenty of evidence for framing the overthrowing of a leader as democracy’s restoration or as its subversion. Bolivia, again, is a case in point. Scholars of the country argue that both Mr. Morales and the military are on the wrong side of democracy.  Santiago Anria of Dickinson College, in Pennsylvania, and Jennifer Cyr of the University of Arizona wrote in the Washington Post that Mr. Morales’s “attempt to stay in power revealed his ‘autocratic temptations’: a desire to speak and act on behalf of the entire ‘people’ and to do so forever.” The scholars faulted opposition leaders for helping to stoke the crisis and credited Mr. Morales with expanding democracy earlier in his tenure. But they argued that he now “barely respects constitutional checks and balances on presidential authority.” Rut Diamint, a political scientist at Torcuato Di Tella University in Argentina, agreed with the criticisms of Mr. Morales but added, “None of that justifies a coup d’état.”  She called it “a setback for democracy in Latin America” and a precedent for “other countries to define a political order with the support of the armed forces.” Stuck in the middle of these powerful actors are actual Bolivians, told that they must pick one to defend democracy from the other. Debates over what to call Bolivia’s upheaval might force complicated events into an ideologically appealing narrative that does not quite fit, but they still matter — potentially a great deal.  Perceptions of whether or not Mr. Morales’s removal was legitimate, in Bolivia and abroad, could play a significant role in who is able to take power next, their ability to govern and what sort of government they form. “That’s part of the importance of these appeals — is it a coup or is it a revolution? — because it will set up what happens in the next week,” Mr. Singh said, referring to Mr. Morales’s challenges to the standing of any opposition-led government. Experts on Bolivia and on coups joined forces on Monday to challenge the black-and-white characterizations, urging pundits and social media personalities to see the shades of gray.  Within a few hours, some had already thrown up their hands in defeat. That included Mr. Anria, the Bolivia expert, who wrote on Twitter, “Binaries don’t help us much, and yet they are so pervasive!”']","The Cold War binary of “bad” coups and “good” popular revolts no longer applies. But the labels persist, with important consequences."
‘This Will Be Forever’: How the Ambitions of Evo Morales Contributed to His Fall,2019-11-12,By Ernesto Londoño,"['It was a watershed moment for democracy in Latin America. Evo Morales, an Indigenous leader who rose to prominence in the hardscrabble world of coca growers unions in Bolivia, stood before his compatriots to take the oath of office in 2006, mincing no words as he described the sea change his landslide presidential victory represented. “Our communities, historically, have been marginalized, humiliated, hated, despised and condemned to extinction,” Mr. Morales said in his inauguration speech. “Our people were never recognized as human beings, even though these communities are the rightful owners of the noble land and its natural resources.” The rise of Mr. Morales and other pathbreaking populist leftists who won elections across Latin America in the early years of the new millennium brought hope that democracy in a politically turbulent region had reached a new level of maturity. They promised greater social inclusion and a more equitable distribution of wealth — goals that materialized, to varying degrees, for millions. The Bolivian leader’s dramatic ouster from power on Sunday, after the military abandoned him amid a popular uprising set off by last month’s fraud-marred election, was an ignominious milestone for the era of the leftist leaders. As Mr. Morales hastily flew out of the capital and went into hiding Sunday night amid rumors that his arrest was imminent, eventually boarding a plane for Mexico on Tuesday, the debate over his downfall laid bare the region’s deep ideological polarization. Mexico’s government and Argentina’s incoming president, Alberto Fernández, condemned the events in Bolivia as a coup. Others, including Carlos Mesa, the former Bolivian president who is vying to replace Mr. Morales, and Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right leader, saw it as the triumph of peaceful resistance to a despot. The starkly different takes reflect how tarred Mr. Morales’s legacy became as he bent democratic norms to stay in power longer than the two terms that Bolivia’s Constitution allows. “If he had groomed a successor and accepted a transition of power, he would have been seen as a Nelson Mandela of South America,” said Mark Goodale, a professor of anthropology at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland who follows Bolivia closely. “He wouldn’t have just been a good leader for Bolivia, but one of the great political leaders in Latin America.” [Update: Bolivian senator Jeanine Añez Chavez has declared herself the country’s leader.] Mr. Morales strode into the presidency with a sweeping mandate, having trounced his opponents in the 2005 election. He proposed profound changes to Bolivia’s power structure, and during his first term oversaw the drafting of a new Constitution that sought to erase the structural classism and racism that had long kept Bolivia’s Indigenous people, a majority in the nation, second-class citizens. The president’s rhetoric was often radical, especially with respect to the United States, which he regarded as a scheming, colonialist actor that had held too much sway over Latin America. Mr. Morales, who as a coca leaf union leader was targeted and roughed up by American narcotics agents, took pleasure in kicking out the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2009. But when it came to governing — especially on economic matters — he was a pragmatist. Instead of outright nationalizing state institutions as his ally and counterpart Hugo Chávez did in Venezuela, Mr. Morales cut better deals for the state and embraced market-friendly policies. With inflation in check and robust foreign currency reserves on hand, the government spent billions over the years on subsidies and infrastructure, broadening access to health care and education. “The standard of living for millions of people has improved dramatically,” said Calla Hummel, a political scientist at the University of Miami who has done research in Bolivia for several years. “People were able to stay in school longer, build and buy houses, buy cars, do things that hadn’t been possible before 2006.” Over the years, Mr. Morales consolidated power by traveling around the country at a frenetic pace to break bread with union chiefs, entrepreneurs and social movement leaders. He was a master at shoring up support at the grass-roots level by steering government funds to key areas and at outsmarting rivals. Those skills, said Mr. Goodale, reflect the way Mr. Morales learned to wield power in the rough-and-tumble realm of coca union leaders. “It involves a Machiavellian style of power,” he said. “It requires a lot of self-interested moves and stabbing people in the back when it becomes necessary.” As some of his leftist contemporaries departed from power, some with legacies tarred by allegations of corruption, Mr. Morales dug in, disdainful of the two-term limit imposed by the Constitution. Those authoritarian tendencies did not come as a surprise to people who had watched Mr. Morales’s rise closely. As early as 2009, he had made clear that the presidential palace was not going to change hands anytime soon. “We are not just tenants, we have recovered what is rightfully ours, brothers and sisters,” he declared at the time during a speech. “This will be forever.” Mr. Morales seemed to feel strongly that the changes he set in motion required him to stay at the helm of the government. In 2016, when Mr. Morales was campaigning for a referendum that sought to do away with term limits, I asked to interview him in La Paz. Instead of agreeing to a traditional interview, the president asked that I spend an entire day trailing him — an offer he has often extended to foreign journalists. I was struck by two things: his vanity and the extent to which the government had turned Mr. Morales into a brand. The first event of the day was a predawn workout in a police gym, during which the grunting president displayed his stamina and strength for a mystified audience of one. Later in the day, as we flew to a couple of cities, Mr. Morales’s image was everywhere: stamped on murals in a new subsidized housing complex, on airport billboards and even on each cable car of La Paz’s futuristic public transportation system. The first clear sign that Bolivians were growing weary of Mr. Morales came when he narrowly lost the term limits vote, his first electoral defeat as president. Mr. Morales had struggled to persuade voters in large part because of a corruption scandal that broke days before the referendum. It involved a former girlfriend of the president who had used her access to the government to help a Chinese firm get contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The way that case was handed — the former girlfriend was prosecuted but no one from the government took responsibility for enabling her — was telling about a justice system that on Mr. Morales’s watch had become opaque, and was often used to punish government critics. At first, after the term-limit defeat, Mr. Morales said he would respect the will of voters and step down. But the following year he found a workaround: The Constitutional Court, which was packed by loyalists, ruled that term limits infringed on human rights. That decision angered many Bolivians. As Mr. Morales campaigned, it became clear that  even Indigenous communities that had once revered him had come to conclude that it was time for the president to go. Mr. Morales was declared the winner in the Oct. 20 vote, albeit by a tighter margin than in any presidential election since 2005. But his victory set off a firestorm of protests and violent clashes amid mounting evidence of electoral irregularities. As the unrest spread, and the legitimacy of his victory became impossible to defend, Mr. Morales on Sunday called for a new vote. But it was too little too late. With much of the police force in open revolt, the military chiefs on Sunday urged Mr. Morales to resign. Ms. Hummel said the sequence of events did not necessarily constitute a coup, considering that the military seems uninterested in taking control of the country. “We’re seeing people taking to the streets and demanding better governance, which is potentially hopeful,” she said. But Bolivia is at a perilous crossroads following a rare 14-year stretch of political and economic stability. “I think it’s a very dangerous power vacuum,” Ms. Hummel said. “How do we move on from the Morales era, which was very stable and predictable, to something else — and what is that going to be?”']","Bolivia prospered on the watch of its firebrand leftist president, but his refusal to step aside led to an ignominious downfall.

Venice Flooding Brings City to ‘Its Knees’,2019-11-13,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The mayor of Venice, who said that the city “was on its knees,” has called for a state of emergency and the closing of all schools after the Italian city was submerged under “acqua alta,” an exceptionally high tide — the highest in 50 years. Outdoor restaurant tables and chairs could be seen bobbing in the waters, and tourists were forced to clamber through the windows of high-end hotels as the water rose to about six feet before 11 p.m. on Tuesday. As dawn broke on Wednesday, the authorities began to survey the damage.  “I’ve seen things in San Marco I thought I’d never see,” Mayor Luigi Brugnaro of Venice told the Italian station Radio24. “It is a very difficult situation,” he added.  In a post on Twitter, the mayor blamed climate change for the city’s troubles and called for the rapid completion of a long-delayed barrier system.  Later, speaking at a news conference alongside national and local officials, the mayor said that the damage had been significant. “We’re talking hundreds of millions of euros,” he said. The flooding was the second highest in the city’s history, after the disastrous flood of 1966, which peaked at 6.3 feet. Last year, as severe weather in Italy killed 11 people, ferocious winds drove the high tide in Venice to more than five feet above average sea level.  Residents and tourists could be seen wading through water in rain boots. The water invaded the ground floors of many historic palazzos, stores, restaurants and hotels. At least three vaporetti, Venice’s public transportation boats, sank, Italian media reported. One floated over the banks that line the city’s canals, ending up perilously close to buildings. Famous tourist spots like St. Mark’s Square were under several feet of water by Wednesday. The crypt of St. Mark’s Basilica was flooded by more than three feet of water, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Almost exactly a year ago, after a violent storm had swept the city, concerns were raised about the basilica’s ability to withstand the effects of the changing climate, the growing number of days in which the city was under water, and the onslaught of tourists. “Venice is on its knees,” the mayor said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday with photos showing him walking through the basilica with the city’s principal prelate, the patriarch of Venice, Francesco Moraglia. At the news conference the mayor said that while wandering through the city, “I found people in tears because they had lost everything. If we don’t want the city to be abandoned, we have to give certain answers. It’s not just about quantifying the damages, but about the future of this city.” The patriarch of Venice echoed his sentiments.  “Going around the city we found desperate people, who said that a year ago they were in the same situation,” Msgr. Moraglia said. He added that the Diocese of Venice and Caritas, the Catholic charity, would provide lodgings for people who had been left homeless, giving priority to “fragile people in difficulty.” “I hope the message passes that the city has been wounded, and that it can’t be wounded each year in the same way,” the patriarch said. The newspaper Il Gazzettino, under a banner headline, “Acqua Alta. Fear and Anger in Venice,” described the city’s residents as “barricaded in their homes.” The home page of the city’s website bore no good news. More high water was expected in the coming days.  Italian news outlets reported that at least one man had died by electrocution while trying to pump water from his home in Pellestrina, an island that borders on the Venetian lagoon and forms a barrier against the Adriatic Sea. The body of another man was found in his home, according to local news outlets. Mr. Brugnaro said the situation in Pellestrina was critical because the water had overwhelmed sea walls. “We can’t get the pumps to work because they are underwater,” the mayor said. Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto Region, said that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte would arrive in the city shortly and spend the night. Venice has also long struggled with overtourism, as officials have tried to prevent colossal cruise ships from docking on the city’s main canal after a series of accidents involving vessels that came in too fast. In June, a cruise liner plowed into a smaller tour ship and a wharf on a canal in Venice, injuring four people and reigniting arguments about the dangers of allowing huge vessels to pass through the fragile lagoon city. Italy has also invested billions of euros in a flood-protection system known by the acronym MOSE, but its offshore underwater dams have yet to be completed. Though Venetian residents have gotten used to wading through flooded streets, strong winds on Tuesday coincided with the high tide, submerging the city. “Acqua alta has always been normal,” said Lorenzo Bonometto, an expert on lagoon ecology. But the combined high tide and strong winds made the result “an exceptional event,” he said. The frequency of acqua alta has become more troubling, experts say, and is linked to rising seawater levels, not only in Venice, but also around the world. Sea levels are rising “at a faster rate” than experts had expected, and that is having a greater impact on the lagoon city, Mr. Bonometto said. While flooding is a complex phenomenon with many causes, the effects of climate change on sea-level rise, and the intense rainfall that comes with the greater capacity of a warming atmosphere to hold more moisture, are increasingly recognized as factors that can boost natural variation in weather patterns. There is also the added fact that Venice is sinking. Luigi Cavaleri, an engineer at the Institute of Marine Sciences in Venice said the city’s subsidence and the rising sea levels meant that Venice was sinking at a rate of one-fifth of an inch a year. That means that the city will be submerged by water more frequently. Mr. Cavaleri said last year’s storm was a much more serious event, but noted, “Floods will continue.”  Had the flood system been operational, he said, “the city might have been spared. Hopefully, it will be for the next flood.”  Mr. Brugnaro, the mayor, said a completed MOSE project could have averted the disaster — it is scheduled to be operative from 2022 — but that flood barriers were just one element of a complex system. And other elements necessary for the health of the lagoon, such as for the navigability of the canal, were still incomplete. “We need resources and clear ideas,” he said. “For now, MOSE is a ghost. We want to see it finished.” John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.']","The mayor called for a state of emergency after the Italian city was submerged under “acqua alta,” an exceptionally high tide — the worst in 50 years."
Women in Gambia Describe Torture After Ex-President Called Them Witches,2019-11-12,By Julie Turkewitz,"['SINTET, Gambia — Matty Sanyang was at a baby naming ceremony when the soldiers arrived in Sintet, a farming town not far from the West African coast, pulled her neighbors from their homes and announced that the president had made a decision: The people of her village were witches, and they would need to be cured. Then, she said, the soldiers pushed her into a truck, stripped her naked and forced her to say she was a witch. “What they took,” said Ms. Sanyang, “was our dignity.” On Monday, a  public national truth and reconciliation commission in Gambia began hearing testimony from citizens like Ms. Sanyang who say they were victims of what commission officials are calling “witch hunts” ordered by Yahya Jammeh, the former president who ruled for 22 years before fleeing abroad in 2017 with his fleet of luxury cars. The commission is designed to investigate atrocities perpetrated during his long reign. As president, Mr. Jammeh jailed dissidents, ordered extrajudicial killings and forced AIDS patients to quit their medications and submit to an herbal regimen of his own invention, according to human rights advocates. He also branded some of his citizens as witches, a tactic his critics say was central to his effort to divide his country and consolidate power. Now, for the first time, the people he accused  are testifying before a nationally televised commission. On Monday, the witnesses included a former police superintendent who described how a top police official went from one office to another at police headquarters, accused some colleagues of witchcraft and sent them off to an unknown location.  The hearings on the roundups will last at least three weeks. Ms. Sanyang, a mother of four who lives in Sintet, is among those hoping to tell her story. “I want people to know the truth,” she said. “I am not a witch.”    But as residents clamor to speak out, some are questioning whether their testimony will be enough to heal the divisions that Mr. Jammeh sowed. Sintet, with its blue and yellow homes, sits 80 miles from the Gambian capital off a long road, past thick greenery and spired mosques. Its residents come from many ethnic groups — there are Jola, Mandinka and Fula people among them — and they were once united, many said, intermarrying and attending each other’s weddings. Now they are split between those who still support Mr. Jammeh and those who don’t, often among ethnic lines. Some still believe their neighbors were witches, while others call the kidnappings and assaults a terrible crime. The ordeal has also divided Gambians outside of Sintet. Some people refuse to visit the town, calling its residents sorcerers. Other Gambians call them killers, because several of Mr. Jammeh’s admitted hit men hail from the area. Momodou Bah, 34, a former elected official from Mr. Jammeh’s party, said the discord encouraged by the regime — and specifically by the accusations of witchcraft — “will probably take us some two decades to mend.” Persecution based on accusations of witchcraft still occurs around the world, a phenomenon that often goes unrecognized, according to the Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network, a nonprofit research and advocacy group.  In many cases in West Africa, said Leo Igwe, a Nigerian scholar with the network, accusers are trying to explain a misfortune, and come to blame a neighbor or family member they believe is possessed by evil. These accusations frequently lead to torture, said Mr. Igwe, and those who survive can live the rest of their lives with a “violent sense of disconnection from society.” What distinguished the Gambian experience, he said, was that the former president, Mr. Jammeh, appeared to use witchcraft accusations as a state tool, and targeted people on a “mega scale.” Hundreds of people were abducted during the attacks in Gambia, according to Amnesty International, and at least two died of kidney failure in the aftermath. In Sintet, soldiers poured a burning liquid into the throats and eyes of many residents, according to witnesses, leaving some plagued by vomiting and diarrhea; others said they have experienced long-term kidney and vision problems.  Gambia is an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, with a sizable Christian minority. Over time, some families have braided fear of witchcraft into their broader belief systems. Mr. Jammeh’s accusations held so much sway because many people in Sintet were already his supporters. One Friday this summer, officials from the truth commission, along with a Gambian human rights activist, Fatou Baldeh, took the highway from the capital to Sintet to hold a workshop meant to help villagers wrestle with the past.  The green flags of Mr. Jammeh’s party hung outside many homes.  Many said that Mr. Jammeh was one of few politicians to bring them the economic boom they see in the rest of the world. In the preschool building, residents explained to Ms. Baldeh that Mr. Jammeh had made that very highway possible. He had brought them power tillers, they said, and tractors, fertilizers and education. “He loved the students,” said Rohey Bah, 19, a woman about to finish high school. “He boosted our agriculture,” said Habibou Tamba, 33, a man who remains a Jammeh supporter. But then there were the kidnappings. Ms. Sanyang, wearing a blue dress, recalled how on the day of the roundup, in March of 2009, the baby naming ceremony burst into chaos as people ran from the soldiers. Trucks and buses poured in, she said. Then came a crowd of men cloaked in red, holding mirrors. The men said they were healers and went house to house, guarded by military and police officers, pulling people from their beds and sending them to the trucks. Mr. Bah, then an elected leader in Mr. Jammeh’s party, said he watched them take his aunt and his grandmother. “They said they were doing this job for the president,” he said. The officers drove dozens of people to Kanilai, the president’s hometown, to a compound on the president’s farm, according to interviews and information collected by Amnesty International. Inside the compound, officials forced Ms. Sanyang and dozens of others to drink the strange liquid, and splashed it in their faces, she said. Mr. Bah, alarmed, said he had followed the caravan to the compound and entered to try to negotiate the release of Sintet’s citizens. He said he saw his neighbors screaming and writhing on the floor until they eventually lost consciousness. When Ms. Sanyang came to, she said, soldiers stripped her and others naked. It was an affront that for her, a religious Muslim, was equal to sexual assault. Another woman, Sutayring Manjang, now 80, said officials forced her and others to admit they were witches and accused her of using sorcery to kill people. “I told them, ‘I am a member of your party,’” she said, “‘and you are doing this to me?’” In one tent, Mr. Bah said, officials appeared to be videotaping these interrogations. Some people were kept for a night, others for three or four, Mr. Bah said. The soldiers eventually released their captives, amid pleas from Mr. Bah and others. A spokesman for the Gambian military, Maj. Lamin K. Sanyang, did not deny that soldiers participated in the kidnappings, adding that he was waiting with the rest of the country to hear witnesses testify. But he said the soldiers’ participation was not sanctioned by the military. “The manner by which they got involved — I am not privy to that information,” he said. When the kidnapping victims returned to Sintet, many found the trauma wasn’t over. People fell ill, and their farms and businesses suffered. School fees went unpaid, residents said. Children went hungry. The community divided along political and ethnic lines. Mr. Jammeh is a member of the Jola ethnic group, and some Mandinka and Fula people began to blame the Jolas for the attack. They stopped attending each other’s weddings. The journey toward reconciliation has moved slowly. The truth commission hearings began in January and are expected to last two years. After, the attorney general will decide whom to prosecute. Mr. Jammeh is in exile, and no one knows if the authorities will be able to bring him to court. Some of the testimony will take place in a town similar to Sintet, called Jambur, where 66 people were taken during a kidnapping, said Fatoumata Mballow, a commission employee who has been conducting interviews there. Six people in Jambur died in circumstances that locals attributed to the toxic liquid, she said. In Sintet, Ms. Sanyang said that even if she goes on television to tell her story and proclaim she is not a witch, she wasn’t sure if people would believe her. But she wants to testify anyway, she said. “I want to be able to say: ‘This happened to me.’”']",Gambia’s former president ordered people he accused of “witchcraft” to be kidnapped and tortured.

"As Australia Burns, Its Leaders Trade Insults",2019-11-13,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — When a mass shooting shattered Australia in 1996, the country banned automatic weapons. In its first years of independence, it enacted a living-wage law. Stable retirement savings, national health care, affordable college education — Australia solved all these issues decades ago. But climate change is Australia’s labyrinth without an exit, where its pragmatism disappears. The wildfires that continued raging on Wednesday along the country’s eastern coast have revealed that the politics of climate in Australia resist even the severe pressure that comes from natural disaster. Instead of common-sense debate, there are culture war insults. The deputy prime minister calls people who care about climate change “raving inner-city lunatics.” Another top official suggests that supporting the Greens party can be fatal. And while the government is working to meet the immediate need — fighting fires, delivering assistance — citizens are left asking why more wasn’t done earlier as they demand solutions.   “We still don’t have an energy policy, we don’t have effective climate policy — it’s really very depressing,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, an associate professor at Griffith Law School. Australia is not the only country where the threat of climate change has largely produced inaction or failed promises. President Trump has done everything he can to erase the United States’ climate policy even as dangerous fires ravage California. Canada and South Korea are far from meeting their targets to cut emissions in line with Paris Agreement commitments. But in Australia, where coal is king and water is scarce, the country’s citizens have spent the week simmering with fear, shame and alarm. As a 500-mile stretch from Sydney to Byron Bay continued to face catastrophic fire conditions, with 80 separate blazes burning and at least four deaths reported, Australians have watched, awe-struck, as life-changing destruction has been met with political sniping.  Michael McCormack, the No. 2 official in the conservative government, kicked it off on Monday, telling listeners of the country’s most popular morning radio programs that fire victims needed assistance, not “the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies.” Barnaby Joyce, the government’s special envoy for drought assistance, followed up by suggesting that two people killed by fires near a town called Glen Innes over the weekend might have contributed to their own deaths if they supported the Greens. The victims’ neighbors called his comments “absolutely disgraceful.”  But a Greens party senator responded with his own outrage: He said the major parties were “no better than arsonists,” an insult carrying special weight for the world’s most arid inhabited continent.  “The higher the flames in the bush, the lower the politics,” blared a headline in The Sydney Morning Herald. While the latest conflict has flared as smoke fills the skies of Sydney, its roots go back years, maybe centuries. Even as the country’s emissions continue to soar, it’s been hard to reach a political consensus on energy and climate change policy because of Australia’s mining history and a powerful lobby for one product: coal. “Coal is our N.R.A.,” said Ms. Harris Rimmer, referring to the National Rifle Association, which has stymied changes to gun laws in the United States even as mass shootings have become shockingly common. “They have total control over Parliament.” The comparison has its limits. Coal is not enshrined in the Constitution, as a right to bear arms is in the United States, nor is it a consumer product. But like guns in America, coal helped define the country in its early years of settlement — and is still an outsize presence in Australian life.  The industry’s economic benefits reach fewer people than many Australians believe. It frequently hires federal lawmakers after they leave office, and even now politicians often defend coal in patriotic terms. For conservatives in particular, extraction of natural resources in rural areas is a stand-in for values worth fighting for against condescending urban elites. Just a few days before the fires, for example, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a mining group that new laws were needed to crack down on climate activists and progressives who “want to tell you where to live, what job you can have, what you can say and what you can think.” “Climate change has become a proxy for something else,” said Robyn Eckersley, a climate politics expert at the University of Melbourne.  What’s galling for many scientists is that the public wants the federal government to do more; polls consistently show that Australians see climate change as a major threat requiring aggressive intervention.  And the problems emerging now — fires, cyclones, heat waves, drought, shifts in sea life and the death of the Great Barrier Reef — have been predicted in the public record for years. In 2000, a Senate committee report criticized the government for a lack of action, stating that “Australia’s per capita emissions have shot to the highest in the world,” and making more than 100 recommendations for both reducing emissions and adapting to a more dangerous environment. “Australia will be very negatively affected by climate change given the size of its land mass,” the report says, “its long coastline, current extremes of climate, vulnerability to cyclones and the El Niño/La Niña cycle, existing problems with soil salinity, and its economic dependence on agriculture and tourism.” Fires have been a focus of in-depth reports since at least 2013, when the nonprofit Climate Council issued its first one: “Be Prepared: Climate Change the Australian Bushfire Threat.” Even firefighters, who scramble the class and urban-rural divide that the government often tries to exploit, have tried to tell officials that they need to confront the way that the changing climate supercharges the already dangerous threat of fires.  “We’ve seen these incidents becoming larger and more intense,” said Leighton Drury, a fire union official in New South Wales. “It would be very silly for any politician or any leader to keep their head in the ground and say we don’t need to do anything here.” Nonetheless, for now, that is what the government is doing. Mr. Morrison, who in the past has made it clear that Australia’s economic prosperity comes first, has repeatedly argued in recent days that now is not the time to discuss climate policy or politics. Photographed hugging fire victims, he has sought to focus on emotional and financial support. Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and author, said that “it wastes the opportunity to explain to the Australian public what we’re seeing in climate extremes.” Unfortunately, more opportunities are on the way. Strong winds and high temperatures are predicted for this weekend, leading fire officials to warn that the blazes already burning will spread, while new conflagrations will produce more demands for help. The pressure on the Australian government to do for the climate what it’s done for other policy problems will only grow with the flames.

But this week’s fires have revealed once again that its pragmatism stops at climate change.
U.K. Scholars Back Cambridge Researcher’s Efforts to Avoid Deportation,2019-11-11,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — Britain’s academic community has mobilized in support of a Cambridge University scholar whose request for permanent residency was denied, she says, because she spent too much time outside of the country working on her doctoral thesis.  The scholar, Asiya Islam, a junior research fellow in the University of Cambridge’s sociology department who has lived legally in Britain for a decade, is facing the prospect of being ejected from the country by the end of January. More than 1,000 professors, lecturers and Ph.D. candidates have signed an open letter to the Home Office — the government department that handles immigration, security, and law enforcement — urging that the decision be reconsidered. Ms. Islam says the time she spent abroad was essential to her academic research. Britain’s immigration rules require that people applying for the type of permanent residency she sought — also called indefinite leave to remain — spend no more than 180 days at a time or 540 days in total outside of the country over the course of a decade. Ms. Islam spent nearly a year in New Delhi between 2016 and 2017 doing research for her doctoral thesis, and despite supplying letters from Cambridge affirming that her fieldwork was necessary for her studies, the Home Office ruled that she had “failed to provide any exceptional reasons” to support a time-abroad exemption. Instead, she was told in a letter that the 647 days she had spent outside of Britain over the past 10 years — of which 330 were for her Ph.D. research — meant she had surpassed the limit, and her application was duly rejected.  “The letter from the Home Office seemed like it was a copy and paste of some standard language, filled in with my details,” Ms. Islam said in an interview on Monday. “I am highly skilled and bringing my expertise to U.K. academia and value to the U.K. economy, and that does not seem to have been considered at all in the decision-making process.”  Professor Sarah Franklin, the head of the sociology department at Cambridge, called the Home Office’s decision an “outrageous breach of common sense.” She said that the government’s immigration policy was damaging the very institutions it was trying to safeguard. “The government, with its explicit policy of creating a hostile environment, is not having the intended effect of protecting the U.K., but it is having the opposite effect of undermining core institutions such as universities,” Professor Franklin said, citing a strategy put in place in 2012 by Theresa May, who was the home secretary at the time, that was meant to create “a hostile environment for illegal migration” in Britain.  Ms. Islam, 31, is originally from Aligarh, in northern India, and has lived in Britain since 2009. She has a string of academic successes to her name, including an award from the London School of Economics for her master’s degree and a Gates scholarship for her Ph.D. at Cambridge on gender and class in urban India. Ms. Islam, whose student visa expires at the end of January, said she had been shocked and very upset by the rejection and would appeal the decision.  “For me, there are personal, professional, emotional and financial consequences that I am still in the process of taking account of,” Ms. Islam said. “Living with this kind of uncertainty is not nice at all.”  The Home Office did not comment directly on her case but said that each application was considered on an individual basis. The agency said that applications for permanent residency would be refused if an individual exceeded the 540-day limit. Ms. Islam found out about the rejection last week and decided to speak out about her case by posting on Twitter.  Outrage about the decision spread quickly among the academic community and by Monday, the open letter had garnered more than 1,000 signatures. Ms. Islam said the outpouring of support was “heartening.”  In the open letter, Ms. Islam’s research was called “an asset to the U.K. and its academic community, yet her very success in academic fieldwork is now being held against her.” Elise Burton, a close friend of Ms. Islam’s and a fellow researcher at Cambridge, who drafted the open letter last Friday, said in an interview that she was not surprised at how quickly many in the academic world had taken the opportunity to voice their disapproval. “I know many others who have struggled with similar issues,” she said. “We are hoping to see broader change in the immigration system.” The letter said that the reputation and competitiveness of British academic institutions could suffer because of decisions made by the Home Office in Ms. Islam’s case and in others like hers. Harriet Truscott, a spokeswoman for Newnham College, Cambridge, where Ms. Islam studies, issued a similar warning. “Without talented academics like Dr. Islam, the University of Cambridge would not be a global leader in research,” she said.']","More than 1,000 academics have signed an open letter in support of Asiya Islam, a research fellow who has lived legally in Britain for a decade."
South Korea Stops Stream of Blood From Culled Pigs,2019-11-13,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said on Wednesday that it had successfully stopped a stream of red blood from tens of thousands of pigs possibly infected with African swine fever from reaching a river that provides drinking water for much of the population north of Seoul. Residents living in towns between Seoul and South Korea’s border with North Korea were alarmed early this week when the local news media reported that a small stream had turned red in Yeoncheon, a county that borders North Korea. It turned out that the blood came from 47,000 pig carcasses waiting on trucks to be buried. The animals were the last of the 160,000 hogs that the county authorities had culled to stop the spread of African swine fever, a highly contagious disease incurable for infected pigs but not dangerous to humans. The carcasses were decaying and oozing with blood on the trucks because of a shortage of plastic burial containers when rain hit the area on Sunday. A stream there turned red with blood, raising fears that the blood might contaminate the Imjin River, which is 10 miles downstream and provides drinking water for many towns north of Seoul. Officials built dikes and used pumps to stop the contaminated water from flowing downstream, while some towns downstream stopped pumping drinking water from the Imjin River. On Wednesday, Environment Ministry officials said tests showed that the blood did not contaminate the river, and towns began pumping drinking water from it again. African swine fever has been sweeping across Asia and Europe, devastating hog farmers. South Korea has slaughtered 410,000 pigs, all of them in towns north and west of Seoul, since the outbreak was first reported in mid-September at a farm near the border with North Korea. South Korean officials suspected that the deadly animal disease may have been spread to South Korea from North Korea by wild boars across the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. North Korea reported its first outbreak of the disease in May at a farm near its border with China. South Korea’s last and 14th pig farm infected with the disease was reported on Oct. 9, but its battle against the outbreak has not stopped, since wild boars are still being found with the virus. The country has employed military snipers and civilian hunters, as well as drones, to track and kill wild boars near the North Korean border.']",Towns near the border with North Korea were alarmed when a stream turned red after pigs were culled over fear of African swine fever.
‘I Assume the Presidency’: Bolivia Lawmaker Declares Herself Leader,2019-11-12,By Clifford Krauss,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — Bolivia’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Tuesday when a leading lawmaker stepped forward and claimed the presidency, even as the country’s ousted leader urged his supporters in the legislature to battle on from his exile in Mexico. “I assume the presidency immediately and will do everything necessary to pacify the country,” the lawmaker, Senator Jeanine Añez Chavez, told members of the assembly.  But with supporters of the ousted President Evo Morales refusing to take part in the legislative session, it was not immediately clear whether Ms. Añez’s declaration would move the country away from conflict, or headlong into it. Minutes after she spoke, Bolivia’s highest constitutional court issued a ruling that backed her assumption of power. She was the highest-ranking politician in the line of succession after Mr. Morales and other top officials stepped down.  The country had been without a leader since the resignation on Sunday of Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, who came to power more than a decade ago as part of a leftist wave that swept Latin America. It seemed uncertain that Ms. Añez would be able to calm the tense and deeply polarized nation. Shortly after her announcement, members of Mr. Morales’s party said they would hold another legislative session on Wednesday to nullify her decision. Mr. Morales denounced Ms. Añez’s move as illegitimate, saying on Twitter that she had acted “without legislative quorum, surrounded by a group of accomplices and supported by the armed forces and the police, which repress the people.”  A former media executive and leader of a conservative coalition, Ms. Añez said before she declared herself president that she would lead a transition focused on selecting an honest electoral commission and holding elections as soon as possible.  “This is simply a transitory moment,” she said earlier Tuesday. “There is an urgency.” Fireworks echoed across La Paz, Bolivia’s largest city, and in other major urban centers. But at the same time, the police used tear gas to disperse furious crowds of Mr. Morales’s supporters who were gathered in downtown La Paz. Mr. Morales’s abrupt departure had come after the armed forces sided with protesters who accused him of rigging an election to stay in power. Mr. Morales, who was granted refuge by Mexico “for humanitarian reasons,” has described his ouster as a coup.  On Wednesday morning, the streets of La Paz were quiet, as normal bus and hospital service resumed. Schools remained closed, but businesses began to reopen in most major cities and traffic thickened. But tensions were building, with Morales supporters who still have a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly promising an attempt to nullify Ms. Añez’s self-proclaimed presidency. Supporters of Ms. Añez have set up barricades in recent days around the assembly’s plaza, along with the national police, and it remained uncertain whether they would even allow the Morales party lawmakers to enter the building.  Mr. Morales had called a morning news conference in Mexico City in which he was expected to repeat his biting attacks on Ms. Añez’s sudden climb to power and to signal what kind of tactics he expected his followers to take against the new government. Some political and legal analysts said the steps taken by Ms. Añez and the assembly members present for her announcement were extraordinary but necessary, because members of Mr. Morales’s party had boycotted the scheduled session at which they were to select a new president. “Añez, along with congressmen of both chambers, are abiding by their constitutional duties and are taking measures to secure the constitutional succession of power,” said Carlos Aramayo Raña, a Bolivian political scientist.  “Politically speaking, what is the alternative, Bolivians fighting each other?” Mr. Aramayo Raña asked. “Who will take responsibility for the blood that will be spilled?” But after a month of unrest and strikes, many Bolivians expressed hope that Ms. Añez’s proclamation would bring back normality. In the city of Cochabamba, in central Bolivia, the new president’s controversial proclamation was greeted with a visible sigh of relief, if not mass celebration.  Empty streets almost immediately began to fill with cars and bicycles, and local residents began dissembling the barricades they had put up in protest of Mr. Morales’s re-election, diligently sweeping up the debris into garbage sacks. About 100 opposition protesters waving flags converged on the city’s central square to celebrate. Some set off fireworks or honked from their cars and motorbikes. Ms. Añez’s proclamation, however, has not put an end to sporadic political violence and opportunistic looting unleashed by Mr. Morales’s resignation. Local news outlets reported several chicken farms around Cochabamba were looted early on Wednesday. Hours after the swearing-in ceremony, a New York Times reporter watched about 20 motorbike-riding civilians armed with metal pipes and chains travel out of Cochabamba’s main police station, as police officers saluted them and gave thumbs up on the way out. The riders did not carry any political affiliation, but Cochabamba’s Police Headquarters had flipped its allegiance to the opposition last Saturday, triggering a national wave of police mutiny that brought Ms. Añez to power. While Ms. Añez’s supporters remained firmly in control of central Cochabamba, Bolivia’s fourth-largest city in the Andean plateau, Indigenous groups loyal to Mr. Morales camped out on the approaches to the city. Clashes between both parties’s armed bands and security forces left at least a dozen people injured here Tuesday, including three from gunshot wounds. Earlier on Tuesday, in a rapid-fire series of tweets, Mr. Morales had urged members of his coalition to continue blocking efforts to nominate an interim leader. He congratulated the legislators for not showing up at the session at which his resignation would have been formally accepted, and Ms. Añez recognized as the country’s interim leader. He said they were “acting with unity and dignity to reject any manipulation by the racist, coup-mongering and traitorous right wing.” This frustrated many of the legislators who wanted to move forward. “Today, they have to understand that the most important is Bolivia, not Evo Morales,” one opposition lawmaker, Luis Felipe Dorado, said of the president’s supporters. “Evo Morales is gone from the country, but they continue to obey him, not the will of the country.” On Monday, as looting and violence spread across several cities, Ms. Añez at first appeared rattled, sobbing as she called for calm. But by the evening, she was projecting strength, and demanding that the army accept the national police’s call to jointly patrol the streets of La Paz to restore order.  The army quickly responded, sending troops into the streets and setting up defensive positions around vital infrastructure like electricity and waterworks.  The military high command met with Ms. Añez for more than an hour at the government palace Tuesday night in what her aides described as a planning session to keep the peace. At the end of the meeting, pictures were released of the senior officers saluting Ms. Añez. Bolivians appear sharply divided in their views — and in their hopes for the future. When Mr. Morales was first elected in 2006, he became the first Indigenous person to lead Bolivia, a nation in which two-thirds of the population are Indigenous. In the Plaza San Francisco in La Paz, street vendors, most of them Indigenous, overwhelmingly expressed support for him. “Evo was the best president we ever had,” said Rosario Siñane, 39, who was selling individually wrapped candies. “Now we have no more hope.” José Ariel Blanco, the 25-year-old owner of a stationery store two blocks from the legislature, said he was thankful for Mr. Morales’s achievements — chief among them, tackling the racism that the Indigenous had suffered for centuries. “My grandmother couldn’t walk into a bank in her Indigenous clothes until Evo became president,” he said. “Now she can, and that won’t change.” But he said Mr. Morales went too far in bending the rules of democracy. “The Venezuelan and Cuban models don’t work over time,” he said. Down the street from Mr. Blanco’s store, Victor Huancollo, a 24-year-old computer science university student, stood guard at a makeshift barricade intended to keep supporters of Mr. Morales from approaching the legislature. He was hopeful that new elections would be held in a few months, he said, and that “a transparent president who is not corrupt will emerge, not like what we had over the last 14 years.” On Tuesday morning Mr. Morales was met by Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, at the presidential hangar of Mexico City’s main airport. In comments to the news media, Mr. Morales remained defiant, vowing to continue his involvement in politics and his fight for social justice, Bolivia’s Indigenous populations and the poor. “Our sin is that we are ideologically anti-imperialist, but this coup won’t make me change ideologically,” he said. Mr. Morales, who was flanked by Bolivia’s former vice president, Álvaro García Linera, also thanked his hosts, the Mexican government. “We are very grateful to the president of Mexico, because he saved my life,” he said. Mr. Morales left office after weeks of growing unrest over a disputed presidential election and after the military indicated it would support the people in the streets who were calling for him to step down. In his audio message, which was released by the Mexican news media and broadcast in Bolivia, Mr. Morales called on the military to “stop the massacre.” Photographed draped in a Mexican flag aboard a Mexican Air Force plane, Mr. Morales also told his supporters, “We’ll work together for Bolivia.” At a news conference on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ebrard, the Mexican foreign minister, said his government had encountered numerous difficulties in securing permission to land its plane in Bolivia to retrieve Mr. Morales, and in getting cooperation from other countries in the region to facilitate the plane’s return to Mexico with the former Bolivian president aboard.  Among the obstacles, he said, the government of Peru had forbidden the plane to land on Peruvian territory to refuel during its return trip, and Ecuador had blocked passage over its territory, forcing the plane to take a path over the Pacific Ocean. That further delayed Mr. Morales’s arrival in Mexico City. Anatoly Kurmanaev contributed reporting from Cochabamba, Bolivia. Kirk Semple and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.

"Tampons to Be Taxed as Essential, Not Luxury, Items in Germany",2019-11-12,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Long classified in Germany as “luxury goods” taxed at the highest possible rate, tampons, pads and other menstrual products will soon join bread, books and cut flowers on the list of items considered “necessary for everyday life.” The change, set to take effect on Jan. 1, will reduce the tax on menstrual products to 7 percent from 19 percent. Parliament passed the law last week, as a campaign to reduce the high taxes on period products spread across the globe.  While 75 percent of all items considered essential in Germany — and therefore taxed at the lower rate — are foodstuffs, the category also includes other, less obvious products.  Cut flowers, books and newspapers, paintings, collectible coins, and theater tickets are also on the list. European Union regulations dictate that certain items cannot be taxed at a lower rate, but menstrual products are not among them, so two German women took the issue into their own hands.  “The higher tax rate on these products amounts to fiscal discrimination of women, based on their sex, which is not allowed by the Constitution,” Nanna-Josephine Roloff and Yasemin Kotra, who started the movement in Germany, wrote on their petition launched on International Women’s Day in 2018. By the end of that year, they had gathered 100,000 signatures — including from many men who had expressed support — and began lobbying politicians in Berlin, Ms. Roloff said in a telephone interview.  She said that many lawmakers were initially reluctant to support the proposed change, or even to return their calls. Those who did agree to speak with them often came up with excuses why change was impossible.  “We heard that they couldn’t do anything because it wasn’t in the contract drawn up by the governing coalition,” Ms. Roloff said, “that such a change would cause the whole tax system to collapse and that financial policies are not there to ensure equality in the tax code.”  On the advice of Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a co-founder of the United States-based nonprofit Period Equity, the women shifted their focus to conservative politicians in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, and their partners in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union.  In June, the parties put out a joint statement that the higher tax rate for menstrual products “is not justified through context or the tax code” and argued for lowering it. “That was the breakthrough,” Ms. Roloff said. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz met the women in October and thanked them for starting the initiative before voicing his support for lowering the so-called tampon tax. The last week, Parliament approved the change. It has already been incorporated into the German tax code and is to take effect on Jan. 1, bringing Germany in line with several other countries around the world.  Kenya was the first nation to stop taxing menstrual products in 2004, in part because millions of women and girls in the country could not afford these products. Canada dropped its tax in 2015, and Australia, India and Malaysia followed suit in 2018. In Europe, Britain, France and Luxembourg have also decreased taxes on such products. Women in Denmark and Sweden still pay a 25 percent tax on tampons and sanitary pads, according to data gathered by the Civico Foundation in Spain, while in Hungary, women pay 27 percent, despite European Union regulations that stipulate tax on menstrual products can be as low as 5 percent.  In the United States, menstrual products are subject to sales tax in 33 states, although 22 states are considering legislation to eliminate the tax. Nearly a dozen states have already eliminated it.  Ms. Roloff said that she and Ms. Kotra would have to monitor whether prices dropped once the change takes effect in January, but added that she hoped their success would raise awareness that the campaign was not just about the price of period products.  “We wanted to show that discrimination is deeply ingrained in places like the financial system,” she said. “But that it is possible to change it.”  Next, they would like to see menstrual products provided for free to women and girls in public institutions, including schools, hospitals, prisons and municipal office buildings.  “People aren’t expected to run around with toilet paper,” she said. “We think period products should be given an equal status.”  Except when it comes to taxation, that is. Toilet paper still falls under the standard rate.']","Starting Jan. 1, menstrual products will be considered “necessary” items, as bread, books and cut flowers are."
Quebec Reverses Decision on French Citizen’s Immigration Application,2019-11-11,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — A French woman whose desire to immigrate to Quebec was upended because she wrote a chapter of her doctoral thesis in English will receive a document necessary to remain in the province, she said on Monday. The woman, Émilie Dubois, a 31-year-old Francophone from Burgundy, had applied for a certificate required to settle permanently in Quebec.  But Quebec authorities, alluding to the chapter of her biology doctorate written in English, initially rejected her application on the grounds that she had not demonstrated sufficient proficiency in French. After an international outcry, the authorities called Ms. Dubois to let her know they had reversed their decision, she said on Monday. “I am happy and relieved, but I hope my case has raised awareness about the government’s immigration policies,” she said by phone from Quebec City. “It is not a good strategy to turn away the best and brightest students if Quebec wants to improve its economy.” The right-leaning government of the Quebec premier, François Legault, came to power last year with a promise to limit immigration. It has been exploring policies that would narrow the criteria for newcomers, including students, to gain residency.  Immigrants coming to Quebec will also soon have to pass a values test to assure they understand Quebec’s approach to issues such as gender equality. The government’s efforts to rein in immigration have prompted concerns that Quebec, home to some of the country’s leading universities, will no longer be as attractive to talented international students who once viewed studying in the province as a pathway to gaining Canadian residency and eventual citizenship. The province is determined to uphold French, the language of government, commerce and the courts. Mr. Legault has made clear that while he wants to reduce the number of immigrants coming to Quebec, he is eager to attract skilled labor from France. Nevertheless, Ms. Dubois’s initial application was turned down despite the fact that she completed a biology doctorate at Laval University in Quebec City, a French-language university. She also started a scientific graphic design company.']",
German Lawmakers Oust Committee Chair Over Remarks Seen as Anti-Semitic,2019-11-13,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — After a far-right lawmaker accused Germany’s president of “eroding” the rule of law and circulated remarks widely viewed as anti-Semitic, his colleagues on Wednesday ousted him as chair of a parliamentary committee on the grounds that he was unfit for office.  The decision to remove Stephan Brandner, a member of the Alternative for Germany party, from his post was the first such move in the nation’s post-World War II history. It comes as the country’s mainstream parties are struggling with how best to handle the party amid a growing fear over the rise of radicalization in the country. The persistent popularity of the far-right party, known as the AfD, and its representation in state and municipal assemblies across the country, has forced traditional parties to debate whether to isolate it or cooperate with it. Mr. Brandner, who was chairman of the legal affairs committee in Parliament, provoked outrage among lawmakers when he reposted a comment on Twitter that questioned the outpouring of solidarity with Jews and Muslims that followed a neo-Nazi’s thwarted attack last month on a synagogue in Halle. The Twitter post asked why politicians were “hanging around synagogues and mosques,” when the two people who were killed were Germans — wording that the committee members said in a statement “assumed that Jews and Muslims can’t be Germans.” Although he apologized for circulating the remarks, Mr. Brandner refused to step down. On Wednesday lawmakers from the governing Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, along with those from the opposition Free Democrats, Greens and the Left party, voted unanimously to remove him from his post. “Brandner’s firing sends a clear signal against hate and harassment,” Jan-Marco Luczak, a member of the conservative Christian Democrats told reporters after the vote. “With it, we are finally returning the honor to this chair.” The AfD is not part of the governing coalition, but in the German system, some committee chairs are assigned to members of opposition parties, to balance the power of the majority. Even before Mr. Brandner took up his post, there had been concerns from legal and judicial associations about his ability to carry out the job. He rejected the suggestion that his actions had been out of line and accused the other committee members of trying to curb his right to free speech. “This is a further low point for parliamentary democracy in Germany,” he told reporters after the hearing. “Speak your mind once and whoops, you’ve lost your job.”  After a strong showing by the far right in last month’s election in the state of Thuringia left none of the traditional parties with a clear majority, members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives began urging their party to break its refusal to engage in any way with the AfD. The party’s leadership in Berlin quashed the suggestion, insisting that any cooperation with the far right would betray the party’s values and break an agreed-upon taboo.  A statement written by a Greens lawmaker, Manuela Rottmann, and supported by other members of the legal affairs committee declared that Mr. Brandner was “not qualified to lead this committee.” “With your comments, you are destroying the bridges of communication to citizens, to the Bar, to professional associations, religious organizations and civil society,” the statement read. “You are destroying every requirement that the chair of the legal affairs committee be able to accept a plural, open democracy.”  Before becoming a lawmaker in Berlin, Mr. Brandner had made a name for himself in his three years in the state legislature of Thuringia, where he racked up a record number of warnings and was once ordered out of the legislature. He was formally rebuked in Parliament for accusing President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of “eroding” the rule of law during a debate in May commemorating 70 years of the German Constitution.']","A member of the far-right Alternative for Germany party was removed as unfit for his post, a first for postwar Germany."
"Trains Collide in Bangladesh, Killing at Least 16",2019-11-12,By Kai Schultz and Julfikar Ali Manik,"['NEW DELHI — Two trains collided in eastern Bangladesh on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people and injuring dozens more, officials said. Shariful Alam, a spokesman for Bangladesh’s railway department, said the collision on Tuesday occurred around 3 a.m. in the district of Brahmanbaria, where the Turna Nishita train, which was heading to Dhaka, the country’s capital, smashed into the Udayan Express, a train heading in the opposite direction. Mr. Alam said the conductor of the Turna Nishita, who survived the accident, failed to heed a stop signal when he rammed into one of the other train’s passenger compartments, where many people were sleeping. “We were so close to death, but God saved us,” Mohammad Moslem, 50, a passenger on one of the trains, told Reuters, adding that when he came out of the train, many of the bodies were missing limbs. Hundreds of people rushed onto the tracks to pull survivors from a flaming mass of twisted metal. Television footage showed fire service rescuers zipping up body bags. Relatives rushed to a nearby hospital. Mr. Alam said the driver was suspended after the accident. He said the government had opened an investigation into the collision and that victims’ families would receive financial compensation. Train accidents are somewhat common in Bangladesh, where track conditions are poor and there have been many derailments.']",
Hong Kong Colleges Become Besieged Citadels as Police Close In,2019-11-13,By Edward Wong and Ezra Cheung,"['HONG KONG — Seething with anger, the black-clad students hurled gasoline bombs, threw bricks and even aimed flaming arrows at the riot police, who answered with tear-gas volleys and rubber bullets that hurtled into Hong Kong’s university grounds for the first time. And with those battles on Monday and Tuesday at the territory’s largest universities, another unspoken rule in the antigovernment protests that have been convulsing Hong Kong for six months was shattered: the sanctity of educational campuses from the police.  The clashes turned what had been sanctuaries for the students at the core of the movement into scenes that evoked medieval citadels under siege.  They opened a new chapter that threatens to further disrupt the Asian financial capital, which has struggled for normalcy despite the increasingly violent protests against the Chinese Communist authorities in Beijing who have the last word over Hong Kong’s future.  Hong Kong has fallen into recession as tourists have fled and as its busy shopping areas become backdrops for street battles between demonstrators and police officers. The world is asking hard questions about what could befall Hong Kong as Beijing  further tightens control over a city that is supposed to operate under its own laws. [Why are people protesting in Hong Kong?] The most dramatic student-versus-police clash unfolded late Tuesday night at a barricaded bridge leading to the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For hours, police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows. More than 100 injured students were brought to a makeshift first-aid clinic in a gym.  By targeting campuses, the police have breached the last refuge of the protesters, a move that brings the violence to the heart of the universities and invokes the pivotal and fraught role of student activism in the global history of democracy movements.  “One thing that people have realized is that the protests, the movement, the conflict, is unavoidable,” Gabriel Fung, a 19-year-old second-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said. “It’s going to reach you wherever you are at some point.” It is at these universities where young leaders and other students have been organizing revolts against the Chinese Communist Party and spreading the pro-democracy ideas that undergird the protests. And here, too, that the students discuss the wealth inequality and cultural homogenization that have led to visions of a bleak future among many of their generation.  In Hong Kong, university administrators and professors now find themselves in a difficult position, trying to preach tolerance and walk a tightrope of furious demands from students, the police and government officials. Two schools on Wednesday ended their semesters weeks early. “Not a single place in Hong Kong is exempt from the rule of law, and that includes universities,” John Lee, the secretary for security, said Wednesday at a news conference. “Universities are not supposed to be the breeding ground of violence.” The showdown has been brewing for years, going back to the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement of 2014. And the roots of the protests in many ways harken back to social movements elsewhere. On mainland China, students have led campaigns calling for sweeping political change, notably in 1919 and 1989. In the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, violence broke out on campuses during anti-Vietnam War protests, most horrifically at Kent State University in 1970, when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire on students, killing four and injuring nine. Student activists in Hong Kong have lived by an exhausting weekly rhythm since the movement began in early June: protest on weekends, show up on Mondays for class, study for exams and apply for internships or jobs in between it all. Many argue with parents who disagree with their politics or tactics. Hundreds have been arrested in recent months and quickly released by the police, as required by law. It was the death of a university student this month that set off the current round of protests and violence. Chow Tsz-lok, a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, sustained a fatal injury after falling from a parking garage near a police action on Nov. 4. Thousands attended candlelit memorial rallies last weekend, and his photograph is on posters and makeshift shrines all over campuses, since he is now a martyr for other students. Roiled by the latest unrest, universities canceled classes from Monday to Friday. That meant protesters have been able to hit the streets at dawn on weekdays after sleeping a few hours. On campus, activists have sprayed fresh graffiti, including phrases cursing administrators. The fraught situation led police officers on Wednesday to organize an evacuation of dozens of mainland Chinese students across the border to Shenzhen, where hotels offered them free rooms.  One graduate student at the University of Hong Kong said he and others from the mainland still felt safer on campuses than on the streets. He said many students do not openly express pro-Beijing opinions and sometimes avoid speaking loudly in Mandarin, the dominant language back home. (He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the tensions.)  Some university departments have delayed recruitment drives of mainland and foreign students to come up with new strategies; a drop-off in enrollment by mainland graduate students, who often pay full tuition, would lead to budget problems.  Hong Kong’s public universities, which have more than 86,000 undergraduate and nearly 11,000 graduate students, each have distinct characters. That means the students have occupied different roles in the movement, and the protests have played out in different ways on each campus. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, with 20,000 students, is considered the most radical campus. Most of its students are Cantonese-speaking locals, some of whom live nearby with their parents in dense apartment blocks. And the campus is high in the hills of Sha Tin, isolated from the city center, which is an hour’s ride away by subway. On Monday, the police arrested five students on the campus’s edge, administrators said. The next morning, the police, still at the border, confronted front line students, and clashes took place over 20 hours. Rocky S. Tuan, the president, who has been known for trying to engage with students during the movement, showed up during a lull in the evening to urge the students to be calm. “You all should know that I really want to help you. I will do everything within my capability,” he said. “It is the university’s responsibility to maintain peace on campus, not the police.” But as Mr. Tuan began walking away, the police fired tear gas. Mr. Tuan himself was enveloped in the gas. Students set fires to keep the police from advancing, and scores formed human chains to pass along bricks, umbrellas and bottled water to the front lines. Students sitting on one patch of road made gasoline bombs as if on an assembly line. “It was a savage move and a type of police violence when they tried to encroach on the university,” said Timothy Chow, 23, an engineering student who graduated in June. “This is why we have to protect our Chinese University of Hong Kong.” “When I saw our compatriots and Chinese University staff being hurt by the police, I felt particularly furious and wanted to come back to defend our university,” he added. At the University of Hong Kong this week, front-line students also set up barricades and, against the advice of professors, threw paving bricks off balconies, even though it is considered the most established of the territory’s schools.  Founded in 1911, it is the territory’s oldest university. Many of its students are foreigners or Hong Kong residents who attended international schools. English is the main language, and the university aims to open a mainland China campus. Among its alumni are many police commanders and Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive who is reviled by protesters. On Monday, the students were on edge in part because the police had taken a student from a dormitory area early that morning. Two liberal law professors, Hualing Fu and Johannes Chan, urged a group of front-line protesters in masks not to resort to violence and to understand that the struggle for democracy was a lifetime commitment, according to video footage. But one masked woman shouted they had no choice, and asked: “How many people are we going to sacrifice?” “We are better, we are different,” Mr. Fu said. “But we shall not forgive,” a young man shouted, “we shall not forget.”  On Monday and Tuesday mornings, police officers arrived at campus entrances to try to clear the barricades. They fired tear gas, but retreated. Students have called on the president, Xiang Zhang, to forcefully condemn the police, but he has refrained from doing so, and, unlike Mr. Tuan, rarely holds open forums. On occasion, professors have shown up at the front lines to speak to students, as William Hayward, dean of social sciences, did on Tuesday. “Obviously, as it goes on and as it gets more polarized, this becomes increasingly a challenge,” Mr. Hayward later said of student engagement. “Some of them do really open up, but at the same time, you know, of course they’re trying to figure out — is he on our side or is he trying to silence us?” As night fell on Tuesday, students traded shifts at the barricades, walking past a famous eight-meter statue of orange corpses, “The Pillar of Shame,” that memorializes the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students and workers around Tiananmen Square in Beijing by the Chinese government. Paul Mozur and Katherine Li contributed reporting.']","Police have begun raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests, leading student activists to engage with them in pitched battles that resemble medieval sieges."
This Mexican Village’s Embroidery Designs Are Admired (and Appropriated) Globally,2019-11-13,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['SAN NICOLÁS, Mexico — A mystery lies behind the origin of the distinctive forms depicted in the elaborate embroidery stitched in San Nicolás, a pinprick of a mountain village in the central Mexican highlands. But to Glafira Candelaria José, who has sewn those images all her life, there can be only one source. “Diosito,” said Ms. Candelaria, using an affectionate form of the Spanish word for “God.” A spiritual charge does seem to animate the figures fluttering across the fabrics that the artisans of the Indigenous Otomí community produce in this area. And many of the vivid forms are inspired by the cascade of local vegetation and the wildlife that shelters there: deer, colorful birds, mountain lions and foxes. Over the past few decades, the artisans working in San Nicolás and other villages clustered around the region’s main town, Tenango de Doria, in the state of Hidalgo, have turned a craft they practiced for survival into a cottage industry. The tenangos, as the embroidered pieces are called, have evolved into richly detailed works reaching a worldwide market. Including some unsolicited admirers. Over the past few months, major international brands have advertised products decorated with the Otomís’ distinctive iconography, without mentioning Tenango de Doria or the Otomí as their source. The polite phrase for this is cultural appropriation. In local villages, where children begin to embroider before they learn to read, people call it plagiarism. For all its lushness, this part of Mexico has been largely ignored and its heritage disdained. Acute poverty pushed many Otomí to migrate to the United States, the only way to shake off childhoods when they went hungry and shoeless. People here still speak Otomí, an Indigenous tonal language, even though it has given way to Spanish in most of the region. “We have always been marginalized for being Indigenous,” said Rebeca López Patiño, a village artisan. Nothing, however, has stopped them from embroidering, with their exuberant visions adorning bedspreads, tapestries, cushions, clothing and even earrings. “It is what we have always done,” said Angélica Martínez García, 37. “My mother would wake us up at 4 in the morning to embroider. Every weekend my mother would sell a tablecloth, and we would have enough to eat from that.” Now the international copies have generated stern letters from Mexico’s culture minister and renewed discussion over how to protect the intellectual property of the Indigenous communities. Several tenango artisans have begun registering their designs under Mexican copyright law. Among them is Adalberto Flores, who filed a criminal complaint against Nestlé three years ago for selling a ceramic cup bearing similar images to his own. The company denied any wrongdoing, and the case is not resolved. Meanwhile Nestlé won a court ruling this year invalidating his copyright registration. A second company, Benetton, used what looked like a tenango print in a swimsuit this summer. The company said that the design was “the result of online research,” and that its “product department was not aware of the traditional work of this community.” Alma Yuridia Santos Modesto, part of an artisan collective in the nearby village of El Dequeña, said the visibility that comes from global brands using Otomí designs “gives a big boost to our craft.” But, she added: “It would be nice to take us into account. At least by giving us a bit more work.” Her collective did embroider bags for Carolina Herrera a few years ago. More recently, though, the same fashion house used tenango iconography in its 2020 resort collections without any credit. After a complaint from the culture minister, the company said its designer “wanted to show his deep respect” for “Mexican craftsmanship.” The tradition of the tenangos is new by Mexican standards, with the Otomí, or hñähñu as they call themselves, developing their singular iconography in the 1960s. Marta Turok, an anthropologist and expert on Mexican folk art, said some images may have derived from nearby cave paintings or from portrayals of healing ceremonies practiced by local shamans, who were among the first artisans. But the Otomí are enriching their designs with new experiences, including migration, said Diana Macho Morales, a social anthropologist at the National School of Anthropology and History who has carried out research in the community. Alongside stylized images of flora and fauna, Ms. Macho has encountered surprises: a giraffe, an image derived from a government campaign for a healthy diet and the Incredible Hulk. For most of the artisans, the one-way connection to international fashion is nothing more than an asterisk, a distraction from the real concern of how to make a living. Those who do the heavy labor of needlework earn less than $10 to embroider a square about the size of a small cushion. Some artisans, known as “dibujantes,” draw the designs onto the fabric, and earn more. A few dibujantes, whose designs have become well-known, dream of showing off their work to a global audience. Mr. Flores, who is battling Nestlé, is a dibujante. He used to spend part of every year working as a landscaper in North Carolina. “I would like to go back — but this time to exhibit my work with a brand, and with a visa,” he said. Ezequiel Vicente José, a retired teacher, is one of the village’s best-known dibujantes. He has established a distinctive style, regularly adding images of human activities to his designs: cutting firewood, planting a cornfield, a wedding, the Day of the Dead — “an infinity of things,” he said. Mr. Vicente thinks the craft could generate a livelihood for more people if artisans banded together, by agreeing on prices and on “how to improve the drawings.” “Selfishness and envy have not allowed us to work together,” he said. Even with a collective approach, the village artisans would still be constrained by the absence of basic infrastructure. There is not a single bank branch in the entire municipality of Tenango de Doria. The road to San Nicolás is paved but most of the other villages are at the end of dirt roads. As a result, many artisans have no choice but to sell to middlemen who arrive on market days and set the prices. “We compete among ourselves and that lowers the price,” Ms. López said as she unfolded an elaborate tablecloth that she designed and embroidered, and that she said should cost about $250. A buyer in the Tenango de Doria market would offer only $150, she said. But perhaps the biggest concern in the village is how many in the next generation will want to follow their parents. Faustina José, 43, grew up in a family of eight children and they all embroidered. Only one of her four children draws and embroiders with her; the other three are in the United States. “It is being lost,” she said of the craft that helped lift her out of poverty. “Young people don’t want to do it. They prefer to work, or to study.”']",
The French Theaters Where the iPhone Is No Match for Guignol,2019-11-11,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — The children hurried with their parents past tree-lined promenades and sparkling fountains toward a jewel-box puppet theater in Luxembourg Gardens, the popular  park at the center of Paris. Around 40 pint-size spectators, ages 2 to 8, swarmed around a tiny ticket window, then clambered into a brightly lit hall with black walls and red leather benches, licking lollipops and pulling at cotton candy.  iPhones were stowed and forgotten as they faced a miniature stage with red velvet curtains and posters of colorfully costumed French marionettes. Françis-Claude Desarthis, 73, the theater’s rotund, cherub-faced owner, ambled down the aisles, swinging a brass bell to signal the start of the show. “Silence!” cried a 4-year-old girl, raising a finger to her lips. “Guignol is coming! Mr. Desarthis, who had slipped behind the stage, pulled a three-foot tall wooden puppet with arched eyebrows, cherry-red cheeks and a  brown coat on his arm. Guignol, a talkative, impulsive character who is a cultural icon in France, was instantly recognizable to this boisterous crowd. Guignol defeats bad guys — on this day, an evil French chef — and defends the oppressed. On a starry set with Montmartre and the Eiffel Tower painted into the background, he dispensed justice to other wooden marionettes as the children cheered him on. “The kids are completely transfixed,” said Patrice Seme, 54, who had brought his grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, from their home in Versailles to the Théâtre des Marionnettes du Luxembourg, one of the oldest in Paris.  “You can’t get this from an iPhone,” he added. “We are opening the doors to their imagination.” In an era of limitless on-demand entertainment, the timeworn art of French marionette theater continues to capture minds and hearts in this country in ways that smartphones, video games and the most seducing technologies can’t. About 600 marionette companies operate in France, with the biggest concentration of theaters — known as châtelets, or little castles — found in parks around Paris. Many operations, like Le Guignol de Paris, inaugurated in 1892 in the Buttes des Chaumont park, are run by the descendants of marionettists who passed down their savoir-faire. Mr. Desarthis is one of them. A second-generation puppeteer, he began learning from his father at age 6.  “The marionette is an essential part of our culture,” said Mr. Desarthis, as he settled onto a theater bench after a show.  “They engage with the public, which feels connected to their stories,” he added, flexing his arms to get the blood flowing after wielding several six-pound puppets for an hour. “It’s a collective experience.” In France, the culture of the puppet is complex. From Cinderella to working-class caricatures like Gnafron, a poor shoemaker, puppets in elaborate costumes animated by hand, string or stick keep audiences of every age rapt. They sing familiar songs, defy authority and confront life’s dramas in performances that mirror the nation’s psyche. Marionettes have also branched into the avant-garde, morphing into unconventional sizes, forms and materials. A sugar cube arranged on a chair may be considered a marionette if someone animates it with hands and voice. Fantastical creations appear in operas, musicals and plays, and are feted at the biennial World Puppet Theater Festival in the  town of Charleville-Mézières. But they haven’t knocked Guignol from center stage. Mr. Desarthis’s atelier near the Luxembourg Gardens is filled with 2,500 Guignol figures, from chimney sweeps to poodles, that he has lovingly fashioned over the decades. With four employees, he also paints the sets, records voices and arranges special effects on 80 projectors.  “Rain, snow, flames — we do it all,” he said. Mr. Desarthis was smitten by marionettes as a boy, inspired by his father, Robert, a former toy seller and clown who built Paris’s first stand-alone puppet theater in 1933. Back then, the Luxembourg Gardens, owned by the French Senate, swarmed with three times as many visitors as today. “There were almost no cars, and people didn’t leave on vacations and holidays,” he said. “Le tout Paris went there, and every puppet show was packed.” When Françis-Claude was born in 1946, his parents put marionettes in his crib. At 6, he said, he told his teacher: “It’s no use teaching me to read. I want to do puppets.” His father enrolled him in diction and acting courses, and sent him to a top marionette training school in Czechoslovakia at age 16. These days, Mr. Desarthis said, children have more distractions.  “They have technology, videos, TV, phones,” he said. “But once they come inside my theater, they have a direct interaction with the Guignols, and they forget about all that.” He slipped his hand into a floppy piece of brown fabric topped with a wooden ball. Suddenly, Guignol sprang up, waving his arms and pointing around the theater. “People don’t understand how much of an art it is, to make a puppet come to life,” he said. “The magic is in the wrist,” he continued. “If you know the craft, you give him energy, vibrancy and a real personality.” The marionette dates to the Middle Ages, when icons of the Virgin Mary were paraded in religious processions. “Marion,” a diminutive for Mary, took on a life of its own in the 17th century, when puppets inspired by the commedia dell’arte in Italy appeared in street shows, just as the French playwright Moliere popularized traveling plays in villages around France. The characters were aimed at adults, and grew more satirical after the French Revolution. The most popular was Guignol, created in 1808 by Laurent Mourguet, an illiterate silk weaver-turned tooth-puller in Lyon who used marionettes to attract clients in the city’s central square. Guignol quickly struck a chord among Lyon’s working class. He railed against misery and injustice, mocked authority and beat police puppets who harassed the poor. The message was so pointed that Napoleon III briefly censored Guignol plays. “People identified with Guignol,” said Lucile Bodson, the former director of the International Institute of Marionettes. “He entered the popular culture and gave them power to express themselves against the powerful.” So enduring is Guignol’s satire that a television show, “Les Guignols d’Info,” featuring life-size  puppets, aired on France’s Canal+ channel for 20 years before ending last year. President Emmanuel Macron was depicted as a penguin while running for office, and a gun-toting Sylvester Stallone symbolized America. These days, Guignol is a toned-down version of his former self, playing to a generation of parents that eschews spanking and violence.  “Today, there’s no brutality or beatings,” Mr. Desarthis said. “We shouldn’t be teaching children that — au contraire.” But the message remains the same. “It’s the tension between good and evil, and that justice rewards the good,” Mr. Desarthis said. He stepped backstage to prepare for another show. As a new group of children toddled in, a ballad about the puppeteer played on a video. “He’s hot, and his arms hurt,” the song went. “But he makes the children laugh. What a beautiful thing, my friends, to be a child forever!” In a moment, dozens of motionless puppets would spring to life on Mr. Desarthis’s arms. An 80-year-old Parisienne and her cat, Minouchette, who lived under the rooftops of Montmartre. A heartless chef, Lustucru, who planned to butcher innocent rabbits — and the cat — for dinner. And, of course, Guignol. He would free the oppressed, save the old lady and kick the chef down a chimney — much to the delight of his young audience.']",
Philippine Guerrillas Kill at Least 6 Soldiers in Bombing,2019-11-12,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — Six Philippine soldiers were killed and 23 others wounded, the military said on Tuesday, when a platoon checking on reports of an infiltration by communist rebels stepped on improvised bombs as they negotiated hilly terrain. The troops had been sent in on Monday after civilians had complained of harassment by guerrillas with the New People’s Army outside Borongan City on Samar Island, which is in the central eastern part of the country. Six improvised bombs planted by the insurgents exploded before the soldiers engaged in a firefight with them, the military said. The 30-minute gun battle that followed led to the death of one guerrilla, the military said. The killings were a reminder of the stubborn insurgent threat in remote areas of the Philippines despite military campaigns aimed at eliminating the rebels. Capt. Reynaldo Aragones, an Army infantry spokesman, said the rebels “were extorting money and food, and the responding soldiers were hit by the blasts.” He said soldiers were still searching the remote area for insurgents. The island of Samar is one of the few remaining strongholds of the New People’s Army, the armed unit of the Communist Party of the Philippines, which has waged a guerrilla campaign for half a century. President Rodrigo Duterte, a self-proclaimed leftist, initially enjoyed support from the party’s founder, Jose Maria Sison, who is in exile in Europe. Mr. Sison taught Mr. Duterte when he was in college, and many had initially thought that their connection would lead to an end to an insurgency that has claimed thousands of lives and stunted the growth of the countryside. But Mr. Duterte abruptly called off talks with the communists in 2017, accusing them of continuing to attack government positions despite the peace efforts. He has dared Mr. Sison to come home and personally talk peace with him. But Mr. Sison rebuffed the offer, saying he faced arrest if he set foot in the Philippines. The president then declared a termination of the peace process until his term ends in 2022. In April, six soldiers were killed in a communist rebel attack that came a month after the insurgents marked their 50th anniversary.']",The killings were a reminder of the stubborn threat of insurgents in rural areas of the Philippines.
"Mexico, a Haven for Leftists in Exile, Provides Evo Morales With a Landing Spot",2019-11-13,By Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin,"['MEXICO CITY — When Evo Morales stepped off a Mexican government plane on Tuesday and into exile on Mexican soil, he followed a well-trod path. During the past century and a half, Mexico has been a haven for those on the left who have sought asylum — Spanish leftists, American socialists and Communists from Europe among them. In explaining its decision to invite Mr. Morales, the leftist Bolivian leader who stepped down on Sunday, the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that Mexico “has shown itself as an inclusive and supportive state whose doors have been open.” Those doors have opened to Cubans who fought for independence against Spain in the 19th century, most notably José Martí, the poet and revolutionary who spent a couple of years in Mexico in the mid-1870s during a long period of banishment from the island. Spanish leftists who fled after the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s were also welcomed by the Mexican authorities, a wave that included the filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who arrived in Mexico in the 1940s and became a Mexican citizen. During the Nazi era in Germany, thousands of European Jews and Communists sought protection in Mexico, many of them artists and writers. And a number of American socialists migrated south during the Red Scare campaign of the 1950s, driven away by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. Lorenzo Meyer, a historian and emeritus professor at the Colegio de México in Mexico City, said that Mexico’s welcome of generations of left-wing exiles has been a way for its government to assert independence from the United States without presenting an overt foreign policy challenge. “Of course, with the United States next door, Mexico cannot be completely sovereign, but that does not stop it from taking some symbolic measures,” Mr. Meyer said.  In the 1970s, Argentines and Chileans, fearing for their lives during the dirty wars in their countries, sought refuge in Mexico, which also protected the family of President Salvador Allende of Chile, who died in a 1973 coup. More recently, Guatemalans escaping the scorched-earth tactics of the Guatemalan military in the 1980s migrated to Mexico, the most famous being Rigoberta Menchú, the Indigenous advocate who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. And in the past few years, tens of thousands of Central Americans have applied for asylum here, many having done so after being foiled in their attempt to reach the United States. Other prominent exiles have included the deposed Shah of Iran, who in 1979 was granted a Mexican tourist visa and spent a few months living in the city of Cuernavaca, south of the capital, before going to the United States for medical treatment. In this case, Mexico’s open arms stretched only so far: The Mexican government blocked him from returning. For some, Mexican refuge has not only provided a second lease on life, it has also proven to be a staging ground for a successful return to the homeland. After failing in an early assault on a Cuban military barracks, in 1953, Fidel Castro lived in Mexico City and plotted his ultimately successful campaign to topple the Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista. But Mexico hasn’t worked out so well for others. Among the best-known figures granted sanctuary in Mexico was Leon Trotsky after his exile from the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin. In 1940, during a visit with Mr. Trotsky, a Stalinist agent who had infiltrated his inner circle sunk a pickax into his skull. Mr. Trotsky died at a hospital the next day.']","Spanish leftists, American socialists and Communists from Central Europe have all found a home in Mexico over the past century and a half. "
"To Make This Tofu, Start by Burning Toxic Plastic",2019-11-14,By Richard C. Paddock,"['TROPODO, Indonesia — Black smoke billows from smokestacks towering above the village. The smell of burning plastic fills the air. Patches of black ash cover the ground. It’s another day of making tofu. More than 30 commercial kitchens in Tropodo, a village on the eastern side of Indonesia’s main island, Java, fuel their tofu production by burning a mix of paper and plastic waste, some of it shipped from the United States after Americans dumped it in their recycling bins. The backyard kitchens produce much of the area’s tofu, an inexpensive and high-protein food made from soy that is an important part of the local diet. But the smoke and ash produced by the burning plastic has far-reaching and toxic consequences.  Testing of eggs laid by chickens in Tropodo, a village of 5,000 people, found high levels of several hazardous chemicals including dioxin — a pollutant known to cause cancer, birth defects and Parkinson’s disease — according to a report released this week by an alliance of Indonesian and international environmental groups. The dioxin found in Tropodo is the end product in a chain of malfeasance, carelessness and governmental neglect. “They start the burning early in the morning and go until evening,” said Karnawi, 84, who lives near seven of the plastic-burning commercial kitchens. “It happens every day and the smoke is always in the air. For me, it’s difficult to breathe.” Like many Indonesians, Mr. Karnawi uses only one name.  An egg laid by one of Mr. Karnawi’s chickens had one of the highest levels of dioxin ever recorded in Asia, the report found.  The levels of dioxin found in that egg were second only to eggs collected near Bien Hoa, Vietnam, the former United States air base that was a Vietnam War staging area for the defoliant Agent Orange, which contains dioxin. The United States recently began a 10-year, $390 million cleanup at Bien Hoa, which remains heavily contaminated nearly five decades after the war ended. An adult who eats just one egg like the one taken from Mr. Karnawi’s henhouse would exceed the United States daily safety threshold by nearly 25-fold and the stricter European Food Safety Authority standard by 70-fold. Eggs are commonly used for testing contamination because chickens effectively sample the soil as they forage and toxins accumulate in their eggs.  “These stark findings illustrate the dangers of plastics for human health and should move policymakers to ban plastic waste combustion, address environmental contamination, and rigorously control imports,” said Lee Bell, an adviser to the International Pollutants Elimination Network and a co-author of the report. The study was conducted by four environmental groups: Ecoton and the Nexus3 Foundation, based in Indonesia; Arnika, based in Prague; and the International Pollutants Elimination Network or IPEN, a global network dedicated to eliminating toxic pollutants. The toxins found in Tropodo’s soil begin with Westerners believing they are doing a good thing for the environment — sorting their waste for recycling. Much of that waste is sent abroad, including to Indonesia, where it is combined with local waste for processing. But rather than being turned into new consumer goods like fleece jackets and sneakers, much of the waste is unusable for recycling and is instead thrown into the furnaces that fuel Tropodo’s tofu boilers. “This is plastic collected from consumers in the United States and other countries and burned to make tofu in Indonesia,” said Yuyun Ismawati, a co-founder of the Nexus3 Foundation and a study co-author. The amount of foreign waste coming to Indonesia soared two years ago after China halted trash imports. In East Java, 11 paper mills operate south of Surabaya, Indonesia’s second-largest city, and import waste paper for recycling.  Some unscrupulous foreign waste handlers dump unwanted plastic on the developing world by including as much as 50 percent plastic in their supposed paper shipments, Ms. Yuyun said. Local companies profit by accepting the shipments. Much of the plastic is unwanted, low-grade material and Indonesia has no good way to dispose of it. After removing the best materials for recycling, most companies send their remaining waste to Bangun, a village known for its trash pickers who hunt for items of value and material worth recycling. In Bangun, piles of trash, some more than 15 feet high, fill every vacant bit of land. About 2,400 people live in the village and almost every family is involved in the waste business. The trash pickers say they can tell that some shipments have come from the United States because of the writing on items they sort. Further indicating the origin of the waste, the pickers say they sometimes find accidentally discarded American dollars and broken liquor bottles with distinctively American labels, like Jack Daniels. The final stop for the least wanted trash is Tropodo and its tofu makers. Every day, trucks carry leftover scraps of paper and plastic 20 miles by road from Bangun to Tropodo and leave their loads outside the tofu kitchens. “People need it as fuel for the tofu factories,” said a truck driver, Fadil, 38, as he dumped his load on a village street. He said he had been delivering paper and plastic waste to the village’s tofu makers for 20 years. The open burning of trash — including plastic — is widespread throughout Indonesia. The practice is illegal but the law is seldom enforced. Environmental activists say Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, has neglected health concerns in pursuit of economic development and have urged him to address toxic contamination, including air pollution and mercury contamination. In July, the Environment Ministry’s director general for waste management, Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, visited Tropodo and acknowledged that the plastic burning was hazardous but made no attempt to halt it. She told reporters that she would investigate how the toxic smoke could be controlled. “If the plastic is used as fuel it is not a problem but the pollution should be managed,” she said. Since then, the government has taken no action. Contacted last week by The New York Times, Ms. Ratnawati declined to discuss the issue and referred questions to the director general for environmental pollution, Karliansyah. He did not respond to inquiries from The Times. Many of Tropodo’s residents say they detest the plastic burning but are powerless to stop it. The tofu makers — a major employer in Tropodo — switched to burning plastic from wood many years ago. The kitchens operate every day, and when there is little wind the acrid smoke hangs over the village like a poisonous fog. Nanang Zainuddin, 37, runs a small kitchen around the corner from Mr. Karanawi’s henhouse. He says he burns plastic because it is cheaper, sometimes as little as a tenth of the cost of burning wood. The process of making tofu starts with soaking and grinding soybeans, placing them in a concrete tub and injecting steam from a boiler that is fueled by burning plastic. One worker tends the boiler and stuffs plastic into the fire while others steam the soybeans and skim off the pulp. Mr. Nanang said that he disposes of the plastic ash by burying some and spreading more on the ground to create a level surface. He also gives some to neighbors so they can spread it over the soil around their homes. “We are now standing on the ashes,” he said as chickens and chicks scratched for food near his feet. “Dioxin can come from anywhere,” he added, “but if the government would like to resolve this, they are welcome.” The former mayor of Tropodo, Ismail, 50, a tofu producer himself, banned the use of plastic as fuel in 2014. But the prohibition lasted only a few months before the burning resumed. His edict has been ignored ever since. “There are many tofu makers here and most of them do not care,” said Mr. Ismail, who uses mostly wood and some plastic as his fuel. “The tofu makers only count the profit, profit, profit. They don’t count the disadvantages created by this business.” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","Plastic waste from America, collected for recycling, is shipped to Indonesia.

ISIS Suspect Trapped at Turkish-Greek Border Is to Be Deported to U.S.,2019-11-14,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey announced on Thursday that it would repatriate an American suspected of being a member of the Islamic State, after a commitment from the United States that his entry would not be blocked. The American, Muhammad Darwish Bassam, 39, had been stranded on a strip of land at the Turkish-Greek border for the past four days after Turkey had tried to deport him to Greece, but Greek officials refused him entry.  The announcement by the Interior Ministry came a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey met with President Trump in Washington. Turkey has used Mr. Bassam’s case to highlight its demand that Western countries take back their citizens who joined the Islamic State and have been detained by Turkish forces. A spokesman at the United States Embassy in Ankara, the Turkish capital, declined to confirm the announcement on privacy grounds. Little is known of Mr. Bassam or his exact affiliation with the Islamic State. Official news outlets in Turkey have reported that he is of Jordanian origin and holds an American passport. He is reported to have been captured by Turkish-backed forces in northeastern Syria last month, after Mr. Erdogan ordered the seizure of territory to create what he called a safe zone. Mr. Bassam has been photographed waving his arms and pacing inside the buffer zone between the Turkish and Greek border posts. Journalists were not permitted to speak to him, and a unit of antiterrorism police officers had been guarding him at all times. Officials from Greece and Turkey have given conflicting statements: Greek officials said that Mr. Bassam had declared that he was being deported against his will to Greece; Turkish officials said that he had requested to go to a third country rather than to the United States. In an interview with the Turkish daily Sozcu on Wednesday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said that Turkey was holding 2,280 Islamic State members, a far larger number than was previously known. “There are 2,280 ISIS members in Turkey from 30 countries, all of them will be deported,” Mr. Soylu told the newspaper. He also said that there were 250 Islamic State members in immigration centers in Turkey, 850 who had been captured in the latest operation in northeastern Syria, and 1,180 “being held in Turkish prisons.” “We’re not a hotel or a guesthouse for terrorists from any country,” he added. Turkey’s ministry also said the process for deporting one foreign fighter from Britain and seven from Germany had been carried out.  Later on Thursday, the British police said they had made a “Syria-related” arrest of a 26-year-old man who landed at Heathrow International Airport on a flight from Turkey. He was detained on suspicion of terrorism offenses, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.']",Turkey said it had received assurances from Washington that the American would not be refused entry.
South Korea Resists U.S. Pressure to Improve Ties With Japan,2019-11-15,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea on Friday adamantly rejected an American request to continue sharing military intelligence with Japan, as the two American allies remained locked in festering disputes over trade and history. Mark T. Esper, the United States secretary of defense, visited Seoul to attend an annual defense meeting and personally implore his South Korean counterpart to remain in the intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, known as the General Security of Military Information Agreement, or GSOMIA.  Washington considers the agreement important for the security and stability of the region. South Korea and Japan face similar threats from North Korea and China, but there is a deep-seated mistrust rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.  “The only ones who benefit from the expiration of GSOMIA and continued friction between Seoul and Tokyo are Pyongyang and Beijing,” Mr. Esper said during a joint news conference with his counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, on Friday.  “That reason alone should be powerful enough for all of us to sit down and make sure that we restore our alliance and partnership where it was,” Mr. Esper added. Mr. Jeong said South Korea would abandon the agreement next Friday unless Japan removed the export restrictions it had earlier imposed against South Korea.  That sentiment was echoed by the office of President Moon Jae-in. “Our decision to terminate GSOMIA was inevitable,” Ko Min-jung, a spokeswoman for Mr. Moon, said in a radio interview earlier on Friday. “If we revoke our decision unilaterally without any change in Japan’s exports restrictions and in relations between South Korea and Japan, it would only prove that we made our original decision not prudently enough. That was not the case.” When South Korea announced in August that it would abandon the agreement, despite repeated objections from Washington, it created a rare fracture in the alliance between South Korea and the United States. Washington issued several statements expressing strong disappointment with its allies in Seoul. The agreement took effect in 2016 and had become a symbol of Washington’s successful efforts to persuade its two key East Asian allies to set aside their mutual enmity in order to counter China’s growing military influence and the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. Although South Korea insists that its commitment to the alliance with Washington remains intact, its decision to quit GSOMIA showed how easily such efforts by the United States can be trumped by recurring historical disputes between South Korea and Japan. Simmering tensions between the two neighbors exploded after South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled late last year that Japanese companies should pay reparations to South Koreans for forced labor during the colonial era. Japan insists that all wartime claims were settled when it and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1965. Japan later imposed a series of restrictions on security-related products exported to South Korea. In August, South Korea retaliated by announcing an end to GSOMIA. Although Mr. Moon and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan met briefly in Bangkok last week, their governments have yet to narrow their differences. During his trip to Seoul, Mr. Esper also discussed how to bring North Korea back to denuclearization talks and mounting friction between South Korea and the United States over how to share the cost of keeping 28,500 American troops in South Korea. The issue of cost has become particularly contentious under President Trump, who has insisted that South Korea and other allies shoulder the expense of maintaining American bases on their soil. In February, South Korea agreed to contribute about 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, this year, an 8.2 percent increase from last year. Washington is now demanding that South Korea contribute as much as $4.7 billion next year, according to South Korean news media and lawmakers. On Friday, Mr. Esper would not name an exact figure but said South Korea is a “wealthy country” that “could and should” pay more. Mr. Jeong said the United States and South Korean negotiators were trying to work out a “fair and reasonable” deal. Mr. Trump has often questioned the cost of stationing American troops abroad. The two allies are also still working to bring North Korea back to the table to discuss abandoning its nuclear weapons and missiles programs.  On Thursday, a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator called a proposal from Washington to resume denuclearization talks next month “a trick to earn time,” and said North Korea was not interested in negotiating until Washington abandoned its “hostile policy.” On Friday, both Mr. Esper and Mr. Jeong indicated that the allies were open to changing their plans for a joint air force drill to help maintain diplomatic momentum with North Korea. But they stopped short of canceling the drill. “We always have to remain flexible in terms of how we support our diplomats to ensure that we do not close any doors that may allow forward progress on the diplomatic front,” Mr. Esper said.']",Defense Secretary Mark Esper had urged Seoul to reconsider abandoning a military intelligence-sharing deal with Tokyo. 
Putin and Zelensky to Meet for First Time Over Ukraine Conflict,2019-11-15,By Anton Troianovski,"[""MOSCOW — The presidents of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Paris next month for long-anticipated talks that could change the contours of the five-year-old conflict in eastern Ukraine whose repercussions have spread worldwide.  The talks, scheduled for Dec. 9, will be the first between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the comedian who won the presidency in April on a pledge to end the fighting with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.  At the meeting, officials say, the leaders will aim to make progress in carrying out the terms of a peace deal that was reached four years ago in Minsk, Belarus, but has yet to be implemented. The accord aimed to restore Kiev’s control over separatist-held territory in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky has conducted troop withdrawals, coordinated with the separatists, at several points along the front lines to build momentum for the talks, even as the Kremlin has seemed to vacillate over whether Mr. Putin was prepared to engage. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, began with Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014, after pro-European protests in Kiev toppled Ukraine’s Russia-friendly president. Since then, Ukraine has become the biggest flash point in the broader conflict between Moscow and the West, triggering European and American sanctions against Russia and rippling into the impeachment hearings playing out in Washington. Mr. Zelensky will face pressure on multiple fronts as he goes into the talks. His domestic critics claim he is prepared to sell out Ukrainian interests to make peace with Mr. Putin, who has fomented the separatist conflict. At the same time, Mr. Zelensky’s negotiating position is hobbled by the impeachment spectacle, with has exposed new uncertainties about America’s longstanding support for Ukraine. At least nine key American officials who had a hand in Ukraine policy have either resigned or become distanced from the Trump administration since last spring. Western officials have played down expectations for the Paris meeting, noting that Kiev and Moscow are hemmed in by domestic politics. Still, since it appeared uncertain recently that Mr. Putin was even prepared to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, the scheduling of talks has, in itself, seemed to augur some incremental progress. The two leaders will be joined by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. In a statement, Mr. Macron's office cited “major progress since the summer in negotiations for a settlement.” Summit meetings between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany took place five times under Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, but the last one was in 2016.  The talks will seek to produce “a kind of road map — how to implement everything written in the text of the Minsk agreement,” Bohdan Yaremenko, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Ukrainian Parliament and a Zelensky ally, said in an interview last week.  The Minsk agreement, hammered out over 16 hours of talks in February 2015, included promises that a special legal status would be granted to Ukraine’s eastern regions and that local elections would be held. The provisions have remained unimplemented because they proved to be deeply contentious on both sides.

"In Strike That Killed 5 Children, Israel Said It Took Out Gaza Militant. Now It Isn’t Sure.",2019-11-15,By Iyad Abuheweila and David M. Halbfinger,"['DEIR El-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Ismail al-Swarka was shaken from slumber after midnight on Thursday by what sounded like four missile blasts. Then he heard his neighbors screaming. What he found outside was horrifying: Eight of his relatives, including five children, had been killed in an airstrike, with several more badly wounded. As the sky brightened into morning, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman posted on Twitter the photo of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander it said had been killed in the strike, which occurred just hours before a cease-fire ended two intense days of fighting between Israel and the militant group. But Islamic Jihad says the man in the photo was actually a different commander from Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip, who is still alive — and that the victims of the attack in Deir El-Balah, near the center of the coastal enclave, were all civilians.  On Friday, Israel’s military backtracked on its earlier claim and said it had begun an investigation into the harm to civilians in the Gaza strike. Gaza health officials said 16 civilians were among the 34 Palestinians killed in the two-day round of combat, which began when Israel assassinated an Islamic Jihad commander early Tuesday, and escalated as the militant group responded with hundreds of rockets aimed at cities and towns across southern and central Israel. There were no Israeli fatalities. Israel’s military asserted that it was conducting its strikes with precision, and it seemed that way at first: The leader targeted on Tuesday, Baha Abu al-Ata, was killed when a missile hit his third-floor bedroom. His wife was also killed, but their children, in another room, survived. Israel also pointed repeatedly to airstrikes that it said had killed militants in the act of firing or preparing to fire rockets but had kept collateral damage to a minimum. But the military says civilian casualties are unavoidable in Gaza’s teeming neighborhoods, where militants often fire rockets from residential areas. Israel accuses militants of using civilians, including their own relatives, as human shields against retaliatory strikes. The eight al-Swarka family members killed appear to have accounted for half the civilian death toll in one devastating strike. The Israeli military continued to insist on Friday that it had struck “an Islamic Jihad military infrastructure” in the Deir el-Balah attack. “According to the information available” at the time, it said in a statement, “no civilians were expected to be harmed as a result.” Initial information, the military said, “showed that an Islamic Jihad operative was killed in the strike,” apparently the commander of a rocket unit, which it said explained the Twitter post by its Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee. But doubts about that information have prompted an investigation into the victim’s “identity, as well as the harm caused to civilians by the strike,” the military said. Since Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, Israel has fought three wars and dozens of skirmishes against Islamic militant groups. While the wars have inflicted heavy damage on Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group, hundreds of civilians have also died in Israeli airstrikes. The high civilian death toll has drawn heavy international criticism, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague has opened a preliminary investigation into Israel’s battlefield tactics. Israel has rejected the criticism, saying it takes numerous precautions to prevent unnecessary civilian casualties. It says its targets are based on sophisticated intelligence and cleared by legal advisers and other experts, and that it often warns inhabitants to evacuate before their homes are struck.  Palestinian militants also have been denounced for firing rockets at Israeli civilian areas. On Friday afternoon, it was hard to see the remains of any structure, let alone infrastructure, at the site of the Thursday airstrike. All that was left of the al-Swarka family’s two homes, which had been about 50 yards apart, were shards of two tin shacks strewn across giant craters in the sand. Neighbors told The Associated Press that an Islamic Jihad commander had lived in one of the destroyed homes, but that he wasn’t home at the time of the airstrike. But Ismail al-Swarka, the brother of one of those killed, gave a different account. One of the destroyed homes, he said, belonged to Rasmi Abu Malhous, who sometimes used the surname al-Swarka, the name of their populous Bedouin tribe. He received a police officer’s salary from the Palestinian Authority, though like many others on the payroll of the authority, idled years ago in Gaza for political reasons, he did not actually put on a uniform and go to work. One of Mr. Abu Malhous’s two wives, Mariam, was killed, Ismail said; the other, Wissam, survived. Three of his children were killed. In the other home lived Mohammad and Yousra al-Swarka, Ismail’s sister. Mohammad works for Palestinian Islamic Jihad but in a civilian capacity, the group said, mediating disputes between families and performing other social functions.  “Why are the children killed if the Israeli army has a problem with someone?” asked Dawood Shihab, an Islamic Jihad spokesman.  Yousra was killed in the blast, her brother said, along with two of the family’s six children.  Ismail al-Swarka said the Israelis gave no warning before firing on his relatives’ homes. After he rushed outside after the airstrike, he said he was disoriented by what he found. “It was unrecognizable,” he said. “I didn’t know what to do.” He found one nephew’s body at the edge of a crater. Then a neighbor stumbled across an adult’s body. “It was my sister,” he said. “I helped dig her body out of the sand.” Mohammad al-Swarka remained in critical condition on Friday at a local hospital.  Ismail al-Swarka said his brother-in-law was also a goatherd and owned some chickens and a donkey cart. The smaller animals were blown to bits. The donkey was injured but survived. Iyad Abuheweila reported from Deir el-Balah and David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem. ']",The Israeli military said it has begun an investigation into who was actually killed in an airstrike that Palestinians said caused the deaths of eight civilians.
"In Struggle Over Parthenon Marbles, Greece Gets Unexpected Ally: Xi Jinping",2019-11-13,By Iliana Magra,"['For almost two centuries, Greece and Britain have tussled over who should possess the Parthenon Marbles, the crowning prize of timeless beauty and ancient civilization taken from Athens and now displayed at the British Museum in London. But Greece had an unexpected ally put its finger on the scale on Tuesday, when President Xi Jinping of China expressed support for the return of the works during his first state visit to the country.  Mr. Xi’s support is just one measure of the growing affinity between the countries, underscored by a two-day visit during which their leaders signed 16 new agreements, and China committed millions more in investments in Greece. On his second day in Athens, Mr. Xi was given a tour of the Acropolis Museum in Athens by President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who asked for the Chinese leader’s “support in this struggle for the Parthenon sculptures to return here where they belong.” “I not only agree with you,’’ Mr. Xi replied in comments broadcast on Greek national television. “Not only will you have our support, but we thank you because we, too, have a lot of our sculptures abroad and we try as much we can, as soon as we can for these things to return to their homeland.”  The sculptures are also known as the Elgin Marbles, after the 19th-century British lord who brought the collection to Britain. China has its own longstanding grievances with cultural relics and artworks that were lost when colonial powers dominated China, and Mr. Xi has described himself as a proud defender of his country’s heritage, often referring to its 5,000 years of civilization. With nationalism on the rise at home, China has stepped up calls in recent years to repatriate its ancient artifacts, even sending teams of researchers to overseas museums to catalog the more than one million Chinese antiquities it estimates are on display abroad.  Over the years, China has successfully wielded its growing economic might to recover a number of artifacts said to have been looted from the Old Summer Palace. Notably, several bronze animal heads are now back in the country after being bought or recovered from their foreign owners by the state-owned China Poly Group Corporation. On Wednesday, China’s National Cultural Heritage Administration announced that another bronze animal head had been recovered and would be displayed alongside the other repatriated relics in an exhibition at the National Museum of China. For many Chinese, such artifacts are reminders of what the Chinese Communist Party still calls the country’s “century of humiliation” at the hands of Western powers.  These similarities in their history provided a unifying narrative for Chinese and Greek leaders during Mr. Xi’s visit.  In welcoming Mr. Xi, Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis said that the Greek and Chinese people are “carriers of great ancient civilizations that sealed the course of humanity.”  Mr. Xi, in an article in the Greek newspaper Kathimerini preceding his visit, wrote: “Confucius and Socrates are two masks that cover the same face: the brightest face of human logic,” borrowing a line from the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis. But it is the two countries’ economic ties that have brought them closer in recent years, and Mr. Xi’s visit made clear that Chinese investment was there for the long term.  In 2016, COSCO, the Chinese state-owned shipping group, bought more than half of Piraeus, Greece’s biggest port, turning it into the busiest port in the Mediterranean, according to the port.  On Tuesday Mr. Xi, Mr. Mitsotakis, and the chairman of COSCO and the Piraeus Port Authority oversaw a deal between the port authority and the European Investment Bank, which agreed on a 20-year, 140-million-euro loan for Piraeus’s expansion and upgrade. Greece’s new center-right government under Mr. Mitsotakis welcomed the Chinese investment as well as China’s huge export market for its agricultural goods, according to experts.  China, in return, experts say, is keen to deepen its influence in NATO and the European Union, of which Greece is part. “Greece is the one country in ‘old Europe’ that is most open to Chinese investments,” Steve Tsang, the director of the School of Oriental African Studies China Institute, said in an email on Wednesday. “In a world that is becoming more uncomfortable with Xi’s policy in asserting China, Greece seems like a reassuring, welcoming place for Xi to visit and show his domestic audience how much he is loved by a European country with the oldest civilization,” he said.  The Parthenon Marbles include an 80-meter frieze depicting the Great Panathenaia, the ancient Greek feast in honor of the goddess Athena, the muscled body of an ancient Greek river god lounging in midair and voluptuous female figures.  They were obtained by the British Museum after the British Parliament bought them in 1816 from Lord Elgin, who was a British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire when Greece was still a part of it.  Greece argues that Lord Elgin stole the marbles, making the sale illegitimate, and that the artifacts should be returned to their place of origin. Mr. Xi’s support for the repatriation did not make for one of the official agreements between the two countries. But Mr. Mitsotakis has made the return of the works one of his administration’s priorities, and raised the issue in his opening remarks to the Chinese president during their official dinner on Monday. Mark Stephens, a British lawyer who has been advocating for the repatriation of the marbles, called Mr. Xi’s support an “enormous boon.” “You have a major power weigh in,” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.  “It was a very low cost gesture of good will to Greece,” Thanos Dokos, Greece’s alternate national security adviser, said in an email on Wednesday.  For many Greeks, the fact that the Parthenon Marbles remain at the British Museum is a travesty, said Tatiana Flessas, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics.  “It is a real cause célèbre,” she said by phone on Wednesday, as both sides want “actual ownership” of the marbles.  Neither seems ready to budge.  “The museum’s collections represent the whole world,’’ said Hannah Boulton, a spokeswoman for the British Museum, in a statement on Wednesday. ‘‘It is a unique resource to explore the richness, diversity and complexity of all human history.”  “The Parthenon Sculptures are a vital element in this interconnected world collection,” she said, adding that the museum had “lent objects to various museums, including the Acropolis Museum.” The Parthenon Sculptures in the British Museum are available for free to six million visitors a year, she added.  Christopher Buckley and Amy Qin contributed reporting from Beijing. ']",China pledged big investments in Greece and signed 16 agreements. But it turns out that the repatriation of artifacts is also drawing the nations closer.
Dueling Camps Vie for Control of Venezuela’s Embassy in Brazil,2019-11-13,By Letícia Casado and Ernesto Londoño,"['BRASÍLIA — Venezuela’s embassy in Brazil’s capital became the scene of a tense and at times violent standoff on Wednesday that lasted more than 12-hours and began when a group of Venezuelans seeking the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro tried to gain control of the diplomatic compound.  Representatives of Juan Guaidó, a Venezuelan politician who seeks to depose Mr. Maduro and proclaimed himself the rightful leader of Venezuela in January, entered the diplomatic compound saying they were doing so at the invitation of some of the diplomats assigned there by the Maduro government. Around 5 p.m. Mr. Guaidó’s supporters left the embassy, according to local press reports in Brasília. The confrontation lasted more than 12 hours, and led to screaming and shoving matches at the gate that drew a large police presence. It played out as Brazil was hosting the Chinese, Indian, Russian and South African leaders for a summit of an alliance known as BRICS. The head of the mission,  denounced the entry of Mr. Guaidó’s supporters as an invasion and a breach of diplomatic norms.  Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry condemned the attempted takeover of the embassy in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. It called for the “immediate expulsion” of those who had sought to take control of the compound and denounced the “passive” response by the Brazil police. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon that the government was “taking the necessary measures to restore public order and avoid acts of violence.”   The standoff underscored the diplomatic conundrum facing many governments in the region since Mr. Guaidó’s bid to take power.  Brazil was among several countries that promptly recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader, arguing that Mr. Maduro’s autocratic conduct had rendered him an illegitimate leader. Brazil’s government has recognized Mr. Guaidó’s diplomatic envoy to the country, María Teresa Belandria, as Venezuela’s ambassador in Brazil. But it has not expelled diplomats appointed by Mr. Maduro, who have been in control of the diplomatic facility. This has created an awkward and legally dubious situation for countries like Brazil, which in practice have retained diplomatic relations with two camps that are battling for power.  Critics of Mr. Maduro in the region hoped that robust international support for Mr. Guaidó would prompt the armed forces to turn on Mr. Maduro. But the military did not budge, leaving Mr. Maduro in power while many in the international community, including the United States, continue to nominally regard Mr. Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. The Wednesday confrontation began in the early morning. The leader of it, Tomas Silva, a deputy to Ms. Belandria, posted a video on social media saying that diplomatic representatives of Mr. Maduro had welcomed the Guaidó allies and handed over control of the facility, which includes an embassy and an adjacent residence. “We’re thrilled, we’re happy,” Mr. Silva said, standing in front of the embassy emblem. “Dignity has been restored.” Mr. Silva said the Guaidó team’s presence at the embassy should galvanize a protest that opposition leaders have organized for Saturday in Venezuela. But Freddy Meregote, Mr. Maduro’s top diplomat in Brasília, called the takeover “an irresponsible invasion” that had violated diplomatic norms. Brazilian leftist politicians called the attempted takeover of the embassy a serious breach of diplomatic norms. “We can’t accept this,” said Jandira Feghali, an opposition leader in Congress. “It sets a very serious precedent.” Paulo Pimenta, another leftist lawmaker who was inside the facility on Wednesday, said the people who strode into the premises “had no idea what they were doing.” He said the group included “bodybuilders and jujitsu fighters who were hired.” Brazil’s presidency said in a statement that it had not encouraged the takeover of the compound and that it was hoping the standoff could be resolved peacefully. “As usual, there are unscrupulous individuals trying to take advantage of events to generate disorder and instability,” said the statement, in an apparent reference to Brazilian sympathizers of Mr. Maduro. Letícia Casado reported from Brasília and Ernesto Londoño reported from Rio de Janeiro.']","The standoff, which unfolded while Brasília is hosting several heads of state for a summit, underscores the diplomatic conundrum created by competing claims to Venezuela’s presidency."
‘We’re Just So Angry’: Australians Protest Police Killing of Aboriginal Teenager,2019-11-14,By Isabella Kwai and Sasha Gattermayr,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Thousands of Australians have taken to the streets this week to protest the police killing of an Aboriginal teenager in a remote community, a case that has added fuel to long-simmering anger over the government’s behavior toward the country’s Indigenous people.  On Wednesday, the police officer who fatally shot the 19-year-old man, Kumanjayi Walker, in the central Australian town of Yuendumu was charged with murder. But questions have continued to swirl about what happened when officers were alone with Mr. Walker, as well as how he and his family were treated in the hours that followed. Mr. Walker did not receive medical care after he was shot on Saturday, because staff had evacuated the clinic in Yuendumu earlier in the day over safety concerns. That left any medical emergencies to be handled by another clinic nearly 40 miles away. And after Mr. Walker died, family members who waited outside a police station were not informed about his death until 10 hours later.  “I just cry every day and night,” Napurrurla, Mr. Walker’s grandmother, said in a phone interview from Alice Springs, where most of the community had gathered on Thursday for a march. “We’re just so angry.” The protests in recent days, in both remote areas and major cities, have reflected the fury and grief among Indigenous people who say they are sick of police brutality. People in Yuendumu painted red handprints on the police station and held an Indigenous smoking ceremony. They later traveled hours away to Alice Springs to demand transparency from the police. And in major cities across Australia on Wednesday, hundreds of other protesters gathered, some holding signs carrying messages like “Black Lives Matter.” More than 400 Indigenous people have died while in custody since 1991, the year that a royal commission made 339 recommendations to reduce such deaths. While inquiries have uncovered medical malpractice, no police officer has ever been prosecuted for murder. In 2007, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after the death of a man on Palm Island, off the country’s northeastern coast, led to months of riots. “People have always been very frightened about being in the cells,” said Yasmine Musharbash, a senior lecturer in anthropology at the Australian National University who has been living in Yuendumu. “Now you have mothers telling children to stay the hell away from police. It means that any one of them can shoot you.”  On the day he died, Mr. Walker, a member of the Warlpiri Indigenous group, was in Yuendumu for his grandfather’s funeral, his family and community elders said.  Northern Territory police officials initially said that Mr. Walker had lunged with a weapon at a police officer and that two shots had been fired in an ensuing struggle.  But on Thursday, after the officer, Zachary Rolfe, 28, had been charged with one count of murder and then granted bail, police officials said that an investigation would be opened into the episode. They asked the community to “trust the process.” “Our sincere condolences go to the deceased man’s family, the Yuendumu and wider Warlpiri community,” said Michael White, the acting deputy police commissioner in the Northern Territory.  Mr. Rolfe will plead not guilty and will “vigorously contest the charge,” Paul McCue, the president of the Northern Territory Police Association, said in a statement.

"Girl, 5, Is 6th Child Killed by Stray Bullet in Rio de Janeiro This Year",2019-11-13,By Ernesto Londoño and Lis Moriconi,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — A 5-year-old girl who died Wednesday morning in Rio de Janeiro was the sixth child in the city slain this year after being struck by a stray bullet. Ketellen Umbelino de Oliveira Gomes was walking to school with her mother on Tuesday when she was shot in the leg in the Realengo district of western Rio de Janeiro, according to police officials and witnesses. Investigators believe she was caught in the crossfire of one of the gun battles waged routinely in the city by drug trafficking gangs vying for control of neighborhoods. As her mother rushed her to a nearby clinic, Ketellen reportedly tried to comfort her. “Even as she lay on the floor, she said: ‘Mom, don’t cry, don’t, Mom,’” a relative, Daise da Costa, told reporters. The killing comes as police in Rio de Janeiro have intensified operations against drug gangs in the city, a crackdown that has left hundreds of people dead and scrambled turf wars among heavily armed gangs. Since the beginning of the year, at least 21 children have been struck by stray bullets in Rio de Janeiro, according to Fogo Cruzado, or Crossfire, an organization that monitors violence in the city. Eleven of them were hit during police operations. Ketellen is the youngest of the six fatal victims. The other five children killed this year ranged in age from 8 to 12. Rio de Janeiro’s governor, Wilson Witzel, said he asked the police to carry out a “rigorous investigation of this crime and the others.” Mr. Witzel, a former federal judge who has presidential aspirations and an acrimonious relationship with President Jair Bolsonaro, blamed the federal government for the bloodshed. “Impeding the entry of drugs and weapons to the country is the responsibility of the federal government,” he said in a statement on Twitter. “The failure to combat, at the federal level, the trafficking of drugs and weapons, ends up fueling this insane war playing out in the states.” Investigators believe the target of the shooting was another minor, Davi Gabriel Martins do Nascimento, 17, who was standing nearby. He was also fatally shot. Witnesses told police that two men walked out of a car around noon on Tuesday, took aim at the teenager and opened fire. Ketellen underwent surgery overnight. She died Wednesday after losing too much blood.  Her father, Augusto de Oliveira, an unemployed painter, told reporters on Wednesday that the family was devastated. “The feeling we’re left with is to go grab the jerk that did this and do the same thing to him,” he told reporters. “My daughter was only 5-years-old.”']","Police operations targeting drug gangs have put children in the crossfire in the Brazilian city, where at least 21 minors have been struck by stray bullets in 2019."
"Pushed From Hungary, University Created by Soros Shifts to Vienna",2019-11-15,By Benjamin Novak,"['VIENNA — Forced out of Hungary, Central European University marked its relocation to Vienna on Friday with a bittersweet ceremony that amounted to a victory for Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, in his campaign against liberal values. Founded and endowed after the fall of the Iron Curtain by George Soros, the billionaire financier and philanthropist, the university promoted democracy and liberal thought in a region where they had been suppressed for a century under fascism and communism. But it ran afoul of Mr. Orban’s increasingly authoritarian and nativist government, which has turned Mr. Soros — a Jew who was born and raised in Hungary, but has lived most of his life in the West — into a kind of all-purpose boogeyman. Mr. Soros announced on Friday that his Open Society Foundations had committed 750 million euros, about $825 million, to an effort by Central European University and Bard College in New York to build a global network for colleges and universities to work together and support each other. Mr. Orban has changed Hungary’s laws and political environment in ways that have silenced independent voices by making it steadily harder for the university and other civil society institutions to operate. More than seven decades after its founder decided to leave Hungary, the university was forced to do the same. Central European University will maintain a presence in Budapest “out of a sense of moral obligation,” because of the support it has received there, Mr. Soros said in an interview on Friday as it formally inaugurated its new Austrian home. The move will be a gradual one, starting with a small number of programs but with most programs scheduled to be based in Vienna by autumn 2020. Mr. Soros has for decades poured money into Eastern Europe, supporting civil society organizations, sponsoring research and promoting the transition to open, pluralist democracy. But that project has run headlong into the growing power of autocratic and nationalist right-wing movements across Europe, particularly in Hungary.  “Under Viktor Orban’s autocratic rule, no independent institutions are tolerated,” said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of international affairs and sociology at Princeton. “So it was only a matter of time before Orban’s attention turned to C.E.U.”  In 1989, Mr. Soros funded a scholarship for Viktor Orban, then a rabble-rousing young liberal from provincial Hungary, and in 1993, the fledgling university he founded put down roots in Budapest. The university says it takes pride in attracting émigré Hungarian scholars back to their native land to teach and research. It has almost 17,000 alumni, faculty from more than 40 countries and students from more than 100. The university estimates that it contributed almost €24 million annually to the Hungarian economy, a benefit that will now go to Austria. Mr. Orban served as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, but had moved far to the right after his party, Fidesz, returned to power in 2010. He has said he is on a mission to build an “illiberal democracy,” and similar shifts have occurred to varying degrees in several eastern European countries. Mr. Orban has sharply curtailed the independence of the courts and Hungary’s prosecution service. Nearly all of the Hungarian media is now under the control of allies beholden to him. His government has rewritten election laws to favor Fidesz, and opposition parties are routinely under pressure from state authorities. As Mr. Orban has cemented control over Hungary, his government has stepped up attacks against critics. It has demonized immigrants, curbed academic freedom and assailed international structures like the European Union as threats to Hungarian sovereignty. The United States ambassador to Hungary, David B. Cornstein, has said that Central European University’s clashes with the state boil down to a personal conflict between Mr. Orban and Mr. Soros. Mr. Soros rejected that description vehemently, adding, “Orban would love to make it a personal issue between us.” The Hungarian leader is not ideological, he said in the interview, arguing that Mr. Orban uses nationalism as a tool to hold power and cover for systemic corruption.  “He’s an ambitious man and in the course of gaining power he developed a system of enriching himself and his assistants,” he said. Mr. Soros has for years been the target of sweeping state-funded propaganda campaigns that tap into anti-Semitic tropes reminiscent of the interwar period. The Hungarian government has blanketed the country in ads featuring a black-and-white photo of Mr. Soros, with text reading, “Let’s not allow Soros to have the last laugh.” In 2016, Mr. Orban said: “The next year will be about squeezing out Soros and the powers that he symbolizes.” The government enacted legislation that targeted civil society groups that receive foreign funding — many of them beneficiaries of Open Society Foundations, which was forced to stop operating in Hungary — and made Central European University’s future in the country uncertain. Changes in law created an assortment of new requirements for foreign universities operating in Hungary, and specifically took issue with United States degrees issued by Central European University, which is incorporated and accredited in the United States. The university’s efforts to come into compliance with the law were in vain, despite bipartisan backing in Congress and statements of support from the State Department. An agreement between Mr. Orban’s government and the State of New York, which might have allowed the university to remain in Budapest, was never signed by the government. Last December, the university announced it had to leave, and would move its headquarters and the bulk of its operations to Vienna. Even so, Mr. Soros, who reminisced about his father teaching him to ski in the hills of Budapest, said, “I have always had a special spot for my native Hungary.”']","Central European University and its founder, George Soros, have been favorite targets of Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orban, as he stifles dissenting voices.

Pneumonic Plague Is Diagnosed in China,2019-11-13,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['BEIJING — Two people in China were diagnosed with plague, setting off a panic on Tuesday about the potential spread of the highly infectious and fatal disease and prompting China’s government to warn citizens to take precautions to protect themselves. Beijing officials said the two infected people came from Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated region of northern China. They sought treatment on Tuesday in a hospital in Beijing’s Chaoyang District, where they were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, according to the government office of the district. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on Weibo, the microblogging site, that there was no need for Beijing residents to panic and that the risks of further transmission are “extremely low.” The authorities quickly isolated the patients, conducted epidemiological investigations on the people who could have been exposed and disinfected all the relevant sites, the CDC said. They have also strengthened monitoring of patients with fever, it added. Pneumonic plague is one of three types of infectious disease known as plague caused by the same bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Patients diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which causes high fevers and shortness of breath, sometimes first contract the closely related and more well-known disease, bubonic plague.  Fears are mounting in China over a possible outbreak of the disease, once known as the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in medieval Europe, and spread through Asia and Africa.   Last month, the authorities in China said they would strengthen quarantine measures to prevent plague from entering the country after Madagascar was struck by a fast-spreading outbreak of the disease. It is unclear when the cases were first detected in China but residents are asking why the authorities took so long to diagnose and disclose the problem.  Li Jifeng, a doctor at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital where the two people sought treatment, wrote on WeChat, a social media platform, that the patients sought treatment on Nov. 3. That post, which has since been deleted, was published by CN-Healthcare, a website that covers health care news in China. Dr. Li could not be reached for comment and Beijing Chaoyang Hospital declined to comment.  Dr. Li wrote that the patient she saw was a middle-aged man, who had a fever and complained of breathing difficulties for 10 days. He sought treatment at a hospital in Inner Mongolia but his condition did not improve. His wife also developed a fever and respiratory problems.  “After so many years of specialist training, I’m familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of most respiratory diseases,” wrote Dr. Li. “But this time, I looked and looked at it. I couldn’t guess what pathogen caused this pneumonia. I only knew it was rare.” On why the authorities took so long to make the announcement, Dr. Li wrote that signs of any infectious disease need to be repeatedly verified and investigated, and such announcements cannot be “transmitted casually.” The police quarantined the emergency room in the Chaoyang Hospital on Monday night, the news outlet Caixin reported, citing residents.  On Tuesday, Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to “block and control” online discussion related to news about the plague, according to a directive seen by The New York Times.  Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time. “The plague is not the most terrifying part,” one user wrote on Weibo. “What’s even scarier is the information not being made public.”  If left untreated, pneumonic plague is always fatal, according to the World Health Organization. But recovery rates are high if detected and treated with antibiotics, within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, the agency said.  Another user on Weibo called on the government to disclose how the patients arrived in Beijing from Inner Mongolia. If the patients traveled on their own using public transportation they could have spread the disease to many people.  “How many people have they encountered potentially?” the user wrote. “Only 2 kilometers away from Chaoyang Hospital. I’m shaking and trembling.” According to China’s health commission, six people have died in the country from the plague since 2014. The most recent case was recorded earlier this year. Officials have warned people to avoid traveling to infected areas and contact with rodents.  Elsie Chen and Zoe Mou contributed research.

‘Your Face Is Burning.’ How It Feels to Photograph Australia’s Fires,2019-11-15,By Isabella Kwai,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Isabella Kwai, a reporter with the Australia bureau. Australia is burning, and the worst is yet to come. Bushfires raged through the east coast last weekend, setting the tone for the week as schools closed and those living in danger zones prepared to evacuate on an especially hot, windy Tuesday. Since then, at least four people have died and dozens of homes have been destroyed as firefighters have battled more than 80 fires. But the country has been burning for a while, experts say.  Fire seasons, once limited largely to the summer months, are stretching longer and the land is growing drier, providing plenty of fuel. While the country’s political leaders trade insults over climate change, experts say that without more resources and interventions, living in bushland will come at a cost.  When Matthew Abbott, a photographer who regularly contributes to The New York Times,  heard about the fires, he jumped in the car.  On Tuesday, he headed for Taree, a town in northern New South Wales hit by the worst of the fires. I asked him about his experience documenting the battle that firefighters have waged in the area.  Here is his account: I was in town waiting to hear any news from the NSW Rural Fire Service. The town was already covered in smoke. Everyone was anxious, talking about the catastrophic conditions.  In the morning it was the calm before the storm. It wasn’t until about midday that fires started to escalate. We headed to Hillville, which is about 50 kilometers out of town. Photographing fires is a very difficult thing because you’ve got no idea. Fires can start and can go out of control in a matter of minutes. You see flashing lights whizzing past and helicopters swarming above. You follow them and try to document the process. You have to conserve your energy. You’d approach a fire and be careful not to run too much and just be there and absolutely back away because your face is burning. Your camera is scorching hot, it’s almost melting. I was trying to cover my ears and elbows as I was photographing, it was just so hot.  In the beginning of the day, the fire was always around us, moving in different directions in valleys. At the end of the night a southerly change came. We knew where it was coming from and we could see it racing toward us. It was a very powerful thing to see. It’s a different kind of fear from what I’ve experienced before because it’s so far out of my control. It’s quite chaotic. I kept thinking, “I can’t lose my car keys. If I lose my car keys, I can’t get out of here.”  Sometimes I left the car running because I was paranoid it wouldn’t start. Without the car you’d be in trouble. Things can happen very quickly and you have to get out of there.  I was traveling with a couple of other photographers as well. One of the big killers in fires is just exhaustion, which leads to heart attacks. People think that you get burned alive or you die from smoke inhalation, but the big killer is exhaustion. To be so close to the inferno is an intense experience. You don’t realize it, but your heart rate is up and you’re not doing anything — you’re just there. In Australia you’re always in a remote area and there’s just not that many people around. In many cases, we’re down a dirt road with a fire out of control and no one knows we’re there. We’re wearing the full protective clothing so we’ve got boots — my boots have melted. We’ve got fire clothes, fire retardant stuff. That really protects you from the heat, but your face is exposed. I had a mask on. I had sunglasses and heaps of water as well. When I came back in, I’d splash myself with water and try to keep as hydrated as possible and also as calm as possible. It’s good that they were prepared, but people were terrified and they take fire very seriously. It really scared people. Going into the Woolworth’s in Taree, there was no water left. It was eerie because the whole shopping center there was just full of smoke. But most people you meet, fighting fires on their property, they’re pretty receptive and understand the media are there to show what’s going on.  People had their hoses on, sprinklers on all day. You had farmers out there with water pumps on the back of their quad bikes. Often it’s just one little spot fire that can be enough to cause havoc. You can do a lot really fighting by yourself. Many people were putting themselves in harm’s way by staying behind and fighting these fires. We also saw a lot of properties vacant.  Everyone’s saying this is just the beginning. This year is going to be massive. All it takes is a little bit of wind and a bit of fire. Did you have to evacuate or prepare for the bushfires this week? We want to hear your story.

His 22-Pound Cat Was Too Fat to Fly. So He Called In an Understudy.,2019-11-13,By Anna Schaverien,"['A man who tricked his way into getting his overweight cat into the passenger cabin of a plane has been penalized by a Russian airline. Aeroflot stripped the passenger, Mikhail Galin, of his air miles and removed him from their frequent-flier program after he bragged on social media about sneaking his hefty pet onboard by switching him for a lighter cat during check-in. When airline employees told Mr. Galin that his 22-pound cat, Viktor, was simply too heavy to fly in the passenger cabin on a flight to Vladivostok, in eastern Russia, he devised a plan to ensure his kitty did not wind up in the cargo hold. Mr. Galin said in a post on Facebook that he delayed his flight  and used air miles to secure a business class seat for himself and Viktor. After asking friends for help, he then sourced a 15-pound feline called Fibi, describing her as an “understudy cat.” When he presented the slimmer pet at check-in, she came under the airline’s limit of eight kilograms, or about 17 pounds, for animals flying in the passenger cabin. Mr. Galin and Fibi were approved for takeoff.  But unknown to Aeroflot and its staff, Mr. Galin swapped Fibi for his real pet, Viktor, before boarding the plane. Mr. Galin, unable to resist the temptation to capture the moment, took photographs and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.  Viktor, a brown cat with black stripes and long white whiskers, was snapped in a pet carrier in front of a glass of what appears to be sparkling wine. He was also shown being held up to the plane window by Mr. Galin, with Aeroflot’s branding clearly visible on the headrest. Those images eventually played a role in his downfall. The airline told Agence France-Presse that it opened an investigation after Mr. Galin’s post caught their attention, and that it eventually found video surveillance footage of the cat swap at check-in. “Aeroflot has taken the decision to take this passenger out of its frequent flier program,” Aeroflot told the agency. “All of the miles collected during his time in the program will be annulled.” According to news reports, Mr. Galin had nearly 400,000 miles on his account.  Aeroflot did not respond to requests for comment. In a message, Mr. Galin confirmed that his frequent flier account had been blocked, and said he found out about the penalty through news reports. The story of the cat swap became so widespread in Russia that it was even mentioned on Wednesday in a daily call between President Vladimir V. Putin and Russian journalists.  Mr. Putin said that the Kremlin did not comment about cats.  Mr. Galin justified his actions in his social media posts, saying that Viktor had become ill on the first leg of his trip, from Riga, Latvia, to Moscow. Two days later, before the second flight, from Moscow to Vladivostok, a fastidious employee weighed Viktor and declared him too tubby to continue to fly in the cabin. Mr. Galin was then offered the chance to check the cat into the hold. He said he had engineered the swap because he feared Viktor would be traumatized by such an experience and might not survive the eight-hour flight. Last year, a French bulldog named Kokito died after a flight attendant placed the animal in an overhead compartment on a United Airlines flight. The same airline faced questions in 2017 when an apparently healthy giant rabbit died in the cargo hold. Mr. Galin said he had spent the last two years working in Latvia and was flying home to Vladivostok with Viktor. He explained the cat’s unusual size was because of its breed, though he did not specify which one. And added that he had asked the person sitting next to him if they had any allergies. At the end of his post, Mr. Galin rewarded the thousands of people who had followed the story with a throwback snap to when Viktor was a kitten. “A photo of young Viktor,” he wrote. “When his weight still met the requirements of the airline.” Andrew Higgins contributed reporting.']",The airline found out about the trick after the Russian man posted photographs on social media.

Ethnic Rifts in Bolivia Burst Into View With Fall of Evo Morales,2019-11-15,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Clifford Krauss,"['COCHABAMBA, Bolivia — In the days since the ouster of Evo Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, deep ethnic tensions that have long divided the country have erupted, complicating efforts to move Bolivia out of political crisis.  Mr. Morales, a champion of the Indigenous, has now been replaced by an acting president of European descent, and resentments have surfaced. Police officers have ripped the Indigenous insignia off their uniforms. Protesters have burned the Indigenous flag. And the acting president, who posted tweets many consider racist, initially appointed a cabinet without a single Indigenous member. “We feel threatened,” said Juan Acume, a farmer from the Quechua, an Indigenous group, near a protest barricade of earth mounds and tree trunks across Bolivia’s main highway on Wednesday night. “They don’t represent us; they reject us, the Indigenous.” Mr. Morales’s nearly 14  years in power represented a breakthrough for the three-quarters of Bolivians who are either of Indigenous descent or identify as members of Indigenous groups. But he also reinforced his base of support with explicit appeals to racial identity that many Bolivians found threatening and polarizing. Now that Mr. Morales has taken asylum in Mexico, his supporters fear the loss of their hard-won political and economic gains.  Their fears grew when Jeanine Añez Chavez, an opposition senator, swiftly proclaimed herself the country’s interim president on Tuesday, promising to unite the nation and to call new elections in January. But on Wednesday, when she unveiled her caretaker cabinet, not one of the 11 ministers identified as a member of an Indigenous group. After an outcry, she appointed an Indigenous minister of culture as she added more cabinet members.  In previous years, Ms. Añez had published provocative posts on Twitter mocking Indigenous people’s culture, branding their religious rites “satanic” and calling Mr. Morales a “poor Indian.” She has since deleted the tweets, but not before they spread widely on social media. They were supplemented by a cascade of fake racist posts attributed to Ms. Añez and spread by Mr. Morales’s supporters, according to a media monitoring group, the Bolivia Verifies Observatory. At a news conference on Friday, Ms. Añez denounced the fake tweets and said that her enemies were spreading disinformation. But asked if any of the racial tweets attributed to her were real, she did not respond.  “This rhetoric of racism and discrimination,” she said, “is not real, and we reject it.”  In some of the worst violence to convulse Bolivia in recent weeks, police fired tear gas and live rounds on Friday afternoon at Indigenous supporters of Mr. Morales who had attempted to march into Cochabamba, a city about 250 miles east of La Paz. At least five people died in the violence, according to Bolivia’s ombudsman’s office. Tensions between the Indigenous population and Bolivia’s long-ruling elite of European descent date to Spanish colonial times, and have simmered under the surface ever since.  Diego von Vacano, a Bolivian political scientist at Texas A&M University, likened traditional race relations in Bolivia to “the apartheid system in South Africa, with Indigenous people being second class citizens.” He said, “The significance of Evo was he rose up and achieved a lot of positive things for Indigenous people.”  But as Mr. Morales began losing his grip on power over the past three years, Mr. von Vacano added, “he rallied his Indigenous base through the rhetoric of racial distinctions, which has now polarized much of the country.” During Mr. Morales’s time in office, the number of Indigenous representatives in ministries and congress grew, and included women who wear traditional full skirts called polleras, which were once disdained in public spaces.  Mr. Morales also redistributed the country’s natural gas wealth to native communities, and led a renaissance of traditional cuisine, music and dress. He introduced a multicolored flag, called the Whipala, which represents the country’s diverse Indigenous groups, and made it an official flag alongside the country’s traditional Independence-era banner of red, green and yellow. These policies have made him an idol of many in Bolivia’s main Indigenous communities, the Quechua and Aymara, which make up about a third of country’s adult population, according to the latest census.  They also have fueled resentment among many Bolivians of mixed or European descent, as well as the country’s smaller Indigenous groups, who accused Mr. Morales of ethnic favoritism and exploiting racial differences for political gain.  Mr. Morales’s critics say that his government’s fixation with a particular brand of Bolivia’s diverse Indigenous culture — the highland subsistence farming communities — masks the country’s growing cosmopolitanism. The percentage of Bolivians who have identified themselves as members of Indigenous groups fell to 41 percent in the last census, in 2012, from 62 percent a decade earlier.  “Racism exists in Bolivia; it existed before Evo, and it will never disappear,” said Michelle Kieffer, an insurance broker, as she sipped a cappuccino in an upper-middle-class neighborhood of the country’s administrative capital, La Paz.  “While Evo started an important discussion,” she added, “he also manipulated the race issue, and that has caused disunity. And now people of different races look at each other with suspicion.” Bolivia’s political fault lines are complex; race often combines with regional and ideological divisions. There are Indigenous leaders who broke with Mr. Morales over allegations of corruption, and some Bolivians who are not Indigenous supported his Socialist politics. But the racial divide was apparent this past week when comparing the crowds marching for and against Mr. Morales.  These divisions are rocking cities like Cochabamba, a diverse regional capital of about 700,000 in a high Andean valley that is surrounded by the majority-Quechua speaking countryside. It was in Cochabamba where a decision by local police commandos last Friday to join demonstrators protesting Mr. Morales’s contested re-election spurred a nationwide defection of security forces. The mutiny sounded the death knell for Mr. Morales’s embattled government. Pressured by the armed forces, Mr. Morales announced his resignation from his stronghold in the coca farming region of Cochabamba Province on Sunday, and flew into exile the next day. After taking control of Cochabamba city, the rebellious police officers cut off the Whipala insignia from their uniforms and dumped them on the ground, a scene captured on a video shot by a local newspaper. Minutes later, antigovernment protesters grabbed the Whipala standard from Police Headquarters and burned it on the city’s main square. To the rebels, the dual use of national flags was a symbol of disunity promoted by Mr. Morales. “They made us believe that there were two Bolivias, and we always believed that there was one,” said Col. Miguel Mercado, the police commander of the neighboring province of Santa Cruz,  in a television interview. “It has to shelter all of us.” But to many of Bolivia’s Indigenous people, the Whipala desecration was a grave insult that symbolized the end of equal rights they had enjoyed under Mr. Morales. On Thursday, thousands of Cochabamba’s mainly Quechua coca leaf farmers descended on the outskirts of the regional capital waving the country’s two flags to demand Mr. Morales’s return. Heavily armed military and police cordons blocked their entry into the city, a reminder to many coca farmers of the brutal repression they had suffered during Mr. Morales’s pro-American predecessor governments. It was the biggest protest in Bolivia that day, yet not one local journalist was present in a city that boasts several local television channels and newspapers. To the protesters, it was yet another sign of cultural discrimination. The entertainment programs and commercials on Bolivia’s national television are almost exclusively filled with white actors and presenters. “They’ve been giving orders for 500 years, and now they want to take away our 13 years,” said Herlinda Cruz, a coca grower dressed in a pollera and traditional bowler hat. “They will take away my pollera. They will take away my voice,” she added, breaking into tears. The ethnic divide is, in part, religious. Mr. Morales had a tense relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, partly because he had encouraged traditional Aymara ceremonies in the presidential palace, a practice considered pagan in a country where Catholicism was a central part of the conquest of the Indians in the 16th century.  Ms. Añez was sworn in holding an oversized Bible, which she ceremoniously placed in the presidential palace. Although the vast majority of Bolivians consider themselves Christians, Ms. Añez’s conservative Catholicism  signaled to some the return of European domination of Bolivian culture. When Ms. Añez appears in public, an aide frequently stands by her holding a cross.  Mr. Morales has fanned the growing cultural and racial tensions from his Mexican exile. In frequent news conferences and Twitter postings, he has called his opponents “racists and coup-mongers.”  His message was echoed almost verbatim by his supporters at a protest in Cochabamba on Thursday. Many carried homemade weapons and shields to protect themselves against what they expected to be an imminent police attack. At least one person died in clashes between Indigenous protesters and the police in a nearby province the previous day. “They have burned our flag; they have laughed at our culture. This is racism; this is discrimination,” said Alfonso Coque, a coca grower. “We will give our lives for our rights.” Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Cochabamba, and Clifford Krauss from La Paz. Cesar del Castillo contributed reporting from La Paz.']","As the country’s first Indigenous president has tumbled from power, Indigenous Bolivians fear the loss of their hard-won political gains, and say a racial backlash has begun.

Hong Kong Students Ready Bows and Arrows for Battles With Police,2019-11-14,By Mike Ives and Katherine Li,"['HONG KONG — Protesters armed with bows and arrows on Thursday reinforced the siege-like fortifications they had built on Hong Kong university campuses in anticipation of clashes with the police, and a 70-year-old man died after being struck in the head, possibly by a thrown brick. President Xi Jinping also gave his toughest public comments yet about the protests that have roiled Hong Kong since June, saying China supported the police “in sternly enforcing the law.” The protests started over an extradition bill that has since been withdrawn, and have morphed into broader demands for democracy and police accountability. Months of increasingly violent clashes have dramatically changed life in the financial hub, and the locus of tension between protesters and the police has lately moved from the streets to university campuses. Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.  The police kicked off the workday on Thursday by spraying tear gas at an entrance of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Around the same time, the university sent an email to the staff urging them to leave the campus “in view of the escalating danger and a high risk of bodily injury.”  Tensions were also running high at other universities. Several others  — including PolyU, Chinese University, Hong Kong Baptist University and the University of Hong Kong — have canceled on-campus lectures for the remainder of the fall semester. At C.U.H.K., protesters were seen building brick walls around the campus entrances. “All day all night,” read a slogan someone spray-painted on one of the walls, “We are gonna fight.”  Protesters at C.U.H.K. and PolyU have also practiced shooting firebombs out of giant, makeshift slingshots. The police have said they believe C.U.H.K. is being used as a “factory” to make gasoline bombs, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons for use against officers. “The rioters have gone one step closer to terrorism,” John Tse, a top police official, told reporters on Thursday. At the University of Hong Kong, protesters have used bricks and bamboo poles to erect elaborate roadblocks. In a Facebook post on Wednesday night, the university’s president urged members of the campus not to “create any situation which will lead to police entering the campus to search, to investigate or to make arrests.” The university said in a memo to students on Thursday that it was suspending classes on its main campus for the remainder of the fall term “in view of the uncertain and unsafe traffic conditions"" for traveling there.  A 70-year-old man working for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department died on Thursday night at a local hospital from a head injury, the authorities said. The government said that the man was apparently hit on the head during his lunch break Wednesday by “hard objects hurled by masked rioters.”  The police said separately that he appeared to have been attacked with a brick, and was unconscious when he reached the hospital. The authorities did not say whether the man was targeted deliberately or hit by accident. The Hospital Authority said that 64 people received medical treatment related to clashes across Hong Kong on Wednesday. At least one appeared to have been gravely injured, but it was unclear how many of the injuries were specifically linked to violence by protesters or the police. Protests have erupted across Hong Kong this week in part because a policeman on Monday shot a young demonstrator at point-blank range on a street corner. He was in serious condition as of Wednesday. Also on Monday, some hard-core activists set a man on fire after he accused a group of protesters of lacking patriotism for the Chinese motherland. The attack left him in critical condition. Even before Monday’s violence, tensions were running high over the death last week of a student who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. The circumstances leading to his death remain unclear, but many in the protest movement see him as a martyr. Thousands of masked people, many on their lunch breaks from day jobs in office towers, flooded Hong Kong’s Central business district around midday on Thursday, the fourth consecutive day of such protests. The office workers, wearing high heels and tucked-in dress shirts, were expressing solidarity with the front-line activists who have been disrupting mass transit and clashing with the police all week. The workers who took to the streets chanted “Hong Kong people, take revenge” — a slogan that became popular after the death of the student who fell from the parking garage. Some of the workers formed a human chain to help funnel supplies to black-clad activists who were blocking roads with traffic cones and overturned dumpsters. Most of the unrest roiling Hong Kong since June has occurred at night, on weekends or public holidays. The disruptions this week, by contrast, have forced commuters to choose whether to venture outside during the weekday and risk being caught up in clashes and tear gas.  On Thursday morning, there were delays or closures on seven of Hong Kong’s 11 subway lines, although the scale of the disruptions appeared to be smaller than on other days this week.  A section of Tolo Highway, a major thruway in northern Hong Kong that runs past of the Chinese University campus, was blocked by debris that protesters had thrown down from a bridge that carries vehicles as well as pedestrians. (More than a million of the city’s seven million residents live north of the bridge, making it a choke point for anyone traveling south.)  Protesters blocked a key tunnel linking Hong Kong Island with the Kowloon Peninsula with makeshift barricades, a day after throwing gasoline bombs at some of its toll plazas.  The city’s Education Bureau has canceled all classes — kindergarten through secondary school — from Thursday through the weekend. President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that China “staunchly supports the Hong Kong police in sternly enforcing the law,” and that the city’s most urgent task was “to halt the violence and chaos and to restore order.” Mr. Xi’s comments came a few days after he gave public backing to Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, whose reputation has been battered by the protests. The Hong Kong police said on Wednesday that some police officers from the city’s marine unit had been deployed to help evacuate mainland Chinese students who attend C.U.H.K. Supporters of the Hong Kong police and government marched on Thursday through Yuen Long, a district in northern Hong Kong that was the site of a mob attack on antigovernment demonstrators in July.  “It is right to fire!” some of them chanted, referring to recent police shootings.  Keith Bradsher, Ezra Cheung, Tiffany May, Elaine Yu and Edward Wong contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.']","Black-clad activists, mostly students, set up elaborate roadblocks, built brick walls, and practiced shooting firebombs from a giant slingshot."
Inside Hong Kong’s Battle-Ready Campuses,2019-11-15,By Tiffany May and Lam Yik Fei,"['HONG KONG — Across Hong Kong’s university campuses, students and their supporters are bracing for police confrontations in increasingly elaborate ways: constructing Molotov cocktail assembly lines, erecting catapults that use helmets to launch projectiles, and building walls made of brick and mortar or crosshatched bamboo.  As riot police officers bombarded the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday with rapid-fire tear gas and stinging liquid, a secluded haven for learning suddenly looked more like a battlefield. Now, students across the city said, they are being pushed to defend themselves in more radical ways. “They are insulting the institution of universities. This is a holy place for us to learn. It’s not a place for them to ruin,” said Anna Foy, a 23-year-old graduate student. “I used to just Photoshop posters, protesting in air-conditioning. But now I have evolved into someone who goes to the front line.”  After five months of unrest, tensions rose in the past week, first after the death of a student demonstrator who fell from a parking garage, and then after the police shooting of an unarmed protester. Demonstrators have disrupted the city’s transportation system in recent days in an effort to force the government to respond to their demands, including accountability for the police.  As the police crack down, students have found themselves in previously unimaginable situations. “I didn’t think I would be mixing these chemicals with my own hands, but I am here to learn,” said Jacqueline Kwok, a 19-year-old student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, or PolyU, surrounded by plastic funnels, rolled towels and glass bottles. The pungent smell of chemicals filled the air as another protester tested a freshly made gasoline bomb by hurling it into a drained swimming pool, flames licking the blue tiles as the bottle smashed. Other students said they planned to make smoke bombs that would cause less bodily harm, but whose sulfuric odors would also deter police advances. On the edges of campuses, black-clad protesters stalked rooftops and makeshift watchtowers, keeping a wary eye out for undercover officers and potential snitches. Visitors who wanted to pass through had to show either student or press cards at “customs” stands, and present their belongings to be inspected. Protesters scattered nails and bricks stacked like mini Stonehenges, to slow down police vehicles should they try to clear the roads. And small groups roamed with bows and arrows, a few even practicing with flames. Ken Chan, a 17-year-old high school student and archery hobbyist, said: “I know this is really extreme and risky. I would consider shooting arrows as a final resort, if I could protect the people of Polytechnic University and to protect Hong Kongers. This is really extreme.”  University leaders said they were alarmed that violent clashes — and preparations for future ones — had reached campus grounds previously untouched during the months of unrest, and that large numbers of outside protesters were now occupying its buildings and fields.  “Our campus has been turned into a scene of disorder,” PolyU said in a statement, urging students and staff members to stay away and pleading for the outside protesters to leave. Classes were being held online. At the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Friday night, protesters evacuated the campus after a van was set on fire and explosions were heard. John Tse, police chief superintendent, said on Wednesday that the force suspected that C.U.H.K. was being used as a “weapon factory.” He added that the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds against students was justified on those grounds. Fearing a new incursion by the police, many supporters of the protesters, including alumni, flocked to the campuses, leaving bags of food and supplies. “We are very worried about the students, so we wanted to come back and check on them,” said Karen Chan, a 30-year-old social worker and graduate of PolyU. The campus’s cafeteria had the air of a disaster bazaar, with overflowing boxes of bottled water, gas masks, goggles and paper towels, organized by category. In the kitchens, volunteer cooks made simple meals of white rice, canned meat and noodles. “When it was quiet, I started making chicken-egg sandwiches for protesters so that they can eat something yummy, not just ramen, ramen and ramen,” said Ryan Fa, a 17-year-old volunteer medic. Elite universities like C.U.H.K. and the University of Hong Kong have even earned nicknames like Riot U and Revolution University.  Coco Wong, a C.U.H.K. student, said the name Riot U reflected the “wild” nature of her classmates.  “InRiot U, we have people with all sorts of knowledge and ability,” she said. “When our home turf is being invaded, we can only rush to the front and fight back.” ']","Classrooms may be empty, but universities are bustling with preparation for confrontations with the police.

"Iran Abruptly Raises Fuel Prices, and Protests Erupt",2019-11-15,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran abruptly raised gasoline prices as much as 200 percent early Friday and imposed a strict rationing system, and within hours protests erupted across the country with angry crowds calling for the ouster of President Hassan Rouhani. The new energy policy appeared to be the latest attempt by the Islamic Republic to manage an economic crisis worsened by American sanctions that have sharply reduced oil exports.  Mr. Rouhani said at a speech a day earlier that Iran faced a deficit amounting to nearly two-thirds of its annual $45 billion budget. By Friday night, large crowds had gathered in major cities including Shiraz, Mashhad, Ahwaz and Bandar Abbas, as well as in a range of smaller working class towns. In some places the protests turned violent, according to videos posted on social media showing riot police officers spraying tear gas in one confrontation and smashing vehicle windshields in another.  Like their counterparts in Lebanon and Iraq, the protests in Iran on Friday were set off by economic anxiety,  but some quickly assumed an antigovernment tone. Iranians across political factions — both hard-liners and reformists —  expressed fury on social media, saying the price increases would only hurt the people and create more loopholes for financial corruption.   Some said the timing of the policy change was especially ill advised, given the popular unrest that has convulsed Lebanon and Iraq. “We will reclaim our rights but not be oppressed,” chanted hundreds of men and women blocking the road at a sit-in in the southern city of Ahwaz. In Mashhad, a religiously conservative city in the northeast, people turned off their cars to create traffic jams and shouted, “Rouhani, shame on you, let go of the country!” Iran announced the policy in a statement by the heads of its three key branches —  government, parliament and judiciary — to signal unity. Two energy analysts close to the government in Iran said that Mr. Rouhani had opposed the policy because of concern that it could cost his faction major losses in the coming parliamentary elections. One of the analysts said that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, had overruled Mr. Rouhani.  An announcement carried on state-run television described the changes as a way to help fund subsidies for about 60 million Iranians, or around three-quarters of the population. But the timing of the changes, coming without warning, suggests the government was worried there would be a backlash for increasing the price of gasoline in a stressed economy, in which inflation already is running by some estimates at 40 percent. The immediate effect of the change also appeared to be an attempt to prevent motorists from mobbing gasoline stations to fuel up beforehand.  “Clearly, making this decision in the middle of the night, to take effect immediately, right before a weekend, reflected their concerns about the political implications,” said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. While official media said the price increase was unrelated to the budget, it came as the government was scrambling for ways to compensate for a stark decline in revenue from oil exports, which have shrunk because of sanctions the Trump administration imposed after it withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018. “All of these games carry one message: The treasury is empty and the only way they have to fill it is to take from the people’s pockets,” said Maysam Sharifi, an oil and energy trader in Tehran. Iran has long planned to cut energy subsidies as part of an economic reform plan. Mr. Rouhani’s predecessor,  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, also cut subsidies and created a cash handout system to Iranian families instead, but economists said that policy led to inflation and market instability. Some Iranian economists warned that the new energy policy would fail for a number of reasons. The price increases are not significant enough to give the government a big financial boost — estimated at $800 million a year. But for ordinary Iranians, the added expense could breed resentment and lost confidence. “There will be no positive impact in the economy,” said Alireza Salavati a political economist in London. “This policy is poorly planned and terribly executed and will result in more inflation and instability.”  Gasoline has remained a relative bargain in Iran because it is heavily subsidized. The low price also has been partly blamed for undisciplined consumption and has contributed to the country’s urban pollution problem. Under the changes, the price for a liter of gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, or about 13 cents, from 10,000 rials per liter on Thursday, and a monthly ration for each private car was set at 60 liters. Any purchases over that limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter. The change was all the more jarring because Iran is endowed with vast quantities of fossil fuels. The Energy Information Administration of the United States ranks Iran as possessing the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and second largest natural gas reserves. Just last Sunday, President Rouhani bragged that an enormous oil field holding 53 billion barrels of crude had been discovered in southwest Iran, which if confirmed would give the country about 210 billion barrels and make it the No. 3 country in oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia, with 298 billion, and Venezuela, with 303 billion, according to statistics from BP.     ']",The timing of the announcement suggested an urgent scramble to fill a budget gap caused partly by severe American sanctions. Angry protests over the price increases soon followed.
A Ukrainian Billionaire Fought Russia. Now He’s Ready to Embrace It.,2019-11-13,By Anton Troianovski,"['KIEV, Ukraine — In the last five years, more than 13,000 people have died in a de facto war between Ukraine and Russia — a fight, many here say, to shake off the shackles of a colonial master and to move closer to the West. A crucial figure in the effort was a billionaire named Ihor Kolomoisky, who spent millions of dollars to field and equip fighters and helped stop the Russian advance in 2014. But Mr. Kolomoisky, widely seen as Ukraine’s most powerful figure outside government, given his role as the patron of the recently elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, has experienced a remarkable change of heart: It is time, he said, for Ukraine to give up on the West and turn back toward Russia. “They’re stronger anyway. We have to improve our relations,” he said, comparing Russia’s power to that of Ukraine. “People want peace, a good life, they don’t want to be at war. And you” — America — “are forcing us to be at war, and not even giving us the money for it.” His comments appeared to reflect, at least in part, his self-interested frustration that Western diplomats and the International Monetary Fund have been leaning on the president to prevent Mr. Kolomoisky from regaining control of the bank seized from him and a co-owner in 2016 amid allegations of a multibillion-dollar embezzlement. But whatever his motivations, Mr. Kolomoisky’s geopolitical views matter, because analysts and Western diplomats believe he has extensive sway with the administration of Mr. Zelensky, a comedian whose television shows were carried on Mr. Kolomoisky’s channel. While Mr. Zelensky continues to pursue closer ties with the West, he also appears to be prepared to engage with Russia more directly than his predecessor. Mr. Zelensky recently offered to meet with Mr. Putin without Western leaders present, the former president of Kazakhstan said Tuesday. In the impeachment hearings in recent weeks, American officials have described Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence as one of the biggest problems facing Mr. Zelensky’s new administration. The I.M.F. is reportedly holding up financing for Ukraine in part because of concerns that Mr. Zelensky is not doing enough to recover funds that Mr. Kolomoisky is accused of stealing from his Ukrainian bank, Privatbank, which cost the government in Kiev $5.6 billion to bail out in 2016. Mr. Kolomoisky, who denies any wrongdoing and says the government illegally seized his bank, has previously criticized the I.M.F. and what he sees as an excessively assertive Western role in Ukraine, insisting in an emotional interview — as he has in the past — that Mr. Zelensky should be prepared to default on the fund’s loans. But he described the impeachment proceedings now gripping Washington as a last straw, and he spoke in blunt terms about the logic of embracing Russia as a partner. It has become clear that the European Union and NATO will never take in Ukraine, he said, so it would be best to accept reality and not even try. “You all won’t take us” in the alliance, Mr. Kolomoisky said in the interview, in a conference room at his offices in Kiev. “There’s no use in wasting time on empty talk. Whereas Russia would love to bring us into a new Warsaw Pact.” Five years ago, Mr. Kolomoisky, now 56, had a far different perspective. With Ukraine under attack from Russian-backed separatists, the billionaire accepted an offer to become governor of his home Dnipropetrovsk region near the war’s front line. He financed a pro-government militia that held the battle lines before the regular army could deploy enough troops to keep the separatists at bay. As a fixture in Ukraine’s Jewish community, he countered the notion advanced by the Kremlin that the new pro-Western government in Kiev was run by neo-Nazis. In 2017, Mr. Kolomoisky left Ukraine for Switzerland and Israel after the government under then-President Petro O. Poroshenko seized Privatbank and accused him of a large-scale fraud that threatened to destabilize Ukraine’s economy. He returned this past May after the election of Mr. Zelensky, the comedian whose hit sitcom about a good-at-heart teacher turned president of Ukraine appeared on Mr. Kolomoisky’s television channel. Mr. Kolomoisky now insists he still has no love lost for Russia, mentioning the mass famine in the 1930s as one of the tragedies that befell Ukraine because of its association with Moscow. But, he told The Times in a profanity-laced discussion, the West has failed Ukraine, not providing enough money or sufficiently opening its markets. Instead, he said, the United States is simply using Ukraine to try to weaken its geopolitical rival. “War against Russia,” he said, “to the last Ukrainian.” Rebuilding ties with Russia has become necessary for Ukraine’s economic survival, Mr. Kolomoisky argued. He predicted that the trauma of war will pass. “Give it five, 10 years, and the blood will be forgotten,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “I showed in 2014 that I don’t want to be with Russia,” he added. “I’m describing, objectively, what I’m seeing and where things are heading.” He said financing from Russia could replace loans from the I.M.F., which has pushed for anticorruption reforms that annoy Ukraine’s entrenched business interests. “We’ll take $100 billion from the Russians. I think they’d love to give it to us today,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “What’s the fastest way to resolve issues and restore the relationship? Only money.” For Mr. Kolomoisky, the enmity toward the United States is personal. He says he believes he is a target of the F.B.I., which is reported to have started a financial-crimes probe into his activities. Fiona Hill, the former Europe and Russia adviser at the White House, told lawmakers that she was “extremely concerned” by Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence with Mr. Zelensky. George D. Kent, a senior State Department official, said he had told Mr. Zelensky that his willingness to break with Mr. Kolomoisky — “somebody who had such a bad reputation” — would be a litmus test for his independence. And William Taylor, the acting ambassador in Kiev, said he had warned Mr. Zelensky: “He, Mr. Kolomoisky, is increasing his influence in your government, which could cause you to fail.” Mr. Kolomoisky said that if he were Ukraine’s president, he would proceed with the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. Asked if that risked exposing Ukraine to blowback if a Democrat were to win next year’s presidential election, Mr. Kolomoisky responded: “If they get smart with us, we’ll go to Russia.” “Russian tanks will be stationed near Krakow and Warsaw,” he said. “Your NATO will be soiling its pants and buying Pampers.” Mr. Zelensky campaigned on an anticorruption platform, pledging to rid Ukraine of the influence of the business tycoons who seized control of the country’s key assets after the breakup of the Soviet Union. He pledged that Mr. Kolomoisky would have no special sway over his administration. But there are mounting signs that Mr. Kolomoisky’s influence is rising, and the oligarch’s comments about the importance of rebuilding ties with Russia are likely to increase concern among critics of Mr. Zelensky who already believe that the president is prepared to undermine Ukrainian interests in his pursuit of a Kremlin peace deal. Mr. Kolomoisky said he was feverishly working out how to end the war, but he refused to divulge details because the Americans “will mess it up and get in the way.” Mr. Kolomoisky said he remains intent on regaining ownership of Privatbank or being compensated. He said those like Mr. Poroshenko responsible for the bank’s seizure must be punished, “and the death penalty must be brought back for them.” With international investors jittery over Mr. Kolomoisky’s role, Mr. Zelensky has insisted publicly that he will not return the bank to its former owners. “He knows it wasn’t stolen,” Mr. Kolomoisky countered, referring to the money Mr. Kolomoisky and his partner were accused of embezzling from the bank, which both deny. “He’s saying what you all want to hear.” Mr. Kolomoisky rejected the reports about his hidden influence on Mr. Zelensky’s government. But he warned that he was starting to believe that depiction of himself, and that he had the ability to make it come to life. “If I put on glasses and look at myself like the whole rest of the world, I see myself as a monster, as a puppet master, as the master of Zelensky, someone making apocalyptic plans,” Mr. Kolomoisky said. “I can start making this real.”']",
Boris Johnson Was Supposed to Be an Ace Campaigner. So Why Is He Stumbling?,2019-11-14,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — For months, Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned on calling a general election in Britain, figuring he could break the logjam in Parliament by taking his case for Brexit directly to the people. Instead, as he has floundered in the early stages of the campaign, Mr. Johnson has discovered that the people are taking their case to him. “Where have you been?” asked a man angry at the government’s response to floods that have ravaged his Yorkshire town. “You’ve got the cheek to come here,” a young woman chided him, saying that his promise of prosperity after Brexit was a “fairy tale.” “I’m not very happy about talking to you, so if you don’t mind, I’ll just motor on with what I’m doing,” said another woman, filling sandbags. In the voting this summer for Conservative Party leader — and, hence, prime minister — Mr. Johnson’s prime selling points were his personal popularity and skills as a campaigner. But in the early stages of the general election, exposed to hostile voices, he has seemed at times unsure, tone deaf and gaffe prone. “Boris Johnson isn’t helping matters, he isn’t winning any friends, there have been so many mistakes,” said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, while noting that Labour had failed to take advantage. On Thursday, Mr. Johnson was forced to cancel a visit to a bakery in the southwestern town of Glastonbury after a crowd of climate-change protesters gathered with signs that said “No BoJo” and “Cruel Con.” After he found a friendlier bakery in an adjacent town, the prime minister joked about needing to avoid the “crusties,” his preferred put-down for environmental activists. Even in the most hostile of Mr. Johnson’s encounters, the voters typically call him “Boris,” which attests to his first-name celebrity — a quality that analysts say makes him a formidable campaigner and still a good bet to win a Parliamentary majority when Britain goes to the polls on Dec. 12. The Conservatives have clung to a polling lead of between 6 and 14 percentage points over the opposition Labour Party. Yet, the charged atmosphere on the campaign trail is a reminder that Brexit has left this country bitter, divided and deeply suspicious of the political establishment. Mr. Johnson and his populist aides set out to exploit those sentiments, framing this election as one of the “people vs. the Parliament.” Now he is finding that some of that anger is being directed at him. Perhaps that’s one reason Mr. Johnson has seemed less sure-footed than many analysts expected in the early days of the campaign. A shambling, slipshod figure in the best of times, the prime minister has seemed undisciplined and occasionally uninformed during several recent appearances — lending weight to past criticism that he is often lazy and ill-prepared. Chatting with manufacturers in Northern Ireland last week, Mr. Johnson offered a rambling defense of the withdrawal agreement he negotiated with the European Union, which appeared to contradict the facts of the deal and caused a minor tempest when a video of the episode surfaced. Waving a glass as he spoke, Mr. Johnson insisted that companies would not have to fill out extra paperwork when they shipped goods from Northern Ireland to Britain. If they were asked to do so, he said, they should call him “and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin.” But his own government has said that exporters would be required to fill out “exit summary declarations.” During a visit to the London Electric Vehicle Company in Coventry, England, Mr. Johnson laid out a cogent case for why the Conservatives were the only party that will swiftly exit the European Union. But he stepped on his own climactic line about how he would “turbocharge” the country’s economic future much like the electric vehicles produced in the factory — musing in an aside about whether one could actually turbocharge a battery-operated vehicle. “This is Boris Johnson and this is what you get — someone who is slightly unprepared, who wings it a bit — and you either like that and think, ‘Oh, this is Boris’ or you think he is appalling for all sorts of reasons,” Mr. Fielding said.  Andrew Gimson, who wrote a biography of Mr. Johnson, took exception to the criticism, saying there was nothing accidental about the prime minister’s antics. They were designed, he said, to keep Mr. Johnson the center of attention, which in turn helps him press his very serious, but potentially tiresome, argument about Brexit. “The greater enemy for him is boredom,” Mr. Gimson said. “If people get very bored, they might want to change the subject, and he doesn’t want them to change the subject. There’s method in Boris’s madness.” While Mr. Johnson has achieved a rare celebrity in British politics, he remains a deeply polarizing figure. John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde and Britain’s leading expert on polling, noted that he is “the most unpopular new prime minister in polling history,” though he added that his appeal to Brexit voters made him potentially helpful to the Tories. “Boris you might want to regard as like a Ming vase,” Mr. Curtice said. “He’s potentially a really valuable asset — you just want to make sure he doesn’t fall on the floor.” In the last British election campaign in 2017, Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, began as a relatively popular prime minister running against an unpopular competitor in the Labour leader, Mr. Corbyn. But she steadily lost that advantage over the course of the campaign. This contest, Mr. Curtice said, was more of “an unpopularity contest,” because of the divisive nature of both leaders. Mr. Corbyn has also had his share of unsteady moments. Visiting Scotland, he was heckled for the second day in a row at a meeting in Dundee. Worse, his visit generated all the wrong sorts of headlines over Labour’s stance on whether Scots, who voted against independence in 2014, should hold a second referendum on the question — something Mr. Johnson has ruled out. On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn said that there would be no independence referendum “in the first term for a Labour government” if he took power after next month’s general election. Hours later, he said did “not countenance” another independence referendum in “the early years” of a Labour government. Still, there was better news for Mr. Corbyn from Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party. He had already agreed not to contest seats held by Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives so as not to split the pro-Brexit vote, but had been under pressure to withdraw even more candidates to give Mr. Johnson a free run. On Thursday Mr. Farage said that the party would run candidates, including in seats that are held by the Labour Party, potentially splitting the pro-Brexit vote in areas the Tories need to win.  “If he’s in the House of Commons, and we’re not there to challenge at every step of the way what he’s doing, then I fear we will end up with something that is Brexit in name only,” Mr. Farage said. Given all the abuse Mr. Johnson has taken, he looked almost relieved on Wednesday when a reporter abruptly shifted the subject to self-abuse. After his speech in Coventry, Mr. Johnson was asked why he had dropped a line from his text in which he accused his opponents of “self-obsession and onanism,” a flowery term for masturbation. Grinning slightly, Mr. Johnson said, “All I can say is that a stray early draft seems to have somehow found its way into your otherwise peerless copy, by a process that I don’t pretend to understand, but I will make inquiries.”']","Exposed to hostile voices on the campaign trail, he has seemed at times unsure, tone deaf and gaffe prone.

Along Alberta’s Cowboy Trail,2019-11-15,By Ian Austen,"['This week I traveled around southern Alberta to report on the province’s mood after its severe rebuke of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party in the recent federal election. Naturally I spoke with politicians, including Premier Jason Kenney, and political analysts. But I also tried to meet a wide array of Albertans, traveling south from Calgary to Longview. While there I was reminded, in a very personal way, of the direct connection to the province’s history many Albertans hold, as well as the roller coaster ways of its oil and gas industry. Alberta Highway 22, the Cowboy Trail, is the scenic route to Longview, although simply calling it scenic is greatly understating things. Looming to the west of Alberta’s foothills country, the Rocky Mountains were spectacularly painted with fresh snow. (The early and heavy snowfalls were less welcomed by farmers in southern Alberta who are now relying on a break in the weather to finally finish harvesting.) The foothills are the epicenter of the ranching lore that remains a major part of Alberta’s collective identity even if relatively few of its citizens now spend their days moving herds around grasslands. The Twin Cities Hotel in the center of Longview also signifies another time in the area’s history. At its north end, a replica wooden oil derrick looms. While the massive reservoir found under the Leduc No. 1 well in 1947, near Edmonton to the north, turned Alberta into a major oil power, its energy industry actually started down in the Turner Valley area at the height of the Great Depression. Like the oil sands center of Fort McMurray before the oil price collapse about five years ago, Longview became famous as a boom town, one so lively it presumptively adopted the name Little New York. But it wasn’t alone. Its twin, and the source of the hotel’s name when it opened in 1938, was Little Chicago, just up the highway to the north. Both became places to make good money, quickly. In cities like Calgary, native-born Albertans often seem like curiosities. The province has long lured people from across Canada and around the world. That includes Mr. Kenney, who was born in Ontario and raised in Saskatchewan. But because Alberta became a province only in 1905, it still doesn’t take much effort to find people whose grandparents and even parents were part of the European settlement of what has become Alberta’s farming and ranching areas. The pioneers of Little Chicago included my mother-in-law, Barb Coutts, and her mother, Kitty Leman. Kitty and her husband, Pete, both immigrants from Britain, were trying to farm with little success in Agassiz, British Columbia, when more than 20 wells sprang up in Little Chicago, their flares lighting the town. Kitty, with her daughter in tow, arrived to capture some of the money sloshing around with a cook wagon that catered to oil workers. Pete eventually quit farming, was named postmaster and set up an adjacent store. The opening of the post office, apparently on orders from Ottawa, brought an end to the Little Chicago name. The official replacement was Royalties. Today Royalties isn’t even a ghost town, it has vanished. While a few pump jacks still buck up and down in the area, Leduc changed the equation and the town gradually withered away, its buildings knocked down or hauled away. Alongside Highway 22, uphill from Longview is its only remnant: a memorial cairn topped by a miniature derrick and surrounded by photographs from the glory days, including one of Pete’s store and post office, and interpretive panels. Aside from a brief spell in Calgary during the mid-1950s, Barb went on to live most of her life in Ontario before her death in 2000. But her name still lives on in the foothills even if her onetime hometown doesn’t. On the back of the cairn she is listed, as Barb Leman, among the people who attended the Royalties’ long vanished school before serving in World War II. “I still notice every time when a customer comes in who’s clearly never been here before.

"U.N. Query on Syria Hospital Bombings May Be Undermined by Russia Pressure, Limited Scope",2019-11-14,By Whitney Hurst and Rick Gladstone,"['The aerial bombings of hospitals in rebel areas of Syria have long stood out as possible war crimes, so brazen that the leader of the United Nations ordered a special inquiry three months ago, raising hope of some accountability. But with evidence accumulating that the Syrian government’s Russian allies are responsible for some of those bombings, the opposite appears to be happening. The scope of the inquiry has so far been limited to just seven sites among the many targeted, according to an internal United Nations document seen by The New York Times. At the same time, diplomats say Russia has been pressing the global organization’s leader, Secretary General António Guterres, not to release the conclusions of even this narrow inquiry. And in what appears to be a new sign of impunity, one of the targets on the inquiry’s list, Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital — an underground facility that Russian pilots bombed at least once before, according to a New York Times investigation — appears to have been bombed by the Russians again on Nov. 6. [Read how we investigated Russia’s previous bombing of Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital.] The incidents under investigation include a possible bombing of Kafr Nabl in July, but not the attacks on Kafr Nabl and three other hospitals on May 5-6, which the Times investigation concluded had been carried out by Russia. All four hospitals also were on a list of sites that should not be attacked, known as a deconfliction list, sent by the United Nations to countries fighting in Syria, including Russia. The Times used witness accounts and videos, time-coded cockpit recordings of Russian pilots, plane spotter logs and security camera footage from Kafr Nabl to trace the follow-up attack on Nov. 6 to Russia. The times that one pilot confirms strikes in the cockpit recordings match the times the hospital was hit. Kafr Nabl, in northwest Syria’s Idlib province, was hit by three airstrikes and rendered temporarily out of service in the latest attack. No one was killed or wounded, according to a doctor there. A spokesman for Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s United Nations ambassador, did not respond to the Times’s request for comment about accusations that Russia had sought to pressure Mr. Guterres to keep the inquiry confidential. The spokesman instead pointed to public comments made by Mr. Nebenzia on Sept. 16 when he objected to what he described as disinformation about the Syrian and Russian military campaign. Mr. Nebenzia also said the inquiry should examine the United Nations deconfliction list, suggesting it was flawed. “Nobody denies that there are also civilians in Idlib, and that they live in dire conditions, some of them going through second or even third round of relocation. However, there is no other way to resolve their suffering, but to liberate this area from jihadists, who simply hold those civilians as a shield to protect their own positions,” Mr. Nebenzia said. Russia is the most important ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and is largely responsible for helping his forces as they move to destroy the last vestiges of a Western-backed rebellion that had once threatened to topple him at the height of the war, now in its ninth year. Since the end of April, Syria and Russia have been concentrating their firepower on northwest Syria, the remaining chunk of rebel-held territory. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said last Friday that at least 61 medical facilities in that area had been hit so far. He expressed alarm that “health facilities continue to be directly hit or significantly damaged” even as the United Nations panel is investigating. Mr. Guterres established a board of inquiry on Aug. 1 after 10 members of the Security Council, including the United States, expressed alarm at the attacks on hospitals. Diplomats say Mr. Guterres was initially reluctant but relented, and is now facing pressure from Russia to keep the inquiry’s findings a secret. Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said the United Nations is still considering how to handle the inquiry’s findings, when asked if the conclusions would be made public.  It would not be the first time that the Russians have sought to suppress or at least discredit any international finding that impugns the war conduct of the Kremlin or its Syrian ally. Two years ago, for example, Russia blocked Western attempts to extend the life of a United Nations-backed panel investigating chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after it had found the Syrian government responsible for a lethal aerial assault in the village of Khan Sheikhoun, which would be a war crime. The Russians called the panel’s research methods shoddy and had earlier warned its leader that the conclusion was unacceptable.   Hospitals, clinics, doctors and other medical workers have long been considered exempt from attack in the rules of war, regardless of who they are treating. Provisions of the Geneva Conventions specify that the wounded and sick shall be cared for and respected. While such principles have been violated in many conflicts, human rights advocates say the transgressions in Syria have been especially egregious. Any effort by Russia to suppress the hospital bombing inquiry, if successful, would extend the Kremlin’s record of blocking or impeding action at the United Nations that the Russians deem harmful to Mr. al-Assad’s side. Russia has vetoed 13 Security Council resolutions calling for action on Syria. In September, Russia blocked a demand for a cease-fire in the northwest of the country, the same area the Russian Air Force is currently bombing. Rights groups have expressed hope that the United Nations investigation of the hospital bombings would at least provide unassailable information that would point to who had carried them out. But some expressed dismay that the inquiry is so limited. Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that monitors attacks on medical facilities, said her organization was “gravely concerned that the Secretary-General’s initiative may lack the depth or breadth to effectively answer why civilian facilities were bombed, who was responsible, and how to prevent such attacks in the future.” Others are pressing Mr. Guterres to ignore any attempts to suppress the findings. “The victims, their families, and the world at large have a right to know the facts,” said Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director at Human Rights Watch. “Keeping silent will only embolden those responsible for war crimes in Syria.” Diplomats say they expect the inquiry’s final report to be finished by the end of the year.

Russia Frees Norwegian Convicted of Spying in Unusual 3-Way Swap,2019-11-15,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW —\xa0When Russian agents grabbed Frode Berg in front of Moscow’s ritzy Metropol Hotel two years ago, they turned the retired Norwegian border inspector into the symbol of a new Cold War descending on Scandinavia’s Arctic north.  At noon on Friday, Mr. Berg walked free after 23 months in prison on espionage charges, in a spy swap that harked back to the original Cold War. At a border crossing between Lithuania and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Russia released Mr. Berg, along with two Lithuanians convicted of spying. Lithuania freed two convicted Russian spies. “We are happy Frode Berg is now coming home to Norway, as a free man,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway said in a statement. “I would like to thank the Lithuanian authorities for their cooperation and for their efforts to free Berg.” The unusual three-way swap with two NATO allies underscored the Kremlin’s interest in using foreign citizens arrested in Russia to secure the release of its own citizens abroad. Mr. Berg’s Russian lawyer, Ilya Novikov, said the Russian authorities had sought different deals in return for Mr. Berg’s freedom that they were not able to secure.  “The solution that worked was not the first and the second solution that was considered,” Mr. Novikov said in an interview. “That’s why it took so long. Russia had its own ideas that proved impossible to realize.” One of the Russians released in the swap, Nikolai Filipchenko, was detained in 2015 and accused of trying to recruit Lithuanian security officers to plant bugs in the office and residence of the Lithuanian president. The other, Sergey Moiseyenko, had been in prison since 2014 for spying on NATO and the Lithuanian military.  The two Lithuanians released, Yevgeny Mataitis and Aristidas Tamosaitis, were convicted of espionage in Russia in 2016. The arrest of Mr. Berg in December 2017 shocked his Arctic hometown, Kirkenes, Norway, where the retired border inspector had been active in promoting closer ties with Russia. Many in Kirkenes, a Barents Sea port town a 15-minute drive from the Russian border, took pride in their work to strengthen their remote region’s cultural and economic links with Russia even as geopolitical tensions grew.  But the authorities in Moscow said Mr. Berg had a secret mission on his trips to Russia, accusing him of collecting information about Russian nuclear submarines. Through a lawyer, Mr. Berg last year admitted he believed he was acting as a courier for Norwegian intelligence, but said he was not informed of the risks involved.  “I feel really misused,” Mr. Berg said in a Moscow court appearance last year. Mr. Berg was sentenced to 14 years in prison, and his supporters feared it would be years until he returned. Even if Russia were to consider a spy swap, they said, there appeared to be no Russian spies in Norwegian prisons.  But Friday’s three-way swap shows Russia is prepared to get creative in making deals. The Kremlin is reported to have tried to exchange an Israeli woman arrested with a few grams of marijuana in her luggage at a Moscow airport for a Russian set to be extradited from Israel to the United States on hacking charges.  That effort failed this week after Israel went ahead with the Russian hacker’s extradition. In September, Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners, with Russia returning a Ukrainian filmmaker, Oleg Sentsov, who had been jailed in Russia after being convicted on what were widely seen as trumped-up terrorism charges, and 24 sailors detained late last year in waters near Crimea. “Any foreign citizen detained in Russia is a hostage, and he must be exchanged for someone or for something,” said Mr. Novikov, Mr. Berg’s lawyer, who also represented several of the Ukrainians in the September swap. Henrik Pryser Libell contributed reporting from Oslo. ']","A retired Norwegian border inspector, two Lithuanians and two convicted Russian spies were exchanged."
Bolivia’s Interim Leader Pledges to ‘Reconstruct Democracy’,2019-11-13,By Clifford Krauss,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — The lawmaker who has assumed Bolivia’s interim presidency addressed her violence-torn nation on Wednesday and pledged to “reconstruct democracy,” even as the ousted Bolivian president called her government unconstitutional and his backers vowed to disrupt it. In her first televised address to Bolivia, Jeanine Añez Chavez, the senator who declared herself interim president on Tuesday, urged citizens to resume their normal lives after weeks of violence set off by a disputed election. She promised to seek “a national consensus.” And Ms. Añez rejected accusations from Evo Morales, who stepped down as president on Sunday with his country in turmoil, that her assumption of the presidency was illegitimate. Mr. Morales has taken refuge in Mexico. On Wednesday, with the backing of the military, Ms. Añez met with advisers to appoint a new cabinet. But outside, in the streets of La Paz, a scene of chaos was playing out, and it was clear that Bolivia remained deeply polarized and volatile four days after Mr. Morales, the nation’s first Indigenous leader, resigned amid claims of election fraud.  On Wednesday afternoon, after using tear gas to break up a peaceful protest by supporters of Mr. Morales, the police blocked about a dozen senators allied with the former president from entering the legislature. “Dictatorship! Dictatorship!” chanted the crowd accompanying the lawmakers. Less than an hour later, as tear gas wafted outside the government palace, the armed forces announced a shake-up of the high command. An army general, Carlos Orellana Centellas, became the new top commander of the armed forces and promised to take orders from Ms. Añez.  “We will guarantee the security of the constitutional government,” General Orellana Centellas said. Ms. Añez’s assumption of the interim presidency has won the backing of the country’s Constitutional Court. And Wednesday night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the United States “applauds” Ms. Anez for “stepping up” as Bolivia’s interim leader.  But Mario Galindo, a noted Bolivian political science professor, said the political situation was confusing and in flux. “At this moment, it is not clear who is in charge of whom,” he said. Under Bolivian law, he said, the senators who were barred from entering the legislature “had all the right to enter the senate and meet with whomever they wanted.” Supporters of Mr. Morales remained skeptical of Ms. Añez, accusing her and the opposition of having staged a coup. “We want Morales to return,” said one protester, Graciela Argollo, a radio station worker from Cochabamba, Mr. Morales’s stronghold. “Añez must resign. She’s not with the farmers and poor people.” Ms. Añez declared herself interim leader of Bolivia’s government before a special session of the legislature on Tuesday night. She had been next in line of succession after the resignation of Mr. Morales and a series of high-ranking officials on Sunday. Ms. Añez has said she intends to stay in power only until new elections can be held, in 90 days. But the session at which she claimed power was boycotted by supporters of Mr. Morales, who hold a majority. In Mexico City, Mr. Morales told reporters that Ms. Añez’s government was unconstitutional because the legislature had not approved his resignation.  Mr. Morales said he would return to Bolivia “if the people ask me to return to pacify” it, but he also said he was willing to bow out if it would unite the country and end the violence.  “Without Evo if they want, but without violence, because that isn’t the solution,” he said. “But it doesn’t depend just on Evo.” Mr. Morales also offered a defense of his record, citing the rise from poverty made by many members of Bolivia’s long-repressed Indigenous communities. He listed economic statistics to prove his success, down to the miles of roads that were paved under his presidency. “Continuity is important for the economic development of the country,” he said. Bolivia’s political crisis and widespread protests were set off by the recent election in which Mr. Morales, 60, declared victory in his quest for a fourth term.  His grip on power swiftly eroded amid accusations that the vote had been rigged. The Organization of American States, which monitored the elections, said that the Oct. 20 vote was marred by irregularities and that it could not validate Mr. Morales’s claim of victory. As the protests went on, some police units defected and joined the protests, and military officials called on Mr. Morales to resign.  A former media executive and conservative legislator, Ms. Añez quickly gained the support of the Bolivian Army’s high command, who visited her on Tuesday for a planning meeting at the government palace. Her backers released photos of members of the high command saluting her. The new government was welcomed enthusiastically by crowds in Santa Cruz, a longtime center of dissent against Mr. Morales, and other localities, though it appeared that few people know much about Ms. Añez, who had served in an obscure legislative post. “I can’t say that I like her or not,” Victor Pusari, the son of an apartment building porter, who was guarding the entrance of his central La Paz building, said on Wednesday. “But we need a leader, someone to be in charge.” Ms. Anez swore in an 11-member cabinet Wednesday evening in a ceremony at the government palace, in which she promised “an inclusive government.”  The cabinet included three women but no Indigenous people. Perhaps the most important member will be the new Economy Minister, Jose Luis Parada, an energy specialist, who will be responsible for reviving an economy weakened low natural gas prices and by recent road blockages and violent protests. Looting and clashes between the police and demonstrators across the country have left at least eight dead in recent weeks, according to Bolivian news reports. On Wednesday, Morales supporters descended on La Paz for a third day in a row from El Alto, a nearby mountain city with a heavily Indigenous population.  Chaos gripped the downtown as protesters set bonfires in the street and the police launched tear gas at groups of demonstrators. A mix of tear gas and smoke made the air difficult to breath. Stores were shut, and hotel employees handed out vinegar-drenched rags for guests who had been gassed. Some Bolivians said they were prepared to back the interim government. “When they come, we’re here to defend,” said Jarameel Armas, a university student who joined the police at a barricade of corrugated metal and heavy chains, referring to Morales supporters. “We will defend the new government and the democracy we have won.” Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.']","The leader, Jeanine Añez Chavez, appointed a new cabinet, but backers of the ousted Evo Morales have promised to disrupt the new government."
"As Islamic Jihad and Israel Battled, Hamas, in a Twist, Sat on the Sidelines",2019-11-14,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, has been trying for over a year to keep a lid on its conflict with Israel, to improve the abysmal quality of life for the two million Palestinians under its control, and to keep millions of dollars in cash coming in each month from its generous allies in Qatar. But a nettlesome, unruly and heavily armed little group called Palestinian Islamic Jihad has repeatedly sabotaged those plans by firing rockets at Israel, which more often than not has responded by raining down destruction on Hamas’s own installations and men. On Tuesday, impatient with Hamas’s failure to curtail the group, Israel assassinated a top Islamic Jihad commander, a maverick said to be responsible for nearly every instance in the past year in which an incipient cease-fire on the Gaza-Israeli border was wrecked by violence from the Palestinian side. The killing put Hamas in the uncomfortable position of sitting on the sidelines while its much smaller but more militant rival exchanged blows with their shared hated enemy over two long days of battle. With Islamic Jihad firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, and Israel answering by killing  34 people, including about two dozen militants and at least six children, Hamas was left to watch the funeral processions roll by and ponder a difficult choice between two roles it has awkwardly balanced for over a decade: Redouble its efforts to achieve quiet along the border? Or revert to its long history as the champion of armed resistance to Israel, and get into the fight? “By the hour, Hamas gains more criticism from their base,” said Shimrit Meir, an Israeli analyst of the Arab world. “Hamas fighters are watching this and saying, ‘What about us? What have we become?’” That predicament gets to the heart of the complicated and evolving dynamic between Hamas, the de facto civilian government and 30,000-strong army in Gaza, which has dominated the coastal territory since 2007, and Islamic Jihad, an even older faction that in many ways has been the untrammeled id of the Palestinian resistance movement for some time. Both groups are viewed as terrorist organizations by Israel and the United States. In times of all-out war, as in 2014, they team up against Israel. But with Hamas firmly entrenched in Gaza — and Israel preferring to let things stay that way rather than see Gaza and the West Bank reunited — Islamic Jihad has increasingly taken on the role of the ideological purist agitating for violent conflict with Israel, not compromise. As Gaza’s ruler, by contrast, Hamas is responsible — like it or not — for keeping the peace, a twist from its past role. In its early years, when Yasir Arafat’s Fatah movement was the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza, Hamas itself played the same sort of tormentor’s role, attacking Israeli soldiers and civilians and making itself look fierce compared to Fatah, which, through the Palestinian Authority, sought to achieve a negotiated settlement with Israel. Back then, Israel would often punish the authority for Hamas’s actions. Even today, while Hamas ridicules the Palestinian Authority for its security cooperation with Israel on the West Bank, Islamic Jihad’s roughly 6,000 militants often accuse Hamas of doing much the same thing. Hamas, which is largely held responsible by Gaza residents for the awful conditions there, has been seeking a long-term cease-fire with Israel to ease the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and rebuild Gaza’s economy. This week, it was Islamic Jihad, for a change, that broached a cease-fire: In a televised interview on Wednesday night, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, the group’s Lebanon-based leader, laid down terms including swearing off future assassinations and stopping the use of live ammunition against Palestinian protesters along the Gaza border fence. On Thursday morning, Israel confirmed a cease-fire had gone into effect, and there were reports that it had agreed to spurn live fire at the Gaza fence — suggesting Islamic Jihad could earn new bragging rights: Hamas has been sending protesters to be killed at the fence for 19 months, but Islamic Jihad was finally protecting them.  But an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, did not confirm any new restriction on live fire at the border fence, saying, “Demands are one thing, and reality is another.” And on Thursday morning, the cease-fire was punctuated by at least two rounds of rocket fire. Tensions between Hamas and Islamic Jihad go back decades. Both groups spun off from the Muslim Brotherhood: Islamic Jihad was founded in 1979 by Fathi Shikaki, a Palestinian inspired by the Shiite Islamic revolution in Iran. Tareq Baconi, a Gaza expert for the International Crisis Group, said that while the Brotherhood believed Muslims needed to build a “virtuous society before you begin resisting,” Islamic Jihad believed that resistance to the Israeli occupation needed to come first. When Hamas came into being during the First Intifada, in 1987, it immediately dwarfed Islamic Jihad, said Azzam Tamimi, a Brotherhood-affiliated Palestinian academic and activist based in London. “Both were initially in competition,” he said. “Islamic Jihad members would say, ‘We didn’t need another resistance movement — we’re already there. You could’ve just supported us.’” The groups grew closer when Mr. Shikaki was assassinated in Malta, in 1995, and Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, a Gaza-born scholar who had taught Middle Eastern politics at a Florida university, was named Islamic Jihad’s leader. Mr. Shallah believed the groups should unite into one movement, Mr. Tamimi said. But the Hamas takeover in Gaza led to new friction when some elements of the defeated Fatah movement were merged into Islamic Jihad. The Syrian civil war created a new divide: Hamas, whose top leaders were in Syria, came out in support of the rebels, rupturing its relationship with Bashar al-Assad’s regime and damaging its ties with Iran. Islamic Jihad did not take sides, and wound up receiving far better funding and weapons deliveries from Tehran, Mr. Baconi said. Today, while Hamas works with Iran, Israeli analysts say, Islamic Jihad works for Iran: It is considered a full-fledged Iranian proxy, and one that Iran can use to send Israel messages through relatively low-risk acts of violence. Public opinion may reflect that dual loyalty: While Hamas is supported by about a third of Gaza residents, polls show, Islamic Jihad is the preferred faction of around 5 percent. Mr. Shallah suffered a series of catastrophic strokes in April 2018, and was replaced by Mr. al-Nakhalah that September. Analysts and Israeli intelligence experts say his hawkishness has made Mr. Shallah look cautious in comparison. But it was a tactical officer, Baha Abu al-Ata, nominally the commander of Islamic Jihad’s northern brigade, who ordered repeated strikes on Israel in defiance of Hamas’s efforts to achieve a truce along the border, officials and analysts say. Mediators from Egyptian intelligence, striving along with United Nations officials to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza, brought Mr. al-Ata to Cairo for talks in mid-October.  But within two weeks, Mr. al-Ata was firing rockets into Israel again, officials said. This week, convinced that Mr. al-Ata was planning a deadlier attack, Israeli officials said, they tracked him down to an apartment in Gaza City. An air-to-ground missile killed him and his wife. Israel, which has been trying to limit its response to targets associated with the Islamic Jihad, sees the killing as removing a dangerous wild card. That view is likely shared by many leaders of Hamas, analysts suggested. It is not, at least publicly, shared by Mr. al-Ata’s comrades. “The Israelis said they don’t want escalation, but when you commit such an operation, what does that mean?” said Ihsan Ataya, an Islamic Jihad representative in Lebanon. If a cease-fire does not take hold, the greater risk for Israelis and Palestinians is that Islamic Jihad’s continued fighting draws Hamas into battle. “It’s amazing that Hamas is not joining in,” Ms. Meir, the Israeli analyst, said. “It also shows how committed they are to a cease-fire.” Already, though, she said, Islamic Jihad’s efforts had affected life in Israel. “They’re very content that they managed to destabilize daily life here,” Ms. Meir said. “I live in Tel Aviv, and my supermarket wasn’t open yesterday. That’s not irrelevant. They have gains on the battlefield.” Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Iyad Abuheweilah from Gaza City.']","With Israel exchanging blows with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas faced a stark choice: Join the fight or redouble efforts to keep the Gaza border quiet."
Germany Passes Climate-Protection Law to Ensure 2030 Goals,2019-11-15,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Germany enshrined its fight against climate change into law on Friday in a bid to meet its targets under the Paris Agreement, approving a raft of measures including a $60 billion spending package, a fee system for carbon emissions and taxes to make flying more expensive.  The law, which passed the lower house of Parliament and is expected to pass the upper house later this year, has been sharply criticized by opposition lawmakers and climate scientists alike for its lack of ambition and scope. They say it will not be enough to get the country to achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 55 percent of 1990s levels by 2030. “You have failed in humanity’s task of protecting the climate,” Anton Hofreiter, leader of the opposition Green Party caucus in Parliament, told lawmakers ahead of the vote on Friday. Germany’s leader, Angela Merkel, who was known as the “climate chancellor” when she first took office in 2005 after making a name for herself as environment minister, had vowed to prioritize the issue in her final term in office. In September, after months of debate, her government passed a climate package that forms the heart of the new law. The environment minister, Svenja Schulze, told reporters after the vote: “I am very happy that the centerpiece of the package, the climate action law, has now been passed. It is the central point, the linchpin, with which climate policy in Germany will really change.”  Germany is Europe’s largest economy, and it has sought for years to revolutionize its energy sector by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy such as solar, wind and biogas, while cutting climate-killing emissions. But the country fell behind this year, and the government admitted that it would be able to cut emissions by only 32 percent of 1990s levels by 2020, not the targeted goal of 40 percent. Under the new law, ministries must make specific emissions reductions in their sectors, such as energy, transportation or housing, and take additional steps if necessary to meet them. An important element of the package is a domestic carbon pricing scheme that will force companies to pay an initial 10 euros, about $11, for a ton of carbon dioxide emissions from heating and transportation. Climate scientists and members of the Greens have derided the price — which is to increase to €35 by 2025 — as too low to be effective.  The Greens hold more seats in the upper house of Parliament, reflecting their representation in Germany’s 16 states, and have vowed to use their strength there and in regional legislatures to tighten aspects of the law.  Included in the €54 billion, or about $60 billion, spending package are incentives for buying electric cars, replacing oil-burning furnaces and better insulating private properties. The law also includes tax breaks for train tickets and tax increases to be levied on the price of airline tickets — all aimed at making it more attractive for people to choose trains, which emit lower levels of carbon dioxide, over higher-emitting planes.  At the same time, the package includes increased benefits for commuters to avoid a backlash as occurred in France, where a proposed gas tax increase set off months of violent demonstrations by the “Yellow Vest” movement.  Further incentives in the law foresee supporting the expansion of green energy, such as allowing communities a stake in local wind parks. Lawsuits have slowed the building of many proposed wind parks, hampering their expansion. Climate scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who assessed the package at the heart of the law said that without a higher price on carbon emissions, effective monitoring and better integration with other European Union nations, the legislation would not be enough for Germany to meet its 2030 goals.  “The climate package is, at best, an indication of a change of direction” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the director of the institute. “but this has not yet taken place.”']",The law aims to get the country in line to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to meet Paris Agreement targets.
Saving the Fire Victims Who Cannot Flee: Australia’s Koalas,2019-11-14,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['MELBOURNE, Australia — The victims were carried in one by one, their paws burned and fur singed, suffering from dehydration and fear. Their caretakers bandaged their wounds, swaddled them and laid them in baskets with the only thing that was familiar — the leaves of a eucalyptus tree.  As catastrophic fires have burned more than two million acres in Australia, dozens of koalas have been rescued from smoldering trees and ashen ground. The animals, already threatened as a species before these latest blazes ravaged a crucial habitat, are being treated in rescue centers, and at least one private home, along the country’s east coast. “They are terrified,” said Cheyne Flanagan, the clinical director of the Koala Hospital, in Port Macquarie, the only facility of its kind in the world. She added that what was happening to the koalas was “a national tragedy.” Officials at the hospital began warning weeks ago, when the fires first ignited around Port Macquarie, 250 miles north of Sydney, that hundreds of koalas may have been “incinerated.” Rescuers have not yet been able to confirm the scope of the loss because some of the blazes are still raging.  The plight of the koala — a national symbol of Australia — has raised questions among conservationists and scientists about what it will take to preserve biodiversity in a country increasingly prone to intense fire, extreme heat and water scarcity, and which already has among the highest rates of species extinction in the world. While koalas have evolved to exist alongside wildfires, the animals are facing new threats not just from climate change but also from human development, which has dislocated local populations, impairing their ability to survive fires. In some regions, scientists say, koalas’ numbers have declined by up to 80 percent, though it is difficult to know how many remain across Australia. “We have these unique animals not found anywhere else on this planet, and we’re killing them,” Ms. Flanagan said. “This is a big wake-up call.” The animal distress goes beyond koalas. Recently, tens of thousands of bats plummeted from the sky in temperatures exceeding 107 degrees Fahrenheit in northern Australia. Kangaroos, parched by drought, decimated the grapes on a vineyard in Canberra. And waterfowl in the Macquarie Marshes, a wildlife haven in northwest New South Wales, have been affected by a fire in their habitat. “It’s a swamp for goodness’ sake; it’s burning,” said David Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania. The current bush fires, the earlier burning of rainforests and a continuing extreme drought, he said, are all “warning lights” that ecosystems have been pushed far beyond their normal patterns. Climate change and other human impacts have so altered the landscape that the government needs to urgently rethink its approach to conservation, Dr. Bowman said, suggesting interventions like irrigating, feeding and relocating animals.  “You want koalas?” he said. “That’s what we’ve got to do.”  In the weeks that the fires have been burning around Port Macquarie, more than two-thirds of the habitat of a local population of koalas in the forest surrounding two lakes has been decimated, conservationists said.  They estimated that 350 of the nearly 700 koalas that lived in the region had been killed. As of Thursday, 22 adult koalas and one joey had been rescued. They are being treated at the Koala Hospital along with dozens of other animals, including kangaroos and possums that were injured in dog attacks or car accidents — often the collateral damage of creatures searching for a new home after a disaster.  About 50 miles south of the hospital, in Taree, one family has transformed its home into a koala rehabilitation center. There, 24 animals, each given a name on a Post-it note attached to its basket, are beginning the slow road to recovery in the couple’s living room. “Somebody has to look after them because nobody else is doing too much, as far as the government, in protecting their habitat and protecting them,” Christeen McLeod, who is housing the koalas, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “So we do this,” she added, “and hope that we can save some of them.” Koalas, unlike kangaroos, birds or snakes, do not flee from fires, but instead scale trees to the canopy, where they can curl themselves into a ball for protection and wait for the danger to pass.  But during high-intensity fires, such as those that have burned in recent weeks, the animals, conservationists say, are far less likely to survive. Even if the fire itself does not reach the tree canopy, the animals may overheat and fall to the ground, where they can be burned to death. They can also suffer smoke inhalation, or burn their paws or claws when trying to climb down trees.  Claws, crucial for life in the wild, do not grow back. A “koala who can’t climb can’t survive,” said Sue Ashton, the director of the Koala Hospital.  She said that while the hospital hoped to rehabilitate and eventually release the animals, it was likely that some would have to be euthanized. That, she added, would be a further blow to conservation efforts. Though the fires are still burning, a rescue team led by the hospital began to search the periphery last week, walking in a human chain, their necks strained toward the tree canopy, searching for survivors.  The rescuers described a lifeless scene free of birds and insects, with the forest undergrowth gone, reeds burned in a creek, and hollowed-out trees still smoking.  “This fire is currently still burning,” said Scott Castle, the assistant clinical director at the hospital, who participated in the effort. “So,” he added, “there’s a lot more to search.”']",The plight of dozens of animals being treated for burned paws and singed fur is raising fears about climate change and the future of the species. 
"North Korea Says U.S. Sought More Talks, but Calls It a ‘Trick’",2019-11-14,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that the United States had proposed resuming talks on denuclearization in December, but warned that Pyongyang was not interested unless Washington was ready to meet its terms. And a top envoy said he believed the proposal was merely “a trick to earn time.” The North Korean envoy to the talks, Kim Myong-gil, said on Thursday that his counterpart in Washington, Stephen E. Biegun, had sent a proposal to the North through a third party. Mr. Biegun and Mr. Kim led their countries’ delegations to working-level talks in Sweden last month, which ended without an agreement. In a statement that was carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, Mr. Kim expressed strong doubt about Mr. Biegun’s sincerity, asking why the American envoy had sent his proposal through an intermediary rather than contacting him directly. “If the negotiated solution of issues is possible, we are ready to meet with the U.S. at any place and any time\u200b,” Mr. Kim said. But he added that North Korea had “no willingness to have such negotiations” if the United States merely planned to stall, as \u200bhe said Mr. Biegun’s team had done in Stockholm\u200b. \u200bAfter \u200bthose talks collapsed, North Korea said it had no desire to engage in “sickening negotiations” with the United States anymore, swearing that it would never meet with American negotiators again until Washington had taken “a substantial step” toward a “complete and irreversible withdrawal” of its “hostile policy.” On Thursday, Mr. Kim said he intuitively believed that Washington was not ready to give a satisfactory answer to the North’s demand. “Explicitly speaking once again, I am not interested in such a meeting,” he said. The North Korean statement did not specify what the American proposal was suspected to be a distraction from. But earlier, the North had accused the United States of using negotiations for “domestic political” purposes, a reference to the Ukraine scandal that is fueling impeachment hearings in Washington. Mr. Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, held their first summit meeting in June last year in Singapore, \u200bsigning a broadly worded agreement for North Korea to \u200b“\u200bwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u200b”\u200b \u200bin return for “new” relations \u200band\u200b security guarantees\u200b from Washington\u200b. But when the two leaders met again in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, they failed to agree on how to implement the Singapore deal. Mr. Kim insisted that his country could denuclearize only \u200bin phases. \u200bAs the first\u200b step, he suggested, the United States should lift \u200ball major United Nations sanctions\u200b against his country\u200b in return for \u200bthe dismantling of \u200ba key nuclear fuel production complex.  Mr. Trump demanded a quick and comprehensive elimination of the North’s nuclear weapons, as well as their means of delivery and production facilities, before easing any international sanctions. \u200bIn Stockholm last month, negotiators had tried in vain to narrow the gaps. Washington said at the time that the American negotiators had presented the North Koreans with “creative ideas.” On Thursday, Mr. Kim, the North Korean negotiator, indicated that\u200b the United States had offered incentives such as signing a document declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted in a truce, and exchanging liaison offices in each other’s capitals.  But he said such incentives of “secondary importance” fell far short of meeting the North’s demand that the United States lift its “hostile policy,” which he said was “harmful to our rights to existence and development.” North Korea has typically cited international sanctions and the United States’\u200b military threats, including its joint exercises with South Korea\u200b, as part of such a hostile policy. Washington and Seoul are set to start a joint air-force drill later this month. In a speech in April, Kim Jong-un said he would wait until the end of the year for Washington to come up with a more flexible proposal. In recent months, North Korea has resumed a series of missile and rocket tests, warning that it would find “a new way” if the Trump administration did not meet its demand by then. In response to the latest North Korean statement, a State Department spokesperson said that Mr. Trump remained “committed to making progress toward the Singapore commitments of transformed relations, building lasting peace and complete denuclearization.” Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington']",The top North Korean envoy to the negotiations with Washington said he was not interested unless the United States was ready to make substantial concessions.
Exchanges of Fire Continue Across Israel-Gaza Border,2019-11-13,By Isabel Kershner and Iyad Abuheweila,"['JERUSALEM — Gaza militants continued to bombard southern Israel with rockets on Wednesday and Israeli forces struck back against targets in the Palestinian coastal enclave in a clash set off by Israel’s assassination of a senior Islamic Jihad commander on Tuesday. Though the death toll rose in Gaza and much of southern Israel was paralyzed by air-raid warnings, both sides appeared to be carefully measuring their actions.  After a quiet night and a resumption of hostilities early Wednesday, Israel and Gaza teetered between a quick resolution to this round of violence and a possible escalation — either intentional or through a misstep — that could lead to a much broader conflict. In a speech on Wednesday night, Ziad al-Nakhala, the secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, said that Israel was seeking a cease-fire and he laid out his group’s conditions for one, including an end to Israel’s targeted killings and a commitment to previous understandings on easing the blockade on Gaza. By midnight, the death toll in Gaza over the two days of violence had risen to at least 26, according to Palestinian health officials, including several civilians. Palestinian officials said more than 80 people had been wounded. The Israeli military put the number of militants killed at about 20. No deaths have been reported in Israel as a result of the rocket fire, which triggered multiple sirens on Wednesday and sent residents running for bomb shelters. But the Magen David Adom emergency medical service said it had treated dozens of people as a result of the rocket fire that began on Tuesday. A few were lightly injured by shrapnel; the rest were wounded while running for cover or showed stress symptoms.  The fight remained between Israel and Islamic Jihad, with Hamas, the larger militant group that governs Gaza, having stayed out of the fray so far. If Hamas were to start firing, the conflict would likely spiral down sharply, with Israeli officials warning of harsh consequences. Hamas sent mixed messages, issuing statements in solidarity with Islamic Jihad and the “resistance” in the name of the Joint Operation Chamber, a committee of all the militant factions in Gaza that at least nominally is managing the battle.  Analysts put Hamas’s continued restraint down to its probable desire for a quick return to its understandings with Israel that have led to relative calm along the border in recent months, as well as injections of Qatari cash for the organization.  Hamas’s reticence perhaps also attested to frustrations with Islamic Jihad. Israeli officials said the smaller group had repeatedly tried to disrupt the cease-fire with sporadic, rogue rocket fire over the last year and had specifically accused Baha Abu al-Ata, the commander who was killed along with his wife in a missile strike as they slept in their apartment before dawn on Tuesday, of directing the attacks. But standing by could also have consequences. One Israeli minister, Yuval Steinitz, warned that Israel would broaden its assault if Hamas did not act to rein in Islamic Jihad. Issuing a stern warning to Islamic Jihad, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was not looking for an escalation but would respond harshly to each rocket attack. “Islamic Jihad would do well to understand this right now, instead of when it will be too late,” Mr. Netanyahu said at the start of a special cabinet meeting. “I believe that Islamic Jihad is starting to internalize this message. They understand that we will continue to strike them without mercy. They understand that Israel is very strong and that our will is very great.” The United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, said his organization was working “to urgently de-escalate the situation.” “The indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars against population centers is absolutely unacceptable and must stop immediately,” Mr. Mladenov said in a statement.  Islamic Jihad’s military wing took responsibility for all the rocket fire in a statement on Wednesday. But Islamic Jihad appeared to have scaled back the range of its rocket fire, if not the intensity of its barrages, in response to the killing of Mr. Abu al-Ata. Most rockets and mortar shells appeared aimed at Israeli cities and communities within a few miles of the Gaza border, with the militants refraining from firing at the populous Tel Aviv area to the north, as they did initially on Tuesday.  In addition to the attack that killed Mr. Abu al-Ata, the group also blamed Israel for the attempted assassination of Akram al-Ajouri, an Islamic Jihad leader whose home in Damascus, Syria was also hit by an airstrike before dawn on Tuesday. The group said its “account with the Zionist enemy is still open,” adding, “our jihad is ongoing and our operations are continuing.” Israel has remained silent about the attack on Mr. al-Ajouri, which killed his son and another man, neither taking nor denying responsibility.  The Israeli military said on Wednesday that it was limiting its airstrikes to Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza, including infrastructure, weapons manufacturing facilities and rocket-launching crews. The military said it also struck one squad that was preparing to fire anti-tank missiles.  Still, the situation remained highly volatile. Islamic Jihad made it clear on Tuesday that its real revenge for the killing was yet to come, suggesting that the rocket fire was just a prelude. And the more the death toll rose in Gaza, the more likely that Hamas would come under pressure to get involved. In Gaza, schools and most businesses remained closed and people mostly kept indoors, wary of Israeli strikes and the danger of misfired rockets falling short of the border.  Three civilians, Rafat Ayyad and his two sons, Islam and Amir, one of them a young child, were killed in an airstrike as they rode on a motorcycle in a residential district of Gaza City on Wednesday morning, according to relatives. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said he did not have details of what happened in that case. But he added that the military was taking “extensive measures, both intelligence-wise and operationally, and in the choice of munitions we use, to minimize to the greatest extent possible any harm to noncombatants.” Many Gazans said they wanted to see the militant groups respond harshly to deter Israel from carrying out further assassinations after the killing of Mr. Abu al-Ata.  “This was a cowardly act,” said Ismail Al-Khour, 30, a mechanic in Gaza City. “The resistance must bomb them and the occupied lands.” Israeli schools within a 25-mile radius of the Gaza border were closed for a second day on Wednesday. After dusk, the authorities instructed the residents of communities close to the Gaza border to stay near their safe rooms and bomb shelters amid almost constant rocket fire.  Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system intercepted most of the rockets headed toward population centers, but one house in the coastal city of Ashkelon suffered a direct hit and a woman was moderately injured.  Israel’s newly appointed defense minister, Naftali Bennett, issued his own warning to enemies on all fronts on his first day in the post, saying, “Whoever plans to harm us by day will never be sure that they will make it though the night.”  Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City. Ibrahim El-Mughraby contributed reporting from Gaza City.  ']",A clash set off by Israel’s killing of an Islamic Jihad commander teetered between containment and escalation into a broader conflict.
"Venezuela’s Ex-Spy Chief, Wanted in U.S., Is Missing in Spain",2019-11-13,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — The Spanish police said on Wednesday that they were searching for Hugo Carvajal, the former intelligence chief of Venezuela, after Spain’s national court reversed an earlier decision and ordered the extradition of Mr. Carvajal to the United States to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges. The search for Mr. Carvajal is the latest twist in an international game of cat and mouse since the Spanish police first detained him last April. He was released from a Spanish jail in September after the American extradition request was first rejected. The court ruled that the claims made against him were too “abstract” to establish his individual involvement in drug trafficking.  Last September, the Spanish court also accepted the defense’s argument that the American request was politically motivated, saying that the United States wanted to extradite Mr. Carvajal because the move would be “within the American political strategy toward Venezuela.” Spanish prosecutors appealed, however, and the ruling was reversed last week, reactivating the arrest warrant for Mr. Carvajal. A spokesman for the national court said that details of the ruling were not yet public, so it remains unclear why the decision was changed.  On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Spanish national police said that officers were trying to find Mr. Carvajal. Maria Dolores de Argüelles, a Spanish lawyer representing Mr. Carvajal, said that she had no idea where her client was and had also been unable to reach his wife by phone.  But Mr. Carvajal could not be considered a fugitive, Ms. de Argüelles said, since she had yet to receive a document from the court confirming that it had agreed to extradite him. “That some people should know about a court decision before the court even informs the parties is simply incredible,” she said by phone.  Mr. Carvajal, known by the nickname El Pollo, or “The Chicken,” served for several years as the military intelligence chief under Hugo Chávez, the former leader of Venezuela. He was also a lawmaker in the governing Socialist party before an abrupt fallout with the current leader, Nicolás Maduro.  In February, Mr. Carvajal urged the military to break with the president and instead side with Mr. Maduro’s main opponent, Juan Guaidó. Amid the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, Mr. Maduro has managed to hold on to power and has resisted pressure from Mr. Guaidó and other opponents, including the United States, to step down. Mr. Guaidó has been recognized as the legitimate president by the United States and several other Western governments.  The United States Justice Department said that in April 2006, Mr. Carvajal coordinated the transportation of about 6.2 tons of cocaine to Mexico from Venezuela, according to charges filed in federal court in New York.  He would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life if convicted. After Mr. Carvajal was detained in Spain last April, he claimed during his extradition hearing in Madrid that the drug charges against him had been fabricated.  Spain has become one of the main safe havens for members of the Venezuelan opposition and defecting members of the Socialist party who have fled their country as the political situation and economic problems there have spiraled out of control.']","A Spanish court ordered the extradition of Hugo Carvajal, who broke with Nicolás Maduro’s government.

Hong Kong Protests Roil City as Universities Cut Semester Short,2019-11-13,"By Mike Ives, Elaine Yu and Katherine Li","['HONG KONG — Two Hong Kong university campuses cut their semesters short on Wednesday because of widening unrest, as residents navigated severe transit disruptions and office workers brawled with the police in the heart of the financial district. This week’s disruptions are notable because they have strained the city’s infrastructure for three straight workdays, forcing commuters to choose whether to venture outside and risk being caught up in clashes and tear gas. The protests started in June over an extradition bill that has since been withdrawn, and have morphed into broader demands for democracy and police accountability. Schools and universities have become flash points. A day after young demonstrators staged a fiery standoff against the police on the fringes of a university campus, classes were called off there on Wednesday for the remainder of the fall semester. Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.  Student demonstrators with umbrellas, masks, bricks and shields geared up on Wednesday at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a campus that has become a focal point of the confrontation between protesters and the police. CUHK also became one of at least two Hong Kong universities to announce that on-campus classes would be canceled for the remainder of the fall semester. The other, Hong Kong Baptist University, said in an email to students and staff that on-campus classes would be postponed or conducted online. At the fringes of the CUHK campus on Tuesday night, police officers in riot gear on the fringes fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas at demonstrators who set a giant blaze and threw gasoline bombs. The clash lasted for hours and left dozens injured. Student activists at CUHK and other universities say they are defending their campuses from police intrusion. The police assert that they have to stop demonstrators from blocking roads, throwing bricks or trying to disrupt rail services.  John Tse, a top police official, told reporters on Wednesday that the police force believed CUHK was being used as a “factory” to manufacture gasoline bombs, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons for use against officers.  “This necessitates police response and the use of force, including rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and tear gas for dispersal,” he said.  Since the protests began, the movement has been driven in large part by high school and university-age students. But until recently, campuses were a relative safe zone from violent clashes. John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary for security, defended the police on Wednesday. Universities were not meant to be “breeding grounds for violence,” he told reporters. “If someone sees violence and does not stop it, then that person becomes an accomplice.” The Education Bureau said on Wednesday morning that it was up to parents whether their children attended school, and that schools should keep their campuses open regardless. The statement immediately prompted criticism from unions on opposite sides of the city’s political spectrum. The bureau later said that all classes at Hong Kong kindergartens, primary and secondary schools would be suspended on Thursday. Large groups of riot police officers disrupted a rally in the city’s financial district around lunchtime on Wednesday, making multiple arrests and beating protesters with batons.  Many of the protesters were there to support the students who had been battling the police at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday. Office workers in suits and ties formed a human supply chain to move water and umbrellas to front-line protesters. When the police swooped in and started beating protesters, the crowd fought back, and a brawl erupted outside a luxury mall that houses an Apple store.  By early afternoon, the streets around the mall had the feel of a militarized zone, and were deserted except for a handful of officers, workers and tourists taking pictures. After the police retreated, protesters spent much of the afternoon sprinkling the financial district with stone-and-bamboo barricades. The police began clearing those barricades in the evening, crushing some with an armored vehicle. But in other parts of town, protesters set fires, built more barricades and clashed with officers into the night. The Chinese central government’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong condemned the flare-up of protest violence, warning in a statement issued online late Tuesday that months of protests had “pushed Hong Kong into an extremely dangerous place.” “This murderous conduct in broad daylight is brazen terrorism,” the office said of a man who was set alight by protesters on Tuesday. “This shows absolutely no bottom line in behavior, absolutely no humanity or morality, and absolutely no fear of the law.” The most likely scenario now is that the Hong Kong government will more broadly invoke the city’s emergency regulations ordinance, said Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semiofficial advisory body set up by Beijing.  The Hong Kong government invoked the colonial-era ordinance last month to ban face masks at public gatherings. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Lau said it might be used again to enact a curfew, although the question of how the police would enforce it remained unclear. “If people defy a curfew, do you use live ammunition to enforce it?” he said. “That is the decision to be made — the government is still very reluctant to do it.” The Hong Kong police said on Wednesday that some of the city’s marine police officers had been deployed to help evacuate mainland Chinese students who attend CUHK. China’s Communist Youth League, the youth division of the ruling Communist Party, offered the students seven days of free accommodation at its lodgings in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city that lies just over the border from Hong Kong. The protesters who clashed with the police outside the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday were angry over the police shooting of a young demonstrator at point-blank range on a street corner a day earlier. (He was in serious condition as of Tuesday.) The police force said it had arrested 142 people across Hong Kong on Tuesday, and that officers fired 1,567 rounds of tear gas, 1,312 rubber bullets and 380 bean bag rounds. Tensions had been building after the death last week of a student who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations. Many in the protest movement now see the student, Chow Tsz-lok, as a martyr. Hong Kong’s youth are angry over what they see as a steady erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule as well as the city’s sky-high cost of living. They also fear that their city’s unique culture and identity will be gradually subsumed by growing mainland Chinese influence. There were widespread transit disruptions across the Asian financial center Wednesday morning, marking the third straight day that protesters had impeded some of the city’s essential infrastructure. Tiffany May, Keith Bradsher, Ezra Cheung, Austin Ramzy, Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.']",There were severe public transit disruptions a day after demonstrators staged a fiery standoff against the police.
Saudi Anti-Extremist Force Names Feminists as a Target. Briefly.,2019-11-13,By Megan Specia,"['Saudi Arabia’s state security agency released a video last week on an official government Twitter account that listed feminism, homosexuality and atheism among ideologies that fell into the category of “extremism.”  “Extremism in all its forms is a societal scourge,” read the message that accompanied the video, posted to the account of the General Department for Counter Extremism, which showed animated depictions of a long list of views subject to punishment. But the clip and tweet were abruptly removed on Tuesday, and the agency in charge of the department and the broader leadership attempted to walk its message back. The video and its removal are the latest signs of complications as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, attempts to present a sweeping overhaul of the social system in a country whose authorities have been steeped in ultraconservative policies for decades. Prof. Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi anthropologist at the London School of Economics, said the incident was emblematic of the internal power struggles and of changes being imposed from on high that have been slow to filter down. “It’s just symptomatic of the confusion that is taking place in Saudi Arabia,” she said. “It’s like for centuries we wanted you to be pious, religious and we imposed every restriction on you — now we want you to be open and we want to lift all of the restrictions.” The notoriously repressive nation has long drawn condemnation for governing based on an austere interpretation of Islam that includes strict social codes. But since 2017, Prince Mohammed has moved to ease some social restrictions, introduce a more moderate form of Islam and diversify the oil-driven economy. A ban on female drivers was lifted, parts of the kingdom’s restrictive guardianship system were rolled back to give women more freedom, and efforts have been made to expand the entertainment and tourism sectors.  But crackdowns on dissent have continued, with scores of activists detained, including a number of prominent women’s rights activists. Reports from their families indicate that they have been subject to torture. There are still strict norms around social conduct, and allegations of rights abuses are rife. The country also found itself at the center of international outrage after the killing of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi by operatives linked to Prince Mohammed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi Presidency of State Security — which is made up of the kingdom’s counterterrorism and domestic intelligence services — issued a statement on Tuesday calling the content in the video shared on Twitter “inaccurate” and said it “contained many mistakes in defining extremism.”  The agency also denounced as “untrue” a report in a state-run outlet, Al Watan, which said that feminists could be jailed and flogged. The government-run Saudi Human Rights Commission also issued a statement confirming that “feminism was not criminalized in Saudi Arabia and that the kingdom accorded the greatest importance to women’s rights.”  But many have accused the Saudi government of hypocrisy for denouncing the video while keeping women’s rights activists behind bars.  Iyad el-Baghdadi, a pro-democracy activist and vocal critic of Prince Mohammed, asked in a tweet: “If women’s rights are so important, why are Saudi Arabia’s top women’s rights activists in prison?” Professor al-Rasheed said that although it was nearly impossible to know why the initial video was so out of line with the later statement, the law could have been presented to offer an explanation for the harsh treatment of detained women’s rights activists. Loujain al-Hathloul and Aziza al-Yousef are among the women imprisoned over their activism. They are said to have been tortured and subjected to physical and sexual violence, and Professor al-Rasheed suggested that the video could be a way to justify their treatment.  Professor al-Rasheed disagreed with widespread speculation that the video had been removed because of international pressure, saying the reversal was more likely to be a sign of a bureaucratic rift.  “It’s about a confusion. It’s about forces in the government service who may be there to embarrass him. It’s not about the outside world making a big fuss about it,” she said. “I think it’s a serious problem symptomatic of perhaps a fomenting dissent against Mohammed bin Salman.” In a statement after the removal of the video, the security agency blamed a single person who prepared and published the video, saying he had “acted wrongly and on his own behalf.” “The person was brought in for investigation, and steps were taken to deal with the social media hierarchy in order to ensure that such mistakes were not made again,” the agency said. The initial article from Al Watan outlining punishments for feminists has also been removed.  But few believe the video and report could have been created and published without the knowledge of more senior figures in the government, and rights groups say the publication of the video showed an undercurrent of intolerance in Saudi Arabia.  Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa director, called the video “outrageous” in a statement on Tuesday.  “This announcement is extremely dangerous and has serious implications for the rights to freedom of expression and life, liberty and security in the country,” Ms. Morayef said. “It peels away the veneer of progress under Mohammed bin Salman and reveals the Kingdom’s true intolerant face which criminalizes people’s identities, as well as progressive and reformist thoughts and ideas at home.”']","The appearance and disappearance of an inflammatory official video is likely to reflect divisions within the government, experts said.

"Denmark, Worried About Bombings by Swedish Gangs, Begins Border Checks",2019-11-13,By Martin Selsoe Sorensen,"['COPENHAGEN — More than 60 years of hassle-free travel from Sweden to Denmark has ended after the Danish authorities, struggling to quell a wave of bombings blamed on Swedish gangs, introduced passport checks for the first time since the 1950s.  The measures put in place on Tuesday are temporary and will be applied intermittently, but the Danish police said that most travelers should carry passports or national identification cards. Only air travelers from Sweden will be exempted. “To counter the threat from serious, cross-border crime, we are enforcing the protection of the border with Sweden,” the Danish minister of justice, Nick Haekkerup, said in a statement last month. Sweden has had border checks on travelers from Denmark since 2016. But the Danish passport checks come as its neighbor has been rocked by more than 100 explosions in the first 10 months of this year. Officials have blamed the blasts — up from 39 at the same time last year — on criminal gangs. The explosions have spread to Denmark, where at least 13 have occurred in Copenhagen this year, although the police have not linked them all to Sweden. In August, a bomb blew up the Danish tax authority in Copenhagen, causing substantial damage. No one was wounded, but two Swedes are in police custody on suspicion of carrying out the late-night attack. No one has died this year in the wave of bombings in the two countries, but the situation is highly unusual, not only for Sweden and Denmark, but also in comparison with the rest of the Western world during peacetime, according to Amir Rostami, a criminologist. “Unfortunately, we must look to war zones for something similar,” Mr. Rostami, an academic at Stockholm University, told Dagens Nyheter, a Swedish daily. To cope with the rising number of explosions, the Swedish police have bolstered their bomb squad. “During 2019, we’ve been at a level we’ve never seen before, and right now it’s constant,” the national bomb squad’s chief of operations, Jon Wahlander, told Swedish state television. “Almost every day, we’re responding to various incidents either of explosions or with relation to explosions.” The Danish police say they are also concerned about other crimes linked to Sweden: They have charged a Swede in connection with the killing of two other Swedes near Copenhagen in June. Last month, the police in Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, charged a 28-year-old man with gang ties in connection with two explosions in December 2018, the news site svt.se reported. Two other men where also charged in other explosions. One of them, an 18-year-old, apparently fell victim to his own device when it went off in his Malmo home, leaving him with life-threatening injuries. Some of the explosions were caused by grenades made for military purposes and smuggled in to supply gangs that have become more and more at ease with using extreme violence to reach their goals, experts said. Other devices are homemade, using everyday items such as thermos flasks, but strike with cruel precision.  In September, a 23-year-old woman in Lund, a university town in southern Sweden, suffered severe injuries to her face after a bomb went off in front of a shop as she was passing. Denmark and Sweden scrapped passport checks in 1958 to allow seamless passage between the two Scandinavian kingdoms. (Both countries are part of the visa-free Schengen zone, made up of 26 European countries that allow free and unrestricted movement of people.) The Scandinavian countries have similar political systems and related languages, and share a sometimes war-torn past. As well as a bridge, Denmark and Sweden are also joined by four ferry routes. Those connections will be subjected to the new border checks.  “We’re targeting organized crime, and it’s the aim that the border control’s effect on ordinary travelers is as minimal as possible,” the Danish national police director, Lene Frank, said in a statement. Experts argue that intermittent checks are unlikely to either stop criminals or deter them from entering Denmark, since the risk of being caught among the tens of thousands of law-abiding travelers every day is minimal. In response to the criticism, the Danish government pointed to a package of measures making its way through Parliament. They include allowing more CCTV in public places, increasing the monitoring of known criminals and heavier punishment for the illegal use and possession of explosives. Denmark has introduced temporary border controls before.

A 9-Year-Old Is About to Get a University Degree. He Has #Giganticplans.,2019-11-15,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — He doesn’t play chess or any musical instruments. But he loves Fortnite and Minecraft and watches Netflix. Soon, Laurent Simons, 9, of Belgium will become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university. For this, his teachers and others have called him a genius. He simply says, “I’m quite lazy.” That’s because he’s not into sports.  “A lot of people have stereotypes about young geniuses,” his father, Alexander, a dentist, said in a phone interview on Friday. That’s because the world has long been fascinated by prodigies celebrated for their ability to master an instrument, graduate at a young age or achieve outstanding sports performances.  Mozart composed music at age 5.  Picasso was 9 years old when he made his first painting. But in an era when social media carries a certain cachet and influencers make gobs of money posing with products, Laurent is not your typical child prodigy. He’s into Instagram, for one. And as of Friday, he had more than 13,000 followers. Laurent, who was born in Ostende, Belgium, studies electrical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. He entered when he was 8 and is set to complete a three-year program in 10 months. If all goes well and he completes his final project — about a brain-connected electrical chip — he will walk out a graduate in December. “Then, I want to study medicine, and do a Ph.D. and make artificial organs,” he said. Laurent grew up in Belgium with his grandparents while his parents worked in the Netherlands. He started primary school when he was 4, and went to high school at 6, according to his father. He now lives with his parents in Amsterdam. “His grandparents always taught us he’s very special,” Alexander Simons said about his son. “We thought they were taking him too seriously.” Now, he and his wife do, too. And Laurent’s teachers at the university say they were blown away.  “Laurent’s absorption capacity is very high, which means that everything goes much faster and we can cover a lot more material in a short span of time,” said Peter Baltus, a professor of integrated electronics at the university who is the boy’s mentor. “It’s been quite special and enjoyable.” Mr. Baltus  confirmed that Laurent was on track to graduate before the end of the year. Outside of school, Mr. Simons argued, Laurent was like any child of his age: playing video games on his smartphone and sometimes taking a swim. On the other hand, he watches TV series like “The Blacklist,” and his I.Q. is 145, his father said.  It’s fair to say that his parents have helped turn their son into a mini-celebrity, making him available for scores of interviews and organizing news conferences. In the age of instant fame, young bright minds on social media platforms do not go unnoticed for too long. On Laurent’s Instagram account, a photo shows him sitting in front of a television crew. The caption, “Busy Week With Interviews!!” The hashtags #laurentsimons and #giganticplans followed. Other photos show him by a pool next to women wearing bikinis, with former Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium and flanked by his grandparents. Asked about the adult themes displayed on the account created under his son’s name, Mr. Simons said the parents managed the account. The posts echo those of other accounts of young celebrities whose parents direct their presence — and fame — online. (A video posted this week by the parents of a 9-year-old British drummer playing Nirvana has been viewed more than seven million times.) Far from electronic chips or scientific labs, Laurent’s posts also show him bobbing in swimming pools or with friends.  For his next chapter, he said, he would like to study in the United States. Asked which university he would like to attend, his father interrupted and said it was “confidential.”  “We’d like to study half time in Europe and half time in the United States,” Mr. Simons said. “So Laurent is not too far from us.” During the interview, Laurent was a typical 9-year-old, giving short or monosyllabic answers. But he did explain why he wanted to create artificial hearts in the future — in his teenage years.  The grandparents he grew up with have heart conditions. “I’d like to help people like them,” he said. Alain Delaquérière contributed research.']",Laurent Simons of Belgium wants to make artificial hearts. He also loves Fortnite and has thousands of followers on Instagram.
"Iraqi Protesters Cheer Victory Over Iran, at Least on the Soccer Field",2019-11-14,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The protesters massed and shouted against Iran again on Thursday in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square and elsewhere, much as they have done over the past six weeks. But this time they were shouting with euphoria.  Their national soccer team outscored Iran 2-1 in a World Cup qualifying match.  The police, who in other circumstances might be looking tense, joined in the celebrations, as did Iraq’s senior leaders. Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mehdi even ordered giant screens erected in main squares around the country so Iraqis could watch the game, televised live from neighboring Jordan. “All Iraqis are waiting for you to produce amazing results and support your efforts to win and bring joy to the hearts of all Iraqis,” Mr. Mehdi told the head of Iraq’s soccer association before the game.  Regardless of how Iraqi politicians view Iran, when it comes to soccer, they are 100 percent pro-Iraq.  Cheers, fireworks and drumming thundered throughout Baghdad at the final score, giving protesters a cathartic moment of triumph over Iran, which many see as having manipulated Iraq’s political system and bested Iraq economically. It was a moment of union for a country that again seems at risk of fracturing. After Iraq scored the second time, Jassim Al Tamimi, a Baghdad bookstore owner, was almost shouting with excitement.  “This is a gift from God telling us that you will get your rights and we will not remain the same, we will not remain slaves for other states,” he said. The demonstrations that have shaken Iraq for nearly two months paused at dusk as the police, protesters and politicians took off two hours to watch the game.  It has been a tense period between the two countries. The heart of the protesters’ demands is the ouster of the Iraqi government leadership, which they view as having been installed by Iran. They also are calling for an end to political parties, which they see as overly influenced by neighboring countries, and for early elections to replace the Parliament, which they view as corrupt.  “Out, Out Iran! Baghdad Free, Free!” is a common chant.  Iraqi soccer fans who went to watch the game in Iran were recorded on video cursing Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, who has been in Iraq recently discussing the Iraqi government’s response to the protests. General Soleimani is viewed as instrumental in putting in place the current Iraqi government.  Large demonstrations were expected to resume on Friday after the weekly prayer. But the elation on Thursday night was seen as a welcome respite from the violence and loss that have accompanied the protests. At least 320 people have been killed by the security forces, the vast majority of them protesters, and 15,000 wounded, according to the United Nations.  “The happiness is indescribable, as if we we’d won the World Cup.” said As’ad Farij, 32, a computer teacher. He predicted that the victory would give the anti-Iran demonstrations an adrenaline shot that would make the protests “much stronger.” Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, and Alissa J. Rubin from Paris.']",The police and the politicians joined protesters in celebrating Iraq’s defeat of Iran in a World Cup qualifying match. Tensions between the countries are running high. 
Venice Flooding Brings City to ‘Its Knees’,2019-11-13,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The mayor of Venice, who said that the city “was on its knees,” has called for a state of emergency and the closing of all schools after the Italian city was submerged under “acqua alta,” an exceptionally high tide — the highest in 50 years. Outdoor restaurant tables and chairs could be seen bobbing in the waters, and tourists were forced to clamber through the windows of high-end hotels as the water rose to about six feet before 11 p.m. on Tuesday. As dawn broke on Wednesday, the authorities began to survey the damage.  “I’ve seen things in San Marco I thought I’d never see,” Mayor Luigi Brugnaro of Venice told the Italian station Radio24. “It is a very difficult situation,” he added.  In a post on Twitter, the mayor blamed climate change for the city’s troubles and called for the rapid completion of a long-delayed barrier system.  Later, speaking at a news conference alongside national and local officials, the mayor said that the damage had been significant. “We’re talking hundreds of millions of euros,” he said. The flooding was the second highest in the city’s history, after the disastrous flood of 1966, which peaked at 6.3 feet. Last year, as severe weather in Italy killed 11 people, ferocious winds drove the high tide in Venice to more than five feet above average sea level.  Residents and tourists could be seen wading through water in rain boots. The water invaded the ground floors of many historic palazzos, stores, restaurants and hotels. At least three vaporetti, Venice’s public transportation boats, sank, Italian media reported. One floated over the banks that line the city’s canals, ending up perilously close to buildings. Famous tourist spots like St. Mark’s Square were under several feet of water by Wednesday. The crypt of St. Mark’s Basilica was flooded by more than three feet of water, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Almost exactly a year ago, after a violent storm had swept the city, concerns were raised about the basilica’s ability to withstand the effects of the changing climate, the growing number of days in which the city was under water, and the onslaught of tourists. “Venice is on its knees,” the mayor said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday with photos showing him walking through the basilica with the city’s principal prelate, the patriarch of Venice, Francesco Moraglia. At the news conference the mayor said that while wandering through the city, “I found people in tears because they had lost everything. If we don’t want the city to be abandoned, we have to give certain answers. It’s not just about quantifying the damages, but about the future of this city.” The patriarch of Venice echoed his sentiments.  “Going around the city we found desperate people, who said that a year ago they were in the same situation,” Msgr. Moraglia said. He added that the Diocese of Venice and Caritas, the Catholic charity, would provide lodgings for people who had been left homeless, giving priority to “fragile people in difficulty.” “I hope the message passes that the city has been wounded, and that it can’t be wounded each year in the same way,” the patriarch said. The newspaper Il Gazzettino, under a banner headline, “Acqua Alta. Fear and Anger in Venice,” described the city’s residents as “barricaded in their homes.” The home page of the city’s website bore no good news. More high water was expected in the coming days.  Italian news outlets reported that at least one man had died by electrocution while trying to pump water from his home in Pellestrina, an island that borders on the Venetian lagoon and forms a barrier against the Adriatic Sea. The body of another man was found in his home, according to local news outlets. Mr. Brugnaro said the situation in Pellestrina was critical because the water had overwhelmed sea walls. “We can’t get the pumps to work because they are underwater,” the mayor said. Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto Region, said that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte would arrive in the city shortly and spend the night. Venice has also long struggled with overtourism, as officials have tried to prevent colossal cruise ships from docking on the city’s main canal after a series of accidents involving vessels that came in too fast. In June, a cruise liner plowed into a smaller tour ship and a wharf on a canal in Venice, injuring four people and reigniting arguments about the dangers of allowing huge vessels to pass through the fragile lagoon city. Italy has also invested billions of euros in a flood-protection system known by the acronym MOSE, but its offshore underwater dams have yet to be completed. Though Venetian residents have gotten used to wading through flooded streets, strong winds on Tuesday coincided with the high tide, submerging the city. “Acqua alta has always been normal,” said Lorenzo Bonometto, an expert on lagoon ecology. But the combined high tide and strong winds made the result “an exceptional event,” he said. The frequency of acqua alta has become more troubling, experts say, and is linked to rising seawater levels, not only in Venice, but also around the world. Sea levels are rising “at a faster rate” than experts had expected, and that is having a greater impact on the lagoon city, Mr. Bonometto said. While flooding is a complex phenomenon with many causes, the effects of climate change on sea-level rise, and the intense rainfall that comes with the greater capacity of a warming atmosphere to hold more moisture, are increasingly recognized as factors that can boost natural variation in weather patterns. There is also the added fact that Venice is sinking. Luigi Cavaleri, an engineer at the Institute of Marine Sciences in Venice said the city’s subsidence and the rising sea levels meant that Venice was sinking at a rate of one-fifth of an inch a year. That means that the city will be submerged by water more frequently. Mr. Cavaleri said last year’s storm was a much more serious event, but noted, “Floods will continue.”  Had the flood system been operational, he said, “the city might have been spared. Hopefully, it will be for the next flood.”  Mr. Brugnaro, the mayor, said a completed MOSE project could have averted the disaster — it is scheduled to be operative from 2022 — but that flood barriers were just one element of a complex system. And other elements necessary for the health of the lagoon, such as for the navigability of the canal, were still incomplete. “We need resources and clear ideas,” he said. “For now, MOSE is a ghost. We want to see it finished.” John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.']","The mayor called for a state of emergency after the Italian city was submerged under “acqua alta,” an exceptionally high tide — the worst in 50 years."
"As Australia Burns, Its Leaders Trade Insults",2019-11-13,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — When a mass shooting shattered Australia in 1996, the country banned automatic weapons. In its first years of independence, it enacted a living-wage law. Stable retirement savings, national health care, affordable college education — Australia solved all these issues decades ago. But climate change is Australia’s labyrinth without an exit, where its pragmatism disappears. The wildfires that continued raging on Wednesday along the country’s eastern coast have revealed that the politics of climate in Australia resist even the severe pressure that comes from natural disaster. Instead of common-sense debate, there are culture war insults. The deputy prime minister calls people who care about climate change “raving inner-city lunatics.” Another top official suggests that supporting the Greens party can be fatal. And while the government is working to meet the immediate need — fighting fires, delivering assistance — citizens are left asking why more wasn’t done earlier as they demand solutions.   “We still don’t have an energy policy, we don’t have effective climate policy — it’s really very depressing,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, an associate professor at Griffith Law School. Australia is not the only country where the threat of climate change has largely produced inaction or failed promises. President Trump has done everything he can to erase the United States’ climate policy even as dangerous fires ravage California. Canada and South Korea are far from meeting their targets to cut emissions in line with Paris Agreement commitments. But in Australia, where coal is king and water is scarce, the country’s citizens have spent the week simmering with fear, shame and alarm. As a 500-mile stretch from Sydney to Byron Bay continued to face catastrophic fire conditions, with 80 separate blazes burning and at least four deaths reported, Australians have watched, awe-struck, as life-changing destruction has been met with political sniping.  Michael McCormack, the No. 2 official in the conservative government, kicked it off on Monday, telling listeners of the country’s most popular morning radio programs that fire victims needed assistance, not “the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies.” Barnaby Joyce, the government’s special envoy for drought assistance, followed up by suggesting that two people killed by fires near a town called Glen Innes over the weekend might have contributed to their own deaths if they supported the Greens. The victims’ neighbors called his comments “absolutely disgraceful.”  But a Greens party senator responded with his own outrage: He said the major parties were “no better than arsonists,” an insult carrying special weight for the world’s most arid inhabited continent.  “The higher the flames in the bush, the lower the politics,” blared a headline in The Sydney Morning Herald. While the latest conflict has flared as smoke fills the skies of Sydney, its roots go back years, maybe centuries. Even as the country’s emissions continue to soar, it’s been hard to reach a political consensus on energy and climate change policy because of Australia’s mining history and a powerful lobby for one product: coal. “Coal is our N.R.A.,” said Ms. Harris Rimmer, referring to the National Rifle Association, which has stymied changes to gun laws in the United States even as mass shootings have become shockingly common. “They have total control over Parliament.” The comparison has its limits. Coal is not enshrined in the Constitution, as a right to bear arms is in the United States, nor is it a consumer product. But like guns in America, coal helped define the country in its early years of settlement — and is still an outsize presence in Australian life.  The industry’s economic benefits reach fewer people than many Australians believe. It frequently hires federal lawmakers after they leave office, and even now politicians often defend coal in patriotic terms. For conservatives in particular, extraction of natural resources in rural areas is a stand-in for values worth fighting for against condescending urban elites. Just a few days before the fires, for example, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a mining group that new laws were needed to crack down on climate activists and progressives who “want to tell you where to live, what job you can have, what you can say and what you can think.” “Climate change has become a proxy for something else,” said Robyn Eckersley, a climate politics expert at the University of Melbourne.  What’s galling for many scientists is that the public wants the federal government to do more; polls consistently show that Australians see climate change as a major threat requiring aggressive intervention.  And the problems emerging now — fires, cyclones, heat waves, drought, shifts in sea life and the death of the Great Barrier Reef — have been predicted in the public record for years. In 2000, a Senate committee report criticized the government for a lack of action, stating that “Australia’s per capita emissions have shot to the highest in the world,” and making more than 100 recommendations for both reducing emissions and adapting to a more dangerous environment. “Australia will be very negatively affected by climate change given the size of its land mass,” the report says, “its long coastline, current extremes of climate, vulnerability to cyclones and the El Niño/La Niña cycle, existing problems with soil salinity, and its economic dependence on agriculture and tourism.” Fires have been a focus of in-depth reports since at least 2013, when the nonprofit Climate Council issued its first one: “Be Prepared: Climate Change the Australian Bushfire Threat.” Even firefighters, who scramble the class and urban-rural divide that the government often tries to exploit, have tried to tell officials that they need to confront the way that the changing climate supercharges the already dangerous threat of fires.  “We’ve seen these incidents becoming larger and more intense,” said Leighton Drury, a fire union official in New South Wales. “It would be very silly for any politician or any leader to keep their head in the ground and say we don’t need to do anything here.” Nonetheless, for now, that is what the government is doing. Mr. Morrison, who in the past has made it clear that Australia’s economic prosperity comes first, has repeatedly argued in recent days that now is not the time to discuss climate policy or politics. Photographed hugging fire victims, he has sought to focus on emotional and financial support. Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and author, said that “it wastes the opportunity to explain to the Australian public what we’re seeing in climate extremes.” Unfortunately, more opportunities are on the way. Strong winds and high temperatures are predicted for this weekend, leading fire officials to warn that the blazes already burning will spread, while new conflagrations will produce more demands for help. The pressure on the Australian government to do for the climate what it’s done for other policy problems will only grow with the flames.  Isabella Kwai and Jamie Tarabay contributed reporting.']",The country has long been a model for common-sense public policy. But this week’s fires have revealed once again that its pragmatism stops at climate change.
"Facing a Pollution Crisis, Netherlands Tells Drivers to Slow Down",2019-11-14,By Richard Pérez-Peña and Claire Moses,"['The Dutch government has announced a sharp cut in highway speed limits and changes in farming practices, as it struggles to address a pollution problem that threatens to become an economic and political crisis. The Netherlands’ top administrative court ruled in May that the country was in violation of European Union pollution laws, a finding that threatened to block thousands of construction and farming projects, which could bring much of the economy to a standstill. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Wednesday that his government’s plan to address the problem would include a reduction in the daytime speed limit to 100 kilometers per hour from 130 k.p.h., or to 62 miles per hour from 81 m.p.h. The limit will not change at night because fewer drivers are on the road. The modification will go into effect as soon as possible, Mr. Rutte said, and he gave no indication of when — or even whether — it might expire. “It’s a rotten measure, nobody likes it,” Mr. Rutte said at a news conference. “But something of larger importance is at play here. It’s necessary to prevent that the Netherlands shuts down and also, especially, to prevent that jobs will be lost unnecessarily.” The changes are a serious concession for the prime minister and his center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, which has pursued higher speed limits, pro-business policies and major construction projects. The pollutants in question are nitrogen compounds — major components of air, water and soil contamination — that result from tailpipe emissions, but the primary source of them is livestock waste. In addition to the speed reductions, Mr. Rutte announced changes in the feed given to farm animals and an increase of 60 million euros, about $66 million, in subsidies for pig farmers, to reduce nitrogen output. After some lawmakers recently raised the idea of imposing cutbacks on raising pigs and chickens in the Netherlands, farmers drove their tractors into The Hague in protest, severely disrupting traffic for days. It was not clear whether the changes announced on Wednesday would move the Netherlands into compliance with the pollution rules. Mr. Rutte said he would seek the passage of an emergency law to allow vital infrastructure projects, like strengthening the dikes that shield much of the low-lying country from flooding. He described the pollution issue as the most difficult he had faced in nine years as prime minister — even tougher than “the refugee crisis of 2015-2016 in its complexity and how to handle this,” he said.']","The government lowered the daytime speed limit on Dutch highways, to 62 miles per hour, in an attempt to cut nitrogen pollution."
Germany Mandates Measles Vaccine,2019-11-14,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Parents in Germany must vaccinate their children against measles or face fines of several thousand euros under a law passed on Thursday that aims to stop the spread of a disease that has returned in recent years after decades of decline. The law, which is to take effect from March next year, will require all children seeking to attend preschool to prove that they have been immunized or risk losing their placement. Children aged 6 and older, who are required by law to attend school, must also show proof of having received a vaccine. Health officials in Germany have recorded 501 cases of measles this year, despite the existence of vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective. According to the World Health Organization, outbreaks of the disease have increased in recent years across the globe, including in developed countries where it had largely been eradicated.  In an address to Parliament before the vote in favor of the law, Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, called measles an “unnecessary risk” and rejected criticism that the measure infringed on individual rights.  “My understanding of freedom does not stop at my level as an individual,” Mr. Spahn said. “It is also a question of whether I am unnecessarily putting others at risk.”  “Freedom also means that I will not be unnecessarily put at risk and that is precisely why, from the point of view of preserving freedom, this law is a good law, because it protects freedom and health,” he added. Under the law, immunizations will also be required for adults born after 1970 who work with children in public institutions, such as day care centers, schools or hospitals. Exceptions will only be allowed for medical reasons and only a doctor can grant them. Older children already in school will have until July 31, 2021, to prove that they have been vaccinated. Schools and other public institutions will have to report parents who refuse to immunize their children to local health authorities, which will then be authorized to take action on a case-by-case basis.  In extreme cases, parents could face fines of up to 2,500 euros, or about $2,750, for failing to comply. Globally, the measles vaccine is estimated to have saved 21 million lives between 2000 and 2017, according to data cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. But there are still more than seven million cases and 100,000 deaths a year, the agency noted, many in developing countries where people lack access to the vaccine. Most who die are children younger than 5. Even in developed countries, outbreaks have flared up in recent years as a growing number of parents have refused vaccination. Some claim religious reasons, and some mistakenly fear a link to autism, based on research that has been discredited as fraudulent. In the first half of this year, the number of measles cases across Europe reached about 90,000, double the total in the same period in 2018, the World Health Organization said in August. Albania, Britain, the Czech Republic and Greece, which had declared measles eliminated, joined 12 other nations — including France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia — where the disease is now considered by the organization to be endemic. Even in European countries where vaccination against measles is already required, including Bulgaria, France, Italy, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the number of cases has been on the rise. The disease has also been resurgent in the United States, with 1,261 individual cases of measles confirmed in 31 states so far in 2019, the C.D.C. reported this month. A measles vaccination involves two injections, the first usually given when children are 1 year old and the second when they are 4. The same shots (commonly referred to as the M.M.R. vaccine) include protection against mumps and rubella, and a newer version also protects against chickenpox.']","All children attending preschool or higher in the country must be immunized, with fines for parents who do not comply, under a law that is to take effect next spring."
South Korea Stops Stream of Blood From Culled Pigs,2019-11-13,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said on Wednesday that it had successfully stopped a stream of red blood from tens of thousands of pigs possibly infected with African swine fever from reaching a river that provides drinking water for much of the population north of Seoul. Residents living in towns between Seoul and South Korea’s border with North Korea were alarmed early this week when the local news media reported that a small stream had turned red in Yeoncheon, a county that borders North Korea. It turned out that the blood came from 47,000 pig carcasses waiting on trucks to be buried. The animals were the last of the 160,000 hogs that the county authorities had culled to stop the spread of African swine fever, a highly contagious disease incurable for infected pigs but not dangerous to humans. The carcasses were decaying and oozing with blood on the trucks because of a shortage of plastic burial containers when rain hit the area on Sunday. A stream there turned red with blood, raising fears that the blood might contaminate the Imjin River, which is 10 miles downstream and provides drinking water for many towns north of Seoul. Officials built dikes and used pumps to stop the contaminated water from flowing downstream, while some towns downstream stopped pumping drinking water from the Imjin River. On Wednesday, Environment Ministry officials said tests showed that the blood did not contaminate the river, and towns began pumping drinking water from it again. African swine fever has been sweeping across Asia and Europe, devastating hog farmers. South Korea has slaughtered 410,000 pigs, all of them in towns north and west of Seoul, since the outbreak was first reported in mid-September at a farm near the border with North Korea. South Korean officials suspected that the deadly animal disease may have been spread to South Korea from North Korea by wild boars across the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. North Korea reported its first outbreak of the disease in May at a farm near its border with China. South Korea’s last and 14th pig farm infected with the disease was reported on Oct. 9, but its battle against the outbreak has not stopped, since wild boars are still being found with the virus. The country has employed military snipers and civilian hunters, as well as drones, to track and kill wild boars near the North Korean border.']",Towns near the border with North Korea were alarmed when a stream turned red after pigs were culled over fear of African swine fever.
Refugee and Author Detained by Australia Is Given Visa to Travel,2019-11-14,By Megan Specia,"['A Kurdish-Iranian refugee and award-winning writer who was held by Australia for years at a detention center on a remote Pacific island arrived in New Zealand late Thursday, after becoming a cause célèbre for rights activists.  The refugee, Behrouz Boochani, 35, who became a prominent voice for the hundreds of people exiled on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, as part of Australia’s controversial detention program, received permission to leave for the first time in years. The Australian government has paid neighboring countries to detain hundreds of asylum seekers and other refugees who arrive by sea. This is the first time Mr. Boochani has been granted permission to leave Papua New Guinea since his detention began in 2013, after he was given a visitor visa to enter New Zealand to speak at the WORD Christchurch literary festival on Nov. 29. He was held in a detention center on Manus Island until it closed in 2017, and he was then moved to another part of Papua New Guinea. It is not clear what his status will be after the festival, although he has vowed never to return to Papua New Guinea. “So exciting to get freedom after more than six years,” Mr. Boochani said on Twitter on his arrival at Auckland Airport late on Thursday night. “Thank you,” he added, “to all the friends who made this happen.” Mr. Boochani, who worked as a journalist with the Kurdish-language magazine Werya, fled Iran in 2013 after officials raided his office. He traveled to Indonesia and tried to reach Australia by boat, where he planned to seek asylum. But he was intercepted by the authorities. After being moved to a remote detention camp on Manus Island, he documented rights abuses against the hundreds of asylum seekers held alongside him on Manus Island, where he has spent the last six years, and those on the tiny island nation of Nauru. Many of the detainees were from the Middle East and Africa and were seeking refugee status.  Mr. Boochani’s writings raised awareness of the situation on the island, which was largely closed off to international journalists and rights groups. He wrote of daily life on the island, posting updates on social media about squalid conditions at the camp and the suicides and self-harm that became commonplace among the detainees. He revealed inadequate access to heath care, deteriorating facilities and desperation among the men housed there.  He shared details about Manus in 2017 with The New York Times after President Trump walked back promises made by President Barack Obama to relocate all detainees who had received refugee status to the United States. His work was also published by numerous local and international outlets.  “We are under such pressure and a hard situation,” he said at the time. “We cannot go back, and we are still here.”  Working with a translator for five years via messages in Farsi over WhatsApp, he wrote a book, “No Friend but the Mountains,” for which he won the 2019 Victorian Prize for Literature. The prestigious Australian award, selected from a short list of winners in other categories, comes with an award of 125,000 Australian dollars, or about $90,000. He has also won the New South Wales Premier’s Award, the Australian Book Industry Award for nonfiction and the National Biography Award. Human rights groups have long denounced Australia’s policy of detaining migrants and asylum seekers in offshore detention centers like the one on Manus, but the government has maintained that it is necessary to deter those arriving in the country by illegal means.   Australia closed the center on Manus Island in 2017 and moved some of the asylum seekers. Others who received official refugee status have been resettled in the United States, but hundreds remain in limbo on the island.  The Australian government said last month that 562 refugees and asylum seekers remain in Papua New Guinea and on Nauru. Meg de Ronde, the executive director of Amnesty New Zealand, which was involved in obtaining a visitor visa for Mr. Boochani to attend the literary festival, said on Twitter that it was a “life & career highlight to be a small part” of his arrival. In an earlier statement, Ms. de Ronde said, “This is a spark of hope after he has fled violence and persecution, first in Iran and then from Australian authorities.” On Thursday, the organizers of the festival released a statement on Mr. Boochani’s behalf. In it, he said he would continue to speak out against the Australian offshore detention system, “which is designed to deter refugees from seeking asylum and, ultimately, has caused grave harm and torture.”  He also said he would ask the government of New Zealand to aid those who remained in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations rights chief, recently spoke out about Australia’s migration and asylum policies in a speech at the Whitlam Institute in Sydney.  “I have a number of serious concerns about migration and asylum policies in this country, including the so-called offshore processing regime and prolonged mandatory detention of refugees and asylum seekers,” she said. Ms. Bachelet added that she feared the public narrative in Australia about migration and asylum “has become weaponized by misinformation and discriminatory and even racist attitudes.”']","Behrouz Boochani, who was held for years as part of Australia’s offshore immigration detention program, arrived in New Zealand for a literary festival."
Experts Divided on Authenticity of Islamic State Receipts,2019-11-14,By Rukmini Callimachi,"['Questions have been raised about documents that seemed to indicate that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was able to hide out in a hostile area of northwestern Syria because ISIS paid members of a rival jihadist group. An independent Syria researcher, Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, said he believed that the documents, which were central to an article published in The New York Times on Oct. 30, had been forged. The documents were provided to The Times by Asaad Almohammad, a retired American intelligence operative who is now a senior research fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism. They purport to be receipts for payments made by the security branch of the Islamic State to members of Hurras al Din, a Syrian jihadist group known to be an enemy of ISIS. The receipts showed that the payments were for services like security and logistical expenses. After The Times published its article, Mr. Almohammad published a report that also cited the receipts. He said he stood by their authenticity. Mr. al-Tamimi, who had been asked by The Times to review four of the receipts, was cited in the article as vouching for their authenticity.  He has since reviewed all eight receipts and now says he believes they are forgeries. He concluded that although the receipts appear to be printed on original ISIS stationery, the handwritten information on them was most likely not authentic. He noted that several of the receipts are dated in 2017, before Hurras al Din was known to have existed. He said part of receipts showing the location of the ISIS branch was whited out, raising questions about their provenance. And he said that a similarity in the handwriting on receipts that purport to have been written by two different people suggests they were written by the same person. “Unfortunately, this only leads me to the conclusion that they are not authentic,” Mr. al-Tamimi said. Mr. Almohammad disagreed. He said that his conclusions are supported not only by the receipts but by interviews with informers in Syria over a 16-month period. His research found that ISIS made a concerted effort to co-opt the rival group, Hurras al Din, starting in January 2017, more than a year before the group announced its formation. Mr. Almohammad argued that had someone gone to the trouble of forging receipts, he would have been unlikely to date them before the time when Hurras al Din made that announcement. That date is readily available online. He also rejected the assessment regarding the whited-out material on the receipts. The documents were retrieved by two different people in Syria who did not know each other, he said. “A forger could have kept the original names or added new ones,” he said. “Scrubbing the original is hardly a smart thing to do for a forger.” As for the similarity in handwriting, Mr. Almohammad said all eight receipts had been issued under the same nom de guerre, which most likely belonged to the ISIS official charged with dispensing the funds. It is possible, he said, that the official filled out the entire receipt, including the portions attributed to the other signatories. “Taken altogether, I have assessed that given the format, style, timing and sources, the receipts are highly likely to be authentic,” Mr. Almohammad said. “Of course, you can never claim 100 percent verification without the signatories confirming, and even then questions will remain. This is the nature of this work.” Mr. al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader, was living in a zone where Hurras al Din operates, in Idlib Province, as far back as July, according to American officials. He died at his compound there last month during a raid by American Special Operations forces.']",A Times article based on documents recovered by a researcher reported that ISIS made payments to members of a rival group.
"India, Choking on Toxic Air, Tries Something New: An Oxygen Bar",2019-11-15,By Suhasini Raj and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — As air pollution shot up to dangerous levels across India on Friday, underscoring an already dire public health crisis, a crowd descended on a small shop in New Delhi for a novel solution: a 15-minute hit of clean oxygen. At Oxy Pure, a self-styled  “oxygen bar,” customers strapped tubes to their noses and inhaled scents of lavender, lemongrass or spearmint. In the absence of other options, Lisa Dwivedi, a Ukrainian living in the city, said she came to the bar because she was fed up with having itchy eyes, a runny nose and a swollen throat. “I don’t know if it’s psychological, but it makes me feel good to know I am inhaling pure oxygen, if only for 15 minutes,” she said. The air pollution crisis in India has become so severe that officials in the capital declared a public health emergency earlier this month, when levels of deadly particulate matter rose a few dozen times above what the World Health Organization considers safe. Doctors are reporting a surge of patients with severe respiratory problems. This week, New Delhi’s government shut all primary schools for a second time this month because of pollution in the capital region, home to more than 46 million people. But despite air so scary it may be causing brain damage in children, some central government officials have either resisted acknowledging the problem, which has persisted in India for years, or minimized its severity. During an especially poisonous day, when levels of PM 2.5, tiny, cancer-linked particulate matter, rose to some 60 times the safe limit in parts of the capital, Harsh Vardhan, India’s health minister, recommended eating carrots to fight any harmful effects. Another senior lawmaker criticized those who tried to stop farmers from burning their crops, and instead suggested praying to the Hindu god of rain for relief.  So far this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from publicly commenting on the air pollution. His office recently set up a panel to look into it, but a high-level parliamentary meeting on Friday about the pollution was canceled because hardly any officials showed up, according to Indian news outlets. “People are dying and it cannot happen in a civilized country,” a bench of Supreme Court judges said this month about the pollution. “We will not tolerate this. We are making a mockery of everything.” With no imminent solutions, some Indians have tried to step in — with solutions like the oxygen bar. As winds slow during winter months and farmers burn crops to make room for a new harvest, dirty air settles over India’s cities, mixing with construction dust, power plant emissions and fumes from people bursting fireworks to celebrate festivals. Many Indians have become fatalistic about the government taking tougher steps to clean the air, if they even know how dangerous it has become.  Without consistent and strong public messaging, pollution masks are still uncommon in India and those who wear them are sometimes laughed at. This month, people waded into the capital’s stretch of the Yamuna River, which is largely untreated sewage, to wash, clean utensils and take selfies with icebergs of foam formed by industrial waste.  On Thursday, despite the second government shutdown of schools, which lasted from Thursday to Friday, a nonprofit organization sponsored an outdoor run for children. Hundreds of people participated and event banners bore the logo for the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India. During parts of November, officials in New Delhi have tried to lessen the pollution by restricting the use of private vehicles on alternating days, allowing only cars with odd-number license plates to drive on odd dates and cars with even-numbered plates on even-numbered dates. But efforts like this one appeared to have a marginal effect in improving the air, which remained “severe” throughout the capital this week, according to data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.  For Indians worried about the air, options have largely been restricted to buying purifiers, sealing cracks in their homes with blankets and towels, or leaving toxic cities entirely. India’s poorest residents have no choice but to sleep outside in the fog. At Oxy Pure, which is in Select Citywalk, a more upscale mall in New Delhi, customers pay $4 to $6 for 15 minutes of oxygen carried through a nasal cannula. They can choose among seven scents — including eucalyptus, peppermint and cinnamon. Oxy Pure has introduced a “pollution special”: five sessions for the price of four. The owner, Aryavir Kumar, who originally worked as a hotelier, said he did not make a profit from the business, which opened in May. But he plans to open locations in the capital’s airport, and in the cities of Mumbai and Bangalore. “Customers say, ‘Now we have to buy fresh air?’” he said in an interview. “I tell them, ‘Do you not also pay for a bottle of clean drinking water, something you did not do 20 years ago?’”  On Friday morning, Vikram Aiyer, 25, a clean shaven business executive, stopped in to the small store, with its floor-to-ceiling garden installation, water fountains and a replica of a Van Gogh painting, before going to work as a salesman.  He chose eucalyptus as his scent and an attendant in a white lab coat fitted his nostrils with tubes attached to a beaker containing a green liquid. Mr. Aiyer sat in a leathery chair and took a deep breath. “The thought of unadulterated oxygen pumps up my flagging morale in this city,” he said, closing his eyes and exhaling.']","As top officials remain silent, the country’s pollution levels remained hazardous this week, prompting a second closure of schools in the capital and a sometimes desperate search for clean air."
German Lawmakers Oust Committee Chair Over Remarks Seen as Anti-Semitic,2019-11-13,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — After a far-right lawmaker accused Germany’s president of “eroding” the rule of law and circulated remarks widely viewed as anti-Semitic, his colleagues on Wednesday ousted him as chair of a parliamentary committee on the grounds that he was unfit for office.  The decision to remove Stephan Brandner, a member of the Alternative for Germany party, from his post was the first such move in the nation’s post-World War II history. It comes as the country’s mainstream parties are struggling with how best to handle the party amid a growing fear over the rise of radicalization in the country. The persistent popularity of the far-right party, known as the AfD, and its representation in state and municipal assemblies across the country, has forced traditional parties to debate whether to isolate it or cooperate with it. Mr. Brandner, who was chairman of the legal affairs committee in Parliament, provoked outrage among lawmakers when he reposted a comment on Twitter that questioned the outpouring of solidarity with Jews and Muslims that followed a neo-Nazi’s thwarted attack last month on a synagogue in Halle. The Twitter post asked why politicians were “hanging around synagogues and mosques,” when the two people who were killed were Germans — wording that the committee members said in a statement “assumed that Jews and Muslims can’t be Germans.” Although he apologized for circulating the remarks, Mr. Brandner refused to step down. On Wednesday lawmakers from the governing Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, along with those from the opposition Free Democrats, Greens and the Left party, voted unanimously to remove him from his post. “Brandner’s firing sends a clear signal against hate and harassment,” Jan-Marco Luczak, a member of the conservative Christian Democrats told reporters after the vote. “With it, we are finally returning the honor to this chair.” The AfD is not part of the governing coalition, but in the German system, some committee chairs are assigned to members of opposition parties, to balance the power of the majority. Even before Mr. Brandner took up his post, there had been concerns from legal and judicial associations about his ability to carry out the job. He rejected the suggestion that his actions had been out of line and accused the other committee members of trying to curb his right to free speech. “This is a further low point for parliamentary democracy in Germany,” he told reporters after the hearing. “Speak your mind once and whoops, you’ve lost your job.”  After a strong showing by the far right in last month’s election in the state of Thuringia left none of the traditional parties with a clear majority, members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives began urging their party to break its refusal to engage in any way with the AfD. The party’s leadership in Berlin quashed the suggestion, insisting that any cooperation with the far right would betray the party’s values and break an agreed-upon taboo.  A statement written by a Greens lawmaker, Manuela Rottmann, and supported by other members of the legal affairs committee declared that Mr. Brandner was “not qualified to lead this committee.” “With your comments, you are destroying the bridges of communication to citizens, to the Bar, to professional associations, religious organizations and civil society,” the statement read. “You are destroying every requirement that the chair of the legal affairs committee be able to accept a plural, open democracy.”  Before becoming a lawmaker in Berlin, Mr. Brandner had made a name for himself in his three years in the state legislature of Thuringia, where he racked up a record number of warnings and was once ordered out of the legislature. He was formally rebuked in Parliament for accusing President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of “eroding” the rule of law during a debate in May commemorating 70 years of the German Constitution.']","A member of the far-right Alternative for Germany party was removed as unfit for his post, a first for postwar Germany."
Economic Crisis Looms as Protests Rage in Lebanon,2019-11-15,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Banks across Lebanon have shut their doors this week to protect employees from angry customers demanding their dollars. So that anger has been redirected at the A.T.M.s outside, which are also refusing to give out dollars regardless of how much customers have in their accounts. “I want my dollars,” Sonia Badran, a mother of four married to an elevator repairman, said after her third failed trip to the bank this week. Until the country’s dollar crisis is resolved, she said, anti-government protests should continue. “Let them stay on the streets,” she said. “This is not acceptable.” After nearly a month of mass protests criticizing Lebanon’s political elite for corruption and mismanagement, the country’s long-term economic problems are increasingly colliding with the daily lives of its citizens. American dollars — long used in tandem with the Lebanese pound — have grown scarce because worries over the political turmoil have caused more people to try to withdraw their money. So employers have struggled to pay salaries, tenants to pay rent, and traders to pay for goods and services from abroad. Relief appears remote, analysts and economists say; the underlying problems have been building for so long that they can only be fixed through long-term policies that are likely to cause pain. And putting such initiatives in place would require a strong government, which Lebanon lacks. “The problem is that the current policies are unsustainable,” said Nasser Saidi, a former Lebanese economy minister. Putting the country on the right track would require simultaneously dealing with a large budget deficit and bringing down public debt — a gargantuan task. “You really don’t have much choice,” he said. “You are at the edge of the precipice and you are looking down, so unless you do that, where is this going to end?” Protests across Lebanon erupted on Oct. 17 after the government suggested it could raise revenue by taxing calls made through internet services like WhatsApp. For many Lebanese, it\xa0was insulting that the country’s leaders would try to use their calls to subsidize the state after decades of mismanagement and looting. Demonstrations have continued since in a movement that has remained largely leaderless, with demands ranging from economic reforms to trials for corrupt politicians to the complete ouster of the political elite. One month in, the protesters’ main victory was the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Oct. 29. On Friday, there was talk that the country’s leading political parties had agreed to nominate Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, as his successor. Mr. Safadi could begin trying to form a new government next week, Lebanon’s foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, told a local television station. But such processes often take month in Lebanon and it was not immediately clear how much backing Mr. Safadi had. Nor was it clear whether his appointment would assuage the protests. In many ways, the wealthy 75-year-old, who has extensive business ties to Saudi Arabia, is from the same class of leaders the protesters went into the streets to get rid of. Any new government that does not have buy-in from the protesters will struggle to put in place meaningful policies, said Michael Young, a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “Any government that doesn’t satisfy the public’s demands is going to start basically in a hole,” he said. “It will be a government that is opposed by the people and it will have little legitimacy to impose reforms.” In addition to calming the country’s immediate political crisis, any new government will have to deal with deep-rooted economic problems that have been brewing for years, finally leaving citizens unable to pull their own dollars out of the bank. For more than two decades, the Lebanese have simultaneously used American dollars and Lebanese pounds, an arrangement made possible by a central bank policy that kept the exchange rate fixed at about 1,500 pounds to the dollar. The two currencies were used so interchangeably in daily life that it was common to pay for a meal or taxi in one currency and receive change in the other, or in a combination of both. But maintaining that rate required continually bringing new dollars into the country, usually by enticing wealthy investors to make large dollar deposits for high interest rates, a strategy that some economists have compared to a Ponzi scheme. “In some sense, that is the definition of a Ponzi scheme, other than the fraudulent part,” said Dan Azzi, a former Lebanese bank executive and advanced leadership fellow at Harvard. The policy worked for a long time, but came under stress in recent years as the central bank had to honor the high interest rates it had promised while regional turbulence scared many new investors away. Over time, the gap between what investors had earned on paper and the real money in the central bank grew. “It is almost surreal what is happening,” Mr. Azzi said. “A virtual problem, a theoretical problem that has spilled out in the real world.” Now, the rising demand by both wealthy investors and middle-class bank customers for the limited number of dollars means that there are not enough to go around. That has already weakened the connection between the dollar and the Lebanese pound, whose value has declined on the black market, and undermined confidence in the banks. Even before the protests began last month, about $3 billion had been withdrawn from Lebanese banks, the central bank governor, Riad Salameh, told reporters this week. Another $2 billion was pulled out after banks reopened after the first two weeks of protests. Mr. Salameh insisted that deposits were safe and that no official limits had been placed on dollar withdrawals, but many banks have imposed unofficial limits that change frequently and are not publicly announced. Amid mounting anger over the limits, bank employees began an open strike on Tuesday, saying they needed protection from angry customers. While the banks have been closed, many have stopped dispensing dollars from A.T.M.s and placed new limits on debt and credit card transactions. It is unclear whether such practices are even legal, as there is no law authorizing them, said Karim Nammour, a lawyer with The Legal Agenda, an advocacy group. “We are completely dwelling in a situation without a legal basis,” he said. The inability to get dollars has caused a range of headaches for people who pay school fees or rent in dollars and for businesses that rely on dollars to pay for foreign goods or services.  Some foreign products have disappeared from supermarket shelves, and gas stations ran out of fuel recently until the government stepped in to make sure fuel traders could pay for imports. Elie Abyad, who owns a travel agency with six employees in Beirut, said he has struggled to keep his business going since all foreign plane tickets and hotel reservations must be made in dollars, which his local bank has limited his ability to use. He had tried getting cash from bank branches and A.T.M.s, to no avail, and had paid his employees half of their salaries in pounds since he could not get enough dollars. His customers, too, had their plans fouled up by the new regulations, since they cannot withdraw dollars to pay for foreign trips. Across the country, steady streams of citizens have been trying their luck at A.T.M.s to see if they can manage to get any dollars out — mostly in vain. After trying repeatedly — and ultimately failing — to get $300 of his own money from an A.T.M., Raymond Haddad, a retired official from Lebanon’s national lottery, said he had no way to pay the next installment on a computer for his son because the dealer would accept only dollars and his bank would give him only pounds. “They need to form a new government to get us out of this hole,” Mr. Haddad said. “But it needs to be a government that builds confidence, not just any government.” Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.']","After a monthlong political crisis, Lebanon faces an economic one, too, as the effects of long-term policies crash into citizens’ lives."
Hong Kong Colleges Become Besieged Citadels as Police Close In,2019-11-13,By Edward Wong and Ezra Cheung,"['HONG KONG — Seething with anger, the black-clad students hurled gasoline bombs, threw bricks and even aimed flaming arrows at the riot police, who answered with tear-gas volleys and rubber bullets that hurtled into Hong Kong’s university grounds for the first time. And with those battles on Monday and Tuesday at the territory’s largest universities, another unspoken rule in the antigovernment protests that have been convulsing Hong Kong for six months was shattered: the sanctity of educational campuses from the police.  The clashes turned what had been sanctuaries for the students at the core of the movement into scenes that evoked medieval citadels under siege.  They opened a new chapter that threatens to further disrupt the Asian financial capital, which has struggled for normalcy despite the increasingly violent protests against the Chinese Communist authorities in Beijing who have the last word over Hong Kong’s future.  Hong Kong has fallen into recession as tourists have fled and as its busy shopping areas become backdrops for street battles between demonstrators and police officers. The world is asking hard questions about what could befall Hong Kong as Beijing  further tightens control over a city that is supposed to operate under its own laws. [Why are people protesting in Hong Kong?] The most dramatic student-versus-police clash unfolded late Tuesday night at a barricaded bridge leading to the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For hours, police officers fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and students hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks, and practiced firing bows with flaming arrows. More than 100 injured students were brought to a makeshift first-aid clinic in a gym.  By targeting campuses, the police have breached the last refuge of the protesters, a move that brings the violence to the heart of the universities and invokes the pivotal and fraught role of student activism in the global history of democracy movements.  “One thing that people have realized is that the protests, the movement, the conflict, is unavoidable,” Gabriel Fung, a 19-year-old second-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said. “It’s going to reach you wherever you are at some point.” It is at these universities where young leaders and other students have been organizing revolts against the Chinese Communist Party and spreading the pro-democracy ideas that undergird the protests. And here, too, that the students discuss the wealth inequality and cultural homogenization that have led to visions of a bleak future among many of their generation.  In Hong Kong, university administrators and professors now find themselves in a difficult position, trying to preach tolerance and walk a tightrope of furious demands from students, the police and government officials. Two schools on Wednesday ended their semesters weeks early. “Not a single place in Hong Kong is exempt from the rule of law, and that includes universities,” John Lee, the secretary for security, said Wednesday at a news conference. “Universities are not supposed to be the breeding ground of violence.” The showdown has been brewing for years, going back to the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement of 2014. And the roots of the protests in many ways harken back to social movements elsewhere. On mainland China, students have led campaigns calling for sweeping political change, notably in 1919 and 1989. In the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, violence broke out on campuses during anti-Vietnam War protests, most horrifically at Kent State University in 1970, when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire on students, killing four and injuring nine. Student activists in Hong Kong have lived by an exhausting weekly rhythm since the movement began in early June: protest on weekends, show up on Mondays for class, study for exams and apply for internships or jobs in between it all. Many argue with parents who disagree with their politics or tactics. Hundreds have been arrested in recent months and quickly released by the police, as required by law. It was the death of a university student this month that set off the current round of protests and violence. Chow Tsz-lok, a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, sustained a fatal injury after falling from a parking garage near a police action on Nov. 4. Thousands attended candlelit memorial rallies last weekend, and his photograph is on posters and makeshift shrines all over campuses, since he is now a martyr for other students. Roiled by the latest unrest, universities canceled classes from Monday to Friday. That meant protesters have been able to hit the streets at dawn on weekdays after sleeping a few hours. On campus, activists have sprayed fresh graffiti, including phrases cursing administrators. The fraught situation led police officers on Wednesday to organize an evacuation of dozens of mainland Chinese students across the border to Shenzhen, where hotels offered them free rooms.  One graduate student at the University of Hong Kong said he and others from the mainland still felt safer on campuses than on the streets. He said many students do not openly express pro-Beijing opinions and sometimes avoid speaking loudly in Mandarin, the dominant language back home. (He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the tensions.)  Some university departments have delayed recruitment drives of mainland and foreign students to come up with new strategies; a drop-off in enrollment by mainland graduate students, who often pay full tuition, would lead to budget problems.  Hong Kong’s public universities, which have more than 86,000 undergraduate and nearly 11,000 graduate students, each have distinct characters. That means the students have occupied different roles in the movement, and the protests have played out in different ways on each campus. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, with 20,000 students, is considered the most radical campus. Most of its students are Cantonese-speaking locals, some of whom live nearby with their parents in dense apartment blocks. And the campus is high in the hills of Sha Tin, isolated from the city center, which is an hour’s ride away by subway. On Monday, the police arrested five students on the campus’s edge, administrators said. The next morning, the police, still at the border, confronted front line students, and clashes took place over 20 hours. Rocky S. Tuan, the president, who has been known for trying to engage with students during the movement, showed up during a lull in the evening to urge the students to be calm. “You all should know that I really want to help you. I will do everything within my capability,” he said. “It is the university’s responsibility to maintain peace on campus, not the police.” But as Mr. Tuan began walking away, the police fired tear gas. Mr. Tuan himself was enveloped in the gas. Students set fires to keep the police from advancing, and scores formed human chains to pass along bricks, umbrellas and bottled water to the front lines. Students sitting on one patch of road made gasoline bombs as if on an assembly line. “It was a savage move and a type of police violence when they tried to encroach on the university,” said Timothy Chow, 23, an engineering student who graduated in June. “This is why we have to protect our Chinese University of Hong Kong.” “When I saw our compatriots and Chinese University staff being hurt by the police, I felt particularly furious and wanted to come back to defend our university,” he added. At the University of Hong Kong this week, front-line students also set up barricades and, against the advice of professors, threw paving bricks off balconies, even though it is considered the most established of the territory’s schools.  Founded in 1911, it is the territory’s oldest university. Many of its students are foreigners or Hong Kong residents who attended international schools. English is the main language, and the university aims to open a mainland China campus. Among its alumni are many police commanders and Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive who is reviled by protesters. On Monday, the students were on edge in part because the police had taken a student from a dormitory area early that morning. Two liberal law professors, Hualing Fu and Johannes Chan, urged a group of front-line protesters in masks not to resort to violence and to understand that the struggle for democracy was a lifetime commitment, according to video footage. But one masked woman shouted they had no choice, and asked: “How many people are we going to sacrifice?” “We are better, we are different,” Mr. Fu said. “But we shall not forgive,” a young man shouted, “we shall not forget.”  On Monday and Tuesday mornings, police officers arrived at campus entrances to try to clear the barricades. They fired tear gas, but retreated. Students have called on the president, Xiang Zhang, to forcefully condemn the police, but he has refrained from doing so, and, unlike Mr. Tuan, rarely holds open forums. On occasion, professors have shown up at the front lines to speak to students, as William Hayward, dean of social sciences, did on Tuesday. “Obviously, as it goes on and as it gets more polarized, this becomes increasingly a challenge,” Mr. Hayward later said of student engagement. “Some of them do really open up, but at the same time, you know, of course they’re trying to figure out — is he on our side or is he trying to silence us?” As night fell on Tuesday, students traded shifts at the barricades, walking past a famous eight-meter statue of orange corpses, “The Pillar of Shame,” that memorializes the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students and workers around Tiananmen Square in Beijing by the Chinese government. Paul Mozur and Katherine Li contributed reporting.']","Police have begun raiding the edges of the biggest campuses to make arrests, leading student activists to engage with them in pitched battles that resemble medieval sieges."
"A Victim Not Only of Unjust Laws, but of ‘Unjust Authorities’",2019-11-15,By Aida Alami,"['RABAT, Morocco — When Hajar Raissouni, an investigative journalist with one of Morocco’s only independent news outlets, went to her doctor’s office last August seeking treatment for a vaginal hemorrhage, she was not planning on becoming the center of a national discussion on press freedom, abortion rights and what critics say is the nation’s antiquated penal code.  But on Aug. 31, minutes after she received the treatment, Ms. Raissouni and her fiancé, Rifaat al-Amin, were arrested — just two weeks before their wedding date. At first, she thought they were being robbed. But she quickly realized that the six men in plainclothes holding video cameras were police officers, and that she was being arrested because of her critical reporting on the Moroccan authorities. The couple would eventually be charged with sex outside of marriage and having an abortion, both crimes in the North African kingdom, though the abortion laws are rarely enforced. Ms. Raissouni, who strongly denies having had an abortion, says she was forced by the Moroccan authorities to undergo a pelvic examination that aggravated the hemorrhage, provoking renewed bleeding. Her physician, Dr. Jamal Belkeziz, a second doctor and an office assistant also were arrested, charged with violating abortion laws.  Their trial in September caused a sensation in Morocco, drawing crowds of supporters and protesters and unleashing a torrent of criticism from press freedom and abortion rights advocates, among others. The court’s decision to convict all five and sentence Ms. Raissouni and Mr. al-Amin, who is now her husband, to a year in prison provoked another uproar that was quieted only after the issuance of a royal pardon for all of the defendants on Oct. 16. “We’re relieved that Hajar and her co-defendants are free, but they should have never been arrested in the first place,” said Ahmed Benchemsi, Middle East and North Africa communications director at Human Rights Watch, after the pardon. “A silver lining for this deplorable incident is that a debate was opened about archaic laws in Morocco, and now there’s a growing demand to repel criminalization of nonmarital sex from legal books.” Naturally reserved, Ms. Raissouni is still dealing with the consequences of having her private life discussed for weeks in the national and international news media. But the case thrust her reluctantly into the headlines and onto a list of the top 10 cases of injustice against journalists, and she is determined to use her newfound celebrity to push for a political system with independent institutions and a free press. “I was not just the victim of unjust laws but the victim of unjust authorities,” she said recently in an interview conducted in her apartment in Rabat. “My case wasn’t really about a nonexistent abortion, but it was the result of the arbitrary politics of the state.” As terrible as this experience may have been, it seems fair to say that Ms. Raissouni seemed almost bound to fall afoul of the Moroccan authorities at some point. She was born into a prominent family of landowners, warriors, intellectuals and political dissidents in northern Morocco, and was urged from an early age to hold those in power accountable in a country where injustice largely prevails. She is also a niece of two prominent voices of dissent in Morocco: Soulaimane Raissouni, the editor of Akhbar Al Yaoum, one of the few independent news outlets in Morocco, where she had been working; and Ahmed Raissouni, an Islamist and vocal critic of the state. Her fondest memories growing up were listening to her grandfather recount the exploits of her ancestors who fought some of the country’s biggest wars. When one of her history teachers called her ancestors “traitors” in high school, for having opposed the country’s becoming a joint French-Spanish protectorate in the early 20th century, she took it as a badge of honor.  A great-uncle, Moulay Ahmed Raissouni, was the chief actor in those events. A polarizing figure, often described as both a patriot and a bandit, he touched off an international diplomatic dispute in 1904 by kidnapping a Greek-American playboy, Ion Perdicaris, and his son, demanding a $70,000 ransom. President Theodore Roosevelt, looking for an issue to jump-start his campaign for a second term, promptly dispatched several warships to the coast of Morocco. (It all ended amicably enough with Raissouni getting the ransom and Roosevelt winning re-election.) But the family has occasionally paid a grim price for its resistance to the powerful. Just two years ago, Ms. Raissouni’s father was stoned to death in a dispute with other landowners who were trying to stop him from working some of his fields. The urge to write and express herself came to Ms. Raissouni at an early age. When she was just 9, she wrote an article titled “Peace,” and when she was 12, another one titled “Freedom.” She excelled in school and eventually moved to the capital for college. While studying to become an engineer, to please her father, she secretly pursued a career in journalism, writing under a pen name and giving math lessons to support her writing. She started contributing to Akhbar Al Yaoum in 2016, after stints with other newspapers. She now writes about human rights and politics, and in March received an award for her coverage on illegal immigration.  The newspaper, with fewer than a dozen reporters, has been in existence for only a decade, but its journalists have been dragged into court on a regular basis. Last year, the paper’s founder and publisher, Taoufik Bouachrine, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on sexual assault charges, in a prosecution that the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded was politically motivated. The sentence was increased to 15 years in an appeal trial last month. Ms. Raissouni says she is not sure she is ready to resume her career, preferring to take time to recuperate from the ordeal and the aftermath of the intense exposure. She still retains the signature composure she demonstrated throughout the trial: relaxed, funny and sarcastic, while never showing fear. And she says she is still determined to denounce human rights abuses — perhaps even more so.  She says she emerged from the experience feeling closer to her husband than ever. She met Mr. al-Amin — who fled Sudan for his criticism of the since-deposed president, Omar al-Bashir — on the campus of a university in Rabat only a few months ago, and they were drawn together by their common passion for politics and human rights.  They used to argue about human rights in Morocco, which he considered far more respectful of them and justice than his home country. He sees things differently now, she said, so they have moved on to arguing over a Gandhi quote that hangs on their wall in the living room next to photos of Nelson Mandela. “Victory attained by violence,” it reads, “is tantamount to a defeat for it is momentary.” “We disagree about Gandhi,” she said. “I am not saying that violence should be the response to violence. But you can’t smile and write articles. You have to take to the streets and protest.” And they have one other serious point of contention in Oum Kalthoum, one of the Arab world’s most beloved singers. “Now that you went to jail with me, you need to love what I love,” Ms. Raissouni, who plays the oud and the violin, told her husband laughing. “So you need to listen to Oum Kalthoum.”']",An investigative reporter from a prominent Moroccan family was wrongly accused of having had an abortion. Now she wants to hold officials’ feet to the fire. 
This Mexican Village’s Embroidery Designs Are Admired (and Appropriated) Globally,2019-11-13,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['SAN NICOLÁS, Mexico — A mystery lies behind the origin of the distinctive forms depicted in the elaborate embroidery stitched in San Nicolás, a pinprick of a mountain village in the central Mexican highlands. But to Glafira Candelaria José, who has sewn those images all her life, there can be only one source. “Diosito,” said Ms. Candelaria, using an affectionate form of the Spanish word for “God.” A spiritual charge does seem to animate the figures fluttering across the fabrics that the artisans of the Indigenous Otomí community produce in this area. And many of the vivid forms are inspired by the cascade of local vegetation and the wildlife that shelters there: deer, colorful birds, mountain lions and foxes. Over the past few decades, the artisans working in San Nicolás and other villages clustered around the region’s main town, Tenango de Doria, in the state of Hidalgo, have turned a craft they practiced for survival into a cottage industry. The tenangos, as the embroidered pieces are called, have evolved into richly detailed works reaching a worldwide market. Including some unsolicited admirers. Over the past few months, major international brands have advertised products decorated with the Otomís’ distinctive iconography, without mentioning Tenango de Doria or the Otomí as their source. The polite phrase for this is cultural appropriation. In local villages, where children begin to embroider before they learn to read, people call it plagiarism. For all its lushness, this part of Mexico has been largely ignored and its heritage disdained. Acute poverty pushed many Otomí to migrate to the United States, the only way to shake off childhoods when they went hungry and shoeless. People here still speak Otomí, an Indigenous tonal language, even though it has given way to Spanish in most of the region. “We have always been marginalized for being Indigenous,” said Rebeca López Patiño, a village artisan. Nothing, however, has stopped them from embroidering, with their exuberant visions adorning bedspreads, tapestries, cushions, clothing and even earrings. “It is what we have always done,” said Angélica Martínez García, 37. “My mother would wake us up at 4 in the morning to embroider. Every weekend my mother would sell a tablecloth, and we would have enough to eat from that.” Now the international copies have generated stern letters from Mexico’s culture minister and renewed discussion over how to protect the intellectual property of the Indigenous communities. Several tenango artisans have begun registering their designs under Mexican copyright law. Among them is Adalberto Flores, who filed a criminal complaint against Nestlé three years ago for selling a ceramic cup bearing similar images to his own. The company denied any wrongdoing, and the case is not resolved. Meanwhile Nestlé won a court ruling this year invalidating his copyright registration. A second company, Benetton, used what looked like a tenango print in a swimsuit this summer. The company said that the design was “the result of online research,” and that its “product department was not aware of the traditional work of this community.” Alma Yuridia Santos Modesto, part of an artisan collective in the nearby village of El Dequeña, said the visibility that comes from global brands using Otomí designs “gives a big boost to our craft.” But, she added: “It would be nice to take us into account. At least by giving us a bit more work.” Her collective did embroider bags for Carolina Herrera a few years ago. More recently, though, the same fashion house used tenango iconography in its 2020 resort collections without any credit. After a complaint from the culture minister, the company said its designer “wanted to show his deep respect” for “Mexican craftsmanship.” The tradition of the tenangos is new by Mexican standards, with the Otomí, or hñähñu as they call themselves, developing their singular iconography in the 1960s. Marta Turok, an anthropologist and expert on Mexican folk art, said some images may have derived from nearby cave paintings or from portrayals of healing ceremonies practiced by local shamans, who were among the first artisans. But the Otomí are enriching their designs with new experiences, including migration, said Diana Macho Morales, a social anthropologist at the National School of Anthropology and History who has carried out research in the community. Alongside stylized images of flora and fauna, Ms. Macho has encountered surprises: a giraffe, an image derived from a government campaign for a healthy diet and the Incredible Hulk. For most of the artisans, the one-way connection to international fashion is nothing more than an asterisk, a distraction from the real concern of how to make a living. Those who do the heavy labor of needlework earn less than $10 to embroider a square about the size of a small cushion. Some artisans, known as “dibujantes,” draw the designs onto the fabric, and earn more. A few dibujantes, whose designs have become well-known, dream of showing off their work to a global audience. Mr. Flores, who is battling Nestlé, is a dibujante. He used to spend part of every year working as a landscaper in North Carolina. “I would like to go back — but this time to exhibit my work with a brand, and with a visa,” he said. Ezequiel Vicente José, a retired teacher, is one of the village’s best-known dibujantes. He has established a distinctive style, regularly adding images of human activities to his designs: cutting firewood, planting a cornfield, a wedding, the Day of the Dead — “an infinity of things,” he said. Mr. Vicente thinks the craft could generate a livelihood for more people if artisans banded together, by agreeing on prices and on “how to improve the drawings.” “Selfishness and envy have not allowed us to work together,” he said. Even with a collective approach, the village artisans would still be constrained by the absence of basic infrastructure. There is not a single bank branch in the entire municipality of Tenango de Doria. The road to San Nicolás is paved but most of the other villages are at the end of dirt roads. As a result, many artisans have no choice but to sell to middlemen who arrive on market days and set the prices. “We compete among ourselves and that lowers the price,” Ms. López said as she unfolded an elaborate tablecloth that she designed and embroidered, and that she said should cost about $250. A buyer in the Tenango de Doria market would offer only $150, she said. But perhaps the biggest concern in the village is how many in the next generation will want to follow their parents. Faustina José, 43, grew up in a family of eight children and they all embroidered. Only one of her four children draws and embroiders with her; the other three are in the United States. “It is being lost,” she said of the craft that helped lift her out of poverty. “Young people don’t want to do it. They prefer to work, or to study.”']",
"Mexico, a Haven for Leftists in Exile, Provides Evo Morales With a Landing Spot",2019-11-13,By Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin,"['MEXICO CITY — When Evo Morales stepped off a Mexican government plane on Tuesday and into exile on Mexican soil, he followed a well-trod path. During the past century and a half, Mexico has been a haven for those on the left who have sought asylum — Spanish leftists, American socialists and Communists from Europe among them. In explaining its decision to invite Mr. Morales, the leftist Bolivian leader who stepped down on Sunday, the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that Mexico “has shown itself as an inclusive and supportive state whose doors have been open.” Those doors have opened to Cubans who fought for independence against Spain in the 19th century, most notably José Martí, the poet and revolutionary who spent a couple of years in Mexico in the mid-1870s during a long period of banishment from the island. Spanish leftists who fled after the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s were also welcomed by the Mexican authorities, a wave that included the filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who arrived in Mexico in the 1940s and became a Mexican citizen. During the Nazi era in Germany, thousands of European Jews and Communists sought protection in Mexico, many of them artists and writers. And a number of American socialists migrated south during the Red Scare campaign of the 1950s, driven away by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. Lorenzo Meyer, a historian and emeritus professor at the Colegio de México in Mexico City, said that Mexico’s welcome of generations of left-wing exiles has been a way for its government to assert independence from the United States without presenting an overt foreign policy challenge. “Of course, with the United States next door, Mexico cannot be completely sovereign, but that does not stop it from taking some symbolic measures,” Mr. Meyer said.  In the 1970s, Argentines and Chileans, fearing for their lives during the dirty wars in their countries, sought refuge in Mexico, which also protected the family of President Salvador Allende of Chile, who died in a 1973 coup. More recently, Guatemalans escaping the scorched-earth tactics of the Guatemalan military in the 1980s migrated to Mexico, the most famous being Rigoberta Menchú, the Indigenous advocate who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. And in the past few years, tens of thousands of Central Americans have applied for asylum here, many having done so after being foiled in their attempt to reach the United States. Other prominent exiles have included the deposed Shah of Iran, who in 1979 was granted a Mexican tourist visa and spent a few months living in the city of Cuernavaca, south of the capital, before going to the United States for medical treatment. In this case, Mexico’s open arms stretched only so far: The Mexican government blocked him from returning. For some, Mexican refuge has not only provided a second lease on life, it has also proven to be a staging ground for a successful return to the homeland. After failing in an early assault on a Cuban military barracks, in 1953, Fidel Castro lived in Mexico City and plotted his ultimately successful campaign to topple the Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista. But Mexico hasn’t worked out so well for others. Among the best-known figures granted sanctuary in Mexico was Leon Trotsky after his exile from the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin. In 1940, during a visit with Mr. Trotsky, a Stalinist agent who had infiltrated his inner circle sunk a pickax into his skull. Mr. Trotsky died at a hospital the next day.']","Spanish leftists, American socialists and Communists from Central Europe have all found a home in Mexico over the past century and a half. "
"As Talks With Putin Loom, Ukraine Looks in Vain for U.S. Help",2019-11-14,By Anton Troianovski,"['KIEV, Ukraine — Ukrainians are used to hearing the West call for stability in their country. This fall, the roles have reversed. “Ukraine would very much like to see a stable political situation in the States,” Oleksandr Turchynov, the previous Ukrainian president’s national security adviser, said in an interview. The relationship between Kiev and Washington, he added, “is a question of life and death for us.” As the impeachment spectacle unfolds in Washington, attention is focused on President Trump and the ramifications for domestic politics. But the events are having a major impact on Ukraine, weakening President Volodymyr Zelensky’s position as he hopes to start face-to-face talks in coming weeks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over ending the war with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Mr. Putin has sent signals that he’s prepared to dial down tensions with Ukraine, especially since this could help him escape from economic sanctions imposed by Europe and the United States. But he wants to end the war on his terms, and thanks to the disarray in American policy in Ukraine, politicians and officials in Kiev say, the chances of that are improving. In that respect, Ukraine seems to have joined a long list of foreign policy issues where Mr. Trump has intervened in such a way as to advance the Kremlin’s interest, whether in pressuring NATO, withdrawing from Syria, pushing Brexit, siding with right-wing European populists or defending Russia against charges of meddling in the 2016 election.  “We are not interested in any chaos within the United States political system because we are really, really relying on it,” the lawmaker Bohdan Yaremenko, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Ukrainian Parliament and a Zelensky ally, said. Less American engagement in Ukraine, Mr. Yaremenko said, would offer Russia a “clear sign that they could allow themselves more in Ukraine — to be more aggressive, more active.” Sitting on the East-West divide, Ukraine has sometimes been called the new Berlin Wall. The ouster of its Russia-friendly president in 2014 seemed to mark a turning point, aligning Kiev with the West. Now, the Kremlin seems poised, if not to reverse the tide, at least to shift it more in its favor.  In one sign of Moscow’s increasing leverage, Mr. Zelensky recently reached out for a direct meeting with Mr. Putin, without Western leaders present as intermediaries. In another, the business tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky — one of the country’s most influential figures — said he favored rebuilding ties with Russia. In the past, American diplomats worked closely with Kiev in any talks with Moscow. They presented a united front to the Kremlin, cajoled the European Union to maintain sanctions and tried to reassure a nervous Ukrainian public. Kurt D. Volker, the State Department special envoy for Ukraine, traveled to the country frequently, held talks with Russian officials and agitated on behalf of Kiev at the White House, on Capitol Hill and in Europe.  But with American policy and personnel scrambled by revelations about Mr. Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats, the United States is now largely absent from the political and diplomatic process over resolving the war in the east, Ukrainian and Western officials in Kiev say. Since this spring, as Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign built toward its highest pitch, at least nine officials who had a hand in Ukraine policy have either resigned or become distanced from the Trump administration after testifying in the impeachment inquiry: Mr. Volker; John Bolton, the former national security adviser; Fiona Hill, the former adviser on Europe and Russia at the White House; Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine; Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council; and the diplomats Gordon D. Sondland, William B. Taylor Jr. and George P. Kent. Only Mr. Taylor is still active in Ukraine, serving as the acting United States ambassador. On Wednesday, Mr. Taylor testified to the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry, that his aide was told in July that Mr. Trump cared more about “investigations of Biden” than he did about Ukraine. But Ukrainian and Western officials in Kiev said they doubted that Mr. Taylor spoke for Mr. Trump, who dismissed the veteran diplomat as a “Never Trumper” after he offered damaging testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Americans had been “providing this backup and legitimacy of the Ukrainian position,” said Oksana Syroid, who heads a Ukrainian political party, Self Reliance, that supports closer ties with Washington. But with the expanding cloud of controversy surrounding United States-Ukraine relations, Ukraine is now “kind of naked,” Ms. Syroid said. “We are alone confronting Russia.” Mr. Zelensky in recent weeks has pushed forward with a plan for the mutual withdrawal of troops at several points on the front lines of the war in coordination with the separatists. The moves, which have not gone smoothly, are meant to pave the way for Mr. Zelensky’s first official meeting with Mr. Putin. “We have to resolve all the issues by looking each other in the eyes, not by talking on the phone,” Mr. Zelensky said recently in explaining the need to meet with Mr. Putin. No date has been set for the meeting, but Mr. Zelensky’s administration sees a window of opportunity to negotiate. The Kremlin has taken some conciliatory steps, such as exchanging prisoners with Kiev, while Russians are growing tired of the war and of Western sanctions, Mr. Yaremenko, the Zelensky ally in Parliament, said.  Many Ukrainians are already nervous about their inexperienced president negotiating with Mr. Putin. Some 20,000 people marched in the Ukrainian capital last month to protest Mr. Zelensky’s peace plan, warning of an imminent “capitulation.”  Four-way summits between Ukraine, Germany, France and Russia took place five times under Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, during the Obama administration. At the time, State Department officials were coordinating almost daily with the Europeans and Ukrainians to present Moscow with a united front.  Ms. Syroid said she believes both Democrats and Republicans are now thinking twice about even communicating with Ukrainians for fear of being bound up in the impeachment maelstrom. Some officials in Kiev said Ukraine had become “toxic” in Washington. Mr. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union who played a key role in managing Ukraine policy, told congressional investigators that he pointedly ignored a “Hello, how are you?” text message this fall from a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky. “I just didn’t want to respond once the matter had become contentious,” Mr. Sondland said, according to the transcript of his deposition released on Nov. 5. Ukrainians are now baffled about whom they should speak with in Washington. State Department officials are discussing whether to divide the role of Ukraine envoy among several diplomats instead of replacing Mr. Volker, who was working part time in the job, and without pay. “Right now, there is no one,” Mr. Turchynov, the former national security adviser, said, “who knows in detail the situation in Ukraine and can at any moment give advice, consult, have our back and pass on objective information about events happening in the country to the highest political level in America.” The shadow cast onto Ukraine by the impeachment process has not gone unnoticed in Moscow. The revelations about the Trump administration’s pressure campaign back up a core element of the Kremlin’s propaganda about American involvement in Ukraine: that faraway Washington only sees the country as a means to its own ends, without caring for the well-being of regular Ukrainians.  Similarly, Mr. Trump’s orders that United States troops abandon their Kurdish allies in northeastern Syria but guard the country’s oil fields played into the longtime Russian message that America is an unreliable ally and that its interests in the Middle East are just pecuniary.  Mr. Putin has already taken strategic advantage of Mr. Trump’s erratic foreign policy to emerge as a kingmaker in the Middle East. One question now is how Mr. Putin might seek to capitalize on the confusion over American support for Ukraine. Despite the war, many Ukrainians still have close personal or cultural ties to their eastern neighbor, and a September poll found that 54 percent of Ukrainians have a positive view of Russia.  For now, many Ukrainians insist that the impeachment-related tumult hasn’t shaken their long-term faith in America, and they note the strong voices of support they’ve received from Congress and from the officials testifying in the impeachment inquiry.  But signs of a possible shift are emerging. One senior European official who works closely on Ukraine policy said that Ukrainians suffered from a misguided belief that the United States would fix everything. Now, the official said, Ukrainians ought to finally recognize that the European Union is their closer, more reliable partner.  On Oct. 28, one of Ukraine’s business newspapers, Delovaya Stolitsa, published a column that concluded with a similar point: “It’s clear that today Ukraine’s vectors need to be moved closer to a balance of relationships with the leading players (other than Russia, of course), and their less infantile governments, which don’t drag other countries into their no-holds-barred political fights.” Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Lara Jakes from Washington.']","Kiev wants Western support as it seeks to end its conflict with Russia.

Fear Has Yet to Be Extinguished After Chemical Fire in France,2019-11-16,By Adam Nossiter,"['ROUEN, France — After the chemical factory fire, the few who ventured out clutched their noses or covered their faces in handkerchiefs. Soot fell in towns dozens of miles away, farmers dumped thousands of gallons of milk, harvesting was banned, schools closed and residents moved out. More than a month after the giant Sept. 26 blaze, the flames have long been extinguished, but the fear is not. For France, the Lubrizol factory fire in Rouen, Normandy’s ancient river-port capital 80 miles from Paris, has become the disaster that won’t die. In fact, it has come to epitomize environmental anguish in the age of fear for the planet. The disaster has tapped into a deep mistrust of the government — already chronic in France — anger at corporations and unease over the environment. There have been parliamentary inquiry commissions and a criminal investigation. The American chief executive of Lubrizol — a major chemicals company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — has been summoned to testify at the National Assembly in Paris.  President Emmanuel Macron himself has toured the streets of half-timbered houses to comfort citizens, and the inhabitants have continued to mobilize in front of Rouen’s ornate, 15th-century courts downtown. In Paris, Eric Schnur, Lubrizol’s chief executive, tried to be reassuring, telling the French senate that there wasn’t much difference between the Lubrizol fire and “what you might find in a fire, for instance, in a house.” It didn’t work.  More than 9,000 tons of chemicals used for engine oil and industrial lubricant additives went up into the air that night, and the smoke plume stretched 13 miles. Many reported coughing, headaches, sore throats and runny noses.  Lubrizol has promised to help out farmers — some 3,000 were potentially affected — shops, and the local tourist industry. This past week, the government announced the first indemnity payments to farmers. But the fears of the inhabitants here have not gone away. How much is real, and how much imagined? Where is the line between paranoia and justified anxiety? The Rouen disaster has tested those limits.  The government has promised an epidemiological study in the spring. That is not soon enough for many still living in anxiety in Rouen. “They close the windows. They’re afraid to breathe,” said Martine Fleury, a psychiatrist who took part in a recent demonstration.  The demonstration was against the government, against Lubrizol, against the local prefect, and against whatever else was deemed responsible. Hundreds of citizens turned out for it on a warm Saturday afternoon. “There are people who are living completely barricaded,” said Dr. Fleury’s friend Nathalie Le Meur, a pharmacist and biologist.  An organizer’s voice boomed out angrily over a microphone, filling downtown Rouen: “They’re just telling us, ‘Move on, get over it!’ We want the numbers on the hospitalizations!” Inscribed on a bus shelter were the words “Our past stinks of Lubrizol, our future smells like cancer.”  The crowd chanted, “Lubrizol, guilty; the state, complicit,” cars honked in solidarity and the citizens marched through the deserted streets, past the looming Gothic cathedral famously painted by Monet at different hours of the day.  “Now we have learned that we live on top of a volcano,” Dr. Fleury said.  “We could die, and we could die in an industrial accident,” she added. And yet nobody has died, and many of the initial symptoms appear to have worn off. Few at the rally complained of having felt anything at all, or of feeling anything now. Some in Rouen are puzzled at the depth of the reaction. “This is a subject that mobilizes a kind of tension,” said Guy Pessiot, a local historian who once ran Rouen’s tourism office. “There’s a kind of permanent anxiety. It’s the number one subject of conversation.”   “And yes,” he said, “there’s a kind of hyper-reaction: ‘We’re all going to die 15 minutes ago.’ ” He worried that the image of “rotten Rouen,” industrialized and smoke-filled — Gustave Flaubert, the town’s most famous native son, described “smokestacks of factories pushing out immense brown plumes” in “Madame Bovary” — would return. Bottled water still packs local supermarkets because residents are fearful of drinking what comes from the tap, and slight coughs set off alarms long after ailments linked to the blaze are not present. The local prefect, the government’s top representative, said soon after the fire that there was nothing to worry about. “The air quality is normal,” Pierre-André Durand told journalists, a statement that stupefied inhabitants still overcome by the stink. “For now, there are no health risks,” the health minister, Agnes Buzyn, said.  The citizens didn’t believe her then, and they don’t believe her now. “They tried to minimize things. They said there is nothing wrong, but actually in the long term, we don’t know what the consequences could be,” said Justine Barthelemy, a school employee.  “I’m always suspicious of the government,” she said. “We know who is in power. The way it has been handled doesn’t surprise me.” President Macron did not get a friendly reception here when he came more than a month later. “Mr. Macron, we were very afraid in Rouen, my son was very afraid!” an anguished man called out to the president on his Oct. 29 walking tour through the darkened streets of old half-timbered houses.  “They told us not to even go to the hospital. There was no follow-up,” a woman said to the president as he passed amid boos and whistles. “I’m very disappointed in you. You abandoned us,” another woman shouted. “I won’t vote for you again!”  But even if the government follows through on its promise of a long-term health study, puts in place a new warning system and holds off reauthorizing the plant — it is still closed as cleanup continues — it was clear at the recent Saturday demonstration that all of that will not be enough. A fear has taken hold, made all the more pressing by the absence, for now, of tangible aftereffects and the conviction that the government has not told the “full truth,” a phrase repeated by a number of the demonstrators. “I’m afraid that what we breathed will give us cancer,” said Astride Marchais. “I don’t drink the tap water anymore. I saw what was passing overhead, and it frightened me.”   Ms. Marchais, a human resources worker in local government, added, “I threw everything out, and I didn’t pick my fruit.”  “You had the feeling of not being able to breathe,” said Eric Galmot, who described himself as an urbanist. “And now, we have the impression that the truth is being hidden.”  “I might move somewhere else,” said Françoise Perchepied, a retired housekeeper. “Everything is polluted,. We just don’t want to be poisoned.”   She complained that the pills her doctor gave her had not done her much good and that she had a sore throat.  But it was the uncertainty that seemed to afflict people the most. “We still don’t know the truth of what happened, and we still don’t know which products we can buy,” said Nicole Dimonnot, a musician. “How dare they tell us there were no problems, when we all saw that black plume of smoke?” Mélissa Godin contributed reporting.']","For Rouen, Normandy’s ancient capital, the Lubrizol factory fire has become the disaster that won’t die."
South Korea Resists U.S. Pressure to Improve Ties With Japan,2019-11-15,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea on Friday adamantly rejected an American request to continue sharing military intelligence with Japan, as the two American allies remained locked in festering disputes over trade and history. Mark T. Esper, the United States secretary of defense, visited Seoul to attend an annual defense meeting and personally implore his South Korean counterpart to remain in the intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, known as the General Security of Military Information Agreement, or GSOMIA.  Washington considers the agreement important for the security and stability of the region. South Korea and Japan face similar threats from North Korea and China, but there is a deep-seated mistrust rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.  “The only ones who benefit from the expiration of GSOMIA and continued friction between Seoul and Tokyo are Pyongyang and Beijing,” Mr. Esper said during a joint news conference with his counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, on Friday.  “That reason alone should be powerful enough for all of us to sit down and make sure that we restore our alliance and partnership where it was,” Mr. Esper added. Mr. Jeong said South Korea would abandon the agreement next Friday unless Japan removed the export restrictions it had earlier imposed against South Korea.  That sentiment was echoed by the office of President Moon Jae-in. “Our decision to terminate GSOMIA was inevitable,” Ko Min-jung, a spokeswoman for Mr. Moon, said in a radio interview earlier on Friday. “If we revoke our decision unilaterally without any change in Japan’s exports restrictions and in relations between South Korea and Japan, it would only prove that we made our original decision not prudently enough. That was not the case.” When South Korea announced in August that it would abandon the agreement, despite repeated objections from Washington, it created a rare fracture in the alliance between South Korea and the United States. Washington issued several statements expressing strong disappointment with its allies in Seoul. The agreement took effect in 2016 and had become a symbol of Washington’s successful efforts to persuade its two key East Asian allies to set aside their mutual enmity in order to counter China’s growing military influence and the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. Although South Korea insists that its commitment to the alliance with Washington remains intact, its decision to quit GSOMIA showed how easily such efforts by the United States can be trumped by recurring historical disputes between South Korea and Japan. Simmering tensions between the two neighbors exploded after South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled late last year that Japanese companies should pay reparations to South Koreans for forced labor during the colonial era. Japan insists that all wartime claims were settled when it and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1965. Japan later imposed a series of restrictions on security-related products exported to South Korea. In August, South Korea retaliated by announcing an end to GSOMIA. Although Mr. Moon and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan met briefly in Bangkok last week, their governments have yet to narrow their differences. During his trip to Seoul, Mr. Esper also discussed how to bring North Korea back to denuclearization talks and mounting friction between South Korea and the United States over how to share the cost of keeping 28,500 American troops in South Korea. The issue of cost has become particularly contentious under President Trump, who has insisted that South Korea and other allies shoulder the expense of maintaining American bases on their soil. In February, South Korea agreed to contribute about 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, this year, an 8.2 percent increase from last year. Washington is now demanding that South Korea contribute as much as $4.7 billion next year, according to South Korean news media and lawmakers. On Friday, Mr. Esper would not name an exact figure but said South Korea is a “wealthy country” that “could and should” pay more. Mr. Jeong said the United States and South Korean negotiators were trying to work out a “fair and reasonable” deal. Mr. Trump has often questioned the cost of stationing American troops abroad. The two allies are also still working to bring North Korea back to the table to discuss abandoning its nuclear weapons and missiles programs.  On Thursday, a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator called a proposal from Washington to resume denuclearization talks next month “a trick to earn time,” and said North Korea was not interested in negotiating until Washington abandoned its “hostile policy.” On Friday, both Mr. Esper and Mr. Jeong indicated that the allies were open to changing their plans for a joint air force drill to help maintain diplomatic momentum with North Korea. But they stopped short of canceling the drill. “We always have to remain flexible in terms of how we support our diplomats to ensure that we do not close any doors that may allow forward progress on the diplomatic front,” Mr. Esper said.']",Defense Secretary Mark Esper had urged Seoul to reconsider abandoning a military intelligence-sharing deal with Tokyo. 
Prince Andrew Says He ‘Let the Side Down’ When He Stayed With Jeffrey Epstein,2019-11-16,By Megan Specia and Neil Vigdor,"['LONDON — In a rare public moment of contrition for a member of Britain’s royal family, Prince Andrew said this week that it was wrong for him to have stayed at the Manhattan townhouse of Jeffrey Epstein after the financier had served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. The Duke of York was confronted about the 2010 visit to Mr. Epstein’s Upper East Side mansion during an interview with the BBC. It came after The Daily Mail in August published photos and video from Prince Andrew’s stay with Mr. Epstein, a convicted pedophile at the time. “That’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family,” Prince Andrew, 59, said. “And we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, as simple as that.” The full interview is set to air Saturday night on BBC Two, which released excerpts from it on Friday. The second son of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Andrew has faced scrutiny for his ties to Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who faced a raft of sex trafficking and abuse charges before taking his own life in August in a Manhattan jail cell. The glare was so intense that, after Mr. Epstein’s death, it prompted Buckingham Palace to take the rare step of issuing a statement, in which Prince Andrew said he was “appalled” by the allegations against Mr. Epstein and rejected any suggestion that the prince would take part in the “exploitation of any human being.” While Prince Andrew expressed remorse in the interview over accepting Mr. Epstein’s invitation to stay with him, he denied allegations in a legal filing that Mr. Epstein lent one of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, to him for sex on several occasions when she was 17. “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady,” Prince Andrew said. “None whatsoever.” Emily Maitlis, the BBC journalist who sat down with Prince Andrew, said in a post on Twitter that it was a “no holds barred interview,” adding that none of the questions were vetted ahead of time. Exactly what the prince knew about the allegations against Mr. Epstein has been a point of contention in the months since the American businessman was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July. Prince Andrew has been accused of witnessing and taking part in the sexual exploitation of young women and girls during his decades-long friendship with Mr. Epstein. As prosecutors laid out details of Mr. Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse and trafficking of women, allegations of involvement by Prince Andrew began to emerge. In 2011, a photo was published that Ms. Giuffre said was taken in 2001 and showed Prince Andrew standing alongside her in a London apartment with his arm wrapped around her bare waist, with Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background. Ms. Maxwell, a British socialite, has been named by many of Mr. Epstein’s accusers as an active participant in recruiting young women, some of them under the legal age of consent, for him to groom, traffic and exploit. She was also a friend of Prince Andrew. After an August hearing in which many of Mr. Epstein’s accusers spoke publicly for the first time, Ms. Giuffre called on Prince Andrew to “come clean.” “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it,” Ms. Giuffre said. Another woman, Johanna Sjoberg, said in unsealed legal filings in the same 2015 case that Prince Andrew posed for another photograph in 2001 touching her breast and touching Ms. Giuffre’s breast with a puppet of himself. The prince has repeatedly denied both allegations. Since Mr. Epstein’s death, lawyers for Mr. Epstein’s accusers have demanded that the prince provide a full account of his knowledge of the allegations. Prince Andrew made a rare, brief statement on the situation in August, saying that he never saw or suspected any behavior involving the sexual trafficking and exploitation of underage girls during his long friendship with Mr. Epstein. “I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,” he said. “At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.” Prince Andrew said he first met Mr. Epstein in 1999 and the pair were photographed together several times after that. Investigations into accusations against Mr. Epstein began in 2005 in Florida, but more than a decade ago, Miami prosecutors made a secret deal with the financier that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty to two state prostitution charges. He spent about a year in a Florida jail. British tabloids have published footage of Mr. Epstein and the prince in New York that was said to have been taken in 2010, shortly after the financier’s release from prison. Prince Andrew has been widely criticized for apparently maintaining a relationship with Mr. Epstein after the sex crime conviction. Megan Specia reported from London, and Neil Vigdor from New York.']",The Duke of York told the BBC that his 2010 visit to Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion was unbecoming for a member of Britain’s royal family.
Putin and Zelensky to Meet for First Time Over Ukraine Conflict,2019-11-15,By Anton Troianovski,"[""MOSCOW — The presidents of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Paris next month for long-anticipated talks that could change the contours of the five-year-old conflict in eastern Ukraine whose repercussions have spread worldwide.  The talks, scheduled for Dec. 9, will be the first between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the comedian who won the presidency in April on a pledge to end the fighting with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin.  At the meeting, officials say, the leaders will aim to make progress in carrying out the terms of a peace deal that was reached four years ago in Minsk, Belarus, but has yet to be implemented. The accord aimed to restore Kiev’s control over separatist-held territory in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky has conducted troop withdrawals, coordinated with the separatists, at several points along the front lines to build momentum for the talks, even as the Kremlin has seemed to vacillate over whether Mr. Putin was prepared to engage. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, began with Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014, after pro-European protests in Kiev toppled Ukraine’s Russia-friendly president. Since then, Ukraine has become the biggest flash point in the broader conflict between Moscow and the West, triggering European and American sanctions against Russia and rippling into the impeachment hearings playing out in Washington. Mr. Zelensky will face pressure on multiple fronts as he goes into the talks. His domestic critics claim he is prepared to sell out Ukrainian interests to make peace with Mr. Putin, who has fomented the separatist conflict. At the same time, Mr. Zelensky’s negotiating position is hobbled by the impeachment spectacle, with has exposed new uncertainties about America’s longstanding support for Ukraine. At least nine key American officials who had a hand in Ukraine policy have either resigned or become distanced from the Trump administration since last spring. Western officials have played down expectations for the Paris meeting, noting that Kiev and Moscow are hemmed in by domestic politics. Still, since it appeared uncertain recently that Mr. Putin was even prepared to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, the scheduling of talks has, in itself, seemed to augur some incremental progress. The two leaders will be joined by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. In a statement, Mr. Macron's office cited “major progress since the summer in negotiations for a settlement.” Summit meetings between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany took place five times under Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, but the last one was in 2016.  The talks will seek to produce “a kind of road map — how to implement everything written in the text of the Minsk agreement,” Bohdan Yaremenko, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Ukrainian Parliament and a Zelensky ally, said in an interview last week.  The Minsk agreement, hammered out over 16 hours of talks in February 2015, included promises that a special legal status would be granted to Ukraine’s eastern regions and that local elections would be held. The provisions have remained unimplemented because they proved to be deeply contentious on both sides.

"In Strike That Killed 5 Children, Israel Said It Took Out Gaza Militant. Now It Isn’t Sure.",2019-11-15,By Iyad Abuheweila and David M. Halbfinger,"['DEIR El-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Ismail al-Swarka was shaken from slumber after midnight on Thursday by what sounded like four missile blasts. Then he heard his neighbors screaming. What he found outside was horrifying: Eight of his relatives, including five children, had been killed in an airstrike, with several more badly wounded. As the sky brightened into morning, the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesman posted on Twitter the photo of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander it said had been killed in the strike, which occurred just hours before a cease-fire ended two intense days of fighting between Israel and the militant group. But Islamic Jihad says the man in the photo was actually a different commander from Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip, who is still alive — and that the victims of the attack in Deir El-Balah, near the center of the coastal enclave, were all civilians.  On Friday, Israel’s military backtracked on its earlier claim and said it had begun an investigation into the harm to civilians in the Gaza strike. Gaza health officials said 16 civilians were among the 34 Palestinians killed in the two-day round of combat, which began when Israel assassinated an Islamic Jihad commander early Tuesday, and escalated as the militant group responded with hundreds of rockets aimed at cities and towns across southern and central Israel. There were no Israeli fatalities. Israel’s military asserted that it was conducting its strikes with precision, and it seemed that way at first: The leader targeted on Tuesday, Baha Abu al-Ata, was killed when a missile hit his third-floor bedroom. His wife was also killed, but their children, in another room, survived. Israel also pointed repeatedly to airstrikes that it said had killed militants in the act of firing or preparing to fire rockets but had kept collateral damage to a minimum. But the military says civilian casualties are unavoidable in Gaza’s teeming neighborhoods, where militants often fire rockets from residential areas. Israel accuses militants of using civilians, including their own relatives, as human shields against retaliatory strikes. The eight al-Swarka family members killed appear to have accounted for half the civilian death toll in one devastating strike. The Israeli military continued to insist on Friday that it had struck “an Islamic Jihad military infrastructure” in the Deir el-Balah attack. “According to the information available” at the time, it said in a statement, “no civilians were expected to be harmed as a result.” Initial information, the military said, “showed that an Islamic Jihad operative was killed in the strike,” apparently the commander of a rocket unit, which it said explained the Twitter post by its Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee. But doubts about that information have prompted an investigation into the victim’s “identity, as well as the harm caused to civilians by the strike,” the military said. Since Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, Israel has fought three wars and dozens of skirmishes against Islamic militant groups. While the wars have inflicted heavy damage on Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group, hundreds of civilians have also died in Israeli airstrikes. The high civilian death toll has drawn heavy international criticism, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague has opened a preliminary investigation into Israel’s battlefield tactics. Israel has rejected the criticism, saying it takes numerous precautions to prevent unnecessary civilian casualties. It says its targets are based on sophisticated intelligence and cleared by legal advisers and other experts, and that it often warns inhabitants to evacuate before their homes are struck.  Palestinian militants also have been denounced for firing rockets at Israeli civilian areas. On Friday afternoon, it was hard to see the remains of any structure, let alone infrastructure, at the site of the Thursday airstrike. All that was left of the al-Swarka family’s two homes, which had been about 50 yards apart, were shards of two tin shacks strewn across giant craters in the sand. Neighbors told The Associated Press that an Islamic Jihad commander had lived in one of the destroyed homes, but that he wasn’t home at the time of the airstrike. But Ismail al-Swarka, the brother of one of those killed, gave a different account. One of the destroyed homes, he said, belonged to Rasmi Abu Malhous, who sometimes used the surname al-Swarka, the name of their populous Bedouin tribe. He received a police officer’s salary from the Palestinian Authority, though like many others on the payroll of the authority, idled years ago in Gaza for political reasons, he did not actually put on a uniform and go to work. One of Mr. Abu Malhous’s two wives, Mariam, was killed, Ismail said; the other, Wissam, survived. Three of his children were killed. In the other home lived Mohammad and Yousra al-Swarka, Ismail’s sister. Mohammad works for Palestinian Islamic Jihad but in a civilian capacity, the group said, mediating disputes between families and performing other social functions.  “Why are the children killed if the Israeli army has a problem with someone?” asked Dawood Shihab, an Islamic Jihad spokesman.  Yousra was killed in the blast, her brother said, along with two of the family’s six children.  Ismail al-Swarka said the Israelis gave no warning before firing on his relatives’ homes. After he rushed outside after the airstrike, he said he was disoriented by what he found. “It was unrecognizable,” he said. “I didn’t know what to do.” He found one nephew’s body at the edge of a crater. Then a neighbor stumbled across an adult’s body. “It was my sister,” he said. “I helped dig her body out of the sand.” Mohammad al-Swarka remained in critical condition on Friday at a local hospital.  Ismail al-Swarka said his brother-in-law was also a goatherd and owned some chickens and a donkey cart. The smaller animals were blown to bits. The donkey was injured but survived. Iyad Abuheweila reported from Deir el-Balah and David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem. ']",The Israeli military said it has begun an investigation into who was actually killed in an airstrike that Palestinians said caused the deaths of eight civilians.
"In Sri Lanka’s Presidential Election, a Question of Security vs. Rights",2019-11-16,By Dharisha Bastians and Kai Schultz,"['COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankans on Saturday voted for president after a year of political meltdowns and deadly terrorist attacks, in an election that could return the polarizing Rajapaksa family to power.  The two leading candidates are Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a former defense chief known for his hard-edge leadership, and Sajith Premadasa, the son of a former president who was killed during the country’s long civil war. A decade ago, Mr. Rajapaksa and his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, then Sri Lanka’s president, were credited with ending that civil war, but at a brutal cost: thousands of civilian deaths and the propagation of a muscular Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism that persists today.  In a country split along ethnic, class and religious lines, divisions have only been intensified by the wave of bombings on Easter Sunday in April by a Muslim militant group claiming loyalty to the Islamic State. Hundreds of people were killed, mostly at churches and hotels, in attacks that shattered a tenuous postwar peace and raised fears of retribution against innocent Muslims.  Shortly afterward, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 70, announced his intention to run for president,  making a vow to restore stability that many voters have responded to in Sri Lanka, a lush island just south of India with a Sinhalese-speaking Buddhist majority and large Christian, Hindu and Muslim minorities.  But Mr. Rajapaksa stands accused of human rights violations during the war he ran against Tamil Tiger rebels. The Rajapaksas’ watch also featured many forced disappearances and violence against journalists. Some activists and journalists worry that a return of the Rajapaksas would only widen the country’s differences, rather than bringing a scarred nation together. On Saturday, a group of unidentified gunmen opened fire on buses carrying Muslims to polling stations in northwest Sri Lanka, officials said, though there were no immediate reports of casualties. And on Thursday, a journalist was stabbed by several men who accused him of hurting Mr. Rajapaksa’s campaign after publishing a critical book about the family. For now, at least, many Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet are ready to shelve their apprehensions about the Rajapaksas, hoping that the family can revive the economy, which boomed toward the end of their stretch in power. But if the economy grew, so did the country’s debt, particularly to China, whose influence in Sri Lanka grew powerful under the Rajapaksas.  The issue of China’s rising sway here was a major facet of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s surprising election defeat in 2015. Since then, the country was forced to give up a port complex to China, and its debt crisis has been a serious drag on the economy, along with a collapse in tourism since the bombings.  Saturday’s presidential election, when 16 million eligible voters will choose among 35 candidates, could come down to a vote margin in the thousands. Results should be announced in a few days, and could lead to a runoff.  Mr. Rajapaksa’s leading opponent, Mr. Premadasa, 52, of the United National Front, draws considerable grass-roots support from Sri Lanka’s most impoverished districts. The son of a former president who was killed by the Tamil Tigers in 1993, Mr. Premadasa polls well with minority Tamils and Muslims in the war-torn north and east.  “Premadasa understands the poor man’s struggles,” said H.E. Edirimanne, 27, a voter in the southern town of Hakmana. “We want a leader who is down to earth and leads by example, not one who lives in the lap of luxury.” But Mr. Rajapaksa could have enough momentum to expand beyond his party’s traditional vote bank: Sinhalese Buddhists who celebrate him for ending the war. Former paramilitary troops supportive of Mr. Rajapaksa have stoked anti-Muslim fears in eastern Sri Lanka, where many Hindu Tamils are upset about Islamic militancy in the country.  To his supporters, Mr. Rajapaksa’s tough approach to quashing terrorism is what makes him an attractive candidate. “We want a fearless decision maker,” said Pradeep Kumara, 56, a fisherman from the southern village of Mirissa.   The Easter bombings and the ailing economy were twinned nails in the coffin of the departing government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena. Lawmakers urged him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign, then held a no-confidence vote in Parliament that dented the hopes of either man to run for office this time.  The government began imploding in October last year, when Mr. Sirisena abruptly fired Mr. Wickremesinghe, calling him inept and corrupt. And though the Rajapaksas had been leading the political opposition against him, he then appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa to the position of prime minister. The president and prime minister each hold considerable power in Sri Lanka, and many considered the move a coup.  Chaos followed on the floors of Parliament and in the streets, where demonstrations picked up steam. By the time the power grab was ruled illegal, two protesters had been killed. Out of the political wreckage, and security fears around the country after the Easter bombings, Gotabaya Rajapaksa emerged as a leading candidate. But he brings controversy with him. As defense chief during the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, which stretched from 1983 to 2009, Mr. Rajapaksa was accused of crimes against humanity. Among the accusations was that he directed bombings of civilian hospitals in the final phases of the war. And thousands of Sri Lankans in war-affected regions are still missing after surrendering to the military at the end. Earlier this year, Mr. Rajapaksa was served with two civil court lawsuits in the United States, where he had a home and held citizenship. One accused him of involvement in the torture and killing of a senior Sri Lankan journalist. Last week, the journalist’s daughter, Ahimsa Wickrematunge, who filed one of the cases in California, wrote a public letter to voters urging them not to elect Mr. Rajapaksa. “The danger in relying on such a man to keep you safe is that no one can keep you safe from him,” she wrote. Mr. Rajapaksa claimed to have renounced his American citizenship this summer in order to run for Sri Lanka’s presidency, though his opponents contest that assertion and the issue reached the Supreme Court this week. Analysts said the Rajapaksas anticipated challenges to their new bid for power.  Constantino Xavier, a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi, said Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to rebuild his brother’s brand over the past couple of years, including mending ties with India and allying with diplomats from China to counter Western pressure to investigate wartime abuses. Mr. Xavier said a victory for Gotabaya Rajapaksa, despite concerns that he may tightly concentrate executive authority, would indicate “that a majority of the electorate is willing to risk curtailing civil liberties in exchange for a return to political order and economic revival.” Among the more tantalizing questions in the election is what role Mahinda Rajapaksa would play in Sri Lanka’s government if his brother wins. In an interview, Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son, Namal Rajapaksa, was coy about his father’s political ambitions, saying that there was “absolutely no doubt” the party would offer him the position of prime minister, but that “maybe he would like to rest.” Mahinda Rajapaksa has become a public face of his brother’s campaign. During party rallies and press events, he often fields questions intended for Gotabaya. Election posters feature portraits of both men, banking on Mahinda’s pervasive popularity. In a recent column for The Sunday Times, the journalist Gamini Weerakoon worked through a history of power-sharing families in Sri Lanka. Siblings who tried to kill each other. A nephew who went after his uncles. And the Rajapaksas’ own wartime reign, when Mahinda and Gotabaya rode “roughshod over constitutional provisions.” Mr. Weerakoon drew on a nursery rhyme to illustrate the likelihood of the brothers’ joining hands again: “Everywhere that the Little Lamb goes, Mary certainly goes along.” Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi. Maria Abi-Habib contributed reporting from New Delhi.']","The election could mean a return to power for the Rajapaksa family, who ended the country’s civil war by brutal means."
Gotabaya Rajapaksa Wins Sri Lanka Presidential Election,2019-11-17,By Dharisha Bastians and Kai Schultz,"['COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared victory on Sunday in Sri Lanka’s presidential election, signaling the return to power of a divisive family credited for ending the country’s long civil war through brutal means. Mr. Rajapaksa defeated his closest opponent, Sajith Premadasa, by about 10 percentage points, according to an official tally from Sri Lanka’s election commission. His party expects him to be sworn into office early this week. “As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey,” Mr. Rajapaksa wrote on Twitter in his first remarks about the victory. “Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned.” During the election, Mr. Rajapaksa, 70, a former wartime defense chief nicknamed “Terminator” by his family, capitalized on public outrage at the current government’s mishandling of intelligence reports warning of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, a lush island at the foot of India. In April, a Muslim militant group claiming loyalty to the Islamic State killed hundreds of people in coordinated suicide bombings at churches and hotels on Easter Sunday. The attacks shattered a fragile postwar peace in Sri Lanka, where wounds still fester from the war with separatist ethnic Tamils during which thousands of people died. In 2009, Mr. Rajapaksa and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, then Sri Lanka’s president, ended that conflict, but they stand accused of crimes against humanity, including directing the bombings of civilian hospitals and torturing journalists. During campaign speeches, Gotabaya Rajapaksa vowed to take a tough stance on terrorism as president and to bring stability to Sri Lanka, where a collapse in tourism after the bombings threw the economy into a tailspin. Many Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet support the Rajapaksas in the hopes that they can revive the economy, which boomed toward the end of their stretch in power. Others worry that democracy and freedom of speech will be curtailed under Mr. Rajapaksa, whose party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, is likely to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new prime minister. It is not the first time the former president has sought the position. In October 2018, Sri Lanka’s departing president, Maithripala Sirisena, abruptly fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, calling him inept and corrupt, and then appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa to the position. Many considered the move a coup, and by the time the power grab was ruled illegal, two protesters had been killed.  But the Easter Sunday bombings and struggling economy were enough to allow another Rajapaksa to rise. Asanga Welikala, the director of the Edinburgh Center for Constitutional Law and an expert on Sri Lanka, said that Gotabaya Rajapaksa won this election by leveraging the same hard-line approach to national security and “social discipline” that has propelled populists to power around the world.  “This is a mandate that rejects reform, democratization, civil freedom and broad tolerance of pluralism,” Mr. Welikala said of the vote. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s decade as president was known for tightly centralized power and the spread of a strident Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism that has inspired attacks against the country’s large minority communities. Hostility toward Muslims, in particular, has risen since the Easter Sunday attacks, heightening fears of retribution against innocent Sri Lankans. And although the economy grew under Mahinda Rajapaksa, so did the country’s debt to China, whose influence in Sri Lankan affairs spiked under the family’s watch. A lopsided dependence on China for development projects was a key part of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s startling election defeat in 2015.  Since then, the country was forced to give up a port complex to China as the debt crisis battered the economy, though analysts said Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government would most likely tread carefully with China this time around. “Gota will play the China card, but Beijing is now less inclined to repeat the large financial investments it did five or 10 years ago due to growing domestic opposition and international scrutiny,” said Constantino Xavier, a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi. Officials said turnout on Saturday, when 16 million eligible voters chose among 35 candidates, was more than 80 percent, and that Mr. Rajapaksa had won about 52 percent of the vote. The election was largely peaceful, though some violence was reported, including an attack on buses carrying Muslims to polling stations in northwest Sri Lanka. (There were no reports of injuries.) Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s chief competitor, Mr. Premadasa, 52, whose father was killed during the war by a Tamil Tiger rebel, did well with minority Muslims and Tamils in conflict-torn northern and eastern provinces.  But Mr. Rajapaksa won big with a crucial voting bloc: Sinhalese Buddhists who make up around 70 percent of the Sri Lankan population and credit the Rajapaksa family for ending the war. Sunday morning, Mr. Rajapaksa’s supporters hugged and cheered outside his home on the outskirts of Colombo, the capital.  In a statement conceding defeat, Mr. Premadasa, of the United National Front, congratulated Mr. Rajapaksa, urging him to “strengthen and protect the democratic institutions and values that enabled his peaceful election.” Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.']","Mr. Rajapaksa, a former defense chief and brother of an ex-president, vowed to bring stability to a country still reeling from attacks on Easter Sunday."
Protests Incited by Gas Price Hike Grip Iran,2019-11-16,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Protests flared across Iran for a second day on Saturday, with angry crowds calling for the ouster of the regime in unrest incited by a steep increase in officially set gasoline prices but that quickly broadened to include other grievances.  At least six people were dead after security forces clashed with protesters, according to Persian language news outlets. Iran was also experiencing a “near-total national internet shutdown,” according to NetBlocks, which monitors cybersecurity.  “We don’t want an Islamic Republic, we don’t want it, we don’t want it,” demonstrators chanted in the middle-class Tehranpars neighborhood of Tehran. Calling the protests “foreign instigated,” Tehran’s prosecutor warned Saturday that security forces would crack down harshly. The protests erupted  in dozens of cities after the government decided at midnight Friday to cut gasoline subsidies to fund handouts for Iran’s poor. That added to strains from American economic sanctions and the Iranian government’s mismanagement of the economy.  The protests then broadened to venting anger over other problems such as social repression and corruption. Iran disrupted internet and cellphone service and halted phone-data reception, apparently trying to deter people from sharing information and organizing protests, according to NetBlocks. “By shutting down the internet, the Iranian government isolates protesters from each other and from the rest of the world,” said Mehdi Yahyanejad, the director of NetFreedom Pioneers, a technology nonprofit, who is an expert on cybersecurity in Iran. “Oppression can then exist in a vacuum without on-the-ground solidarity or accountability.” Under the price changes, the price for a liter of rationed gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, or about 13 cents, from 10,000 rials per liter on Thursday, and a monthly ration for each private car was set at 60 liters. Any purchases over that limit would be triple the previous price.  Gasoline in Iran still remains among the world’s cheapest.  Parliament said it had been blindsided by the new policy and called for an emergency meeting on Sunday. Lawmakers said they would introduce legislation to reverse the price hike.  Parvaneh Salahshouri, a reformist lawmaker representing Tehran, said lawmakers had been kept in the dark. She wrote on Twitter that Parliament was powerless to act and only a facade for a sham democracy. Many constituents called her office to complain, she said.  Several prominent Shiite clerics urged officials to backtrack before it was too late. “This decision is very unfortunate and worrisome,” said a statement by Ayatollah Safi Golpaygani. “We ask that Parliament reverse this move.” President Hassan Rouhani has said that the government will not benefit financially from the price increase because the money is to be returned to about 60 million needy Iranians in the form of cash subsidies. But hardly anyone across the political divide seemed to believe him.  Mr. Rouhani acknowledged days ago that Iran faced a deficit amounting to nearly two-thirds of its annual $45 billion budget.  Iranians took to the streets on Saturday on foot and in cars. On major highways and roads across Iran, people turned off their vehicles and sat for hours, intentionally creating backups for miles and miles.  “They are out of touch with the public,” said Minoo, who works at a cafe in Tehran but asked that her last name not be published out of security concerns. “Our transportation cost has now tripled, but our salaries remain the same.” In Islamshahr, a small working-class city, crowds attacked a billboard of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Posts on social media showed that they had set it ablaze. While insulting the supreme leader is an offense that can carry the death penalty, people did not seem to care. “We are fed up,” they chanted. In cities including Behshahr, Shiraz, Tehran and Karaj, protests turned violent when people attacked government buildings, set banks on fire, ripped the national flag and kicked and burned revolutionary monuments. The police and demonstrators exchanged gunfire on Friday in Sirjan, a city some 500 miles southeast of Tehran, an Interior Ministry official there told state television.  The state-run IRNA news agency said “protesters tried to set fire to the oil depot,” The Associated Press reported. It quoted the official, Mohammad Mahmoudabadi, as saying, “They insisted on reaching the oil depot and creating crises.” Around Iran, anti-riot police officers and security forces battled crowds on motorcycles and on foot, videos on social media and local news outlets showed. These accounts showed that in Karaj, a young man was shot in the head, while in Shiraz, security forces shot a young man, who collapsed to the ground, bleeding. “They are firing on the people,” shouted the narrator of the video from Shiraz, his hands shaking as he documented the scene. A widely shared flier urged Iranians to strike and create daily traffic jams on major roads by stopping their cars. In one video from Tehran, a truck driver carrying rock and dirt was shown stopping and dumping his haul in the middle of a three-lane highway. Passers-by cheered. In Isfahan and Shiraz, public school was suspended Sunday after school bus drivers announced they would strike. Protests tend to erupt in Iran every few years, but they usually lack organization and leadership. Eventually, they fizzle amid heavy-handed crackdowns and mass arrests. Iranian opposition parties are in disarray, with domestic opposition leaders jailed and those abroad lacking legitimacy among most Iranians inside Iran. A spate of economic protests that erupted in late 2017 led to nearly 5,000 reported arrests and the deaths of at least 25 people.']",The unrest put renewed pressure on the government as it struggles to overcome U.S. sanctions.
Turkey’s Deportations Force Europe to Face Its ISIS Militants,2019-11-17,By Norimitsu Onishi and Elian Peltier,"['PARIS — As Turkey followed through on its threat to release more Islamic State detainees last week, Western European nations were confronted with a problem they had long sought to avoid: what to do about the potential return of radicalized, often battle-hardened Europeans to countries that absolutely do not want them back. Faced with fierce popular opposition to the repatriation of such detainees and fears over the long-term threat they could pose back home, European leaders have sought alternative ways to prosecute them — in an international tribunal, on Iraqi soil, anywhere but on the Continent. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, made more powerful by a sudden shift in American policy, is determined to foist the problem of the captured European Islamic State fighters back on the countries they came from.  Last week, Turkey sent a dozen former Islamic State members and relatives to Britain, Denmark, Germany and the United States, and Mr. Erdogan says hundreds more are right behind them. “All of the European countries, especially those with most of the foreign fighters, have desperately been looking for the past year for a way to deal with them without bringing them back,” said Rik Coolsaet, an expert on radicalization at the Egmont Institute, a Brussels-based research group. “But now, European nations are being forced to consider repatriation since Turkey is going to put people on the plane.” The sudden problem for Europe is a long-tail consequence of President Trump’s precipitous decision last month to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey to take control of territory as well as many of the Islamic State members who had been held there in Kurdish-run prisons or detention camps.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that nearly two-thirds of the Western European detainees, or about 700, are children, many of whom have lost one parent, if not both. Now that more of the former fighters are in Turkish hands, Mr. Erdogan has not hesitated to use the threat of returning them as leverage over European countries who have been deeply critical of his incursion, and who have threatened sanctions against Turkey for unauthorized oil drilling in the eastern Mediterranean off Cyprus.  The fate of the former fighters and their families has become yet another point of contention between Turkey and Europe, which is already paying Mr. Erdogan’s government billions of dollars to stem the flow of asylum seekers from conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Turkey is already home to some three million refugees from the Syria conflict, and Mr. Erdogan is determined to lighten his country’s load. But his real intent remains unclear: Does he really plan to send back all foreign fighters to Europe? Or is he opening the spigot, with the threat of a flood to come, to wring concessions from Europe? What is clear is that with limited military reach in Syria, European nations are ever more vulnerable to Mr. Erdogan’s whims. Turkish officials say that Turkey now holds 2,280 Islamic State members from 30 countries, and that all of them will be deported. The problem is not Europe’s alone. On Friday, Turkey deported an American it described as an Islamic State member, Muhammad Darwish Bassam, to the United States. Last week, a federal judge in the United States ruled that an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State in 2014 was not an American citizen, potentially thwarting her return. But the numbers and risks for Europe are far greater than for the United States. More than 1,100 citizens of countries in Western Europe are believed to be detained in northern Syria in territory once controlled by the Islamic State, according to a recent study by the Egmont Institute. Their potential return has confronted European justice systems with competing security and civil liberties demands as they attempt to vet returnees, decide whether to detain them, and build cases on potential crimes that often happened hundred of miles away on remote Syrian battlefields.  France, the Western European nation with the most detainees in Syria, is getting ready to take back 11 former Islamic State members. The Netherlands has also agreed to take back some of its citizens.  On Thursday, a 26-year-old man suspected of being an Islamic State fighter was arrested after landing at London’s Heathrow Airport on a flight from Turkey.  That same day, seven members of a German-Iraqi family arrived in Berlin from Turkey, from which they had been deported after several months in custody over suspected links to terrorism.  The father was detained, but the other family members were allowed to return to their homes. On Friday, a woman deported by Turkey was detained upon arrival at Frankfurt Airport on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organization abroad. Federal prosecutors in Germany said the woman, a German citizen identified only as Nasim A., left the country in 2014 and married an ISIS fighter, whom she supported until Kurdish-led security forces detained her this year.  A second woman was released after landing in Germany, but will be tracked by experts on de-radicalization. German officials said they believed more than 130 people left the country to join ISIS, 95 of whom were German citizens and had the right to return to the country. Nearly a third of the Germans are under investigation by federal prosecutors. French officials said there had been no change in French policy, which opposes repatriation from Syria. But pressure has been building, and security experts and some government officials have increasingly warned that the repatriation of militants — and their processing in European courts and detention in prisons — would be the only way to ensure Europe’s safety. The deteriorating situation in northern Syria, some experts say, further increases the need for an orderly repatriation to Europe.  Left in Syria, more detainees could fall into the hands of Turkish forces or the Syrian government, which could use them as bargaining chips with the West.  Others could run away and try to regroup, or be taken back by Islamic State sleeper cells, as is feared in the case of some women who recently escaped from a camp in the region. “There are a lot of risks associated with the policy of leaving them where they are,’’ said Anthony Dworkin, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who has studied the Islamic State’s foreign fighters. The potential dangers and difficulties are vividly demonstrated in the case of Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old French citizen of Pakistani origin who grew up and lived in London until she traveled to Syria in 2015. She is believed to still be in the custody of the Turkish authorities. A mother of two, she does not speak French and had spent most of her life in Britain, and although French intelligence services knew of her case, it is unclear that they had expected her to come to France. “Tooba Gondal is a very notorious ISIS female recruiter, but until recently she wasn’t on the radar of French intelligence services,” said Jean-Charles Brisard of the Paris-based Center for Analysis of Terrorism, who was first to reveal that she would be deported. A former London university student, Ms. Gondal became known in the British news media as an Islamic State “matchmaker.” She is accused of persuading other young Western women, like the British schoolgirl Shamima Begum, to marry Islamic State fighters.  She also posed with assault rifles in pictures on social media, and praised the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015. In recent months, Ms. Gondal has pleaded to be taken back to Britain, which had issued an expulsion order against her in 2018. She declared in an open letter to The Sunday Times of London that she was a “changed person” who wished to “face justice in a British court.” As a non-British citizen but a French passport holder, she is now likely to be deported to France. France has already repatriated more than 250 Islamic State fighters and their families from Turkey since signing a bilateral agreement with the government there in 2014. But 400 French citizens are still estimated to be detained in Syria, according to the Egmont Institute, and France does not want them back. Instead, France wants Iraq to try them, especially the male fighters. French officials have led European negotiations with the Iraqi government to set up trials in Iraq. But disagreements between Iraqi and European officials — over legal matters like the death penalty and costs — have prevented an accord. “It is legitimate that people who have committed terrorist acts should be judged closest to the place where they committed those said terrorist acts,’’ Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokeswoman for the French government, said at a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association.  The other French citizens expected to return home — three Frenchwomen and their five children, all under 4 years old — were held in the camp of Ain Issa, according to their lawyer, Marie Dosé.  She said the families escaped in mid-October when the facility was abandoned by Kurdish forces. “They have risked their lives and their children’s to join Turkey and be expelled to France,” Ms. Dosé said.  For more than a year, Ms. Dosé and other French lawyers have fought to bring the mothers back with their children, as the women argued that they wanted to be tried at home. Last year, when a French television crew met one of the four women set to be deported, she said she wouldn’t leave without her son. “If he leaves, I’m leaving with him,” said Amandine le Coz, a 29-year-old woman who grew up in a suburb near Paris. “He’s my life.” In France and other European nations, the stories of people like Ms. le Coz and Ms. Gondal have elicited little sympathy. “There’s been more sympathy for vulnerable children, but as you go up to adults, there’s a lot of pushback against women and there’s even more pushback against male militants,’’ said Joana Cook, a researcher at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization in London. Dr. Cook, who has studied women and children who have returned to their home countries from Syria, said there had been no known incidents involving returnees.  Instead, terrorist cases, including the failed attempt to ignite a car loaded with gas canisters near the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, involved women who had become radicalized at home and had never stepped foot in Syria. In France, about 100 people who returned from Syria have already been judged and given sentences averaging 10 years, Mr. Brisard said. Some of those serving the shortest sentences have already been released, he said. “They’ll be freed one day, that’s for sure,’’ Mr. Brisard said. “But it’s preferable that they be incarcerated in French prisons from where they can’t escape. And after they’ve served their sentences, it’s preferable that they be tracked by a competent intelligence service. In Iraq or Syria, I don’t have much faith in their intelligence services keeping track of our jihadists.’’ Norimitsu Onishi reported from Paris, and Elian Peltier from London.

Iran Blocks Nearly All Internet Access,2019-11-17,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iran imposed an almost complete nationwide internet blackout on Sunday, making one of its most draconian attempts to cut off Iranians from each other and the rest of the world as widespread anti-government unrest roiled the streets of Tehran and other cities for a third day. The death toll for the three days of protests rose to at least 12; hundreds were injured; and more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to semiofficial news agencies like Fars News. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader who has the last word on all state matters, called the demonstrators “thugs” and endorsed the government’s decision to raise prices it sets for rationed gasoline by 50 percent as of Friday and by 200 percent for gasoline that exceeds ration limits. Even after the price hike, gasoline in Iran is still cheaper than in most of the rest of the world — now the equivalent of about 50 cents a gallon.  In a speech on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei said he would support rationing and increasing gas prices because heads of three branches of government — the presidency, judiciary and parliament — had made the decision. He acknowledged that Iranians had taken to the streets to protest and that some had died. But he blamed the protests on monarchists and opposition groups trying to destabilize Iran.  The widespread discontent on display across the country marked yet another crisis for the Islamic Republic. Iran has been struggling with an economic crisis after the United States exited a nuclear deal and reimposed harsh sanctions that ban Iran’s oil sales.  In the past month, Iran has faced a fierce backlash in regional countries such as Lebanon and Iraq where protesters have called for an end to Iran’s outsized influence in their countries’ affairs. Now, the most powerful forces leading the country are being challenged on the home front. In the past, Iran has met such widespread protest movements with forceful crackdowns that have crushed dissent. Ayatollah Khamenei’s support of the gas price hike effectively put an end to parliament’s attempt to challenge the decision, and lawmakers took back a bill they had introduced to reverse the new policy. But protests raged and criticism continued. At least two lawmakers resigned in opposition to parliament’s not being consulted. In the cities from Tehran to Shiraz in the south, Iranian protesters chanted, “Death to Khamenei.”  Some analysts said Iran could not sustain the pressure from all directions and would have to make some concessions — either to its population or to the United States for new negotiations. “The regime is facing a serious crisis and unless they concede someplace to relieve the pressures, the anger and the violence will continue,” said Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an independent analyst based in New York. The Trump administration on Sunday condemned the lethal use of force and the cutting of communications in Iran. “The U.S. supports the Iranian people in their peaceful protests against the regime that is supposed to lead them,” a statement from the White House press secretary said. Iranian activists on social media called for the United States to figure out a way to provide Iran with internet access.  Human rights activists said they worried that without witness documentation of the violence, it would be difficult to hold Iran accountable for its crackdown. The Associated Press reported that Iran also experienced wide disruptions and outages of internet service on Friday and Saturday, according to the group NetBlocks, which monitors worldwide internet access. By Saturday night, connectivity had fallen to just 7 percent of ordinary levels, NetBlocks said. “The ongoing disruption is the most severe recorded in Iran since President Rouhani came to power, and the most severe disconnection tracked by NetBlocks in any country in terms of its technical complexity and breadth,” the group said. The internet firm Oracle called it “the largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.” Ahmad, a taxi driver in Tehran who did not want his last name used, said in telephone interview that when he tried to connect to the internet on his mobile phone, a recorded message said that because of a decision by the National Security Council, connectivity had been cut off.  WhatsApp and Instagram, both used widely by Iranians, were also blocked. Fahimeh, an accountant, said she and her friends relied on WhatsApp to find out the location and time of protests, and in the absence of the internet, it would be difficult for Iranians to plan and spread the word. The Ministry of Information said Sunday that it had identified bad actors among protesters and warned that those responsible for unrest would be arrested. Intelligence agents on Sunday arrested Abdoleza Davari, a senior aide to Iran’s former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and a vocal critic of the gas price policy, according to his wife, Elham Salmani. Mr. Davari had posted a tweet a day earlier saying that the people have the right to demonstrate and that parliament must hear their concerns and stand up to the branches of the government imposing this policy. “They have failed to successfully counter freethinking with ideology so the only tool at their disposal is violence,” said Ms. Salmani, a journalist and political activist, in a telephone interview. She said the prosecutor’s office had threatened to arrest her as well and had accused her of hiding her husband’s mobile telephone and laptop computer. Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent reformist politician, said on Twitter that if elected officials could not listen to the demands of the people, “they should resign and leave the country to its real rulers.”']",Anti-government protests spread as the supreme leader supports a gas price increase. 
New Statue Unsettles Italian City: Is It Celebrating a Poet or a Nationalist?,2019-11-16,By Jason Horowitz,"['TRIESTE, Italy — On a recent afternoon, a little girl gently patted the shoulder of a statue of the Italian writer Gabriele d’Annunzio, depicted sitting cross-legged and reading on a bench in a central square. “This is a girl who shows respect,” said Rosa Cacioppo Mantini, a 92-year-old retired high school literature teacher and committed Fascist who nearly every day stands guard over the statue and adorns it with an Italian flag.  Then the little girl stepped back, stomped on d’Annunzio’s bronze foot and slapped his bald head. “Disrespectful!” Ms. Mantini seethed. Such are the passions provoked these days by d’Annunzio, whose introduction into Trieste’s Piazza della Borsa in September has anguished many local residents.  Once the cosmopolitan port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste boasts a proud literary pedigree. The city is populated with statues; James Joyce, who wrote some of his masterpieces while living in Trieste, is among them, strolling across the Grand Canal on the Ponterosso bridge.  As a poet, d’Annunzio is considered among the great Italian stylists. But some residents complain that it is d’Annunzio’s politics, not his letters, that motived the initiative to place him in their city, to which he had little connection. On Sept. 12, 1919, 100 years to the day before his statue was unveiled, d’Annunzio led his company of black-clad rebel Italian soldiers and irregulars into the city of Fiume on the Adriatic coast. The expedition, filled with unapologetic militarism, inspired Fascism and Mussolini. For 15 months straddling 1919 and 1920, d’Annunzio ruled as a poet-soldier-dictator over the autonomous Free State of Fiume in a small patch of what is today Croatia.  With Italian nationalism back in vogue, so apparently is d’Annunzio, at least among Italy’s right wing, which has claimed the decadent, priapic and prolific literary genius as one of its own.  “The great d’Annunzio,” Matteo Salvini, Italy’s most popular nationalist politician, has called him. Some of d’Annunzio’s modern-day fans have sought to rescue the poet, sometimes referred to as “the Bard,” from the stigma of Fascism. Last spring, the president of the Vittoriale degli Italiani, the museum that has been made out of d’Annunzio’s former pleasure palace on Lake Garda, curated an exhibit on Trieste’s waterfront to mark the 100th anniversary of the Fiume campaign.  “The Fiume campaign wasn’t Fascist, just like Gabriele d’Annunzio wasn’t,” the president, Giordano Bruno Guerri, wrote in the exhibit’s catalog.  In an interview, Mr. Guerri said that during his visit to Trieste in preparation for the exhibit, he walked with Trieste’s center-right mayor, Roberto Dipiazza, past a statue of one of the city’s native poets. The mayor then proposed a statue of d’Annunzio for Trieste and the curator told him he was in luck, he had a spare mold to make one from.  At the statue’s inauguration, Mr. Dipiazza called d’Annunzio a “great Italian,” and the criticism “unbelievable.”  His office deferred comment to the city’s cultural assessor, Giorgio Rossi, who said the exhibit and statue were “an occasion to recognize d’Annunzio not only as a literary figure, but above all as a historical figure.”  But there remains uneasiness about the statue — and that history — in a city where newspapers are draped over wooden racks in cafes, bookish tourists follow the footsteps of literary giants, and aspiring writers are still drawn to the brooding, nowhere-place appeal and legacy of lost empire. Protesters have signed petitions against the statue. Vandals have broken beer bottles over it. Unhappy residents ridicule the fact that the statue’s legs don’t reach the ground, requiring an inelegant footboard to keep his shoes from dangling and earning the likeness a new nickname: “The Short Bard.”  Then there is the more serious fallout, like the protest from neighboring Croatia, which complained that the statue “undermines the friendly and neighborly relations” between the countries.  After the statue was unveiled, the Croats summoned Italy’s ambassador in Zagreb and condemned it as celebrating irredentism, the turn-of-the-20th-century Italian movement to reclaim “unredeemed” lands. The response is part of the complicated legacy of d’Annunzio, a World War I veteran and pilot who, among his exploits, dropped his own propagandistic poetry over Vienna. Until the Italian navy finally bombed him out of power, d’Annunzio held choreographed parades, mandated poetry readings and concerts and gave grand speeches from balconies. He introduced himself, Messiah-like, with a pronouncement of “Ecce homo.”  A highly libertine proponent of sexual conquest, phallus-themed slippers and cocaine use, the dandy conqueror — whose leisure wear is on show at “The Fabulous Joy,” a pavilion dedicated to all things d’Annunzio in an amusement park called Gardaland — turned Fiume into a Bohemian hot spot.  But Fiume also became a test run for the trappings of Fascism. “In the movement which calls itself ‘Fascist,’ has not the best been engendered by my spirit?” d’Annunzio wrote Mussolini after the Duce’s 1922 March on Rome.  Fascists revered him as a John the Baptist figure. Mussolini gave d’Annunzio the title of Prince of Montenevoso and mourned his death in 1938 by proclaiming at d’Annunzio’s funeral, “Italy will arrive at the summit you dreamed of. I swear it.” Instead, Italy ended up in ruins. Adjacent to the square where d’Annunzio now sits, a place marker in Trieste’s Piazza Unità d’Italia notes: “On September 18 1938, Mussolini chose this square to announce the issuing of the anti-Jewish racial laws, an irremovable stain of the Fascist regime and of the Italian monarchy.”  In the south of the city, Nazis converted the San Sabba rice factory into the Italian territory’s only concentration camp. Those associations are downplayed by d’Annunzio’s admirers. A member of Mr. Salvini’s League party, Susanna Ceccardi, a European Parliament member from Tuscany, has insisted the statue has nothing to do with politics.  After Croatia’s protest, she appealed for European officials to show support for the statue, “the sole aim of which,” she wrote, “is to commemorate an important Italian writer.” Still, some wonder why here. “d’Annunzio didn’t engage much with Trieste,” said Mario Cerne, 78, the owner of a bookstore named for the Triestine poet Umberto Saba, a statue of whom stands nearby. As a result, “people have been cold to the new statue,” he said.  That is something of an understatement. “Some people are mad,” said Cristina Buonaccorsi, 71, who took a selfie with the statue of Joyce to send to her daughter in Ireland. Joyce, who worked on his masterpieces including “Dubliners,” “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” and “Ulysses” during his years here, admired d’Annunzio’s prose and his shared experimentation with the novel.  But unlike d’Annunzio, Joyce lived all over Trieste, a place he loved for its white wine and mix of languages, religions and ethnicities. Plaques, above a door on Via San Nicolò, mark the spot where Joyce lived and taught English in the Berlitz School, now the site of a Zara clothing store. Among his students was Italo Svevo, the pen name of the Jewish writer and businessman Ettore Schmitz, the possible inspiration for Leopold Bloom. Once Joyce discovered him, Svevo, the author of “Zeno’s Conscience,” went on to be recognized as a comic modernist master. While Joyce and Svevo are woven into Trieste’s skeptical and ironic fabric, d’Annunzio “doesn’t have anything to do” with the city’s literary tradition, said Marina Nadali, 77, a retired literature teacher.  “It’s politics,” she said, standing in front of a statue of Svevo across town.  To a certain extent, Ms. Mantini agreed.  As she showed off her lapel flag pin of the Republic of Salò, the Nazi-propped puppet state led by Mussolini, and chased away children tying balloons to d’Annunzio’s head, she looked with adoration at the statue, the legs of which she said may be “too short,” but are beautiful.  “He is a great Italian poet, and thanks to him Fiume returned to Italy,” she said, referring to its subsequent annexation by Mussolini. “And then what happened, happened.”']","Boasting a proud literary pedigree, Trieste is populated with statues. But none has provoked passions like that of Gabriele d’Annunzio, who inspired Fascism and briefly ruled his own state last century."
"Pushed From Hungary, University Created by Soros Shifts to Vienna",2019-11-15,By Benjamin Novak,"['VIENNA — Forced out of Hungary, Central European University marked its relocation to Vienna on Friday with a bittersweet ceremony that amounted to a victory for Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, in his campaign against liberal values. Founded and endowed after the fall of the Iron Curtain by George Soros, the billionaire financier and philanthropist, the university promoted democracy and liberal thought in a region where they had been suppressed for a century under fascism and communism. But it ran afoul of Mr. Orban’s increasingly authoritarian and nativist government, which has turned Mr. Soros — a Jew who was born and raised in Hungary, but has lived most of his life in the West — into a kind of all-purpose boogeyman. Mr. Soros announced on Friday that his Open Society Foundations had committed 750 million euros, about $825 million, to an effort by Central European University and Bard College in New York to build a global network for colleges and universities to work together and support each other. Mr. Orban has changed Hungary’s laws and political environment in ways that have silenced independent voices by making it steadily harder for the university and other civil society institutions to operate. More than seven decades after its founder decided to leave Hungary, the university was forced to do the same. Central European University will maintain a presence in Budapest “out of a sense of moral obligation,” because of the support it has received there, Mr. Soros said in an interview on Friday as it formally inaugurated its new Austrian home. The move will be a gradual one, starting with a small number of programs but with most programs scheduled to be based in Vienna by autumn 2020. Mr. Soros has for decades poured money into Eastern Europe, supporting civil society organizations, sponsoring research and promoting the transition to open, pluralist democracy. But that project has run headlong into the growing power of autocratic and nationalist right-wing movements across Europe, particularly in Hungary.  “Under Viktor Orban’s autocratic rule, no independent institutions are tolerated,” said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of international affairs and sociology at Princeton. “So it was only a matter of time before Orban’s attention turned to C.E.U.”  In 1989, Mr. Soros funded a scholarship for Viktor Orban, then a rabble-rousing young liberal from provincial Hungary, and in 1993, the fledgling university he founded put down roots in Budapest. The university says it takes pride in attracting émigré Hungarian scholars back to their native land to teach and research. It has almost 17,000 alumni, faculty from more than 40 countries and students from more than 100. The university estimates that it contributed almost €24 million annually to the Hungarian economy, a benefit that will now go to Austria. Mr. Orban served as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, but had moved far to the right after his party, Fidesz, returned to power in 2010. He has said he is on a mission to build an “illiberal democracy,” and similar shifts have occurred to varying degrees in several eastern European countries. Mr. Orban has sharply curtailed the independence of the courts and Hungary’s prosecution service. Nearly all of the Hungarian media is now under the control of allies beholden to him. His government has rewritten election laws to favor Fidesz, and opposition parties are routinely under pressure from state authorities. As Mr. Orban has cemented control over Hungary, his government has stepped up attacks against critics. It has demonized immigrants, curbed academic freedom and assailed international structures like the European Union as threats to Hungarian sovereignty. The United States ambassador to Hungary, David B. Cornstein, has said that Central European University’s clashes with the state boil down to a personal conflict between Mr. Orban and Mr. Soros. Mr. Soros rejected that description vehemently, adding, “Orban would love to make it a personal issue between us.” The Hungarian leader is not ideological, he said in the interview, arguing that Mr. Orban uses nationalism as a tool to hold power and cover for systemic corruption.  “He’s an ambitious man and in the course of gaining power he developed a system of enriching himself and his assistants,” he said. Mr. Soros has for years been the target of sweeping state-funded propaganda campaigns that tap into anti-Semitic tropes reminiscent of the interwar period. The Hungarian government has blanketed the country in ads featuring a black-and-white photo of Mr. Soros, with text reading, “Let’s not allow Soros to have the last laugh.” In 2016, Mr. Orban said: “The next year will be about squeezing out Soros and the powers that he symbolizes.” The government enacted legislation that targeted civil society groups that receive foreign funding — many of them beneficiaries of Open Society Foundations, which was forced to stop operating in Hungary — and made Central European University’s future in the country uncertain. Changes in law created an assortment of new requirements for foreign universities operating in Hungary, and specifically took issue with United States degrees issued by Central European University, which is incorporated and accredited in the United States. The university’s efforts to come into compliance with the law were in vain, despite bipartisan backing in Congress and statements of support from the State Department. An agreement between Mr. Orban’s government and the State of New York, which might have allowed the university to remain in Budapest, was never signed by the government. Last December, the university announced it had to leave, and would move its headquarters and the bulk of its operations to Vienna. Even so, Mr. Soros, who reminisced about his father teaching him to ski in the hills of Budapest, said, “I have always had a special spot for my native Hungary.”']","Central European University and its founder, George Soros, have been favorite targets of Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orban, as he stifles dissenting voices.

‘Your Face Is Burning.’ How It Feels to Photograph Australia’s Fires,2019-11-15,By Isabella Kwai,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Isabella Kwai, a reporter with the Australia bureau. Australia is burning, and the worst is yet to come. Bushfires raged through the east coast last weekend, setting the tone for the week as schools closed and those living in danger zones prepared to evacuate on an especially hot, windy Tuesday. Since then, at least four people have died and dozens of homes have been destroyed as firefighters have battled more than 80 fires. But the country has been burning for a while, experts say.  Fire seasons, once limited largely to the summer months, are stretching longer and the land is growing drier, providing plenty of fuel. While the country’s political leaders trade insults over climate change, experts say that without more resources and interventions, living in bushland will come at a cost.  When Matthew Abbott, a photographer who regularly contributes to The New York Times,  heard about the fires, he jumped in the car.  On Tuesday, he headed for Taree, a town in northern New South Wales hit by the worst of the fires. I asked him about his experience documenting the battle that firefighters have waged in the area.  Here is his account: I was in town waiting to hear any news from the NSW Rural Fire Service. The town was already covered in smoke. Everyone was anxious, talking about the catastrophic conditions.  In the morning it was the calm before the storm. It wasn’t until about midday that fires started to escalate. We headed to Hillville, which is about 50 kilometers out of town. Photographing fires is a very difficult thing because you’ve got no idea. Fires can start and can go out of control in a matter of minutes. You see flashing lights whizzing past and helicopters swarming above. You follow them and try to document the process. You have to conserve your energy. You’d approach a fire and be careful not to run too much and just be there and absolutely back away because your face is burning. Your camera is scorching hot, it’s almost melting. I was trying to cover my ears and elbows as I was photographing, it was just so hot.  In the beginning of the day, the fire was always around us, moving in different directions in valleys. At the end of the night a southerly change came. We knew where it was coming from and we could see it racing toward us. It was a very powerful thing to see. It’s a different kind of fear from what I’ve experienced before because it’s so far out of my control. It’s quite chaotic. I kept thinking, “I can’t lose my car keys. If I lose my car keys, I can’t get out of here.”  Sometimes I left the car running because I was paranoid it wouldn’t start. Without the car you’d be in trouble. Things can happen very quickly and you have to get out of there.  I was traveling with a couple of other photographers as well. One of the big killers in fires is just exhaustion, which leads to heart attacks. People think that you get burned alive or you die from smoke inhalation, but the big killer is exhaustion. To be so close to the inferno is an intense experience. You don’t realize it, but your heart rate is up and you’re not doing anything — you’re just there. In Australia you’re always in a remote area and there’s just not that many people around. In many cases, we’re down a dirt road with a fire out of control and no one knows we’re there. We’re wearing the full protective clothing so we’ve got boots — my boots have melted. We’ve got fire clothes, fire retardant stuff. That really protects you from the heat, but your face is exposed. I had a mask on. I had sunglasses and heaps of water as well. When I came back in, I’d splash myself with water and try to keep as hydrated as possible and also as calm as possible. It’s good that they were prepared, but people were terrified and they take fire very seriously. It really scared people. Going into the Woolworth’s in Taree, there was no water left. It was eerie because the whole shopping center there was just full of smoke. But most people you meet, fighting fires on their property, they’re pretty receptive and understand the media are there to show what’s going on.  People had their hoses on, sprinklers on all day. You had farmers out there with water pumps on the back of their quad bikes. Often it’s just one little spot fire that can be enough to cause havoc. You can do a lot really fighting by yourself.

"In Bolivia, Interim Leader Sets Conservative, Religious Tone",2019-11-16,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — The interim leader of Bolivia took power this week promising to unify a nation in turmoil. But she has since stacked her cabinet with conservative ministers and thrust religion to the forefront of government at the risk of deepening the divides.  The leader, Jeanine Añez, also called on security forces to restore public order and police responded by opening fire Friday on coca farmers protesting against the government in the central city of Cochabamba. The clash left nine protesters dead and dozens injured, the worst violence yet in the country’s monthlong political crisis. Ms. Añez already appeared to be reaching beyond her caretaker mandate of organizing national elections by January — taking steps, for example, to reshape the country’s foreign policy. Her actions threaten to complicate negotiations with allies of former President Evo Morales to reach a democratic solution to the crisis. “Without a popular mandate, they are pushing forward some of the most objectionable aspects of their agenda,” Javier Corrales, a Latin American politics professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts, said of the country’s new leaders. “They seem to be thinking that what Bolivia needs right now is a purge, and not conciliation.” Ms. Añez, a little-known senator from a remote Bolivian region, was sworn in on Tuesday after Mr. Morales, the country’s first Indigenous president, was forced into exile by protests and pressure from the security forces. One of Bolivia’s most transformative leaders, Mr. Morales’s grip on power unraveled after he tried bending electoral rules to stay in power for a fourth term in October, flouting constitutional term limits he himself had set. Just before she assumed power, Ms. Añez told reporters that her only aim was to unite the country and restore it to the path to democracy. But her critics say her actions so far are having the opposite effect. She injected Catholicism into government, swearing in her ministers in front of a large Bible and making speeches shadowed by an aide carrying a cross. Her heavy use of Catholic imagery was in sharp contrast to the Indigenous ceremonies held by Mr. Morales in the presidential palace.  In a country where the vast majority of citizens consider themselves Christian, said Mr. Corrales, the analyst, Ms. Añez has turned to Bolivia’s conservative religious groups for support to mask her lack of a popular mandate.  Ms. Añez’s close ally, Luis Fernando Camacho, on Wednesday held a political rally at which another speaker shouted disparaging references to the Indigenous culture that Mr. Morales championed: “We have tied all the demons of the witchery and thrust them into the abyss. Satans, get out of Bolivia now.”  Ms. Añez’s revival of Catholic rituals in public events has caused more than a little discomfort because the Constitution defines Bolivia as a secular state. Her religious zeal has also caused concern among some Indigenous groups who associate Catholicism in politics with the former conservative governments that had long treated them as second-class citizens.  In a further shift from Mr. Morales’s focus on Indigenous rights, Ms. Añez has filled her cabinet with politicians from the country’s eastern lowlands, which are dominated by Bolivians of mixed or European descent. Many of her ministers have been staunch opponents of Mr. Morales’s socialist policies or have served in previous conservative administrations. The most radical changes have come from the Foreign Ministry. In just a few days, Ms. Añez, has cut Mr. Morales’s alliances with leftist governments in the region. She broke off relations with President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela and kicked out hundreds of Cuban doctors working in the country. Bolivia’s new foreign minister, Karen Longaric, said the country will quit the Venezuela-led economic bloc Alba and is considering leaving the left-leaning regional association, Unasur. The new Bolivian government has accused Venezuela and Cuba of destabilizing the country and financing subversive groups, an allegation regularly used by the region’s right-leaning governments when faced with internal discontent. On Friday, Bolivian police detained nine Venezuelan citizens, whom they claimed were undercover security agents. On Thursday, Ms. Añez issued a presidential decree exempting the military from criminal prosecution when maintaining public order. The following day, police cracked down with lethal force on the protesters in Cochabamba. The new interior minister, the right-wing Senator Arturo Murillo, began by promising to hunt down Mr. Morales’s top former minister, Juan Ramón Quintana, who has gone into hiding.  “We’re going to go hunting for Juan Ramón Quintana,” said Mr. Murillo, “because he is an animal that feeds on the blood of the people.” Mr. Morales’s political party is demanding protection from persecution in return for its agreement to participate in new elections. The party, Movement for Socialism, remains the most popular in the country, making its participation crucial to the legitimacy of any new vote. Some Bolivians fear that rather than expanding democratic rights, Ms. Añez could weaken them. The new communication minister, Roxana Lizárraga, is a radical commentator who often railed against Mr. Morales’s government. On Thursday, she threatened to persecute journalists who are “involved in sedition,” adding that she already has a list of troublesome members of the media. “These actions don’t correspond to the transitional government — they require support of the voters,” said Fernando Molina, an author and journalist based in La Paz. “What they are doing is capturing political trophies. They want a clean break from Evo.”']","The leader, Jeanine Añez, promised to unify a nation in turmoil. But her initial steps, taking the country rightward and injecting religious themes, risk deepening the divide."
"Prince Andrew Talks About His Ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and Britain Is Appalled",2019-11-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When members of the British royal family consent to warts-and-all television interviews about their troubled private lives, it generally has the effect of roiling the waters rather than calming them. So when Prince Andrew set out to explain his friendship with the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a BBC interview broadcast Saturday night, it backfired predictably.  Viewers were left shaking their heads at the wisdom of consenting to a polite-but-relentless grilling by the journalist Emily Maitlis in the first place. Many said they found his statements alternately defensive, unpersuasive or just plain strange. Prince Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, repeatedly denied accusations by Virginia Roberts Giuffre that he had sex with her when she was 17 years old and had been offered to him by Mr. Epstein. Under insistent questioning by Ms. Maitlis, the duke insisted he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms. Giuffre.  But he could not explain the photograph taken in a London house that appeared to show him with his arm around the girl’s bare waist, and with Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, smiling in the background. He disputed her account of an alleged meeting between him and Ms. Giuffre in a club in London. She has claimed that he sweated profusely while they danced, but he told the BBC that he could not have sweated while dancing with her at the time because he had a medical condition, dating from his combat tour in the Falklands War, that did not allow him to perspire. He said he has since begun to sweat again. When asked whether he regretted his relationship with Mr. Epstein, which continued after the financier served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution, Prince Andrew said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.” “Unbecoming?” the BBC interviewer, Ms. Maitlis, replied with a tone of incredulity. “He was a sex offender.” The duke quickly backtracked, saying: “Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite. I mean, in the sense that he was a sex offender.” The reaction in the British media and on social media was uniformly withering.  “Not one single word of remorse,” said a banner headline in The Mail on Sunday.  “No Sweat … and No Regret,” said The Sunday Mirror. “I couldn’t have slept with teenager, I was at Pizza Express,” said The Sunday Telegraph, referring to Prince Andrew’s contention that he had taken one of his daughters to a pizza restaurant on the night in 2001 that Ms. Giuffre said they danced, drank and had sex. The Sunday Times and other news outlets reported that Jason Stein resigned two weeks ago as the prince’s public relations adviser because he believed that the duke’s decision to agree to the BBC interview “could backfire.” Public relations experts expressed bafflement at the decision of Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, to prostrate himself before television cameras when his answers to the accusations Ms. Giuffre made in a legal filing and in countless newspaper interviews were so unconvincing. In August, as other accusers stepped forward, she said of the prince, “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.” In his interview, the duke cast doubt on several accusations. For example, in explaining the photograph that appeared to show him with Ms. Giuffre, he stopped short of saying the picture had been doctored, as some of his friends have suggested. But he said that he never dresses casually when in London, that he avoids public displays of affection with strangers and that he could not have been at the place the photograph was taken. “The photograph was taken upstairs,” Prince Andrew said, “and I don’t believe I ever went upstairs.” Perhaps even more damaging was his explanation about why he stayed with Mr. Epstein at his Manhattan mansion in 2010, after his host was released from prison. It was “convenient,” the prince said, though he insisted that he had made the visit solely to break off their relationship. As for a photograph of Prince Andrew, now 59, walking with Mr. Epstein in Central Park that was published in The Daily Mail in August, renewing questions about the propriety of their association, the duke said with a wan smile: “That’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family.”  “We try and uphold the highest standards and practices,” he added, “and I let the side down, as simple as that.” Even after all the lurid details of Mr. Epstein’s trafficking in underage girls emerged in court, Prince Andrew refused to say in the BBC interview that he regretted being friends with Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in August.  The prince said that Mr. Epstein had introduced him to an array of interesting people, broadening his horizons after serving in the Royal Navy and benefiting his work as a trade envoy for Britain. Prince Andrew is not the only prominent figure called to be embarrassed by his association with Mr. Epstein. Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder, recently said he regretted having met with him on a few occasions. But the duke’s relationship with Mr. Epstein was far more extensive: He visited Mr. Epstein at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., as well as his private island in the Caribbean. Prince Andrew said he had also invited Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to parties at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, another royal estate. The Duke of York said he did not notice anything untoward on any of those visits and theorized that Mr. Epstein and his staff had behaved differently when the prince was around. He even said he did not know Mr. Epstein that well, having met him through his friendship with Ms. Maxwell, a British socialite. Prince Andrew acknowledged that Ms. Giuffre’s accusations had taken a toll on his family, overshadowed his charity work and cast a legal shadow over him. Even as she and others have called on him to repeat his denials in court, he said he would have to consult lawyers before doing so under oath.  But if his goal in going before the cameras was to put an unpleasant episode behind him, Prince Andrew perhaps could have learned from the experiences of his older brother, Prince Charles, and his late sister-in-law, Princess Diana. Charles, the Prince of Wales, cooperated with a wide-ranging interview with the journalist Jonathan Dimbleby in 1994 that was dominated by his confession that he had been unfaithful to his wife. A year later, Diana famously told another interviewer, Martin Bashir, that “there were three of us in this marriage,” referring to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his wife. Last month, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, also opened up to the TV interviewer Tom Bradby. She said she was struggling with being a royal and a new mother. And Prince Harry kindled rumors of a rift in the royal family by saying that he and his brother, Prince William, were on “different paths at the moment.” He added, “I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.”']",Viewers were incredulous that the Duke of York subjected himself to polite-but-relentless grilling about accusations that he had sex with a teenager. 
Ethnic Rifts in Bolivia Burst Into View With Fall of Evo Morales,2019-11-15,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Clifford Krauss,"['COCHABAMBA, Bolivia — In the days since the ouster of Evo Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, deep ethnic tensions that have long divided the country have erupted, complicating efforts to move Bolivia out of political crisis.  Mr. Morales, a champion of the Indigenous, has now been replaced by an acting president of European descent, and resentments have surfaced. Police officers have ripped the Indigenous insignia off their uniforms. Protesters have burned the Indigenous flag. And the acting president, who posted tweets many consider racist, initially appointed a cabinet without a single Indigenous member. “We feel threatened,” said Juan Acume, a farmer from the Quechua, an Indigenous group, near a protest barricade of earth mounds and tree trunks across Bolivia’s main highway on Wednesday night. “They don’t represent us; they reject us, the Indigenous.” Mr. Morales’s nearly 14  years in power represented a breakthrough for the three-quarters of Bolivians who are either of Indigenous descent or identify as members of Indigenous groups. But he also reinforced his base of support with explicit appeals to racial identity that many Bolivians found threatening and polarizing. Now that Mr. Morales has taken asylum in Mexico, his supporters fear the loss of their hard-won political and economic gains.  Their fears grew when Jeanine Añez Chavez, an opposition senator, swiftly proclaimed herself the country’s interim president on Tuesday, promising to unite the nation and to call new elections in January. But on Wednesday, when she unveiled her caretaker cabinet, not one of the 11 ministers identified as a member of an Indigenous group. After an outcry, she appointed an Indigenous minister of culture as she added more cabinet members.  In previous years, Ms. Añez had published provocative posts on Twitter mocking Indigenous people’s culture, branding their religious rites “satanic” and calling Mr. Morales a “poor Indian.” She has since deleted the tweets, but not before they spread widely on social media. They were supplemented by a cascade of fake racist posts attributed to Ms. Añez and spread by Mr. Morales’s supporters, according to a media monitoring group, the Bolivia Verifies Observatory. At a news conference on Friday, Ms. Añez denounced the fake tweets and said that her enemies were spreading disinformation. But asked if any of the racial tweets attributed to her were real, she did not respond.  “This rhetoric of racism and discrimination,” she said, “is not real, and we reject it.”  In some of the worst violence to convulse Bolivia in recent weeks, police fired tear gas and live rounds on Friday afternoon at Indigenous supporters of Mr. Morales who had attempted to march into Cochabamba, a city about 250 miles east of La Paz. At least five people died in the violence, according to Bolivia’s ombudsman’s office. Tensions between the Indigenous population and Bolivia’s long-ruling elite of European descent date to Spanish colonial times, and have simmered under the surface ever since.  Diego von Vacano, a Bolivian political scientist at Texas A&M University, likened traditional race relations in Bolivia to “the apartheid system in South Africa, with Indigenous people being second class citizens.” He said, “The significance of Evo was he rose up and achieved a lot of positive things for Indigenous people.”  But as Mr. Morales began losing his grip on power over the past three years, Mr. von Vacano added, “he rallied his Indigenous base through the rhetoric of racial distinctions, which has now polarized much of the country.” During Mr. Morales’s time in office, the number of Indigenous representatives in ministries and congress grew, and included women who wear traditional full skirts called polleras, which were once disdained in public spaces.  Mr. Morales also redistributed the country’s natural gas wealth to native communities, and led a renaissance of traditional cuisine, music and dress. He introduced a multicolored flag, called the Whipala, which represents the country’s diverse Indigenous groups, and made it an official flag alongside the country’s traditional Independence-era banner of red, green and yellow. These policies have made him an idol of many in Bolivia’s main Indigenous communities, the Quechua and Aymara, which make up about a third of country’s adult population, according to the latest census.  They also have fueled resentment among many Bolivians of mixed or European descent, as well as the country’s smaller Indigenous groups, who accused Mr. Morales of ethnic favoritism and exploiting racial differences for political gain.  Mr. Morales’s critics say that his government’s fixation with a particular brand of Bolivia’s diverse Indigenous culture — the highland subsistence farming communities — masks the country’s growing cosmopolitanism. The percentage of Bolivians who have identified themselves as members of Indigenous groups fell to 41 percent in the last census, in 2012, from 62 percent a decade earlier.  “Racism exists in Bolivia; it existed before Evo, and it will never disappear,” said Michelle Kieffer, an insurance broker, as she sipped a cappuccino in an upper-middle-class neighborhood of the country’s administrative capital, La Paz.  “While Evo started an important discussion,” she added, “he also manipulated the race issue, and that has caused disunity. And now people of different races look at each other with suspicion.” Bolivia’s political fault lines are complex; race often combines with regional and ideological divisions. There are Indigenous leaders who broke with Mr. Morales over allegations of corruption, and some Bolivians who are not Indigenous supported his Socialist politics. But the racial divide was apparent this past week when comparing the crowds marching for and against Mr. Morales.  These divisions are rocking cities like Cochabamba, a diverse regional capital of about 700,000 in a high Andean valley that is surrounded by the majority-Quechua speaking countryside. It was in Cochabamba where a decision by local police commandos last Friday to join demonstrators protesting Mr. Morales’s contested re-election spurred a nationwide defection of security forces. The mutiny sounded the death knell for Mr. Morales’s embattled government. Pressured by the armed forces, Mr. Morales announced his resignation from his stronghold in the coca farming region of Cochabamba Province on Sunday, and flew into exile the next day. After taking control of Cochabamba city, the rebellious police officers cut off the Whipala insignia from their uniforms and dumped them on the ground, a scene captured on a video shot by a local newspaper. Minutes later, antigovernment protesters grabbed the Whipala standard from Police Headquarters and burned it on the city’s main square. To the rebels, the dual use of national flags was a symbol of disunity promoted by Mr. Morales. “They made us believe that there were two Bolivias, and we always believed that there was one,” said Col. Miguel Mercado, the police commander of the neighboring province of Santa Cruz,  in a television interview. “It has to shelter all of us.” But to many of Bolivia’s Indigenous people, the Whipala desecration was a grave insult that symbolized the end of equal rights they had enjoyed under Mr. Morales. On Thursday, thousands of Cochabamba’s mainly Quechua coca leaf farmers descended on the outskirts of the regional capital waving the country’s two flags to demand Mr. Morales’s return. Heavily armed military and police cordons blocked their entry into the city, a reminder to many coca farmers of the brutal repression they had suffered during Mr. Morales’s pro-American predecessor governments. It was the biggest protest in Bolivia that day, yet not one local journalist was present in a city that boasts several local television channels and newspapers. To the protesters, it was yet another sign of cultural discrimination. The entertainment programs and commercials on Bolivia’s national television are almost exclusively filled with white actors and presenters. “They’ve been giving orders for 500 years, and now they want to take away our 13 years,” said Herlinda Cruz, a coca grower dressed in a pollera and traditional bowler hat. “They will take away my pollera. They will take away my voice,” she added, breaking into tears. The ethnic divide is, in part, religious. Mr. Morales had a tense relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, partly because he had encouraged traditional Aymara ceremonies in the presidential palace, a practice considered pagan in a country where Catholicism was a central part of the conquest of the Indians in the 16th century.  Ms. Añez was sworn in holding an oversized Bible, which she ceremoniously placed in the presidential palace. Although the vast majority of Bolivians consider themselves Christians, Ms. Añez’s conservative Catholicism  signaled to some the return of European domination of Bolivian culture. When Ms. Añez appears in public, an aide frequently stands by her holding a cross.  Mr. Morales has fanned the growing cultural and racial tensions from his Mexican exile. In frequent news conferences and Twitter postings, he has called his opponents “racists and coup-mongers.”  His message was echoed almost verbatim by his supporters at a protest in Cochabamba on Thursday. Many carried homemade weapons and shields to protect themselves against what they expected to be an imminent police attack. At least one person died in clashes between Indigenous protesters and the police in a nearby province the previous day. “They have burned our flag; they have laughed at our culture. This is racism; this is discrimination,” said Alfonso Coque, a coca grower. “We will give our lives for our rights.” Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from Cochabamba, and Clifford Krauss from La Paz. Cesar del Castillo contributed reporting from La Paz.']","As the country’s first Indigenous president has tumbled from power, Indigenous Bolivians fear the loss of their hard-won political gains, and say a racial backlash has begun.

Sadistic Beating on Irish Border Raises Alarms About Return to Violence,2019-11-16,By Ed O'Loughlin,"['DERRYLIN, Northern Ireland — Kevin Lunney, a 50-year-old businessman from Northern Ireland, was heading home one evening when he became the victim of a prolonged, sadistic and ostentatious assault. Abducted by four masked men, he was driven across the nearby border with the Republic of Ireland, locked in a horse trailer and beaten and tortured for two hours. One leg was broken in two places with a heavy implement, several fingernails were pulled out and the initials of his employer, Quinn Industrial Holdings, were carved into his chest with a knife. He was then doused with bleach, apparently to destroy forensic evidence, before being dumped on the side of a quiet country road. The Irish borderlands have a history of murder and intimidation, and Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, likened the attack to the “gangland, paramilitary-style, punishment beatings” that were a feature of Northern Ireland’s 30 years of Troubles. For some, the assault conjured a vision of a grim future along the border, in the event that Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement.  For now, people can cross the border freely and without any need for checks. A so-called no-deal Brexit would be likely to change that: Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, while the Republic of Ireland will continue to be a European Union member state, implying a need for a harder frontier. That new division, many fear, could create ideal conditions for smuggling, and potentially provoke a resurgence of paramilitary intimidation and violence. Yet the attack on Mr. Lunney appears to have had nothing to do with politics or religion. Instead, this assault was just the most ghastly of dozens of incidents in an eight-year campaign of unpunished arson, vandalism, death threats and assaults against the management of Quinn Industrial, also called the Quinn Group or simply Quinn. The violence has brought into question the ability of Dublin and London to enforce the law on their common border. At the heart of the matter is the ownership and management of Quinn Industrial, the region’s biggest industrial employer, which straddles the border between Derrylin in Northern Ireland and Ballyconnell in the south. Mr. Lunney, the operations director at Quinn, was part of a mainly local management team that rescued the business and its 830 jobs with financial backing from the United States after the group’s flamboyant self-made founder, Sean Quinn, went bankrupt in 2011. Once Ireland’s richest man, Mr. Quinn had leveraged a successful construction business into a global insurance, hotel, health care and real estate empire worth an estimated $6 billion in 2008. The business investment and thousands of jobs that Mr. Quinn brought to the impoverished rural counties of Fermanagh and Cavan made him a local hero. But in 2011, Mr. Quinn lost his fortune after investing heavily in shares of Ireland’s now-notorious Anglo-Irish Bank, which was itself about to go broke because of reckless property lending, a bank failure that saddled Ireland’s 4.9 million citizens with more than $30 billion in debt. Since then, Mr. Quinn has encouraged the notion that he and his family got a raw deal in the liquidation. He and his sympathizers have blamed his setbacks not on his business decisions but on the machinations of Dublin’s bankers and politicians, as well as his former staff. The attacks on Mr. Quinn’s former businesses in Cavan and Fermanagh began as his empire was being liquidated in 2011, and were accompanied by anonymous threatening messages calling for the local management, many of them his former assistants, to hand the company back to him. At a public meeting last year, a tearful Mr. Quinn told hundreds of local supporters — some of them still employees at Q.I.H. — that he “felt stabbed in the back” by his former executives. “All they have to do, is come along and say, ‘Sean, we got this wrong. We should not be here. There are the keys,’” Mr. Quinn told the meeting, according to a report in a local newspaper, The Anglo-Celt. Anonymous posters, banners and social media posts have repeatedly threatened named directors, including Mr. Lunney, with “the gun” and “kangaroo justice.” In February, Mr. Lunney’s nose was broken, and boiling water was thrown in the face of a fellow executive, Dara O’Reilly, the company’s chief financial officer, as they ate lunch at a gas station at Ballyconnell. In May, the company received an anonymous letter threatening a “permanent solution” against five named directors, including Mr. Lunney. All told, the company has recorded more than 60 incidents over eight years. While the identity of the attackers is not known, the Irish police and the management of Quinn Industrial blame a criminal gang. Last week a local resident who was wanted for questioning, Cyril McGuinness, died of an apparent heart attack when British police officers raided a house where he was staying in Derbyshire, England. Irish news outlets have reported that Mr. McGuiness, 54, was a career criminal with more than 50 convictions, and that he was suspected of leading the gang that carried out the attacks on Quinn Industrial’s management. On Thursday, three more people were arrested by the police in Ireland over the case. They were released without charge early Saturday. Mr. Quinn has repeatedly condemned the intimidation and attacks, including the assault on Mr. Lunney. A statement released by the Quinn family said, “We have had no involvement in the Quinn Group for several years now and are deeply frustrated and angered that our former ownership of those businesses is being associated in any way with such abhorrent acts.” In a recent rare TV interview, with Britain’s Channel 4 News, Mr. Quinn said that he had “no hand act or part, or no knowledge or no gain” in the attack on Mr. Lunney, and that it had caused him to give up his ambition to regain control of his former companies. “People can say whatever they want about me, but I don’t want to be seen to be the beneficiary of abuse or criminal activity.” Despite Mr. Quinn’s repeated condemnations, the campaign has continued. Ten days after his TV interview, a masked man wearing a costume associated with paramilitaries fighting British control in Northern Ireland issued a new letter threatening Quinn Industrial’s owners and management. “This is your last warning to resign to the directors of Q.I.H., obviously you haven’t learned your lesson after what happened to Kevin. If we wanted we could have killed him very easily,” the statement read. “The Quinn family that employed hundreds of people were stabbed in the back and we have the capability and manpower to see this through until the end and achieve a permanent solution.” Since the assault on Mr. Lunney, the police on both sides of the border have ramped up measures to solve the string of crimes. The Irish police force, An Garda Siochana, said that while no one had been charged at this time it had sent several files to prosecutors, and the Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, who was previously deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said he was happy with the progress being made. Yet the fact that it has taken so many years to bring the investigation this far has raised fears that the violence could threaten further investment in a remote and underfunded region. Quinn Industrial, sprawling across the borderlands, is particularly vulnerable. Liam McCaffrey, the company’s chief executive, said that he felt he and his fellow managers had been too reticent in the past about speaking out against the campaign, and that the authorities in Dublin and Belfast had been slow to respond. “It was underestimated and not taken seriously at the highest level,” he said. “There was a feeling that it was a local issue and it would just go away. What happened to Kevin has changed that. There is more effort now, but they are having to catch up.” Any attempted prosecution will come up against a traditional code of silence in the border regions. Shortly after the attack, Quinn Industrial organized a short march at its headquarters in support of Mr. Lunney and his family. Few of the hundreds of employees and locals who took part were willing to talk to reporters, and even fewer gave their names. Yet silence does not imply support for the attacks. “There’s no way this is coming from workers at the company,” said Donal O’Cofaigh, a communications officer with a union representing many employees who is also a local councilor. “There’s support for Sean Quinn, there’s no doubt about that, but there’s also support for the new management.” Mr. Lunney, along with several other senior managers at the company, still lives amid the winding, hedge-lined roads and humpbacked hills of this border region — scenic, but, as the Troubles proved time and again, perfect for ambushes. “There’s a small number of people that need to be dealt with and they haven’t been,” said Mr. McCaffrey, the Quinn Industrial chief executive. “Some of them may have paramilitary connections but they are motivated by money, not by any political agenda. We are determined not to be intimidated but at the same time we all have families and we want to live a reasonably normal life. We’ve taken steps to protect ourselves and we’ve been in consultation with the police.” ']","The brutal attack on a businessman was not directly related to sectarian violence or Brexit, but it has conjured fears of a grim future if a hard border is reimposed."
Inside Hong Kong’s Battle-Ready Campuses,2019-11-15,By Tiffany May and Lam Yik Fei,"['HONG KONG — Across Hong Kong’s university campuses, students and their supporters are bracing for police confrontations in increasingly elaborate ways: constructing Molotov cocktail assembly lines, erecting catapults that use helmets to launch projectiles, and building walls made of brick and mortar or crosshatched bamboo.  As riot police officers bombarded the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Tuesday with rapid-fire tear gas and stinging liquid, a secluded haven for learning suddenly looked more like a battlefield. Now, students across the city said, they are being pushed to defend themselves in more radical ways. “They are insulting the institution of universities. This is a holy place for us to learn. It’s not a place for them to ruin,” said Anna Foy, a 23-year-old graduate student. “I used to just Photoshop posters, protesting in air-conditioning. But now I have evolved into someone who goes to the front line.”  After five months of unrest, tensions rose in the past week, first after the death of a student demonstrator who fell from a parking garage, and then after the police shooting of an unarmed protester. Demonstrators have disrupted the city’s transportation system in recent days in an effort to force the government to respond to their demands, including accountability for the police.  As the police crack down, students have found themselves in previously unimaginable situations. “I didn’t think I would be mixing these chemicals with my own hands, but I am here to learn,” said Jacqueline Kwok, a 19-year-old student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, or PolyU, surrounded by plastic funnels, rolled towels and glass bottles. The pungent smell of chemicals filled the air as another protester tested a freshly made gasoline bomb by hurling it into a drained swimming pool, flames licking the blue tiles as the bottle smashed. Other students said they planned to make smoke bombs that would cause less bodily harm, but whose sulfuric odors would also deter police advances. On the edges of campuses, black-clad protesters stalked rooftops and makeshift watchtowers, keeping a wary eye out for undercover officers and potential snitches. Visitors who wanted to pass through had to show either student or press cards at “customs” stands, and present their belongings to be inspected. Protesters scattered nails and bricks stacked like mini Stonehenges, to slow down police vehicles should they try to clear the roads. And small groups roamed with bows and arrows, a few even practicing with flames. Ken Chan, a 17-year-old high school student and archery hobbyist, said: “I know this is really extreme and risky. I would consider shooting arrows as a final resort, if I could protect the people of Polytechnic University and to protect Hong Kongers. This is really extreme.”  University leaders said they were alarmed that violent clashes — and preparations for future ones — had reached campus grounds previously untouched during the months of unrest, and that large numbers of outside protesters were now occupying its buildings and fields.  “Our campus has been turned into a scene of disorder,” PolyU said in a statement, urging students and staff members to stay away and pleading for the outside protesters to leave. Classes were being held online. At the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Friday night, protesters evacuated the campus after a van was set on fire and explosions were heard. John Tse, police chief superintendent, said on Wednesday that the force suspected that C.U.H.K. was being used as a “weapon factory.” He added that the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds against students was justified on those grounds. Fearing a new incursion by the police, many supporters of the protesters, including alumni, flocked to the campuses, leaving bags of food and supplies. “We are very worried about the students, so we wanted to come back and check on them,” said Karen Chan, a 30-year-old social worker and graduate of PolyU. The campus’s cafeteria had the air of a disaster bazaar, with overflowing boxes of bottled water, gas masks, goggles and paper towels, organized by category. In the kitchens, volunteer cooks made simple meals of white rice, canned meat and noodles. “When it was quiet, I started making chicken-egg sandwiches for protesters so that they can eat something yummy, not just ramen, ramen and ramen,” said Ryan Fa, a 17-year-old volunteer medic. Elite universities like C.U.H.K. and the University of Hong Kong have even earned nicknames like Riot U and Revolution University.  Coco Wong, a C.U.H.K. student, said the name Riot U reflected the “wild” nature of her classmates.  “InRiot U, we have people with all sorts of knowledge and ability,” she said. “When our home turf is being invaded, we can only rush to the front and fight back.” ']","Classrooms may be empty, but universities are bustling with preparation for confrontations with the police.

"Iran Abruptly Raises Fuel Prices, and Protests Erupt",2019-11-15,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran abruptly raised gasoline prices as much as 200 percent early Friday and imposed a strict rationing system, and within hours protests erupted across the country with angry crowds calling for the ouster of President Hassan Rouhani. The new energy policy appeared to be the latest attempt by the Islamic Republic to manage an economic crisis worsened by American sanctions that have sharply reduced oil exports.  Mr. Rouhani said at a speech a day earlier that Iran faced a deficit amounting to nearly two-thirds of its annual $45 billion budget. By Friday night, large crowds had gathered in major cities including Shiraz, Mashhad, Ahwaz and Bandar Abbas, as well as in a range of smaller working class towns. In some places the protests turned violent, according to videos posted on social media showing riot police officers spraying tear gas in one confrontation and smashing vehicle windshields in another.  Like their counterparts in Lebanon and Iraq, the protests in Iran on Friday were set off by economic anxiety,  but some quickly assumed an antigovernment tone. Iranians across political factions — both hard-liners and reformists —  expressed fury on social media, saying the price increases would only hurt the people and create more loopholes for financial corruption.   Some said the timing of the policy change was especially ill advised, given the popular unrest that has convulsed Lebanon and Iraq. “We will reclaim our rights but not be oppressed,” chanted hundreds of men and women blocking the road at a sit-in in the southern city of Ahwaz. In Mashhad, a religiously conservative city in the northeast, people turned off their cars to create traffic jams and shouted, “Rouhani, shame on you, let go of the country!” Iran announced the policy in a statement by the heads of its three key branches —  government, parliament and judiciary — to signal unity. Two energy analysts close to the government in Iran said that Mr. Rouhani had opposed the policy because of concern that it could cost his faction major losses in the coming parliamentary elections. One of the analysts said that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, had overruled Mr. Rouhani.  An announcement carried on state-run television described the changes as a way to help fund subsidies for about 60 million Iranians, or around three-quarters of the population. But the timing of the changes, coming without warning, suggests the government was worried there would be a backlash for increasing the price of gasoline in a stressed economy, in which inflation already is running by some estimates at 40 percent. The immediate effect of the change also appeared to be an attempt to prevent motorists from mobbing gasoline stations to fuel up beforehand.  “Clearly, making this decision in the middle of the night, to take effect immediately, right before a weekend, reflected their concerns about the political implications,” said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. While official media said the price increase was unrelated to the budget, it came as the government was scrambling for ways to compensate for a stark decline in revenue from oil exports, which have shrunk because of sanctions the Trump administration imposed after it withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018. “All of these games carry one message: The treasury is empty and the only way they have to fill it is to take from the people’s pockets,” said Maysam Sharifi, an oil and energy trader in Tehran. Iran has long planned to cut energy subsidies as part of an economic reform plan. Mr. Rouhani’s predecessor,  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, also cut subsidies and created a cash handout system to Iranian families instead, but economists said that policy led to inflation and market instability. Some Iranian economists warned that the new energy policy would fail for a number of reasons. The price increases are not significant enough to give the government a big financial boost — estimated at $800 million a year. But for ordinary Iranians, the added expense could breed resentment and lost confidence. “There will be no positive impact in the economy,” said Alireza Salavati a political economist in London. “This policy is poorly planned and terribly executed and will result in more inflation and instability.”  Gasoline has remained a relative bargain in Iran because it is heavily subsidized. The low price also has been partly blamed for undisciplined consumption and has contributed to the country’s urban pollution problem. Under the changes, the price for a liter of gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, or about 13 cents, from 10,000 rials per liter on Thursday, and a monthly ration for each private car was set at 60 liters. Any purchases over that limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter. The change was all the more jarring because Iran is endowed with vast quantities of fossil fuels. The Energy Information Administration of the United States ranks Iran as possessing the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and second largest natural gas reserves. Just last Sunday, President Rouhani bragged that an enormous oil field holding 53 billion barrels of crude had been discovered in southwest Iran, which if confirmed would give the country about 210 billion barrels and make it the No. 3 country in oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia, with 298 billion, and Venezuela, with 303 billion, according to statistics from BP.     ']",The timing of the announcement suggested an urgent scramble to fill a budget gap caused partly by severe American sanctions. Angry protests over the price increases soon followed.
Along Alberta’s Cowboy Trail,2019-11-15,By Ian Austen,"['This week I traveled around southern Alberta to report on the province’s mood after its severe rebuke of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party in the recent federal election. Naturally I spoke with politicians, including Premier Jason Kenney, and political analysts. But I also tried to meet a wide array of Albertans, traveling south from Calgary to Longview. While there I was reminded, in a very personal way, of the direct connection to the province’s history many Albertans hold, as well as the roller coaster ways of its oil and gas industry. Alberta Highway 22, the Cowboy Trail, is the scenic route to Longview, although simply calling it scenic is greatly understating things. Looming to the west of Alberta’s foothills country, the Rocky Mountains were spectacularly painted with fresh snow. (The early and heavy snowfalls were less welcomed by farmers in southern Alberta who are now relying on a break in the weather to finally finish harvesting.) The foothills are the epicenter of the ranching lore that remains a major part of Alberta’s collective identity even if relatively few of its citizens now spend their days moving herds around grasslands. The Twin Cities Hotel in the center of Longview also signifies another time in the area’s history. At its north end, a replica wooden oil derrick looms. While the massive reservoir found under the Leduc No. 1 well in 1947, near Edmonton to the north, turned Alberta into a major oil power, its energy industry actually started down in the Turner Valley area at the height of the Great Depression. Like the oil sands center of Fort McMurray before the oil price collapse about five years ago, Longview became famous as a boom town, one so lively it presumptively adopted the name Little New York. But it wasn’t alone. Its twin, and the source of the hotel’s name when it opened in 1938, was Little Chicago, just up the highway to the north. Both became places to make good money, quickly. In cities like Calgary, native-born Albertans often seem like curiosities. The province has long lured people from across Canada and around the world. That includes Mr. Kenney, who was born in Ontario and raised in Saskatchewan. But because Alberta became a province only in 1905, it still doesn’t take much effort to find people whose grandparents and even parents were part of the European settlement of what has become Alberta’s farming and ranching areas. The pioneers of Little Chicago included my mother-in-law, Barb Coutts, and her mother, Kitty Leman. Kitty and her husband, Pete, both immigrants from Britain, were trying to farm with little success in Agassiz, British Columbia, when more than 20 wells sprang up in Little Chicago, their flares lighting the town. Kitty, with her daughter in tow, arrived to capture some of the money sloshing around with a cook wagon that catered to oil workers. Pete eventually quit farming, was named postmaster and set up an adjacent store. The opening of the post office, apparently on orders from Ottawa, brought an end to the Little Chicago name. The official replacement was Royalties. Today Royalties isn’t even a ghost town, it has vanished. While a few pump jacks still buck up and down in the area, Leduc changed the equation and the town gradually withered away, its buildings knocked down or hauled away. Alongside Highway 22, uphill from Longview is its only remnant: a memorial cairn topped by a miniature derrick and surrounded by photographs from the glory days, including one of Pete’s store and post office, and interpretive panels. Aside from a brief spell in Calgary during the mid-1950s, Barb went on to live most of her life in Ontario before her death in 2000. But her name still lives on in the foothills even if her onetime hometown doesn’t. On the back of the cairn she is listed, as Barb Leman, among the people who attended the Royalties’ long vanished school before serving in World War II. “I still notice every time when a customer comes in who’s clearly never been here before. They look around for a minute and say out loud to whoever they are with, ‘Oh, it’s a lefty bookstore,’” one of the owners of Toronto’s Another Story Bookshop said. “We must be doing something right if people are still saying that.” For decades the hockey commentator Don Cherry has drawn fans and critics for bombastic comments that, at times, were denounced as racist. This week, he finally went too far. Copenhagen is now world famous as the city that cycles. Less known is that the stage was set for that by the city’s brush with bankruptcy in the 1980s. Recently a hockey team became the first sports squad in the United States to be made up of transgender and nonbinary athletes. The world met the Beatles through Robert Freeman’s photographs. After nearly six months, Hong Kong remains in turmoil. Have the demonstrations and the police response changed the city forever? As artificial intelligence technology learns how people write and talk, it’s also picking up some bad habits.

Russia Frees Norwegian Convicted of Spying in Unusual 3-Way Swap,2019-11-15,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW —\xa0When Russian agents grabbed Frode Berg in front of Moscow’s ritzy Metropol Hotel two years ago, they turned the retired Norwegian border inspector into the symbol of a new Cold War descending on Scandinavia’s Arctic north.  At noon on Friday, Mr. Berg walked free after 23 months in prison on espionage charges, in a spy swap that harked back to the original Cold War. At a border crossing between Lithuania and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, Russia released Mr. Berg, along with two Lithuanians convicted of spying. Lithuania freed two convicted Russian spies. “We are happy Frode Berg is now coming home to Norway, as a free man,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway said in a statement. “I would like to thank the Lithuanian authorities for their cooperation and for their efforts to free Berg.” The unusual three-way swap with two NATO allies underscored the Kremlin’s interest in using foreign citizens arrested in Russia to secure the release of its own citizens abroad. Mr. Berg’s Russian lawyer, Ilya Novikov, said the Russian authorities had sought different deals in return for Mr. Berg’s freedom that they were not able to secure.  “The solution that worked was not the first and the second solution that was considered,” Mr. Novikov said in an interview. “That’s why it took so long. Russia had its own ideas that proved impossible to realize.” One of the Russians released in the swap, Nikolai Filipchenko, was detained in 2015 and accused of trying to recruit Lithuanian security officers to plant bugs in the office and residence of the Lithuanian president. The other, Sergey Moiseyenko, had been in prison since 2014 for spying on NATO and the Lithuanian military.  The two Lithuanians released, Yevgeny Mataitis and Aristidas Tamosaitis, were convicted of espionage in Russia in 2016. The arrest of Mr. Berg in December 2017 shocked his Arctic hometown, Kirkenes, Norway, where the retired border inspector had been active in promoting closer ties with Russia. Many in Kirkenes, a Barents Sea port town a 15-minute drive from the Russian border, took pride in their work to strengthen their remote region’s cultural and economic links with Russia even as geopolitical tensions grew.  But the authorities in Moscow said Mr. Berg had a secret mission on his trips to Russia, accusing him of collecting information about Russian nuclear submarines. Through a lawyer, Mr. Berg last year admitted he believed he was acting as a courier for Norwegian intelligence, but said he was not informed of the risks involved.  “I feel really misused,” Mr. Berg said in a Moscow court appearance last year. Mr. Berg was sentenced to 14 years in prison, and his supporters feared it would be years until he returned. Even if Russia were to consider a spy swap, they said, there appeared to be no Russian spies in Norwegian prisons.  But Friday’s three-way swap shows Russia is prepared to get creative in making deals. The Kremlin is reported to have tried to exchange an Israeli woman arrested with a few grams of marijuana in her luggage at a Moscow airport for a Russian set to be extradited from Israel to the United States on hacking charges.  That effort failed this week after Israel went ahead with the Russian hacker’s extradition. In September, Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners, with Russia returning a Ukrainian filmmaker, Oleg Sentsov, who had been jailed in Russia after being convicted on what were widely seen as trumped-up terrorism charges, and 24 sailors detained late last year in waters near Crimea. “Any foreign citizen detained in Russia is a hostage, and he must be exchanged for someone or for something,” said Mr. Novikov, Mr. Berg’s lawyer, who also represented several of the Ukrainians in the September swap. Henrik Pryser Libell contributed reporting from Oslo. ']","A retired Norwegian border inspector, two Lithuanians and two convicted Russian spies were exchanged."
Germany Passes Climate-Protection Law to Ensure 2030 Goals,2019-11-15,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Germany enshrined its fight against climate change into law on Friday in a bid to meet its targets under the Paris Agreement, approving a raft of measures including a $60 billion spending package, a fee system for carbon emissions and taxes to make flying more expensive.  The law, which passed the lower house of Parliament and is expected to pass the upper house later this year, has been sharply criticized by opposition lawmakers and climate scientists alike for its lack of ambition and scope. They say it will not be enough to get the country to achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 55 percent of 1990s levels by 2030. “You have failed in humanity’s task of protecting the climate,” Anton Hofreiter, leader of the opposition Green Party caucus in Parliament, told lawmakers ahead of the vote on Friday. Germany’s leader, Angela Merkel, who was known as the “climate chancellor” when she first took office in 2005 after making a name for herself as environment minister, had vowed to prioritize the issue in her final term in office. In September, after months of debate, her government passed a climate package that forms the heart of the new law. The environment minister, Svenja Schulze, told reporters after the vote: “I am very happy that the centerpiece of the package, the climate action law, has now been passed. It is the central point, the linchpin, with which climate policy in Germany will really change.”  Germany is Europe’s largest economy, and it has sought for years to revolutionize its energy sector by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy such as solar, wind and biogas, while cutting climate-killing emissions. But the country fell behind this year, and the government admitted that it would be able to cut emissions by only 32 percent of 1990s levels by 2020, not the targeted goal of 40 percent. Under the new law, ministries must make specific emissions reductions in their sectors, such as energy, transportation or housing, and take additional steps if necessary to meet them. An important element of the package is a domestic carbon pricing scheme that will force companies to pay an initial 10 euros, about $11, for a ton of carbon dioxide emissions from heating and transportation. Climate scientists and members of the Greens have derided the price — which is to increase to €35 by 2025 — as too low to be effective.  The Greens hold more seats in the upper house of Parliament, reflecting their representation in Germany’s 16 states, and have vowed to use their strength there and in regional legislatures to tighten aspects of the law.  Included in the €54 billion, or about $60 billion, spending package are incentives for buying electric cars, replacing oil-burning furnaces and better insulating private properties. The law also includes tax breaks for train tickets and tax increases to be levied on the price of airline tickets — all aimed at making it more attractive for people to choose trains, which emit lower levels of carbon dioxide, over higher-emitting planes.  At the same time, the package includes increased benefits for commuters to avoid a backlash as occurred in France, where a proposed gas tax increase set off months of violent demonstrations by the “Yellow Vest” movement.  Further incentives in the law foresee supporting the expansion of green energy, such as allowing communities a stake in local wind parks. Lawsuits have slowed the building of many proposed wind parks, hampering their expansion. Climate scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who assessed the package at the heart of the law said that without a higher price on carbon emissions, effective monitoring and better integration with other European Union nations, the legislation would not be enough for Germany to meet its 2030 goals.  “The climate package is, at best, an indication of a change of direction” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the director of the institute. “but this has not yet taken place.”']",The law aims to get the country in line to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to meet Paris Agreement targets.
Dueling Matteos Battle for the Future of Italy,2019-11-17,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pity the weak and wobbly new Italian government. While its incompatible coalition partners pretend to tolerate one another, they are relegated to being nervous bystanders, and potential casualties, in the real fight for power: the Battle of the Two Matteos. Technically speaking, the former center-left prime minister Matteo Renzi and the popular anti-migrant nationalist leader Matteo Salvini may be out of power. But their sparring has come to dominate Italy’s political life and the debate over the country’s direction. The two Matteos share more than just a name. Both are ambitious. Both are extremely talented men in their 40s who have spent their entire professional lives in politics. Each represents a strikingly different vision of Italy’s future. Most of all, they need each other to get back into power.  Mr. Salvini needs the once high-flying Mr. Renzi as a punching bag — mocking him as a “misunderstood genius” whose feats “Italians didn’t notice”— to maintain his Everyman appeal as he seeks to destabilize the government and strengthen his policies against immigrants and the European Union. And Mr. Renzi needs Mr. Salvini as a boogeyman — he called him a “monster” — to elevate his profile and convince liberals that only he can keep the nationalist at bay while pushing forward his pro-globalization, pro-European and pro-American positions.  “Salvini is the perfect enemy from this point of view,” Mr. Renzi said in an interview in his Senate office, decorated with notes from former President Barack Obama.  Mr. Renzi’s support has dwindled since he resigned as prime minister in 2016, and he recently left the Democratic Party he once led to start an offshoot, Italia Viva, which for now is polling at only around 6 percent.  Mr. Salvini stumbled, with a nudge from Mr. Renzi, from his perch as interior minister this summer after dominating an Italian government that wrought havoc on the European Union with its crackdowns on migrants, skepticism about the euro and breaking of budgetary rules.  The removal of Mr. Salvini, a hard-right demagogue who seemed to the establishment a ticking time bomb poised to take control of the eurozone’s third-largest economy, prompted sighs of relief from the markets and Brussels.  But Mr. Salvini’s fall from power has not stopped his incessant campaigning, rattling the awkward government alliance of the populist Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party.  As he racks up electoral victories in regions once considered liberal strongholds, Mr. Salvini has applied excruciating external pressure on the coalition. At the same time, Mr. Renzi has proved himself an expert palace operator, applying internal pressure and gaining outsize influence from his seat in the Senate.  “I am proud of having been very Machiavellian,” Mr. Renzi said, adding that Mr. Salvini clearly did not foresee his play and that everyone prematurely counted him out as dead. “And then with a palace maneuver I sent home Europe’s most dangerous populist. So I proved that the old lion still has claws.”    Indeed, Mr. Salvini might still be in power were it not for him.  This summer, at the height of his popularity, Mr. Salvini pulled the plug on his own coalition with the Five Star Movement, in a bid for new elections. He said he wanted “full powers.”  But the plan backfired, when Five Star, surprisingly, turned to the Democratic Party to form a new parliamentary majority, leaving Mr. Salvini out of power. The two parties had loathed each other till the moment they decided to join forces.  Mr. Renzi had spent the three years since his resignation as prime minister excoriating Five Star as a band of anti-democratic hatemongers.  But when Mr. Salvini overreached, Mr. Renzi pounced. Recognizing Mr. Salvini as a greater threat, he urged his Democratic Party to join forces with Five Star. That well-concealed dagger thrust was just the start of what Mr. Renzi now envisions as a contest between the two men that will take years to unfold and potentially end in an electoral showdown.  “We won the battle inside the palace,” he said. “Now we have to win it among the people.” For the time being, Mr. Renzi said his mission was keeping Mr. Salvini out of power long enough to prevent him from appointing a new Italian head of state in 2022, an institutional position he said represented a final check on Mr. Salvini’s power. In 2014, Mr. Renzi won more than 40 percent of the Italian electorate in European Union elections. But he never was directly elected as prime minister. In 2016, he bet his popularity, and office, on a referendum to streamline Italy’s government drastically and a promise to give future prime ministers greater powers. Opposition came from across the political spectrum and he lost, clearing the way for Mr. Salvini’s rise. Mr. Renzi, who was presenting his economic vision across Italy this weekend, acknowledged that he was now in no position to compete with Mr. Salvini, Italy’s reigning populist, in a popularity contest. (Mr. Salvini declined to comment.)  But the fragmented system Mr. Renzi failed to overhaul now plays in his favor. He has been able to exercise significant sway with small but committed parliamentary support and minimal backing in polls. “I play by the rules that this country has,” he said with a shrug. “I wanted to play tennis, but if you make me play Ping-Pong, I will play Ping-Pong. And don’t complain if you lose.” Once the new government was formed with his loyalists in key positions, Mr. Renzi bailed on the Democratic Party, arguing that it was too stuck in its old leftist ways.  He started his new party, Italia Viva, which has enough parliamentary support to bring down the current government if Mr. Renzi decided to withhold his backing.  Suddenly, Mr. Renzi mattered again. The two Matteos recently faced off on a television talk show under a backdrop depicting them in fencing masks and crossing swords. The cover of the newspaper Il Foglio similarly showed them ready to brawl. “The first rule of Fight Club,” Mr. Salvini was imagined saying, “is to make everybody talk about Fight Club.” The new governing coalition has in the process been relegated to spectator status in the battle of the titan Matteos. As it tries to pass a budget and prevent the closing of a major factory, members are nervous that every misstep, every raised tax and slashed benefit, will push their supporters toward one Matteo or the other. Mr. Salvini, who is by far Italy’s most popular politician with about 40 percent support in the polls, is eager to press his advantage by causing the immediate collapse of the new government. He is using strong showings in regional elections to make the case that the people are behind him. Last month, his candidate trounced an opponent backed by Five Star and the Democratic Party in traditionally liberal Umbria. But Mr. Renzi wants the government to last long enough for Mr. Salvini’s momentum to fade, or so he hopes, and build up his own base.  Both are chasing the same sliver of business-minded voters who have long gravitated toward the Forza Italia party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, at 83, is a faded force.  There is, however, a more fundamental problem for Mr. Renzi: Many Italians simply find him insufferable.  “It’s crazy,” Mr. Renzi said in acknowledgment of the rage against him. “Italians don’t like ambitious people, and I am ambitious,” he said. “I am ambitious for myself; if I weren’t ambitious I wouldn’t have become prime minister at 39.” He attributed the anger to years of character assassination by Five Star, the League and leftist critics in the Democratic Party. He cited the disruption he caused to the Italian establishment as the self-styled “Demolition Man.” He said the church did not like his gay rights laws, and the unions did not like his job market reforms. There is much truth in that critique. But it is also true that Mr. Renzi has a boundless ego and dismissive manner, a tendency to personalize politics, to surround himself with local loyalists and to herald major changes hardly perceived by many Italians. And he’s sneaky. In 2014, he publicly told the prime minister of his own party not to worry about him trying to take his job. Then he took his job.  In 2016, he promised to leave politics if he lost a key referendum. He lost and didn’t leave politics.  In 2019 he said he’d stick with the Democratic Party and would never form his own little party. Then he left the Democratic Party and formed his own little party. His defense has essentially been that everybody flip-flops. “There is not a political leader in Italy today who can say that he hasn’t changed his mind with respect to his own future,” he said recently at the Foreign Press Club, “exactly like I did.”']",Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and the popular anti-migrant leader Matteo Salvini may be out of power.

A 9-Year-Old Is About to Get a University Degree. He Has #Giganticplans.,2019-11-15,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — He doesn’t play chess or any musical instruments. But he loves Fortnite and Minecraft and watches Netflix. Soon, Laurent Simons, 9, of Belgium will become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university. For this, his teachers and others have called him a genius. He simply says, “I’m quite lazy.” That’s because he’s not into sports.  “A lot of people have stereotypes about young geniuses,” his father, Alexander, a dentist, said in a phone interview on Friday. That’s because the world has long been fascinated by prodigies celebrated for their ability to master an instrument, graduate at a young age or achieve outstanding sports performances.  Mozart composed music at age 5.  Picasso was 9 years old when he made his first painting. But in an era when social media carries a certain cachet and influencers make gobs of money posing with products, Laurent is not your typical child prodigy. He’s into Instagram, for one. And as of Friday, he had more than 13,000 followers. Laurent, who was born in Ostende, Belgium, studies electrical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. He entered when he was 8 and is set to complete a three-year program in 10 months. If all goes well and he completes his final project — about a brain-connected electrical chip — he will walk out a graduate in December. “Then, I want to study medicine, and do a Ph.D. and make artificial organs,” he said. Laurent grew up in Belgium with his grandparents while his parents worked in the Netherlands. He started primary school when he was 4, and went to high school at 6, according to his father. He now lives with his parents in Amsterdam. “His grandparents always taught us he’s very special,” Alexander Simons said about his son. “We thought they were taking him too seriously.” Now, he and his wife do, too. And Laurent’s teachers at the university say they were blown away.  “Laurent’s absorption capacity is very high, which means that everything goes much faster and we can cover a lot more material in a short span of time,” said Peter Baltus, a professor of integrated electronics at the university who is the boy’s mentor. “It’s been quite special and enjoyable.” Mr. Baltus  confirmed that Laurent was on track to graduate before the end of the year. Outside of school, Mr. Simons argued, Laurent was like any child of his age: playing video games on his smartphone and sometimes taking a swim. On the other hand, he watches TV series like “The Blacklist,” and his I.Q. is 145, his father said.  It’s fair to say that his parents have helped turn their son into a mini-celebrity, making him available for scores of interviews and organizing news conferences. In the age of instant fame, young bright minds on social media platforms do not go unnoticed for too long. On Laurent’s Instagram account, a photo shows him sitting in front of a television crew. The caption, “Busy Week With Interviews!!” The hashtags #laurentsimons and #giganticplans followed. Other photos show him by a pool next to women wearing bikinis, with former Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium and flanked by his grandparents. Asked about the adult themes displayed on the account created under his son’s name, Mr. Simons said the parents managed the account. The posts echo those of other accounts of young celebrities whose parents direct their presence — and fame — online.

Jennifer Arcuri Says Boris Johnson Cast Her Aside Like a ‘One-Night Stand’,2019-11-17,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — An American businesswoman has accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain of casting her aside “like I am some gremlin” or “some fleeting one-night stand” since  their past relationship became public and drew the scrutiny of a police watchdog.  The woman, Jennifer Arcuri, who is believed to be living in California, made her comments in an interview with the British broadcaster ITV News that is to air Sunday night. “I’ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours,” Ms. Arcuri said, as if addressing Mr. Johnson directly.  “I’ve kept your secrets, and I’ve been your friend,” she said. “And I don’t understand why you’ve blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one-night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn’t — and you know that.” The interview threatens to revive a crisis and comes at a pivotal time for Mr. Johnson, who is actively campaigning across Britain for the Dec. 12 general elections. He became prime minister only in July, replacing Theresa May, after he was elected leader of the Conservative Party.  The timing of Ms. Arcuri’s interview was not lost on Mr. Johnson’s aides. When asked for comment, 10 Downing Street said to contact the Conservative Party, which did not immediately respond on Sunday. But a party spokesman told ITV News that “any claims of impropriety in office are untrue and unfounded,” and that these are “vexatious and politically motivated attacks.”  The statement was in accordance with what has been the party line since Mr. Johnson’s conduct as mayor of London has come under scrutiny. He was accused of giving favorable treatment to Ms. Arcuri by assisting her in securing sponsorship money and taking her on trade missions that she was unqualified for.  Mr. Johnson and Ms. Arcuri have denied any wrongdoing.  The Government Internal Audit Agency reviewed a grant that Hacker House, the company for which Ms. Arcuri is chief executive, received in February from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, and found the award of 100,000 pounds, or about $130,000, to be “appropriate.” But in September, City Hall referred Mr. Johnson to a police watchdog for a possible investigation, saying that the accusations, if true, could amount to misconduct in public office. “It has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms. Jennifer Arcuri, and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms. Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances where she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,” said the referral letter, attributed to the Greater London Authority’s monitoring officer, Emma Strain. “This will take time to thoroughly assess and consider before any decision is taken as to whether it is necessary to investigate this matter,” the police watchdog said in a statement.  The ITV program, “Exposure,” will feature Ms. Arcuri in an episode titled “When Boris Met Jennifer.” Ms. Arcuri said that she has tried in vain to get in touch with Mr. Johnson, seeking help to handle the media scrutiny. She told ITV that she had become “collateral damage” while the prime minister seemed to have escaped unscathed. She said that when she called his personal number, she was passed to someone who spoke Chinese. Another time, she said, Mr. Johnson hung up the moment he heard her voice.  She told the broadcaster that she felt she had been “brushed off” as if she was “one of Kennedy’s girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard.” (She apparently was referring to President John F. Kennedy.)  The show suggests, according to ITV News, that the pair had a four-year affair.  Ms. Arcuri did not directly admit to an affair with Mr. Johnson, according to the broadcaster, but said that “half the people” who reached out to her after the story about their relationship was revealed had advised her to “admit the affair, fall on the sword, get it over with.” When asked if Mr. Johnson — who is believed to be living with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, at 10 Downing Street — had been in love with her, Ms. Arcuri replied that if he was, “then he should have come and get me.” “When?” the journalist John Ware asks in the interview.  “In another life,” Ms. Arcuri says with a resigned smile. “This one didn’t work out.”']",The American businesswoman’s ties to the British prime minister have come under scrutiny.
Hong Kong Violence Escalates as Police and Protesters Clash at University,2019-11-17,"By Edward Wong, Mike Ives, Tiffany May, Katherine Li and Lam Yik Fei","['HONG KONG — Hundreds of Hong Kong activists armed with firebombs and bows-and-arrows on Monday battled riot police who have laid a days-long siege to a university, the most violent confrontation yet in a half-year of protests.  Early Monday, the police tried storming the campus at the main entrance and made some arrests. But the occupiers fought back with dozens of firebombs and set barricades ablaze, forcing the police to retreat. As day broke, the occupiers and the police were still locked in the standoff at Hong Kong Polytechnic University that began Saturday night, and smoke billowed from the grounds. Some protesters on Monday morning raced for the exits, only to be met with volleys of tear gas.  The police used tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and armored vehicles to try breach the barricades all day on Sunday. But activists resisted into the night. One police officer was hit in the leg by an arrow, while student leaders said protesters suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after being struck by the water cannon.  The clashes were the culmination of the most disruptive week of the monthslong protests, a period that has focused a global spotlight on the growing desperation of the pro-democracy activists and aggressive efforts by the police to suppress them. It is a sign the conflict is turning more violent as the territory prepares to hold elections later this month. The activists are struggling against the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing to preserve autonomy for Hong Kong, a political system guaranteed for 50 years by an agreement between Beijing and London. The British handed over the global financial hub in 1997. The rising tensions and the potential for greater control over Hong Kong’s political and legal systems by the Communist Party have raised questions over the long-term commercial viability of Hong Kong and the integrity of its fraying social fabric. In Washington, American officials said they were monitoring the clashes as well as reviewing a report by The New York Times on leaked internal Communist Party documents showing how party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, had set up internment camps to hold one million or more Muslims in another frontier area, Xinjiang.  Trump administration officials and Congress have been holding discussions on whether to impose separate sets of sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. But President Trump has held back for fear of upsetting trade talks. Hong Kong is scheduled to hold district council elections next Sunday. Some residents worry the government might postpone the vote, though Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the territory, has said the elections will be held on time. A small number of supporters of Communist Party rule, as well as Hu Xijin,  the chief editor of Global Times, a state-run news organization in Beijing, had become so outraged by the Sunday clashes that they said the police should use live ammunition. The occupation of the university has forced a weeklong shutdown of a tunnel leading to the business districts on Hong Kong Island from Kowloon, and activists said they planned more traffic blockades on Monday. The university president, Jin-Guang Teng, said Monday morning that he had negotiated a temporary truce with the police, but suggested occupiers still would have to turn themselves in to the police after leaving the campus. The clashes of the past week began when protesters changed from a regular routine of weekend protests to disrupting traffic on workdays. The disruptions and attempts by the police to breach campuses — considered a last refuge by activists — quickly led to protesters occupying five universities, two of which sit astride key transportation routes.  The death of a student from a fall earlier this month and two dramatic violent acts also set the city on edge — a traffic policeman shot an unarmed protester, and activists set a man on fire after he confronted them.  Protesters abandoned four of the universities over the weekend, but those at Polytechnic University held on. Hardcore activists converged there, while more moderate ones left on Sunday as the police surrounded the campus. The police arrested dozens trying to flee, including first-aid volunteers. Mainstream supporters of the movement drove to the campus to try to get the police to back off. On Sunday night, the police threatened to use lethal force if the protesters did not leave. “I know that there is a possibility that the police will fire live bullets on us tonight, but right now, we have no choice,” William Lau, 22, a protester on campus, said around midnight. He estimated there were about 500 activists on site at that time. About 50 were arrested after trying to leave, he said, so others were wary of trying to exit. “The police would never just let us walk out like that,” he said. “I know that some want to leave now but don’t know how, while a fair number want to stay and fight.” Right outside the campus, pro-democracy lawmakers, a top Roman Catholic official, an American pastor and a student leader called on the Hong Kong government to intervene to prevent bloodshed. “I want to seek help from the government to stop the police force from their operation and avoid tragedy,” said Owan Li, a student representative on the university council. As the police fired tear gas, Bishop Joseph Ha tried entering with the lawmakers and the American pastor, William Devlin of the Bronx, but were turned away by the police. “If the police are to launch a clearance, they should use as minimal force as possible because lives are precious,” Mr. Ha said.  Mr. Devlin said in a telephone interview that he had been on campus for about four hours as the clashes unfolded and had left, but was trying to re-enter. “They were not being deterred,” he said of the protesters. “They were ready to be arrested. They said, ‘We stand for freedom, dignity, democracy, human rights.’” Mr. Devlin said he had been on the front line in the late afternoon Sunday when the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters. He said he had seen protesters throw 10 to 20 firebombs to deter the police from advancing. At least two were armed with bows and arrows, he said. Louis Lau, the police superintendent, said before midnight that an officer had fired a live round at a vehicle charging toward officers in an area near campus. “Coldblooded rioters can only imitate terror acts,” he said.   Protesters confronted the police throughout the night in nearby neighborhoods to try to draw them away from the campus. The presidents of five universities released a statement calling for restraint by all sides and asking everyone on the campus to leave. Denise Ho, a pro-democracy pop singer who has been banned on the mainland by Beijing, invoked the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre on Twitter and said, “World, please help Hong Kong and save our students!” The police tried sending an armored vehicle across a bridge on the east side of campus. Protesters set the vehicle on fire with bombs, forcing it to retreat. Mr. Hu, the chief editor of Global Times, posted a video of the vehicle aflame on Twitter and said, “Police should be permitted to fire live rounds in this case to counter rioters.” The violence came after protesters at the university on Friday prepared for a long siege, as they poured gasoline into glass bottles to make hundreds or thousands of bombs and practiced throwing those into an empty swimming pool. They also did target practice with catapult-style slingshots and bows-and-arrows. The police began advancing around 10 p.m. Saturday, and the clashes reached a high pitch on Sunday afternoon. In nearby Kowloon Tong on Saturday, Chinese soldiers jogged out of their barracks by Hong Kong Baptist University and cleared bricks from streets that had been placed there by protesters to block traffic. The soldiers wore T-shirts and basketball jerseys, and carried brooms. The Hong Kong garrison of the People’s Liberation Army is based in 19 sites once occupied by the British military. Even though Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since 1997, they almost never venture into the city. The cleanup, which was lauded by Chinese state-run news organizations, prompted a torrent of criticism from local residents. Pro-democracy lawmakers issued a statement saying that the local government and the Chinese military had ignored restrictions imposed on the troops by local laws. Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Mike Ives, Tiffany May and Katherine Li reported from Hong Kong. Paul Mozur and Ezra Cheung contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']","As riot police tried storming a campus occupied by activists, they were met by protesters fighting back with Molotov cocktails and bows-and-arrows."
5 Takeaways From the Leaked Files on China’s Mass Detention of Muslims,2019-11-16,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG —\xa0Internal Chinese government documents obtained by The New York Times have revealed new details on the origins and execution of China’s mass detention of as many as one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region. The 403 pages reveal how the demands of top officials, including President Xi Jinping, led to the creation of the indoctrination camps, which have long been shrouded in secrecy. The documents also show that the government acknowledged internally that the campaign had torn families apart — even as it explained it as a modest job-training effort — and that the program faced unexpected resistance from officials who feared a backlash and economic damage. A member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity brought the documents to light in hopes that their disclosure would prevent Communist Party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping responsibility for the program. It is one of the most significant leaks of papers from inside the ruling Communist Party in decades. Here are five takeaways from the documents. The Chinese government has described its efforts in Xinjiang as a benevolent campaign to curb extremism by training people to find better jobs. But the documents reveal the party’s efforts to organize a ruthless campaign of mass detention in the name of curbing terrorism, a program whose consequences they discussed with cool detachment. The papers describe how parents were taken away from children, how students wondered who would pay their tuition, and how crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of workers. Yet officials were directed to tell people that they should be grateful for the Communist Party’s help, and that if they complained, they might make things worse for their family. Mr. Xi, the party chief, laid the groundwork for the crackdown in a series of speeches delivered in private to officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang in April 2014, just weeks after Uighur militants stabbed more than 150 people at a train station, killing 31.  He called for an all-out “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism” using the “organs of dictatorship” and to show “absolutely no mercy.” The documents do not record him directly ordering the creation of the detention facilities, but he ascribed Xinjiang’s instability to the widespread influence of toxic beliefs and demanded they be eradicated. Terrorist attacks abroad and the drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan heightened the leadership’s fears and helped shape the crackdown. Officials argued that attacks in Britain resulted from policies that put “human rights above security,” and Mr. Xi urged the party to emulate aspects of America’s “war on terror” after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Xi signaled a break from the policies of his predecessor, Hu Jintao, who responded to deadly 2009 riots in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, with a clampdown but also stressed economic development as a cure for ethnic discontent — longstanding party policy.  “In recent years, Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise,” Mr. Xi said in a speech to party officials. “This goes to show that economic development does not automatically bring lasting order and security.” The internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment in August 2016 of a zealous new party boss for the region, Chen Quanguo. He distributed Mr. Xi’s speeches to justify the campaign and exhorted officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up.” Mr. Chen led a campaign akin to one of Mao’s turbulent political crusades, in which top-down pressure on local officials encouraged overreach, and any expression of doubt was treated as a crime. The crackdown encountered doubts and resistance from local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth. Mr. Chen responded by purging officials suspected of standing in his way, including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps. That leader, Wang Yongzhi, built sprawling detention facilities and increased security funding in the county he oversaw. But in a 15-page confession, which he most likely signed under duress, he worried that the crackdown would harm ethnic relations and that the mass detentions would make it impossible to achieve the economic progress he needed to earn a promotion.  Quietly, he ordered the release of more than 7,000 internment camp inmates — an act of defiance for which he would be detained, stripped of power and prosecuted.']","Hundreds of pages of internal papers offer new insight into how the program began, how it was justified even as the damage it caused was clear, and how some officials resisted it.

"India, Choking on Toxic Air, Tries Something New: An Oxygen Bar",2019-11-15,By Suhasini Raj and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — As air pollution shot up to dangerous levels across India on Friday, underscoring an already dire public health crisis, a crowd descended on a small shop in New Delhi for a novel solution: a 15-minute hit of clean oxygen. At Oxy Pure, a self-styled  “oxygen bar,” customers strapped tubes to their noses and inhaled scents of lavender, lemongrass or spearmint. In the absence of other options, Lisa Dwivedi, a Ukrainian living in the city, said she came to the bar because she was fed up with having itchy eyes, a runny nose and a swollen throat. “I don’t know if it’s psychological, but it makes me feel good to know I am inhaling pure oxygen, if only for 15 minutes,” she said. The air pollution crisis in India has become so severe that officials in the capital declared a public health emergency earlier this month, when levels of deadly particulate matter rose a few dozen times above what the World Health Organization considers safe. Doctors are reporting a surge of patients with severe respiratory problems. This week, New Delhi’s government shut all primary schools for a second time this month because of pollution in the capital region, home to more than 46 million people. But despite air so scary it may be causing brain damage in children, some central government officials have either resisted acknowledging the problem, which has persisted in India for years, or minimized its severity. During an especially poisonous day, when levels of PM 2.5, tiny, cancer-linked particulate matter, rose to some 60 times the safe limit in parts of the capital, Harsh Vardhan, India’s health minister, recommended eating carrots to fight any harmful effects. Another senior lawmaker criticized those who tried to stop farmers from burning their crops, and instead suggested praying to the Hindu god of rain for relief.  So far this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refrained from publicly commenting on the air pollution. His office recently set up a panel to look into it, but a high-level parliamentary meeting on Friday about the pollution was canceled because hardly any officials showed up, according to Indian news outlets. “People are dying and it cannot happen in a civilized country,” a bench of Supreme Court judges said this month about the pollution. “We will not tolerate this. We are making a mockery of everything.” With no imminent solutions, some Indians have tried to step in — with solutions like the oxygen bar. As winds slow during winter months and farmers burn crops to make room for a new harvest, dirty air settles over India’s cities, mixing with construction dust, power plant emissions and fumes from people bursting fireworks to celebrate festivals. Many Indians have become fatalistic about the government taking tougher steps to clean the air, if they even know how dangerous it has become.  Without consistent and strong public messaging, pollution masks are still uncommon in India and those who wear them are sometimes laughed at. This month, people waded into the capital’s stretch of the Yamuna River, which is largely untreated sewage, to wash, clean utensils and take selfies with icebergs of foam formed by industrial waste.  On Thursday, despite the second government shutdown of schools, which lasted from Thursday to Friday, a nonprofit organization sponsored an outdoor run for children. Hundreds of people participated and event banners bore the logo for the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India. During parts of November, officials in New Delhi have tried to lessen the pollution by restricting the use of private vehicles on alternating days, allowing only cars with odd-number license plates to drive on odd dates and cars with even-numbered plates on even-numbered dates. But efforts like this one appeared to have a marginal effect in improving the air, which remained “severe” throughout the capital this week, according to data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.  For Indians worried about the air, options have largely been restricted to buying purifiers, sealing cracks in their homes with blankets and towels, or leaving toxic cities entirely. India’s poorest residents have no choice but to sleep outside in the fog. At Oxy Pure, which is in Select Citywalk, a more upscale mall in New Delhi, customers pay $4 to $6 for 15 minutes of oxygen carried through a nasal cannula. They can choose among seven scents — including eucalyptus, peppermint and cinnamon. Oxy Pure has introduced a “pollution special”: five sessions for the price of four. The owner, Aryavir Kumar, who originally worked as a hotelier, said he did not make a profit from the business, which opened in May. But he plans to open locations in the capital’s airport, and in the cities of Mumbai and Bangalore. “Customers say, ‘Now we have to buy fresh air?’” he said in an interview. “I tell them, ‘Do you not also pay for a bottle of clean drinking water, something you did not do 20 years ago?’”  On Friday morning, Vikram Aiyer, 25, a clean shaven business executive, stopped in to the small store, with its floor-to-ceiling garden installation, water fountains and a replica of a Van Gogh painting, before going to work as a salesman.  He chose eucalyptus as his scent and an attendant in a white lab coat fitted his nostrils with tubes attached to a beaker containing a green liquid. Mr. Aiyer sat in a leathery chair and took a deep breath. “The thought of unadulterated oxygen pumps up my flagging morale in this city,” he said, closing his eyes and exhaling.']","As top officials remain silent, the country’s pollution levels remained hazardous this week, prompting a second closure of schools in the capital and a sometimes desperate search for clean air."
Economic Crisis Looms as Protests Rage in Lebanon,2019-11-15,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Banks across Lebanon have shut their doors this week to protect employees from angry customers demanding their dollars. So that anger has been redirected at the A.T.M.s outside, which are also refusing to give out dollars regardless of how much customers have in their accounts. “I want my dollars,” Sonia Badran, a mother of four married to an elevator repairman, said after her third failed trip to the bank this week. Until the country’s dollar crisis is resolved, she said, anti-government protests should continue. “Let them stay on the streets,” she said. “This is not acceptable.” After nearly a month of mass protests criticizing Lebanon’s political elite for corruption and mismanagement, the country’s long-term economic problems are increasingly colliding with the daily lives of its citizens. American dollars — long used in tandem with the Lebanese pound — have grown scarce because worries over the political turmoil have caused more people to try to withdraw their money. So employers have struggled to pay salaries, tenants to pay rent, and traders to pay for goods and services from abroad. Relief appears remote, analysts and economists say; the underlying problems have been building for so long that they can only be fixed through long-term policies that are likely to cause pain. And putting such initiatives in place would require a strong government, which Lebanon lacks. “The problem is that the current policies are unsustainable,” said Nasser Saidi, a former Lebanese economy minister. Putting the country on the right track would require simultaneously dealing with a large budget deficit and bringing down public debt — a gargantuan task. “You really don’t have much choice,” he said. “You are at the edge of the precipice and you are looking down, so unless you do that, where is this going to end?” Protests across Lebanon erupted on Oct. 17 after the government suggested it could raise revenue by taxing calls made through internet services like WhatsApp. For many Lebanese, it\xa0was insulting that the country’s leaders would try to use their calls to subsidize the state after decades of mismanagement and looting. Demonstrations have continued since in a movement that has remained largely leaderless, with demands ranging from economic reforms to trials for corrupt politicians to the complete ouster of the political elite. One month in, the protesters’ main victory was the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Oct. 29. On Friday, there was talk that the country’s leading political parties had agreed to nominate Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, as his successor. Mr. Safadi could begin trying to form a new government next week, Lebanon’s foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, told a local television station. But such processes often take month in Lebanon and it was not immediately clear how much backing Mr. Safadi had. Nor was it clear whether his appointment would assuage the protests. In many ways, the wealthy 75-year-old, who has extensive business ties to Saudi Arabia, is from the same class of leaders the protesters went into the streets to get rid of. Any new government that does not have buy-in from the protesters will struggle to put in place meaningful policies, said Michael Young, a senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “Any government that doesn’t satisfy the public’s demands is going to start basically in a hole,” he said. “It will be a government that is opposed by the people and it will have little legitimacy to impose reforms.” In addition to calming the country’s immediate political crisis, any new government will have to deal with deep-rooted economic problems that have been brewing for years, finally leaving citizens unable to pull their own dollars out of the bank. For more than two decades, the Lebanese have simultaneously used American dollars and Lebanese pounds, an arrangement made possible by a central bank policy that kept the exchange rate fixed at about 1,500 pounds to the dollar. The two currencies were used so interchangeably in daily life that it was common to pay for a meal or taxi in one currency and receive change in the other, or in a combination of both. But maintaining that rate required continually bringing new dollars into the country, usually by enticing wealthy investors to make large dollar deposits for high interest rates, a strategy that some economists have compared to a Ponzi scheme. “In some sense, that is the definition of a Ponzi scheme, other than the fraudulent part,” said Dan Azzi, a former Lebanese bank executive and advanced leadership fellow at Harvard. The policy worked for a long time, but came under stress in recent years as the central bank had to honor the high interest rates it had promised while regional turbulence scared many new investors away. Over time, the gap between what investors had earned on paper and the real money in the central bank grew. “It is almost surreal what is happening,” Mr. Azzi said. “A virtual problem, a theoretical problem that has spilled out in the real world.” Now, the rising demand by both wealthy investors and middle-class bank customers for the limited number of dollars means that there are not enough to go around. That has already weakened the connection between the dollar and the Lebanese pound, whose value has declined on the black market, and undermined confidence in the banks. Even before the protests began last month, about $3 billion had been withdrawn from Lebanese banks, the central bank governor, Riad Salameh, told reporters this week. Another $2 billion was pulled out after banks reopened after the first two weeks of protests. Mr. Salameh insisted that deposits were safe and that no official limits had been placed on dollar withdrawals, but many banks have imposed unofficial limits that change frequently and are not publicly announced. Amid mounting anger over the limits, bank employees began an open strike on Tuesday, saying they needed protection from angry customers. While the banks have been closed, many have stopped dispensing dollars from A.T.M.s and placed new limits on debt and credit card transactions. It is unclear whether such practices are even legal, as there is no law authorizing them, said Karim Nammour, a lawyer with The Legal Agenda, an advocacy group. “We are completely dwelling in a situation without a legal basis,” he said. The inability to get dollars has caused a range of headaches for people who pay school fees or rent in dollars and for businesses that rely on dollars to pay for foreign goods or services.  Some foreign products have disappeared from supermarket shelves, and gas stations ran out of fuel recently until the government stepped in to make sure fuel traders could pay for imports. Elie Abyad, who owns a travel agency with six employees in Beirut, said he has struggled to keep his business going since all foreign plane tickets and hotel reservations must be made in dollars, which his local bank has limited his ability to use. He had tried getting cash from bank branches and A.T.M.s, to no avail, and had paid his employees half of their salaries in pounds since he could not get enough dollars. His customers, too, had their plans fouled up by the new regulations, since they cannot withdraw dollars to pay for foreign trips. Across the country, steady streams of citizens have been trying their luck at A.T.M.s to see if they can manage to get any dollars out — mostly in vain. After trying repeatedly — and ultimately failing — to get $300 of his own money from an A.T.M., Raymond Haddad, a retired official from Lebanon’s national lottery, said he had no way to pay the next installment on a computer for his son because the dealer would accept only dollars and his bank would give him only pounds. “They need to form a new government to get us out of this hole,” Mr. Haddad said. “But it needs to be a government that builds confidence, not just any government.” Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.']","After a monthlong political crisis, Lebanon faces an economic one, too, as the effects of long-term policies crash into citizens’ lives."
"A Victim Not Only of Unjust Laws, but of ‘Unjust Authorities’",2019-11-15,By Aida Alami,"['RABAT, Morocco — When Hajar Raissouni, an investigative journalist with one of Morocco’s only independent news outlets, went to her doctor’s office last August seeking treatment for a vaginal hemorrhage, she was not planning on becoming the center of a national discussion on press freedom, abortion rights and what critics say is the nation’s antiquated penal code.  But on Aug. 31, minutes after she received the treatment, Ms. Raissouni and her fiancé, Rifaat al-Amin, were arrested — just two weeks before their wedding date. At first, she thought they were being robbed. But she quickly realized that the six men in plainclothes holding video cameras were police officers, and that she was being arrested because of her critical reporting on the Moroccan authorities. The couple would eventually be charged with sex outside of marriage and having an abortion, both crimes in the North African kingdom, though the abortion laws are rarely enforced. Ms. Raissouni, who strongly denies having had an abortion, says she was forced by the Moroccan authorities to undergo a pelvic examination that aggravated the hemorrhage, provoking renewed bleeding. Her physician, Dr. Jamal Belkeziz, a second doctor and an office assistant also were arrested, charged with violating abortion laws.  Their trial in September caused a sensation in Morocco, drawing crowds of supporters and protesters and unleashing a torrent of criticism from press freedom and abortion rights advocates, among others. The court’s decision to convict all five and sentence Ms. Raissouni and Mr. al-Amin, who is now her husband, to a year in prison provoked another uproar that was quieted only after the issuance of a royal pardon for all of the defendants on Oct. 16. “We’re relieved that Hajar and her co-defendants are free, but they should have never been arrested in the first place,” said Ahmed Benchemsi, Middle East and North Africa communications director at Human Rights Watch, after the pardon. “A silver lining for this deplorable incident is that a debate was opened about archaic laws in Morocco, and now there’s a growing demand to repel criminalization of nonmarital sex from legal books.” Naturally reserved, Ms. Raissouni is still dealing with the consequences of having her private life discussed for weeks in the national and international news media. But the case thrust her reluctantly into the headlines and onto a list of the top 10 cases of injustice against journalists, and she is determined to use her newfound celebrity to push for a political system with independent institutions and a free press. “I was not just the victim of unjust laws but the victim of unjust authorities,” she said recently in an interview conducted in her apartment in Rabat. “My case wasn’t really about a nonexistent abortion, but it was the result of the arbitrary politics of the state.” As terrible as this experience may have been, it seems fair to say that Ms. Raissouni seemed almost bound to fall afoul of the Moroccan authorities at some point. She was born into a prominent family of landowners, warriors, intellectuals and political dissidents in northern Morocco, and was urged from an early age to hold those in power accountable in a country where injustice largely prevails. She is also a niece of two prominent voices of dissent in Morocco: Soulaimane Raissouni, the editor of Akhbar Al Yaoum, one of the few independent news outlets in Morocco, where she had been working; and Ahmed Raissouni, an Islamist and vocal critic of the state. Her fondest memories growing up were listening to her grandfather recount the exploits of her ancestors who fought some of the country’s biggest wars. When one of her history teachers called her ancestors “traitors” in high school, for having opposed the country’s becoming a joint French-Spanish protectorate in the early 20th century, she took it as a badge of honor.  A great-uncle, Moulay Ahmed Raissouni, was the chief actor in those events. A polarizing figure, often described as both a patriot and a bandit, he touched off an international diplomatic dispute in 1904 by kidnapping a Greek-American playboy, Ion Perdicaris, and his son, demanding a $70,000 ransom. President Theodore Roosevelt, looking for an issue to jump-start his campaign for a second term, promptly dispatched several warships to the coast of Morocco. (It all ended amicably enough with Raissouni getting the ransom and Roosevelt winning re-election.) But the family has occasionally paid a grim price for its resistance to the powerful. Just two years ago, Ms. Raissouni’s father was stoned to death in a dispute with other landowners who were trying to stop him from working some of his fields. The urge to write and express herself came to Ms. Raissouni at an early age. When she was just 9, she wrote an article titled “Peace,” and when she was 12, another one titled “Freedom.” She excelled in school and eventually moved to the capital for college. While studying to become an engineer, to please her father, she secretly pursued a career in journalism, writing under a pen name and giving math lessons to support her writing. She started contributing to Akhbar Al Yaoum in 2016, after stints with other newspapers. She now writes about human rights and politics, and in March received an award for her coverage on illegal immigration.  The newspaper, with fewer than a dozen reporters, has been in existence for only a decade, but its journalists have been dragged into court on a regular basis. Last year, the paper’s founder and publisher, Taoufik Bouachrine, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on sexual assault charges, in a prosecution that the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded was politically motivated. The sentence was increased to 15 years in an appeal trial last month. Ms. Raissouni says she is not sure she is ready to resume her career, preferring to take time to recuperate from the ordeal and the aftermath of the intense exposure. She still retains the signature composure she demonstrated throughout the trial: relaxed, funny and sarcastic, while never showing fear. And she says she is still determined to denounce human rights abuses — perhaps even more so.  She says she emerged from the experience feeling closer to her husband than ever. She met Mr. al-Amin — who fled Sudan for his criticism of the since-deposed president, Omar al-Bashir — on the campus of a university in Rabat only a few months ago, and they were drawn together by their common passion for politics and human rights.  They used to argue about human rights in Morocco, which he considered far more respectful of them and justice than his home country. He sees things differently now, she said, so they have moved on to arguing over a Gandhi quote that hangs on their wall in the living room next to photos of Nelson Mandela. “Victory attained by violence,” it reads, “is tantamount to a defeat for it is momentary.” “We disagree about Gandhi,” she said. “I am not saying that violence should be the response to violence. But you can’t smile and write articles. You have to take to the streets and protest.” And they have one other serious point of contention in Oum Kalthoum, one of the Arab world’s most beloved singers. “Now that you went to jail with me, you need to love what I love,” Ms. Raissouni, who plays the oud and the violin, told her husband laughing. “So you need to listen to Oum Kalthoum.”']",An investigative reporter from a prominent Moroccan family was wrongly accused of having had an abortion. Now she wants to hold officials’ feet to the fire. 
"‘Yellow Vest’ Anniversary Brings Fires, Tear Gas and Dwindled Crowds",2019-11-16,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Clouds of tear gas covered a major square in southern Paris on Saturday as the police attempted to quell a “Yellow Vest” demonstration marking the movement’s anniversary. Protesters, some masked, threw paving stones and set trash cans on fire, while dozens of other demonstrators, a few wearing the yellow road-emergency vests that became the movement’s uniform, milled about on the Place d’Italie at the capital’s southeastern edge. But the mayhem was largely confined to a small area and could not hide the relatively weak mobilization on Saturday. Some 4,700 people demonstrated in Paris, officials said, and 28,000 across the country, compared with the hundreds of thousands who turned out at the movement’s inception last November.  Then, nearly 300,000 turned out for what began as apparently spontaneous demonstrations against a proposed fuel tax rise but quickly broadened into a major social protest movement that rocked the presidency of Emmanuel Macron. By midafternoon on Saturday, the police had made 61 arrests in Paris, down sharply from the hundreds that were the norm throughout months of Saturday protests last fall and winter.  The police canceled a planned protest march through Paris because of the violence at the Place d’Italie, and they earlier closed off the Champs-Élysées, the central avenue that was a focus of previous demonstrations. “All those who are there and who hide their faces will be systematically arrested,” the Paris prefect of police, Didier Lallement, said at a midafternoon news conference, referring to the Place d’Italie. “The rest of Paris is calm,” he added. The protesters, many chanting, “We’re here even if Macron doesn’t want us to be!” and “Happy birthday!” also flooded the Porte de Champerret in the northwest of Paris, attempting to block the ring road around the capital before they were dispersed. Public sympathy for the movement, a cry of protest over stagnating wages and declining living standards, was strong at first, but largely dissipated after weeks of violence tore up sections of Paris and some of the major provincial cities. Mr. Macron quashed the movement by deploying a three-pronged strategy: cash, the unbridled deployment of the police and dialogue. Mr. Macron granted nearly $19 billion in fiscal concessions to the lower-middle-class workers populating the movement, largely in tax breaks and direct subsidies like an increase in the so-called work bonus. Economists estimate that his breaks added some $900 in average purchasing power to French family budgets. In addition, Mr. Macron unleashed France’s tough riot police, resulting in well over 2,000 injuries and dozens of blindings from rubber bullets, along with a significant fear factor that kept people from turning out for the demonstrations.  The president also embarked on a national talking campaign that saw him tour the provinces that were the seedbed of the protest movement, spending hours in dialogue with small-town mayors and citizens over four months. The tactic worked. The Yellow Vests were undermined from within, analysts say, by their failure to coalesce around leaders, fixed goals and a long-term strategy.']",A protest movement that once brought tens of thousands to the streets of Paris has been confined to marginal sites and outmaneuvered by the president whose program it challenged.
Marine Vet Freed by Iran in 2016 Sues U.S. Over Unpaid Compensation,2019-11-18,By Rick Gladstone,"[""When a Marine veteran from Michigan was freed by Iran in 2016, an ordeal of imprisonment, torture and deprivation that had lasted almost four and a half years came to an end. Amir Hekmati was welcomed home as a hero. But his battle with the government in Tehran has given way to a struggle against another country — his own. On Monday, Mr. Hekmati, 36, sued the United States government over its failure to pay any of the compensation promised to him from a special fund for American citizens who are considered victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Known as the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, it was created by Congress in 2015 and has distributed more than $2 billion to thousands of claimants, including Americans held during the 1979-81 Tehran hostage crisis, along with their spouses and children. Administered by the Justice Department, the fund determined nearly two years ago that Mr. Hekmati was eligible for $20 million in compensation, and informed him last December that the first installment, $839,100.35, would be paid in January — ten months ago. While others deemed eligible got their distributions, Mr. Hekmati mysteriously did not, despite inquiries by his lawyer and congressional representatives. “The Fund has offered no explanation for its failure to issue Mr. Hekmati’s distribution,” said the lawsuit, filed at the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington. “Repeated requests by Mr. Hekmati, his legal counsel and members of Congress over the last year for information regarding the timing and status of his distribution have gone unanswered.” Scott Gilbert, Mr. Hekmati’s lawyer, said he had informed the fund on Oct. 11 that he would take legal action if the money was not paid. Later, he received a letter from Deborah L. Connor, an assistant attorney general who serves as special master of the fund, informing him that it wanted to reconsider whether Mr. Hekmati was eligible. No explanation was given. “This is blatant retaliation,” Mr. Gilbert said in a telephone interview. He argued that the fund’s determinations of eligibility “are absolutely final” and reconsiderations are not permissible. As to why the Justice Department delayed the payment and now appears to be questioning whether it should be paid at all, Mr. Gilbert said: “I have no earthly idea. We’ve racked our brains for what it could be.” Ms. Connor said in the letter that the department intended to temporarily reappoint Kenneth R. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer and well-known arbitration expert who was the fund’s original special master and who made the original determination that Mr. Hekmati deserved the compensation, to re-evaluate whether he was eligible. Mr. Feinberg declined to comment and referred inquiries to Peter A. Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. Mr. Carr said in an email that  “we are declining to comment at this time.” An American of Iranian descent, Mr. Hekmati was born in Flagstaff, Ariz., and grew up in Flint, Mich., son of a microbiology professor and an accountant who had emigrated from Iran. He served in the Marines from 2001 to 2005, doing two tours in Iraq. He got his bachelor's degree in economics at the University of Michigan and was about to start his master’s there in 2011, but decided first to travel to Iran to visit his grandmother, whom he had never met. Iranian officials detained him two days before he was to return home and accused him of espionage, which he has consistently denied. Mr. Hekmati was among a group of Americans released by the Iranian authorities in a prisoner swap when the now-endangered nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers took effect in January 2016. He had been imprisoned longer than any of the others and at one point had been threatened with execution. In letters relayed by his family and supporters at home while he was held in Tehran’s Evin Prison, Mr. Hekmati accused the Iranian authorities of using him as a political pawn based on bogus charges. He also accused them of wanton abuse that included whipping his feet, prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care and severe malnutrition. In May, 2016 Mr. Hekmati sued the government of Iran in Federal District Court in Washington, arguing that his detention and treatment constituted hostage-taking and torture. He was awarded nearly $63.5 million in a default judgment — money that Iran never intended to pay — but the case outcome helped him qualify for money from the victims fund. Dan Kildee, a Democratic congressman from Flint who came to know Mr. Hekmati’s family during his incarceration and has kept in touch with Mr. Hekmati since his return, has been among the outspoken advocates who have questioned the Justice Department’s behavior toward him in recent months. “It’s been obviously a source of frustration,” Mr. Kildee, the House majority deputy whip, said in a phone interview. “Amir has been through hell. He spent almost five years in prison in Iran. If there’s some reason, some issue, just tell Amir and his attorneys what it is,” Mr. Kildee said. “If there is a legitimate issue, there’s no excuse for the Justice Department being so obtuse. Just tell us what’s going on.”""]","Amir Hekmati, an American imprisoned and mistreated by Iran, was found eligible for $20 million from a special United States government fund.

Qantas Says It Would Back Suit by Flight Attendant Called Racist by Will.i.am,2019-11-19,By Sasha Gattermayr,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian airline Qantas Airways has said it will support a flight attendant if she decides to sue the musician Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas for defamation after he called her a racist on Twitter and posted her name and photograph. Will.i.am, a producer and rapper whose real name is William Adams, was on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney on Saturday during his band’s Australian tour when, he said, the flight attendant became overly aggressive in asking him to stow his laptop before landing. After the dispute between the two, federal police officers were called to meet the musician at the gate. The flight attendant, Will.i.am wrote on Twitter, “clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour.” In a follow-up tweet to his 12.8 million followers in which he posted the flight attendant’s name and picture, he used the hashtag #racistflightattendant. He later deleted the tweet, though the name and image remain in other posts.  Qantas has publicly stood by the flight attendant, saying, “we completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race.” The company said there had been a “misunderstanding” made worse by the musician’s use of noise-canceling headphones. “Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we’d certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this,” a spokeswoman said on Monday. On Twitter, Will.i.am answered a number of people who criticized his actions, including one who predicted that he would face a lawsuit. Australia, with its notoriously strict defamation laws, may offer a particularly favorable environment for one. The country does not have a Bill of Rights, and there is no constitutional protection for freedom of speech. That has helped breed a legal system in which defamation cases are comparatively easy to win. Will.i.am said he had spoken out as an act of resistance against racial discrimination. “I am posting so that this doesn’t happen again,” he wrote. “Everyone deserves to be treated with respect.”']",The musician posted the name and photograph of the airline employee on Twitter after a dispute on a flight in Australia.
Companies Abandon Prince Andrew After Calamitous Epstein Interview,2019-11-19,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Prince Andrew came under heightened pressure on Tuesday as the repercussions of a disastrous interview about his friendship with the disgraced Manhattan financier Jeffrey Epstein spread amid calls that he testify to the F.B.I. A woman who has accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing her as a child said on Monday that the prince should speak to the American authorities. “Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,” the woman, who calls herself Jane Doe 15, said at a news conference in New York. Several companies have moved to distance their brands from an organization supported by the prince called Pitch@Palace, which aims to help entrepreneurs. Those companies include Cisco Systems, which makes network equipment; Aon, a British insurer; and KPMG, a consulting firm. A spokeswoman for Aon said in an email that the company had asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website because it was not a partner of the organization and never had been. The supporters’ page appeared to have been removed from the organization’s website on Tuesday.  British news outlets also reported that the trustees of Outward Bound Trust, a charity that works with young people, would convene this week to discuss removing the prince as a patron.  Prince Andrew, 59, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, tried to defend his relationship with Mr. Epstein in the interview with the BBC, which aired on Saturday, but his sometimes confusing comments have served only to inflame anger at his behavior and at his links to the convicted pedophile. During the talk with the journalist Emily Maitlis, the prince denied any relationship with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was 17, and expressed little remorse for the victims of Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in August.  Asked why he had stayed at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2010 after his host had been released from prison, Prince Andrew said it was “convenient.”  “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,” Prince Andrew said about Mr. Epstein, whom he continued to see after the financier had served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Unbecoming?” Ms. Maitlis said with obvious incredulity, adding, “He was a sex offender.” The prince replied, “I’m sorry, I’m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender.” Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several women who say they were abused by Mr. Epstein, including Jane Doe 15, said on Monday that speaking to the F.B.I. would be the “right and honorable thing to do” for the prince. “I don’t see how he could have not known that there were underage girls, minors, because he did visit homes of Mr. Epstein in New York, in Palm Beach, in the Virgin Islands,” Ms. Allred told the British broadcaster ITV. “I happen to know that there were underage girls in all of those locations,” she added. In the interview, Prince Andrew said he would be “duty-bound” to testify under oath if he were asked and the “legal advice was to do so.” “Undoubtedly, some very strange and unpleasant activities have been going on,” he said, “I’m afraid to say that I’m not the person who can shed light on it, for a number of reasons.”']",The British royal was urged to tell the F.B.I. about his friendship with the disgraced Manhattan financier.
"On West Bank, No One Rests Easy, No Matter What U.S. Says About Settlements",2019-11-19,By David M. Halbfinger,"['OFRA, West Bank — Benny Aumann, 62, a travel agent, admits to harboring a back-of-the-brain kind of insecurity living as an Israeli in Ofra, a Jewish settlement deep in the mountainous heart of territory claimed by the Palestinians. “There’s a feeling that’s always floating above our heads,” he said, that should a peace agreement come about, “we could one day get notice to leave.” Just up the road in Silwad, a Palestinian village whose land was confiscated to establish the Ofra settlement nearly half a century ago, Nihaya Hamed, 35, lives with a very different sort of insecurity. She is raising four girls and a 7-year-old boy, who she fears will grow up to risk jail, or worse, by demanding his human rights, like the older youths who used to clash with Israeli troops outside the windows of her home every Friday.  The announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday that the United States no longer views Israeli settlements on the West Bank as necessarily violating international law has done little to change the essential insecurity on both sides of the conflict’s front line. While experts debated whether the announcement gave Israel a green light to annex parts of the West Bank or flouted established international law, the only practical effect in the West Bank on Tuesday was a subtle shift in morale: It left Israeli settlers feeling slightly more confident and Palestinians slightly more depressed. “I love this declaration, because it fits with my ideology, my opinions,” said Yossi Leibovitz, 57, who has lived in Ofra for 23 years and, like most of his neighbors, identifies with Israel’s national-religious movement: Orthodox Jews and Zionists who believe that Israel’s sovereignty and Jewish population should sweep over the biblical land of Israel all the way to the Jordan River.  “But if you ask me if it will change anything, it will not,” Mr. Leibovitz said. “Because there will come another administration, and they will say something different.” Ms. Hamed, too, said the Trump administration’s policy shift  would change little, but for a different reason. “America is biased,” she said. “The U.S. is pro-Israel, this is certain.” Still, she said, it did chip away at one of the few ways that Palestinians could console themselves about the failure of their national project: that at least they were legally in the right. Ofra and Silwad are yoked together by a half-century’s bitter history but kept apart by a skinny road, a small army post and rules barring visits to each other’s neighborhoods.  Silwad’s 7,000 residents, looking across the road, might covet Ofra’s idyllic subdivisions, with rows of red-roofed bungalows shrouded by enviably irrigated gardens and backyards. But at least, Ms. Hamed said, they knew that the settlers were outlaws in the eyes of much of the world. “Seeing it as a crime was helpful,” she said. “Legally, politically and emotionally.” Ofra was in many ways the ur-settlement on the West Bank when it quietly took shape in 1975, as religious activists who believed Jews have a divine right to the West Bank started sleeping in an old Jordanian army post, then persuaded the defense minister — Shimon Peres, who would later become a champion of the Israeli peace camp — to let them make it their home. The location was provocative: north of Ramallah along the Samarian mountain ridge, in the heart of the West Bank’s Palestinian population, where settlement attempts had always been blocked. And the way it was settled — below the radar at first, with the aim of creating facts on the ground — set the mold for scores of other settlements that began as outlaw projects. It also violated international law and Israeli law in many ways, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, among other critics. Chief among those: The Geneva Conventions bar an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into occupied territory, and an occupying power may not confiscate privately owned land for its own purposes. While Israel rejects the argument that it is transferring people into occupied territory — Jews have lived there for thousands of years and settlers are moving are there voluntarily, Israel says — Israel considers settlement on privately owned Palestinian land to be illegal. As Ofra grew into a Jerusalem suburb of 900 families and some 3,700 residents, some 60 percent of the settlement was built on land registered as the property of Palestinians, many of them in Silwad, B’Tselem reported in 2008. The group called it “the largest unauthorized outpost in the West Bank.” “They know this is not their land,” Ms. Hamed said, standing outside her home in Silwad. If the Trump administration was firmly on Israel’s side, she said, even Palestinian leaders were only giving lip service to the cause while quietly doing Israel’s bidding. Her people have few international allies and, for the foreseeable future, little hope, she said. “Where is there for us to go? I’m seriously asking,” she said. “To whom should we apply?” Naer Alawi, a furniture maker in Silwad, said it was pointless to expect help from the rest of the world. For all the years foreign diplomats called the settlements illegal, he said, they still did nothing to stop them from expanding. And it was the international community that brought Israel into existence, he said. “We’ve been seeking justice from those who caused the problem in the first place,” he said. To Ofra’s residents, however, calling Ofra illegal is like calling Tel Aviv a settlement. “This is like any other place in the land of Israel,” said Mr. Leibovitz, an insurance agent who moved to Ofra with his wife, Michal, and their four children in 1996, then had two more, and now are raising two foster children. The Leibovitz home sits next to vacant lot where nine homes were demolished in 2017, after settlement opponents, in a rare victory, were able to prove they had been built on private Palestinian land. But Mr. Leibovitz said their own home and most of their neighbors’ were no different. That should not matter, he argued: No owner has ever surfaced, and no owner was living on or cultivating the land before Israel took control. Jordan’s king gave away West Bank land to many people before Israel conquered the territory in 1967, he said, and “nobody knows who owns what.” Ms. Leibovitz, 56, a rehabilitation nurse at Hadassah Hospital on Mt. Scopus, said that sovereign Israel was settled just the way places like Ofra were — an argument that opponents of Israel’s right to exist often make to attack Zionism — so why should what happened since the occupation began, in 1967, be treated any differently from what happened before Israel’s founding in 1948? “Why should those 19 years make such a huge difference in resettling the land?” Ms. Leibovitz asked. Over an hourlong talk in the family’s tile-floored living room, Mr. Leibovitz said that as a religious man, he believed the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, but that “also in the Bible, it’s written that we will not receive this land all at once, but slowly, slowly.” “In the meantime, it’s very important that we treat others nicely,” his wife said. So what about their neighbors in Silwad? Continued settlement and the potential annexation of the West Bank will pose a dilemma for Israel, the Leibovitzes acknowledged: whether to grant full citizenship rights to the Palestinians or keep them in a second-class status. They spoke of limited “autonomy” for Palestinians. Others say that is apartheid. “It’s a very complex situation,” Ms. Leibovitz said. For all his Zionist fervor, Mr. Leibovitz said he would be willing to pull up stakes himself if “true peace” required abandoning the settlements. But then he said he did not believe a true peace would ever come. Instead, he said, he hopes his Palestinian neighbors will eventually seek a better life somewhere else. “Slowly, slowly,” he said again. “And maybe they will go.” Rina Castelnuovo contributed reporting from Ofra, Mohammed Najib from Silwad, and Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem.']","Palestinian and Israeli residents of the West Bank say the new American stance, that Israeli settlement is legal, does nothing to change their fundamental insecurity."
Amazon Deforestation in Brazil Rose Sharply on Bolsonaro’s Watch,2019-11-18,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — The Amazon rainforest in Brazil lost an area about 12 times the size of New York City from August 2018 through July of this year, according to government data released Monday, which shows that deforestation in the biome has shot up significantly since the election of President Jair Bolsonaro. The 3,769 square miles of forest cover lost during that period represents a 30 percent increase from the previous year and the highest net loss since 2008. The new deforestation figures, released by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, provide the clearest evidence to date that deforestation in the Amazon is on a solidly upward trend on Mr. Bolsonaro’s watch. Mr. Bolsonaro, who has long argued that conservation policies stymie economic development, has been disdainful of the environmental measures that reduced the Amazon deforestation rate between 2004 and 2012. His government has weakened enforcement of environmental laws by cutting funding and personnel at key government agencies, and it has scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and ranching.  Environmental activists said Monday’s announcement, while not unexpected, was deeply concerning for the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest.  “This figure is the direct result of the strategy implemented by Bolsonaro to dismantle the environment ministry, prevent the enforcement of laws, shelve plans previous governments made to curb deforestation and empower, through rhetoric, those who commit environmental crimes,” Climate Observatory, a Brazilian environmental group, said in a statement.  “In a break with what occurred in previous years during which the rate rose, this time the government did not announce any credible measures to reverse the trend,” it said. Mr. Bolsonaro’s approach to the environment — and the Amazon in particular — came under sharp scrutiny in August as a rash of forest fires, most attributed to humans clearing land, consumed large swaths of the biome. Facing outrage from European leaders and threats of an international boycott of Brazilian exports, the government deployed the military to help contain the blazes. But the Bolsonaro administration has continued to weaken the agencies tasked with enforcing environmental laws and regulations. And it maintains that industries such as mining and agriculture should have broader access to protected lands, including Indigenous reserves. The environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said on Monday that the rise in deforestation had started well before Mr. Bolsonaro’s government came to power in January. He added that the “unlawful economy” in the Amazon, where illegal logging and mining is rife, was largely to blame. “We need strategies to contain that,” Mr. Salles said during a presentation to journalists. He did not outline a detailed plan to combat the trend. Experts say the damage unfolding in several Brazilian states is causing irreparable harm to the Amazon. The forest is often called the Earth’s “lungs” for its vast capacity to release oxygen and store carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming. Some experts fear that so much forest will be lost that the area will transform into savanna, which cannot store as much carbon. “We must\xa0remember that the Amazon has been undergoing deforestation for decades,” Oyvind Eggen, the secretary general of the Rainforest Foundation Norway, said in a statement. “We are approaching a potential tipping point, where large parts of the forest will be so damaged that it collapses.” Gilberto Câmara, the secretariat director of the Group on Earth Observations, a coalition of governments and researchers that share and analyze data to shape public policy, said the growing destruction of the Amazon is doing tremendous damage to Brazil’s image and economic prospects. “The decision of foreign investors to bring resources to Brazil is increasingly contingent on compliance and rules regarding sustainability,” said Mr. Câmara, a former director of the National Institute for Space Research, the Brazilian agency that tracks deforestation by studying satellite images.  “From the point of view of future generations,” he said, “the loss of biodiversity and the rise of emissions are huge setbacks that will have enormous consequences over the next 10, 15 years and beyond.” Mr. Bolsonaro and several senior government officials have been dismissive of international criticism over deforestation, arguing that Brazil has done more than many other countries to conserve its forests. Earlier this year, shortly before the Amazon fires made international headlines, Mr. Bolsonaro said that protecting the environment mattered only to vegans. In August, when Germany said it would devote funds to conservation efforts in Brazil, he suggested that Chancellor Angela Merkel “take that money and use it to reforest Germany” instead.']","President Jair Bolsonaro has scaled back efforts to fight illegal logging, mining and farming, which have led to widespread destruction in the world’s largest rainforest.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa Wins Sri Lanka Presidential Election,2019-11-17,By Dharisha Bastians and Kai Schultz,"['COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared victory on Sunday in Sri Lanka’s presidential election, signaling the return to power of a divisive family credited for ending the country’s long civil war through brutal means. Mr. Rajapaksa defeated his closest opponent, Sajith Premadasa, by about 10 percentage points, according to an official tally from Sri Lanka’s election commission. His party expects him to be sworn into office early this week. “As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey,” Mr. Rajapaksa wrote on Twitter in his first remarks about the victory. “Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned.” During the election, Mr. Rajapaksa, 70, a former wartime defense chief nicknamed “Terminator” by his family, capitalized on public outrage at the current government’s mishandling of intelligence reports warning of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, a lush island at the foot of India. In April, a Muslim militant group claiming loyalty to the Islamic State killed hundreds of people in coordinated suicide bombings at churches and hotels on Easter Sunday. The attacks shattered a fragile postwar peace in Sri Lanka, where wounds still fester from the war with separatist ethnic Tamils during which thousands of people died. In 2009, Mr. Rajapaksa and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, then Sri Lanka’s president, ended that conflict, but they stand accused of crimes against humanity, including directing the bombings of civilian hospitals and torturing journalists. During campaign speeches, Gotabaya Rajapaksa vowed to take a tough stance on terrorism as president and to bring stability to Sri Lanka, where a collapse in tourism after the bombings threw the economy into a tailspin. Many Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet support the Rajapaksas in the hopes that they can revive the economy, which boomed toward the end of their stretch in power. Others worry that democracy and freedom of speech will be curtailed under Mr. Rajapaksa, whose party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, is likely to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new prime minister. It is not the first time the former president has sought the position. In October 2018, Sri Lanka’s departing president, Maithripala Sirisena, abruptly fired Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, calling him inept and corrupt, and then appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa to the position. Many considered the move a coup, and by the time the power grab was ruled illegal, two protesters had been killed.  But the Easter Sunday bombings and struggling economy were enough to allow another Rajapaksa to rise. Asanga Welikala, the director of the Edinburgh Center for Constitutional Law and an expert on Sri Lanka, said that Gotabaya Rajapaksa won this election by leveraging the same hard-line approach to national security and “social discipline” that has propelled populists to power around the world.  “This is a mandate that rejects reform, democratization, civil freedom and broad tolerance of pluralism,” Mr. Welikala said of the vote. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s decade as president was known for tightly centralized power and the spread of a strident Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism that has inspired attacks against the country’s large minority communities. Hostility toward Muslims, in particular, has risen since the Easter Sunday attacks, heightening fears of retribution against innocent Sri Lankans. And although the economy grew under Mahinda Rajapaksa, so did the country’s debt to China, whose influence in Sri Lankan affairs spiked under the family’s watch. A lopsided dependence on China for development projects was a key part of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s startling election defeat in 2015.  Since then, the country was forced to give up a port complex to China as the debt crisis battered the economy, though analysts said Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s government would most likely tread carefully with China this time around. “Gota will play the China card, but Beijing is now less inclined to repeat the large financial investments it did five or 10 years ago due to growing domestic opposition and international scrutiny,” said Constantino Xavier, a foreign policy fellow at Brookings India in New Delhi. Officials said turnout on Saturday, when 16 million eligible voters chose among 35 candidates, was more than 80 percent, and that Mr. Rajapaksa had won about 52 percent of the vote. The election was largely peaceful, though some violence was reported, including an attack on buses carrying Muslims to polling stations in northwest Sri Lanka. (There were no reports of injuries.) Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s chief competitor, Mr. Premadasa, 52, whose father was killed during the war by a Tamil Tiger rebel, did well with minority Muslims and Tamils in conflict-torn northern and eastern provinces.  But Mr. Rajapaksa won big with a crucial voting bloc: Sinhalese Buddhists who make up around 70 percent of the Sri Lankan population and credit the Rajapaksa family for ending the war. Sunday morning, Mr. Rajapaksa’s supporters hugged and cheered outside his home on the outskirts of Colombo, the capital.  In a statement conceding defeat, Mr. Premadasa, of the United National Front, congratulated Mr. Rajapaksa, urging him to “strengthen and protect the democratic institutions and values that enabled his peaceful election.” Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.']","Mr. Rajapaksa, a former defense chief and brother of an ex-president, vowed to bring stability to a country still reeling from attacks on Easter Sunday."
Sweden Drops Julian Assange Rape Inquiry,2019-11-19,,"['By Elian Peltier LONDON — The Swedish authorities announced on Tuesday that they would end an investigation into allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Julian Assange, the embattled WikiLeaks founder, that date from 2010. “The evidence is not strong enough to form the basis of an indictment,” said Eva-Marie Persson, Sweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions. “In such a situation, the preliminary investigation should be discontinued, and that is what has happened.” Mr. Assange, 48, is still in a British prison awaiting a United States extradition hearing, raising questions about whether the end of the Swedish investigation would clear the path for that process to continue.  “This clears one hurdle away for Julian Assange,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It brings the focus on the extradition process, and what British authorities will be willing to do.” Sweden began investigating Mr. Assange in 2010, after two women accused him of assaulting them during separate sexual encounters while he was visiting Stockholm. When the Swedish authorities issued a European arrest warrant in 2012 seeking his extradition from Britain for questioning over “suspicion of rape, three cases of sexual molestation and illegal coercion,” he fled to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Mr. Assange and his lawyers said they feared that if he returned to Sweden, he would then be extradited to the United States from there. He remained in self-imposed exile in the embassy for seven years, until his arrest in April after Ecuador revoked his asylum status.  Ms. Persson said that investigators had questioned again the individuals who had been interviewed in 2010 and spoken to two additional people who had not previously been interviewed. She said that the investigators had found the accusers credible and their statements reliable but that some parts of the testimonies were contradictory. In 2010, Anna Ardin, a Swedish woman who later spoke publicly about the incident, accused Mr. Assange of forcing her to have unprotected sex. A second woman said Mr. Assange had penetrated her without a condom as she was sleeping during the same trip to Stockholm.  “Memories fade for natural reasons,” Ms. Persson said, but she emphasized that the “injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events.” “Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed,” Ms. Persson said about one of the complainants. “However, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.” Asked by reporters about the length of the procedure — almost 10 years — Ms. Persson said that the extensive news coverage could have affected the case’s viability. “You have to consider how much the witnesses will have read and heard from the media,” she said. The Swedish authorities dropped the investigation in 2017,  but it was reopened this year after Mr. Assange was arrested in London and a lawyer for one of the alleged victims asked for it to be revisited, the prosecutor said. Mr. Assange, who is Australian, has always denied the accusations, and his lawyers have repeatedly accused the complainants of trying to unjustly slur the WikiLeaks founder. Mr. Assange was detained last year and jailed for jumping bail after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its protection of him. The United States is seeking his extradition over accusations that he tried to assist in a breach of classified data.In September, a British court ruled that Mr. Assange must stay in a British jail until his extradition hearing, which is planned for early next year.  The Justice Department has indicted Mr. Assange on a slew of charges including 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act, accusing him of the solicitation, acquisition, and publication of classified information from the former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. The charges raised questions about press freedom, and critics have expressed concern that the case could set a precedent to criminalize future acts of national security journalism. The end of the Swedish investigation into the sexual assault allegations simplifies matters for the United States government in its effort to extradite him to American soil. Put simply, it means there is now only one country, not two, that would like the British authorities to transfer custody of him for further legal proceedings.  The Justice Department declined to comment on how the end of the Swedish investigation would affect its case.  But Mr. Assange’s lawyers welcomed the Swedish decision on Tuesday and said that it was time to turn to the American extradition request. Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor in chief of WikiLeaks, echoed that sentiment in a statement published by the group. “Sweden has dropped its preliminary investigation into Mr. Assange for the third time, after reopening it without any new evidence or information,” he said. “Let us now focus on the threat Mr. Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.” Elisabeth Massi Fritz, a lawyer for one of the women who made allegations against Mr. Assange, said in an emailed statement that she and her client do not share the prosecutor’s assessment. She said there are logical reasons why the oral evidence from nine years ago has changed and said that if the earlier investigation had included more detailed questioning, “then the interviews would have been of higher quality and we would have been able to use them today.”  “Unfortunately, that is not the case,” Ms. Massi Fritz said. “The only right decision would have been to interview the suspect in London.” Megan Specia contributed reporting from London, Christina Anderson from Stockholm and Charlie Savage from Washington.

"Hong Kong Protests: Over 1,000 Detained at a University, and a Warning From Beijing",2019-11-19,"By Elaine Yu, Steven Lee Myers and Russell Goldman","['HONG KONG —\xa0About 50 protesters remained holed up inside a Hong Kong university on Tuesday evening after a three-day standoff between students and the police turned a prestigious institution into a battlefield and ended with hundreds of young people behind bars.   More than 1,000 protesters who had spent the previous day clashing with the police were detained after heavily armed officers surrounded the school on Sunday and gave the protesters few options but to surrender and face arrest. A number of students had escaped by rappelling from a nearby bridge to be whisked away by waiting motorbike drivers, while others failed in an attempt to flee through a sewage pipe.     As much of the territory remained gripped by the drama at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the central government in Beijing on Tuesday condemned a decision by a Hong Kong court that overturned a ban on face masks worn by protesters. The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, and have expanded to include a broad range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy. Here’s the latest: Pinned in from all sides by the police, most of the campus occupiers had surrendered or fled the PolyU campus by Tuesday morning.  By then, on the third day of a standoff, only 100 protesters remained inside. Several hours later, the remaining holdouts numbered around 50.  The protesters — many of them high school and university students, and some armed with bows and arrows and homemade weapons — held the police at bay for three days in what became the most violent confrontation in six months of protests. The battle at PolyU, in which the police fired more than 1,000 cans of tear gas and rubber bullets, represented the force’s most direct intervention onto one of the city’s university campuses. Ted Hui, a pro-democracy lawmaker who stayed on campus during the clashes, escorted several dozen students out of the university on Tuesday evening. “This is not a surrender, and we are not turning ourselves in,” he said. “We are simply leaving.”   The departing protesters were searched by the police, and those older than 18 were put into a police van to be booked.  Mr. Hui, a member of the city’s Legislative Council, was not arrested, a distinction that he said “shows there is political selection in who they arrest and that there are arbitrary arrests.”   The remaining occupiers said that they would not resist the police, but that they would not leave until officers entered the campus to arrest them.  At least 200 of the protesters who left the campus were minors, Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, said in a news conference on Tuesday.  Those under 18 were questioned by the police but were not arrested on the spot. They may still face arrest pending further investigation, Mrs. Lam said.   She said the “special arrangements” for minors were intended to achieve “a peaceful and reconciliatory resolution.” Video from inside the university showed an eerily deserted campus covered in trash and debris, a ransacked convenience store, boxes of unused petrol bombs, and the words “Liberty or death” emblazoned on a building. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority treated about 80 injured people from the university at emergency rooms on Tuesday morning. Another 200 from the campus were later sent to local hospitals.  Separately, Albert Ho, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, said he had been assaulted on his route home from work. The motivation of that attack was unclear.     About 1,100 people were detained near the PolyU campus on Monday and Tuesday, said Kwok Ka-chuen, a police spokesman. That figure would represent the largest roundup of protesters on a single day, making up almost a fifth of the total arrests since the protests began in June.  Those arrested on Monday and Tuesday were charged with offenses that included rioting and possession of offensive weapons. Rioting carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and many of the PolyU protesters were reluctant to surrender in order to avoid the charge.  Mr. Kwok said that 1,458 rounds of tear gas and 1,391 rubber bullets were fired on Monday, putting a figure to the dizzying display of smoke and gunfire witnessed on the second day of the siege.     At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was the site of clashes with the police last week, more than 3,900 Molotov cocktails were seized on Monday, representing the most found in a single location, he said.  He called the prestigious university a “manufacturing base” for fire bombs.  A number of protesters who had left PolyU on Tuesday, including several wrapped in emergency Mylar blankets, waited to be taken to a hospital. Some appeared to be suffering from effects of hypothermia after being struck by a police water cannon.    In Beijing, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress took the unusual step of criticizing a Hong Kong court’s ruling that struck down a contentious ban on the wearing of face masks in public, effectively saying that the central government alone has the authority to rule on constitutional issues in the territory.  The Hong Kong High Court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. In a statement released on Tuesday, a spokesman for the standing committee warned that the ruling “seriously weakened the lawful governing power” of the Hong Kong government. The National People’s Congress, the country’s top legislative body, has the authority to interpret legal matters involving national issues — and to change the Basic Law itself. The timing of the ruling raised new fears of Beijing’s efforts to erode the territory’s autonomy. “When the state loses, she changes the rules of game,” Joshua Wong, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Twitter. “Beijing never intends to play by the rules.” Article 158 of the Basic Law gives the congress the final authority over interpreting whether the Basic Law conflicts with national law. It also calls on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal to seek the legislature’s interpretation in considering cases whose legal significance extends to national issues.  The statement suggested that Beijing was prepared to act decisively to restore the mask ban, but the implications could be much greater, showing that there are limits of the national government’s tolerance for an independent judicial system that has been a pillar of Hong Kong’s singular political and economic status. In another statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s office that handles Hong Kong affairs also criticized the court’s decision to overturn the ban, saying that it had “a gravely negative social impact” and “brazenly challenged the authority of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and the governance powers of the chief executive conferred by the law.” Hong Kong’s embattled police force, once regarded as “Asia’s finest,” has a new boss.   Tang Ping-keung, formerly the territory’s No. 2 police official, was named commissioner of police on Tuesday after approval from the central government in Beijing. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr. Tang blamed the public for tolerating the protests and encouraging their violent acts. “If everyone had come out earlier to condemn the violence, society would not have turned into this state in five months,” he said.  “We can only end the unrest with society’s condemnation, reflection by the rioters, plus our appropriate tactics,” he added. Mr. Tang also rejected a key demand of the protesters: setting up an independent commission to investigate police conduct during the protests. “Our staff might think they are being particularly targeted if the well-established mechanism is bypassed,” he told the Post. “We will be disappointed.” Katherine Li and Tiffany May contributed reporting.']","After a three-day standoff with the police, about 50 protesters remained on the campus of a besieged university.

Turkey’s Deportations Force Europe to Face Its ISIS Militants,2019-11-17,By Norimitsu Onishi and Elian Peltier,"['PARIS — As Turkey followed through on its threat to release more Islamic State detainees last week, Western European nations were confronted with a problem they had long sought to avoid: what to do about the potential return of radicalized, often battle-hardened Europeans to countries that absolutely do not want them back. Faced with fierce popular opposition to the repatriation of such detainees and fears over the long-term threat they could pose back home, European leaders have sought alternative ways to prosecute them — in an international tribunal, on Iraqi soil, anywhere but on the Continent. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, made more powerful by a sudden shift in American policy, is determined to foist the problem of the captured European Islamic State fighters back on the countries they came from.  Last week, Turkey sent a dozen former Islamic State members and relatives to Britain, Denmark, Germany and the United States, and Mr. Erdogan says hundreds more are right behind them. “All of the European countries, especially those with most of the foreign fighters, have desperately been looking for the past year for a way to deal with them without bringing them back,” said Rik Coolsaet, an expert on radicalization at the Egmont Institute, a Brussels-based research group. “But now, European nations are being forced to consider repatriation since Turkey is going to put people on the plane.” The sudden problem for Europe is a long-tail consequence of President Trump’s precipitous decision last month to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey to take control of territory as well as many of the Islamic State members who had been held there in Kurdish-run prisons or detention camps.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that nearly two-thirds of the Western European detainees, or about 700, are children, many of whom have lost one parent, if not both. Now that more of the former fighters are in Turkish hands, Mr. Erdogan has not hesitated to use the threat of returning them as leverage over European countries who have been deeply critical of his incursion, and who have threatened sanctions against Turkey for unauthorized oil drilling in the eastern Mediterranean off Cyprus.  The fate of the former fighters and their families has become yet another point of contention between Turkey and Europe, which is already paying Mr. Erdogan’s government billions of dollars to stem the flow of asylum seekers from conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Turkey is already home to some three million refugees from the Syria conflict, and Mr. Erdogan is determined to lighten his country’s load. But his real intent remains unclear: Does he really plan to send back all foreign fighters to Europe? Or is he opening the spigot, with the threat of a flood to come, to wring concessions from Europe? What is clear is that with limited military reach in Syria, European nations are ever more vulnerable to Mr. Erdogan’s whims. Turkish officials say that Turkey now holds 2,280 Islamic State members from 30 countries, and that all of them will be deported. The problem is not Europe’s alone. On Friday, Turkey deported an American it described as an Islamic State member, Muhammad Darwish Bassam, to the United States. Last week, a federal judge in the United States ruled that an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State in 2014 was not an American citizen, potentially thwarting her return. But the numbers and risks for Europe are far greater than for the United States. More than 1,100 citizens of countries in Western Europe are believed to be detained in northern Syria in territory once controlled by the Islamic State, according to a recent study by the Egmont Institute. Their potential return has confronted European justice systems with competing security and civil liberties demands as they attempt to vet returnees, decide whether to detain them, and build cases on potential crimes that often happened hundred of miles away on remote Syrian battlefields.  France, the Western European nation with the most detainees in Syria, is getting ready to take back 11 former Islamic State members. The Netherlands has also agreed to take back some of its citizens.  On Thursday, a 26-year-old man suspected of being an Islamic State fighter was arrested after landing at London’s Heathrow Airport on a flight from Turkey.  That same day, seven members of a German-Iraqi family arrived in Berlin from Turkey, from which they had been deported after several months in custody over suspected links to terrorism.  The father was detained, but the other family members were allowed to return to their homes. On Friday, a woman deported by Turkey was detained upon arrival at Frankfurt Airport on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organization abroad. Federal prosecutors in Germany said the woman, a German citizen identified only as Nasim A., left the country in 2014 and married an ISIS fighter, whom she supported until Kurdish-led security forces detained her this year.  A second woman was released after landing in Germany, but will be tracked by experts on de-radicalization. German officials said they believed more than 130 people left the country to join ISIS, 95 of whom were German citizens and had the right to return to the country. Nearly a third of the Germans are under investigation by federal prosecutors. French officials said there had been no change in French policy, which opposes repatriation from Syria. But pressure has been building, and security experts and some government officials have increasingly warned that the repatriation of militants — and their processing in European courts and detention in prisons — would be the only way to ensure Europe’s safety. The deteriorating situation in northern Syria, some experts say, further increases the need for an orderly repatriation to Europe.  Left in Syria, more detainees could fall into the hands of Turkish forces or the Syrian government, which could use them as bargaining chips with the West.  Others could run away and try to regroup, or be taken back by Islamic State sleeper cells, as is feared in the case of some women who recently escaped from a camp in the region. “There are a lot of risks associated with the policy of leaving them where they are,’’ said Anthony Dworkin, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who has studied the Islamic State’s foreign fighters. The potential dangers and difficulties are vividly demonstrated in the case of Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old French citizen of Pakistani origin who grew up and lived in London until she traveled to Syria in 2015. She is believed to still be in the custody of the Turkish authorities. A mother of two, she does not speak French and had spent most of her life in Britain, and although French intelligence services knew of her case, it is unclear that they had expected her to come to France. “Tooba Gondal is a very notorious ISIS female recruiter, but until recently she wasn’t on the radar of French intelligence services,” said Jean-Charles Brisard of the Paris-based Center for Analysis of Terrorism, who was first to reveal that she would be deported. A former London university student, Ms. Gondal became known in the British news media as an Islamic State “matchmaker.” She is accused of persuading other young Western women, like the British schoolgirl Shamima Begum, to marry Islamic State fighters.  She also posed with assault rifles in pictures on social media, and praised the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015. In recent months, Ms. Gondal has pleaded to be taken back to Britain, which had issued an expulsion order against her in 2018. She declared in an open letter to The Sunday Times of London that she was a “changed person” who wished to “face justice in a British court.” As a non-British citizen but a French passport holder, she is now likely to be deported to France. France has already repatriated more than 250 Islamic State fighters and their families from Turkey since signing a bilateral agreement with the government there in 2014. But 400 French citizens are still estimated to be detained in Syria, according to the Egmont Institute, and France does not want them back. Instead, France wants Iraq to try them, especially the male fighters. French officials have led European negotiations with the Iraqi government to set up trials in Iraq. But disagreements between Iraqi and European officials — over legal matters like the death penalty and costs — have prevented an accord. “It is legitimate that people who have committed terrorist acts should be judged closest to the place where they committed those said terrorist acts,’’ Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokeswoman for the French government, said at a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association.  The other French citizens expected to return home — three Frenchwomen and their five children, all under 4 years old — were held in the camp of Ain Issa, according to their lawyer, Marie Dosé.  She said the families escaped in mid-October when the facility was abandoned by Kurdish forces. “They have risked their lives and their children’s to join Turkey and be expelled to France,” Ms. Dosé said.  For more than a year, Ms. Dosé and other French lawyers have fought to bring the mothers back with their children, as the women argued that they wanted to be tried at home. Last year, when a French television crew met one of the four women set to be deported, she said she wouldn’t leave without her son. “If he leaves, I’m leaving with him,” said Amandine le Coz, a 29-year-old woman who grew up in a suburb near Paris. “He’s my life.” In France and other European nations, the stories of people like Ms. le Coz and Ms. Gondal have elicited little sympathy. “There’s been more sympathy for vulnerable children, but as you go up to adults, there’s a lot of pushback against women and there’s even more pushback against male militants,’’ said Joana Cook, a researcher at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization in London. Dr. Cook, who has studied women and children who have returned to their home countries from Syria, said there had been no known incidents involving returnees.  Instead, terrorist cases, including the failed attempt to ignite a car loaded with gas canisters near the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, involved women who had become radicalized at home and had never stepped foot in Syria. In France, about 100 people who returned from Syria have already been judged and given sentences averaging 10 years, Mr. Brisard said. Some of those serving the shortest sentences have already been released, he said. “They’ll be freed one day, that’s for sure,’’ Mr. Brisard said. “But it’s preferable that they be incarcerated in French prisons from where they can’t escape. And after they’ve served their sentences, it’s preferable that they be tracked by a competent intelligence service. In Iraq or Syria, I don’t have much faith in their intelligence services keeping track of our jihadists.’’ Norimitsu Onishi reported from Paris, and Elian Peltier from London.

Iran Blocks Nearly All Internet Access,2019-11-17,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iran imposed an almost complete nationwide internet blackout on Sunday, making one of its most draconian attempts to cut off Iranians from each other and the rest of the world as widespread anti-government unrest roiled the streets of Tehran and other cities for a third day. The death toll for the three days of protests rose to at least 12; hundreds were injured; and more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to semiofficial news agencies like Fars News. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader who has the last word on all state matters, called the demonstrators “thugs” and endorsed the government’s decision to raise prices it sets for rationed gasoline by 50 percent as of Friday and by 200 percent for gasoline that exceeds ration limits. Even after the price hike, gasoline in Iran is still cheaper than in most of the rest of the world — now the equivalent of about 50 cents a gallon.  In a speech on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei said he would support rationing and increasing gas prices because heads of three branches of government — the presidency, judiciary and parliament — had made the decision. He acknowledged that Iranians had taken to the streets to protest and that some had died. But he blamed the protests on monarchists and opposition groups trying to destabilize Iran.  The widespread discontent on display across the country marked yet another crisis for the Islamic Republic. Iran has been struggling with an economic crisis after the United States exited a nuclear deal and reimposed harsh sanctions that ban Iran’s oil sales.  In the past month, Iran has faced a fierce backlash in regional countries such as Lebanon and Iraq where protesters have called for an end to Iran’s outsized influence in their countries’ affairs. Now, the most powerful forces leading the country are being challenged on the home front. In the past, Iran has met such widespread protest movements with forceful crackdowns that have crushed dissent. Ayatollah Khamenei’s support of the gas price hike effectively put an end to parliament’s attempt to challenge the decision, and lawmakers took back a bill they had introduced to reverse the new policy. But protests raged and criticism continued. At least two lawmakers resigned in opposition to parliament’s not being consulted. In the cities from Tehran to Shiraz in the south, Iranian protesters chanted, “Death to Khamenei.”  Some analysts said Iran could not sustain the pressure from all directions and would have to make some concessions — either to its population or to the United States for new negotiations. “The regime is facing a serious crisis and unless they concede someplace to relieve the pressures, the anger and the violence will continue,” said Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an independent analyst based in New York. The Trump administration on Sunday condemned the lethal use of force and the cutting of communications in Iran. “The U.S. supports the Iranian people in their peaceful protests against the regime that is supposed to lead them,” a statement from the White House press secretary said. Iranian activists on social media called for the United States to figure out a way to provide Iran with internet access.  Human rights activists said they worried that without witness documentation of the violence, it would be difficult to hold Iran accountable for its crackdown. The Associated Press reported that Iran also experienced wide disruptions and outages of internet service on Friday and Saturday, according to the group NetBlocks, which monitors worldwide internet access. By Saturday night, connectivity had fallen to just 7 percent of ordinary levels, NetBlocks said. “The ongoing disruption is the most severe recorded in Iran since President Rouhani came to power, and the most severe disconnection tracked by NetBlocks in any country in terms of its technical complexity and breadth,” the group said. The internet firm Oracle called it “the largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.” Ahmad, a taxi driver in Tehran who did not want his last name used, said in telephone interview that when he tried to connect to the internet on his mobile phone, a recorded message said that because of a decision by the National Security Council, connectivity had been cut off.  WhatsApp and Instagram, both used widely by Iranians, were also blocked. Fahimeh, an accountant, said she and her friends relied on WhatsApp to find out the location and time of protests, and in the absence of the internet, it would be difficult for Iranians to plan and spread the word. The Ministry of Information said Sunday that it had identified bad actors among protesters and warned that those responsible for unrest would be arrested. Intelligence agents on Sunday arrested Abdoleza Davari, a senior aide to Iran’s former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and a vocal critic of the gas price policy, according to his wife, Elham Salmani. Mr. Davari had posted a tweet a day earlier saying that the people have the right to demonstrate and that parliament must hear their concerns and stand up to the branches of the government imposing this policy. “They have failed to successfully counter freethinking with ideology so the only tool at their disposal is violence,” said Ms. Salmani, a journalist and political activist, in a telephone interview. She said the prosecutor’s office had threatened to arrest her as well and had accused her of hiding her husband’s mobile telephone and laptop computer. Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent reformist politician, said on Twitter that if elected officials could not listen to the demands of the people, “they should resign and leave the country to its real rulers.”']",Anti-government protests spread as the supreme leader supports a gas price increase. 
"In Hong Kong, Daring Escapes From a Violent Siege at a University",2019-11-18,"By Elaine Yu, Russell Goldman, Ezra Cheung and Photographs by Lam Yik Fei","['HONG KONG  — Some protesters slithered down makeshift ropes to waiting motorcyclists, brazenly evading a police cordon set up around a besieged university campus.  Hundreds defied warnings to drop their homemade weapons and refused to surrender.  And a group of sobbing parents staged a sit-in vigil outside the school, blocked by officers who refused to allow them inside.  The scenes at Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday were a montage of urban warfare and mayhem in the heart of the territory, roiled for nearly six months by pro-democracy protesters. The demonstrators have increasingly directed their fury at the police and the authorities in China, who have dropped many hints that their patience is wearing thin.    For days, the protesters have held off the police from entering the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic, fortifying their holdout with homemade fire bombs, giant sling shots, bricks and bows and arrows. At least 38 people were injured in a protracted confrontation at the university on Sunday, the city’s Hospital Authority said, after a bloody battle in which a police officer was struck by an arrow and demonstrators set a police van on fire.  The casualties tripled on Monday, with at least 116 people injured. There were still 100 protesters remaining inside the encircled campus Tuesday, said Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive. As other demonstrations raged across the city, Hong Kong’s High Court offered some vindication to the protesters, striking down a contentious ban on the wearing of face masks in public. The court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory’s mini-Constitution, know as the Basic Law.   And in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was “gravely concerned” by the deepening chaos. The most dramatic scenes unfolded at Hong Kong Polytechnic. As their weapons and supplies dwindled,  protesters sought to flee the campus, only to find all their routes blocked by a line of heavily armed riot police officers and a hailstorm of tear gas and rubber bullets.   On Monday afternoon, the students tried unsuccessfully to rush a police cordon only to be pushed back into the campus. Despite running out of options, the students feared they would be arrested if they obeyed police instructions to “drop their weapons” and leave through one designated exit.  Later in the evening, a number of protesters escaped on ladders made of rope or plastic hoses, dropping down from a bridge connected to the campus, as supporters on escape motorcycles awaited them on the road below.  It was not immediately clear if any were arrested.  The protesters, many of them university and high school students, have occupied the campus for a week. On Sunday night and well into Monday morning, they clashed with the police in one of the most violent confrontations in the months of conflict.  By nightfall, about 100 people staged a sit-in directly in front of the police cordon near the university, including women who were said to be mothers of trapped protesters, sobbing and being comforted by others.  “Most of the people here are parents,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker who joined the rally. “They realize once their children get out they will be immediately arrested. They just want to take a look at their kid and see if he or she is O.K.” Conditions on the campus have grown increasingly desperate with injured protesters unable to receive treatment, Owan Li, a student council member, told reporters. Student leaders said protesters had suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after they were struck by a stinging dye shot from a police water cannon. Trying to mediate the stalemate, Jasper Tsang, the founder of Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing political party, arrived at the university late Monday evening. Mr. Tsang spoke to several protesters at a podium and said he was willing to accompany their departure from the university to help insure their safety.  Later, dozens of  protesters lined up at the designated exit and were arrested on rioting charges by the police. It was not immediately clear whether they had departed because of Mr. Tsang’s mediation. Areas near the university had the feel of a battle zone, with streets engulfed by tear gas and fires.  Scores were arrested by the police on Monday morning near the university. A large group of  people were seen seated outside a hotel in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon, their hands zip-tied behind their backs. The police said that they arranged for Red Cross volunteers to enter the campus in the afternoon and provide first aid to the injured, and that the force would assist those who needed to go to the hospital “before further investigation,” implying that arrests would wait until after their treatments. Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was in touch with social workers, said that some of the young people trapped inside were “close to breaking down.” The police said 154 people were arrested over the weekend, bringing the total number of arrests to 4,491 since the protests started in June. Xinhua, China’s state news agency, reported on Tuesday that China’s state council has appointed a new police chief for Hong Kong. The appointment of Tang Ping-keung, also known as Chris Tang, comes after the police force has been criticized by hard-liners in the country for not being aggressive enough in dealing with the protests. The ruling that overturned the face-mask ban, issued by the city’s High Court, was a blow to the local government’s contention that the protests required the declaration of emergency powers.  The mask ban quickly inflamed tensions in the city and set off more violent clashes. Ms. Lam, the chief executive, imposed the ban without seeking legislative approval by invoking powers granted under the rarely used Emergency Regulations Ordinance.  In its ruling, the court said the ban violated the city’s mini-Constitution because it was too vague and endangered the ability of the Legislative Council to make the territory’s laws. Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s office that handles Hong Kong affairs, criticized the court’s decision. Mr. Yang said the ruling had “brazenly challenged the authority of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and the governance powers of the chief executive conferred by the law,” according to an online statement from the office. He gave a veiled warning for the Hong Kong judiciary to fall into line, citing China’s view of the Basic Law. “We will continue paying close attention to the developments in this case,” Mr. Yang said. “It is to be hoped that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and judicial organs will strictly carry out their duties according to the Basic Law, and shoulder a common responsibility to halt the violence and chaos and restore order.” Masks have been worn by protesters since the early days of the movement, as a way for protesters to conceal their identities and protect themselves from the pepper spray and tear gas routinely deployed by the police. Many protesters saw the law as a pretext that would allow officers to arrest nonviolent demonstrators in order to discourage people from joining the street actions.  The Trump administration has been muted about its position on the Hong Kong unrest, even though many Republicans and Democrats have expressed strong support for the protesters and their cause.   On Monday, Mr. Pompeo called for all sides in the escalating conflict to exercise restraint, and said the territory’s government should start an independent investigation into violent incidents that have punctuated the protests. Such an investigation presumably would include reviewing accusations of police misconduct. Chinese leaders, on the other hand, have increasingly castigated the protesters as thugs and seditionists who have been encouraged by China’s adversaries.  Last Thursday, President Xi Jinping of China made his toughest comments so far about the protests. According to a People’s Daily report of a speech Mr. Xi gave in Brazil, he said China “staunchly supports the Hong Kong police in sternly enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judicial authorities in punishing violent criminals.” Austin Ramzy and Tiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Chris Buckley from Beijing and Edward Wong from Washington.

"For the Eurostar Tribe, Brexit Could Make Brussels Feel Even Farther Away",2019-11-18,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['ON THE TRAIN FROM LONDON TO BRUSSELS — Just as the high-speed train dived under the English Channel, Mujtaba Rahman frantically typed an email on his smartphone and hit send. A short ride later, through a dark void that briefly blocked both his ears and his cellphone reception, he was hurtling across the rolling fields of France. “On the way in and out of the tunnel is a really good time to do some thinking,” Mr. Rahman said.  What he thinks a lot about these days is Brexit. Mr. Rahman once worked for the British government, helping tie its fortunes ever more closely to the European Union. Today, he consults private clients on the risks of Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc.  He is part of a tribe of lawyers, economists, journalists and trade experts who helped turn the high-speed train, known as the Eurostar, into the embodiment of the idea of the near-borderless world that the European Union stood for. Ironically, the Eurostar, which turned 25 last week, has become the primary vehicle they use for going back and forth to undo the relationship they once helped build.  For those living in London, the Eurostar has made weekends in Paris (or Brussels, or now even Amsterdam) — or vice versa — simple, fast and relatively affordable. It enabled a professional class to bounce back and forth under the English Channel that once served as a moat — protective or isolating, depending on the traveler’s perspective. These days, regular passengers include the British negotiators working on pulling their country out of the European Union, who have often boarded the train twice a week to head to Brussels for talks about the divorce.  And then there are the others, like Mr. Rahman, whose professional lives revolve around the links that are being severed.  If Brexit eventually happens, as seems likely, the ease of travel they have depended on, contingent on quick immigration checks for European Union passport holders, seems certain to change.  The fate of the train itself may hang in the balance. For now, the executives who run it watch and wait.  Tickets are still selling fast. In August, a record total of one million passengers rode the Eurostar between London and its destinations of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. The company reported booming profits in 2017 and 2018, and has strengthened its marketing, bolstered by American demand and a growing preference for green travel. But the Eurostar’s future will depend a lot on what Brexit ultimately looks like. A no-deal withdrawal could be catastrophic for business. Documents leaked to the news media this year predicted that a no-deal or “hard” Brexit precipitating stricter and time-consuming passport checks by the French authorities would prompt 15,000-person-long lines at St. Pancras, the major rail station in London served by the Eurostar. Officials and experts predict privately that the company would not survive more than 12 weeks in such an adverse scenario. Eurostar said that the doomsday scenario was “misleading.” “We have worked closely with governments on both sides of the Channel, including the Department for Transport, to ensure that we continue operating in a deal or no-deal scenario,” Rosie Jones, a spokeswoman, said in an email.  “Eurostar has been working extensively with our station partners, governments and control authorities on both sides of the Channel to ensure that robust plans are in place to protect services and to manage customer flows effectively,” she added.  For now, the Eurostar shoots back and forth every day, beneath the Channel, catapulting its traveling tribe between the European capitals. Private and professional lives have been formed and played out through this linkup, and careers will continue to be built around it in a post-Brexit world. Mr. Rahman’s entire adult life is a case in point. A Briton by birth, he quickly became drawn to European Union policymaking and specialized in the subject at university. He joined the British Civil Service as an entry-level professional in a special program that fast-tracks promising graduates with expertise in the European Union. Having spent three years in Brussels on secondment from the British government, Mr. Rahman jumped to the private sector, where he is a prominent analyst, heading up the Europe practice at Eurasia Group, a political-risk consulting firm. He says the seeds of Brexit were sown from the start of Britain’s relationship with Europe. “Britain always sought to extract economic benefits of being a member of the club, without any of the political consequences of being one,” Mr. Rahman said. “It sought to retain sovereignty to the greatest extent possible, it never signed up to political integration.”  Mr. Rahman likes the time he spends on the train, he said on a recent trip as the high-speed shuttle entered the so-called Eurotunnel, the undersea passage that links Britain to France, an engineering feat and the world’s longest underwater railway corridor. Nina dos Santos, Europe editor for CNN, said she remembered being a student at a French school in London when the Eurotunnel was inaugurated in 1994; some of her schoolmates were the children of French engineers working on the groundbreaking piece of infrastructure. Today, she regularly rides back and forth between London, where she’s based at the American network’s Europe headquarters, and Brussels, where she goes to cover Brexit. “I’ve been riding this train to Brussels for 15 years,” she said sipping coffee on a recent morning across the street from the European Commission building in Brussels. Ms. Dos Santos, who speaks six languages, said she sometimes overheard other passengers’ conversations on the Eurostar. “So many people are in similar lines of business — lobbying the E.U., lawyers, politicians and so on — and so often it’s like a little bubble of us traveling between the two cities, a microcosm of Britain’s E.U. membership,” she said. Many of those who once took this train from Brussels to advise companies in London on how to influence the European Union’s industry regulations now travel to advise them on how to survive the withdrawal and navigate the post-Brexit world. Sebastian Vos is one of them. Born in The Hague, Mr. Vos is a top lobbyist in Brussels, heading up the policy practice for Europe at Covington, an American law firm. He predicted that many of his clients, among them some major technology firms, would not abandon London and, regardless of the changes, would continue to be hugely affected by European Union policies. When Britain leaves the European Union (or “if,” as Mr. Vos likes to stress), part of his job will be to advise his clients on how to continue complying with regulations in Europe and in Britain, and how to tackle the possibility that some of those regulations will diverge, as London begins to carve out its own rules. “Brexit, if it does happen, will definitely lead to all kinds of friction,” Mr. Vos said, though he added that the original shock of the withdrawal had waned. Georgina Wright, a senior researcher at the London-based Institute of Government think tank, said that the one thing that could not happen was that Britain cut itself off fully from the Continent. “You can’t unplug the U.K. from the E.U. — energy, data flows, there are all these pipelines that run between the two,” she noted. The Eurostar, she says, is one of those links, and one that has had a special role in her own life.  Born to British parents and raised in Brussels, Ms. Wright said she remembered what a game changer it was when the Eurotunnel was built and introduced a shuttle for passengers who wanted to take their cars to Britain from mainland Europe. Before that, Ms. Wright said, when the family went on their regular visits to grandparents in England, they would wake up early, drive to Calais, France, and wait in the bitter cold to board a ferry that would take them, slowly, to Dover, England. Even with Brexit pending, some are starting to look to the future and what Britain’s new relationship with the European Union will look like.  Mr. Rahman predicts a flurry of activity, with British officials riding the train to Brussels regularly to negotiate the new, post-divorce links. Ms. Wright agreed. “If you think the Brexit negotiations have been complicated, wait until we start negotiating the future,” she said with a chuckle.']",The high-speed rail link was once the locomotive embodiment of the ideal of a border-free Continent. But Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. leaves the service facing an uncertain future.
"China Defends Crackdown on Muslims, and Criticizes Times Article",2019-11-18,By Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — The Chinese government on Monday portrayed the country’s crackdown in the western region of Xinjiang as a great success against terrorism, trying to counter renewed international criticism prompted by a New York Times article detailing the internal deliberations that led to the mass detention of Muslims in re-education camps and prisons.  A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, criticized the newspaper’s report, published on Sunday, saying the article smeared China’s efforts against extremism. But he did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked internal documents that confirmed the coercive nature of the measures used against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in western China over the past three years. A statement from the Xinjiang regional government of China was far more strident, saying the Times article had been “completely fabricated by hostile forces at home and abroad” and calling it “total nonsense and a pack of lies, with sinister motives behind it.” The regional government’s statement did not specifically deny the authenticity of the documents on which the article was based, but repeatedly attacked what it described as fictitious reporting by The Times.  “Concocting fake news to attract eyeballs is a habitual trick of America’s New York Times, and this newspaper suffered a crisis of credibility for its fakery,” the statement said. “This time, America’s New York Times has again fabricated and concocted fake news about Xinjiang. This is nothing more than getting up to its old tricks, and is completely unworthy of refutation. This despicable conduct will surely be met with the contempt of wiser minds in the international community.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said: “Our story is based on more than 400 pages of leaked internal Chinese documents that provide an unprecedented inside look at the crackdown on ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region. This type of journalism is core to our mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world.” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, spoke on the floor of the Senate on Monday about the threat to Muslim ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, pointing to the Times report.  Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the documents were “a handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious and ethnic minority in a region that is supposed to be legally distinct from the rest of China.” He added the campaign was “chilling” and “systematic.” On Monday, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, wrote in a twitter message that “the documents obtained by the @NYTimes show top officials in the Chinese Communist Party directed a brutal & repressive campaign against the Uighurs and religious minorities. While this should surprise no one, it exposes the Chinese Communist Party’s lies.” The documents, provided by a member of the political establishment in China who is concerned about the crackdown, showed the direct involvement of senior officials in conceiving and ordering it. The papers included internal speeches by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, that laid the philosophical groundwork for the policy.  Mr. Geng, the foreign ministry spokesman, was asked about the article at a regularly scheduled briefing. “It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years,” he said. The Communist government once flatly dismissed reports on the mass detentions of as many as one million Muslims as fabrications, but since evidence of the camps has become irrefutable, it has stepped up attempts to defend its actions as justifiable steps to stamp out a national security threat.  Xinjiang has experienced violent attacks, but their extent remains unclear, in part because the authorities censored reports on them at the time and continues to restrict independent reporting. After The Times published its report, China’s state media tried to rebuff criticism from ethnic Uighurs in the United States, whose criticism has been highlighted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Communist Party, reported that its own reporters had visited the relatives of those Mr. Pompeo cited and found them living happily in Xinjiang. “They are ashamed of the scum among their families,” the report said, referring to the Uighurs now living abroad.  The Chinese efforts have not tempered international criticism.  A group of 12 United Nations human rights experts has presented the Chinese government with a scathing critique of its counterterrorism laws and de-radicalization regulations, warning that they flout binding obligations under international law and risk stoking the extremism they are said to be intended to prevent. In a 21-page letter addressed to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the experts said that laws and regulations that provide the legal framework for China’s mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslims are “neither necessary nor proportionate.” “While cognizant of the security situation that China may face,” they said, “we are deeply concerned that the approaches taken in the counterterrorism law not only violate fundamental rights but also may contribute to further radicalization of persons belonging to the targeted minorities, creating major and growing pockets of fear, resentment and alienation.” The letter added that “multiple laws, decrees and policies, in particular those concerning national security and terrorism, deeply erode the foundations for the viable social, economic and political development of society as a whole.” The chilling details contained in the documents obtained by The Times — such as Mr. Xi’s description of Islamist radicalism as a virus or a drug addiction that required “a period of painful, interventionary treatment” — prompted new condemnations from Western politicians. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, called the disclosures disturbing, as did several American politicians, including Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, two leading candidates in the Democratic presidential race. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the treatment of the Uighurs was “among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today.” Given the sensitive nature of the subject — and the source — China’s state media made little other mention of the issue. The Times’s website is blocked in China, but there were signs that the disclosures had filtered through the country’s so-called Great Firewall, as they received unexpected expressions of support. One user on Weibo, one of China’s most prominent social media platforms, singled out an official cited in the documents, Wang Yongzhi, who had been assigned to oversee the city of Yarkand, a cultural capital of the Uighurs. Mr. Wang, part of the Han ethnic majority in China, initially put in place many harsh measures, but became increasingly concerned about their effectiveness. When he quietly ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates, he was arrested. “History will not forget this person and this page of paper,” wrote the user, identifying himself as Still Your Old Yang. Others expressed support for the official who leaked the documents. But Mr. Geng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that Xinjiang had become a model for counterterrorism efforts. “The New York Times not only shut its eyes and ears to the above-mentioned facts,” he said, “but even use the clumsy tricks of grafting flowers and twigs to taking out of context and hyping the so-called internal documents to smear and discredit China’s antiterrorism and de-extremism capabilities in Xinjiang.” Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva and Edward Wong from Washington.']",
"Prince Andrew Talks About His Ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and Britain Is Appalled",2019-11-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When members of the British royal family consent to warts-and-all television interviews about their troubled private lives, it generally has the effect of roiling the waters rather than calming them. So when Prince Andrew set out to explain his friendship with the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a BBC interview broadcast Saturday night, it backfired predictably.  Viewers were left shaking their heads at the wisdom of consenting to a polite-but-relentless grilling by the journalist Emily Maitlis in the first place. Many said they found his statements alternately defensive, unpersuasive or just plain strange. Prince Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, repeatedly denied accusations by Virginia Roberts Giuffre that he had sex with her when she was 17 years old and had been offered to him by Mr. Epstein. Under insistent questioning by Ms. Maitlis, the duke insisted he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms. Giuffre.  But he could not explain the photograph taken in a London house that appeared to show him with his arm around the girl’s bare waist, and with Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, smiling in the background. He disputed her account of an alleged meeting between him and Ms. Giuffre in a club in London. She has claimed that he sweated profusely while they danced, but he told the BBC that he could not have sweated while dancing with her at the time because he had a medical condition, dating from his combat tour in the Falklands War, that did not allow him to perspire. He said he has since begun to sweat again. When asked whether he regretted his relationship with Mr. Epstein, which continued after the financier served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution, Prince Andrew said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.” “Unbecoming?” the BBC interviewer, Ms. Maitlis, replied with a tone of incredulity. “He was a sex offender.” The duke quickly backtracked, saying: “Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite. I mean, in the sense that he was a sex offender.” The reaction in the British media and on social media was uniformly withering.  “Not one single word of remorse,” said a banner headline in The Mail on Sunday.  “No Sweat … and No Regret,” said The Sunday Mirror. “I couldn’t have slept with teenager, I was at Pizza Express,” said The Sunday Telegraph, referring to Prince Andrew’s contention that he had taken one of his daughters to a pizza restaurant on the night in 2001 that Ms. Giuffre said they danced, drank and had sex. The Sunday Times and other news outlets reported that Jason Stein resigned two weeks ago as the prince’s public relations adviser because he believed that the duke’s decision to agree to the BBC interview “could backfire.” Public relations experts expressed bafflement at the decision of Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, to prostrate himself before television cameras when his answers to the accusations Ms. Giuffre made in a legal filing and in countless newspaper interviews were so unconvincing. In August, as other accusers stepped forward, she said of the prince, “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.” In his interview, the duke cast doubt on several accusations. For example, in explaining the photograph that appeared to show him with Ms. Giuffre, he stopped short of saying the picture had been doctored, as some of his friends have suggested. But he said that he never dresses casually when in London, that he avoids public displays of affection with strangers and that he could not have been at the place the photograph was taken. “The photograph was taken upstairs,” Prince Andrew said, “and I don’t believe I ever went upstairs.” Perhaps even more damaging was his explanation about why he stayed with Mr. Epstein at his Manhattan mansion in 2010, after his host was released from prison. It was “convenient,” the prince said, though he insisted that he had made the visit solely to break off their relationship. As for a photograph of Prince Andrew, now 59, walking with Mr. Epstein in Central Park that was published in The Daily Mail in August, renewing questions about the propriety of their association, the duke said with a wan smile: “That’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family.”  “We try and uphold the highest standards and practices,” he added, “and I let the side down, as simple as that.” Even after all the lurid details of Mr. Epstein’s trafficking in underage girls emerged in court, Prince Andrew refused to say in the BBC interview that he regretted being friends with Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in August.  The prince said that Mr. Epstein had introduced him to an array of interesting people, broadening his horizons after serving in the Royal Navy and benefiting his work as a trade envoy for Britain. Prince Andrew is not the only prominent figure called to be embarrassed by his association with Mr. Epstein. Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder, recently said he regretted having met with him on a few occasions. But the duke’s relationship with Mr. Epstein was far more extensive: He visited Mr. Epstein at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., as well as his private island in the Caribbean. Prince Andrew said he had also invited Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to parties at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, another royal estate. The Duke of York said he did not notice anything untoward on any of those visits and theorized that Mr. Epstein and his staff had behaved differently when the prince was around. He even said he did not know Mr. Epstein that well, having met him through his friendship with Ms. Maxwell, a British socialite. Prince Andrew acknowledged that Ms. Giuffre’s accusations had taken a toll on his family, overshadowed his charity work and cast a legal shadow over him. Even as she and others have called on him to repeat his denials in court, he said he would have to consult lawyers before doing so under oath.  But if his goal in going before the cameras was to put an unpleasant episode behind him, Prince Andrew perhaps could have learned from the experiences of his older brother, Prince Charles, and his late sister-in-law, Princess Diana. Charles, the Prince of Wales, cooperated with a wide-ranging interview with the journalist Jonathan Dimbleby in 1994 that was dominated by his confession that he had been unfaithful to his wife. A year later, Diana famously told another interviewer, Martin Bashir, that “there were three of us in this marriage,” referring to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his wife. Last month, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, also opened up to the TV interviewer Tom Bradby. She said she was struggling with being a royal and a new mother. And Prince Harry kindled rumors of a rift in the royal family by saying that he and his brother, Prince William, were on “different paths at the moment.” He added, “I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.”']",Viewers were incredulous that the Duke of York subjected himself to polite-but-relentless grilling about accusations that he had sex with a teenager. 
Samoa Closes Schools as Measles Epidemic Kills at Least 16,2019-11-18,By Isabella Kwai,"['Schools in the Pacific island nation of Samoa were closed indefinitely on Monday and children were barred from public gatherings amid a measles epidemic that has killed at least 16 people, many of them younger than age 2.  As Samoa, a country of about 200,000 people that is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, declared an emergency last week, health officials said they were “anticipating the worst to come.”  At least 1,174 potential cases of measles have been recorded, and 189 people have been hospitalized, the government said in a statement on Tuesday. In the last day alone, 114 cases were recorded and a 7-month-old infant died. Almost all of the cases are on the island of Upolu, with children below the age of 5 most severely affected. Experts said the situation could worsen, and called the Samoan government’s response to the epidemic delayed.  “It’s as bad as you’re seeing and probably worse,” said Dr. Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccinologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “This is very much out of control.” The epidemic has come as the immunization rate against measles has plummeted in Samoa in the years since a medical mistake led to the deaths of two infants and spurred widespread mistrust of vaccinations. In those cases, nurses mistakenly administered a vaccine mixed with an anaesthetic. The immunization rate dropped to as low as 30 percent last year from about 60 percent in 2016, according to figures from the World Health Organization. By contrast, in Fiji, Tonga and American Samoa, where outbreaks have also been reported, about 90 percent of children have been immunized. On Friday, the Samoan government declared that measles vaccinations would be mandatory, and that children under 17 barred from public gatherings and medical facilities unless sick. The National University of Samoa said that it had closed its campuses and would delay scheduled exams until further notice.  There has been a global resurgence of measles in the last several\xa0years, and in August the World Health Organization said that the number of cases had almost tripled in a year. Officials have attributed the increase in part to poverty that has left many countries unable to vaccinate with sufficient regularity. A number of\xa0measles cases in Samoa have been linked to New Zealand, the country’s former colonial power, which has been struggling with its own outbreak, Dr. Petousis-Harris said. Winston Peters, the New Zealand foreign affairs minister, said on Monday that would send 18 more vaccination nurses, for a total of\xa030, along with 3,000 units of the vaccine, to help contain the epidemic in the coming month.  Australia has also sent medical aid at the request of Samoan officials, according to the country’s health department. The Australians have sent 26 medical practitioners with urgent supplies and a portable intensive care unit. Other Pacific governments have also acted. American Samoa declared a health emergency last week and said that travelers to American Samoa from Samoa must now provide proof of measles vaccination. Sasha Gattermayr contributed reporting.']","Over 1,000 cases of measles have been recorded in the Pacific island country, with the casualties including a 7-month-old. “This is very much out of control,” a vaccine expert said.

"After a Massacre, Ethiopia’s Leader Faces Anger, and a Challenger",2019-11-18,By Simon Marks,"['ADAMA, Ethiopia — Not long after security forces tried to arrest him in the middle of the night, Jawar Mohammed, a media baron and one of Ethiopia’s most prominent political activists, found himself face to face with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the man whose government ordered his arrest.  Sitting at a table in a state conference room in the capital, Addis Ababa, the two men met on Nov. 3 to talk about preventing more of the ethnic violence that erupted in October after Mr. Jawar’s supporters began protesting his botched arrest. Eighty-six people died in two days.  Since the bloody protests, the two men have agreed to tone down the violence, and Mr. Jawar has announced plans to take his case to the ballot box. He intends to run in next year’s elections to unseat Mr. Abiy, his one-time ally.  Mr. Abiy, who became prime minister only last year,  was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month for his efforts to end Ethiopia’s long-running war with Eritrea and to bring greater political and economic freedoms to a country that had suffered decades of repression. But the ethnic tensions that have torn this country apart in the past have resurfaced in recent months, and the clashes in October were the deadliest since Mr. Abiy came to power. The violence has tested Mr. Abiy’s claim to be a new kind of leader who can unify the country and usher in a new era of political freedom.  His efforts to reform the country have empowered the opposition — including Mr. Jawar and his followers — and set loose “centrifugal forces from the inside,” said Tobias Hagmann, a political scientist and expert on Ethiopia at Roskilde University in Denmark. “He has all this discourse about national unity, reconciliation and forgiveness, but at the same time, things are happening in the streets, and politics is up for grabs,” Mr. Hagmann said.  In Mr. Abiy’s first months in office, he lifted the state of emergency, freed political prisoners, legalized opposition groups that had been outlawed, and dismissed military and civilian leaders suspected of corruption. The country breathed a sigh of relief. A signature initiative of Mr. Abiy has been trying to persuade his fellow citizens to subordinate their ethnic identities to a national one. But Mr. Jawar and his allies say they want a government that respects their demands for greater regional sovereignty.  Ethiopia has nine semiautonomous regions, where ethnic conflict is rampant and groups that have been newly empowered by the recent democratic overhaul are demanding the ability to run their own affairs.  One ethnic group — the Sidama — is seeking to create a 10th semiautonomous region. A referendum that would decide the matter is scheduled for Wednesday, and there are fears that the vote could descend into further violence. Mr. Jawar said he would run for a parliamentary seat in Oromia, a sprawling region of about 30 million mostly rural dwellers, consisting of dozens of different ethnic groups. His aim is to create a political party there with the goal of winning enough seats to name him prime minister.  His Oromia Media Network, which has over a million followers on Facebook, gives him a powerful platform to sway voters, and he has proved his ability to mobilize his supporters. “I will contest and I will challenge him,” Mr. Jawar said of Mr. Abiy in an interview. “And I will defeat him, there is no question about it.” When Mr. Jawar alerted his followers on Oct. 23 that there was a plan to arrest or possibly kill him at his house in Addis Ababa, they came out in force to support him.  The violence that resulted was particularly deadly in Adama, a city in Oromia about 60 miles east of Addis Ababa. According to hospital records, 17 people died in the city. Thousands of supporters of Mr. Jawar, many belonging to his Oromo ethnic group, marched through the streets of Adama, and as they began to block roads, a separate group of people, many from different ethnic groups, confronted them. Both sides were armed with machetes, knives and pistols, and deadly clashes ensued. Government security forces shot and killed at least 10 protesters. “This is a city of many nationalities where many people live. So when one group comes and starts protesting, I also wanted to defend myself,” said Said, 34, an Adama resident and a member of the Amhara Democratic Party, which advocates the rights of the Amhara ethnic group. “That self-defense later on turned into an offensive on our side,” he added. Said asked to be identified using just his first name because he feared reprisals.  Mr. Jawar has not only shown that he can mobilize people to take to the streets but also that he can get them to return to their homes. On the second day of the protests, Mr. Jawar held a news conference and called for an end to the violence. “Open the blocked roads, clean the towns of barricades, treat those who have been injured during the protests and reconcile with those you have quarreled with,” he told his supporters.  The killing stopped. But Mr. Jawar’s prospects for electoral success are uncertain.  One major stumbling block: Because Mr. Jawar has dual American citizenship, he isn’t yet eligible to run for office in Ethiopia. In fact, he announced his candidacy in Minneapolis, an American city with a large community of Ethiopian immigrants. Mr. Jawar used to support Mr. Abiy, deploying his social media power to help him get elected prime minister in the country of 105 million people.  But now, Mr. Jawar and his Oromo followers accuse the prime minister of hypocrisy. While Mr. Abiy has lifted restrictions that once silenced government critics, released some political prisoners and removed some groups from terrorists lists, the prime minister is still engaged in oppressive tactics, Mr. Jawar said.  Dozens of offices of one political organization that was removed from a terrorist list — the Oromo Liberation Front — have been shut down and thousands of its supporters taken to detention centers in the past year and a half, according to the group’s leader, Dawud Ibsa, and to some human rights groups in Ethiopia. In addition to greater regional autonomy, Mr. Jawar said he wanted an end to what he described as politically motivated arrests. In an interview at his heavily guarded office in Addis Ababa about a week after the protests, Mr. Jawar said that he had wanted to remain supportive of the prime minister, “with me managing the Oromo people for him so he can focus on federal issues.”  But, Mr. Jawar said, the prime minister “has encroached on this, pushing to centralize, excluding many people.” He added that the prime minister “has done good in dismantling the old system, but he hasn’t done anything to replace it.” A spokeswoman for the prime minister declined to comment on Mr. Jawar’s election plans. But at a news conference on Nov. 3, Mr. Abiy said he would continue to implement his vision for Ethiopia. “We have to stop those forces pulling us back two steps while we are moving one step forward,” he said. Like Mr. Jawar, Mr. Abiy is Oromo, but the prime minister has downplayed his ethnicity as part of his efforts to unify the country. And Mr. Abiy’s support comes from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds who want to see a more modern, progressive country and who support his moves to diversify Ethiopia’s agricultural economy.  Mr. Abiy’s critics, including Mr. Jawar, had been holding talks with Mr. Abiy to try to reach a power-sharing agreement that could allow them to have a voice in government even though they lack seats in Parliament. It’s unclear how Mr. Jawar’s candidacy would affect those talks, but he said he would like to continue them. The prime minister has also been holding talks with the four ethnic-driven parties that make up his governing coalition: the Oromo Democratic Party, the Amhara Democratic Party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement. On Sunday, Mr. Abiy said that talks had advanced to merge the parties, though it was unclear if the Tigray group had agreed. The merger could help avert further ethnic violence. “Abiy and his comrades rode Oromo nationalism to come to power. Now he is ignoring it,” said Getachew Reda, an executive member of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. “I don’t think that is a working formula. You have to give them a voice.” In the aftermath of last month’s violence, Mr. Abiy’s popularity has suffered, his rivals and analysts say, and regular Ethiopians have expressed concern that the unrest could signal the start of more widespread ethnic fighting.  Just days after the protests, Mr. Abiy was greeted with boos from hundreds of protesters when he visited Ambo, a town in Oromia that has been a hotbed of antigovernment protests for years.

"Iraq Officials, Responding to Times Report, Deny Aiding Iran",2019-11-19,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['Several senior Iraqi officials named in a New York Times report based on leaked Iranian intelligence cables denied on Monday that they were close to Iran or that they had given sensitive information to its government.  The report, based on about 700 pages of secret Iranian intelligence cables obtained by The Intercept and shared with The Times, was published online early Monday and shed light on the extent of Tehran’s reach inside Iraq’s power circles.  The cables record years of effort by the Iranians to cultivate senior Iraqi politicians, some of whom were said to have passed on information and to have committed to helping the Islamic Republic. The leaked documents describe in detail Iran’s efforts to obtain informants and to persuade Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides.  The cables date from 2014 and 2015, when Iraq was under siege by militants from the Islamic State and Iran’s help was critical to its survival.  In the Times article, the cables’ descriptions of the connections to Iran of several senior Iraqi officials, including the current prime minister, Adil Abdul Mahdi, and a former prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, are detailed at length. They include direct quotes attributed to the Iraqis in reports filed to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, or M.O.I.S. Some of those officials on Monday expressed private dismay, public outrage or both, at being mentioned in the article. Among them were Mr. al-Abadi, the former prime minister, and Lt. Gen. Hatem al-Maksusi, who at the time he was mentioned in the cables was commander of military intelligence in Iraq’s Defense Ministry.  Mr. al-Abadi denied that he had attended a private meeting with an Iranian agent who went by the name Boroujerdi, as recounted in the cables. In a statement on Facebook, he said, “We categorically deny that such a meeting took place.”  Mr. al-Abadi said: “There was no such meeting on his schedule and it is unreasonable that a figure like the prime minister would meet and coordinate with a person with an obscure and unknown rank. It is a stupid and suspicious claim.”  Another Iraqi cited in the article, Bayan Jabr, a former transportation minister, criticized The Times report for not fully quoting his response to the description in the cables of his relationship with the Iranians. The cables said Mr. Jabr had agreed to a request from Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, to fly planeloads of weapons and others supplies through Iraqi airspace to Syria to help the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against American-backed rebels.  According to the cables, Mr. Jabr granted the request.  Mr. Jabr was quoted in the Times article as saying that the flights were carrying humanitarian supplies and religious pilgrims. His office restated that on Monday, and said the article should have noted that at the time, Mr. Jabr had not yet officially taken up the position of minister, and that the planes were “subject to periodic searches by the Americans.”  Another figure mentioned in the cables, and in the Times report, Salim al-Jabouri, the speaker of Iraq’s Parliament in 2014 and 2015, questioned the timing of the article and said it might have been published “to incite the street” against the government. Popular opinion in Iraq is already running heavily against the government, with protests underway throughout the country.  General al-Maksusi played down the significance of the Times report. He was depicted in the cables as putting all of Iraq’s military intelligence at the service of Iran. In comments published in the Times article, he denied working for Iran but praised the country for helping Iraq fight the Islamic State. He said he had also worked closely with the United States.  On Monday, a statement put out by General al-Maksusi’s office said that “military intelligence worked closely” with a committee made up of representatives of four countries after 2014 — Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq — “in the fight against ISIS.”  “The details mentioned in the report did not come up with something new,” the statement said. “It’s natural that intelligence information would be exchanged when there is an agreement on intelligence sharing.”  The leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from the Persian and shared them with The Times. The Intercept and The Times verified the authenticity of the documents but do not know who leaked them. The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to “let the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","Several current and former Iraqi officials, named in leaked spy cables, said they had not provided Tehran with sensitive information.

Lebanon Protesters Shut Down Parliament and Clash With Police,2019-11-19,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Protesters on Tuesday stopped Parliament from convening to discuss a package of controversial laws that critics fear could provide amnesty for past corruption, as crowds blocked roads leading to government buildings and skirmishes broke out with the riot police. The action comes on the 34th day of widespread antigovernment protests that have both galvanized and paralyzed the country, and the protesters’ success seemed likely to sharpen tensions between the government and the people. Several lawmakers had said before the Parliament session was postponed that they would boycott the session, but others on Tuesday could not get through the roadblocks on streets surrounding government buildings.  The session had already been pushed back once: Protesters vowed last week to form a human chain to prevent lawmakers from gathering.  Scuffles broke out on Tuesday at the barbed-wire barrier between the public square where demonstrators have gathered day and night and the government palace overlooking it. The riot police were seen beating some protesters with sticks and knocking them to the ground.  Nearby, shots were fired into the air as protesters blocked a convoy of cars attempting to carry a lawmaker to the Parliament building.  Since former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his cabinet resigned on Oct. 29, the country’s powerful political blocs have been reluctant to form a new government of nonpolitical experts, as the protesters have demanded. Instead, after weeks of deliberation during which the economy slid further toward crisis, the parties proposed a new candidate for prime minister: Mohammad Safadi, a wealthy former finance minister.  The protesters rejected him immediately, saying he was too closely identified with the political class they want swept from power. The move is just one of a series of proposed changes that the protesters have rejected as half measures that would do little to overhaul Lebanon’s sectarian political system, eradicate government corruption or save the crumbling economy.  Among the laws that were to be discussed on Tuesday was amnesty for certain prisoners, including those convicted of drug-related crimes, those accused of joining a terrorist organization and those accused of shooting weapons.  The proposal has long been popular in parts of the country where many residents have been prosecuted over such crimes, but protesters and civil society activists have questioned whether such amnesty could be applied equitably and safely. And critics warn it could potentially be extended to provide blanket amnesty for past corruption. The demonstrations, which by some measures have at times drawn a quarter of Lebanon’s population into the streets, have been largely peaceful.  But at least four people have been killed in events related to the protests. Last week, a soldier shot a man who was helping to block a road in the town of Khalde.

"Maybe This Time, the Bikes Won’t End Up in the River",2019-11-18,By Lidia Sirna,"['In 2013, Rome pulled the plug on its bike share program after it ran out of money and cars kept double-parking in front of its bike racks. Last year, a Hong Kong company gave up after many of its green bicycles ended up in the Tiber river. Months later, a Singapore company bailed after Romans stole the yellow bikes and broke them down for parts. Rome has been a bike share wasteland, but Uber says things will be different for the shiny new red bikes it has introduced all over the city. “We’ve tested ours on Rome’s cobblestones,” said Michele Biggi, the manager of Uber’s Jump electric-bike program in southwestern Europe, who added that previous competitors’ bikes weren’t up to the city’s demands and “could have fallen down with just a gust of wind.” He has big plans for the Uber bikes, he said, which “will change Rome and give the city a new lifeblood.” Maybe. Uber and its competitors have already introduced similar pedal-assisted bikes and electric scooters in Paris, London, Lisbon, Brussels and other cities that in several cases are overrun with rolling menaces. (Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has decried “the scooter anarchy.”) But Rome, the first Italian city to get Uber’s electric-bicycle service, is not any other European city. Rome could be a bike-share dream in one respect: there is no shortage of demand. The city has only two finished subway lines (a third is perennially under construction), and buses come late, fail to show up and occasionally explode. Driving on the city’s notoriously clogged streets is a nightmare. Parking is worse. But the obstacles to a bike share program are daunting: Rome’s infamous potholes, its mounds of uncollected trash, double-parked cars, a strong vandal spirit in place since the actual Vandals sacked Rome, and a local resistance to change and physical exertion. Rome’s embattled mayor, Virginia Raggi, urged Romans to show that the city is civilized after all. “If we don’t want these bikes to be badly treated, guess who it is up to?” Ms. Raggi said at the Uber bikes’ unveiling on Oct. 21. “Romans themselves are the first defense against degradation.” The company is introducing a fleet of 2,800 bicycles that can be left practically anywhere, and they seem to be everywhere. They are parked near the Colosseum, stashed in alleyways or rested against stop signs. Newspapers reported that government officials had parked two bikes in the courtyard of the Italian equivalent of the White House. Uber has a complicated history in Rome. In 2013, the company introduced a version of its car service and it grew fast, threatening Rome’s taxi drivers, who staged strikes. An Italian court later outlawed the service on the grounds of unfair competition. Ultimately, Uber was limited to operating its more expensive luxury-car service, Uber Black. Some Romans are happy that the company is trying again. “They have simply saved my life,” said Luca Zanini, a 25-year-old college student. “When the bus is not on time, I always use them.” But not all Romans are fans. “Rome Is Gross,” a well-known social media feed decrying the city’s degradation, has posted complaints about the high price of the Uber bikes, which cost 50 cents to unlock and then 20 cents for every minute of use. That is about the rate charged by car-sharing services. “You can afford it only if you live in the city center,” said Andrea Quatrini, a 52-year-old public sector employee. “Otherwise it’s impossible.” So far, Uber is happy with how things are going. It says that GPS locaters on the bikes allow for constant monitoring, making them less vulnerable to theft. The company says there have not been any specific acts of vandalism. But the bikes’ baskets are already doubling as trash cans in a city without many of them. And photos circulating on a Facebook page for Roman cyclists showed bikes that had been knocked over like red dominoes near the Bocca della Verità, or Mouth of Truth. “We hope those who damage them will be severely punished,” the post read.']","Uber has launched a bike share program in Rome, where potholes, vandalism, traffic and theft have defeated previous attempts.

Parents of Besieged Hong Kong Protesters Come to the Front Lines,2019-11-19,By Tiffany May and Paul Mozur,"['HONG KONG — One mother fell to her knees before riot police officers and begged for her daughter’s release. Another promised she would boil soup for a trapped son before he made a desperate escape across police lines. From a distance, a father got his first glimpse of his son in days — as the son was led away in handcuffs. As the police siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University trapped more than 1,000 pro-democracy protesters this week, another group entangled in the city’s crisis has turned conspicuously outspoken: their parents.  The voices of mothers and fathers, racked by fear and anger, emerged as a call for compromise in the standoff on the campus, where on Tuesday several dozen holdouts remained.   Many parents worried not only about the safety of students in Hong Kong’s increasingly violent protests, but also about the longer-term consequences for young adults whose lives could now be upended by abruptly truncated educations, criminal charges and prison.  At the same time, parents said their exposure to the police tactics — some have seen police beatings or been hit with nonlethal projectiles themselves in the mayhem —  had made them more sympathetic to their children’s choices to defy and resist.    “If it were not for my daughter being inside, I would not have stood so close to the front,” said Sam Ho, a 43-year-old interior designer. His 17-year-old daughter told his wife that she had gone to the school, known as PolyU, to return books on Sunday. Soon after, her online communications cut off. Without telling her parents, she later joined a pro-peace prayer meeting on campus. That day, the police blocked exits to the campus after protesters had set fire to a bridge, stopping traffic on a key tunnel nearby. The move effectively trapped the protesters, leaving them to fight it out or leave in handcuffs. It also drew demonstrators from across the city into violent confrontations with the police as they sought to rescue people from the standoff.  “Before, I wondered whether some things the protesters, or those who appeared to be protesters, did cross a line. But now I have a deeper understanding of why they had to use those tactics,” said Mr. Ho, adding that he had been most worried that the police would hit and kick his daughter. Video footage of a number of arrests outside the campus showed police officers beating detained students.  Mr. Ho was so distraught on the first night that he joined three parents in a wild rescue bid. The group scaled a high chain-link fence to get onto campus, but abandoned their attempt after one was shot by the police with a beanbag round and tumbled into the bushes.  Being close to the action changed Mr. Ho’s thinking on the petrol bombs that protesters were hurling toward riot officers. “The Molotov cocktails they throw are mainly to create a distance from the police,” he said. Mr. Ho was one of a few hundred parents, many with students inside, who sat near police lines wearing masks and holding signs with messages like “Save the kids, don’t kill our children” and “They are children of God! Let them go!” Many said they had come out simply to be close to their children inside the campus, just hundreds of feet away.  At a news conference they held on Tuesday, the parents made pleas to the Hong Kong authorities, questioning the uncompromising language that has become standard in the city’s political impasse.  Several criticized the authorities for having labeled everyone on campus as rioters. For months, Hong Kong’s police and government, along with China’s state news media, have used the term “rioter” to describe protesters, whether peaceful or violent. “Why should all the students inside be charged with rioting no matter what role they played? What kind of logic is this?” said Chu Chan, a 50-year-old warehouse worker. Her son had remained on campus because he feared a rioting charge that can carry a 10-year prison sentence. As of Tuesday afternoon, he was still on campus. Ms. Chan said her son was studying to be a social worker and cared about others.  “When I heard he was inside PolyU, I began shivering,” she said. “I started to blame him, but then I remembered that he was probably feeling more helpless than me inside. I cannot condemn him.” For the parents, potential incarceration of their children is just one concern. Food supplies ran low during the days-long deadlock, cellphone signals were intermittent and the water supply was eventually cut off.  On Sunday evening, the police warned that they could use live rounds against the protesters. Students inside said that food and supplies were inadequate and that they were without medical care after first-aid workers were arrested. During a police raid on Monday morning, explosions and shots boomed off buildings.  Then came the escape attempts. Some students glided down ropes off bridges and jumped onto the backs of waiting motorcycles. Others made futile charges through plumes of tear gas in an attempt to break through cordons of armed riot police officers. Dozens took to the sewers in a subterranean dash for freedom but turned back, sickened by the fetid dankness.  Rescuers said that at least 200 protesters in all had managed to escape. Around 70 were sent to the hospital for hypothermia and dizziness after their failed sewer gambit.  In total, the police said 1,100 had been arrested or registered among a group of secondary school students who were allowed to leave early Tuesday morning. Mr. Ho’s daughter was among that group. Later Tuesday, a pro-democracy lawmaker, Ted Hui, led most of the remainder of the students peacefully off campus to be arrested. By evening,  about 50 remained.  The parents’ fears struck a nerve for a movement that has made heavy use of family analogies. Volunteer drivers who speed protesters away from the police and ferry them around the city are often called “parents” and refer to their activities as “picking up the kids.” Family support networks, rarely evident during street clashes, keep protesters — many of whom are young students — supplied with food, water and even gas masks. The protests also have caused familial strife.  Eva Lau, a 51-year-old businesswoman, said that while she had attended peaceful marches, she disagreed with her 22-year-old son over his attendance at protests that descend into violence and vandalism. On Sunday evening, as fiery clashes between protesters and the police at PolyU escalated, her son said he wanted to attend the pro-peace prayer meeting at the school. When she tried to dissuade him, she said, he told her that “if everyone thought like you, then no one would be left to protest anymore.” A native of Hunan Province in mainland China who came to Hong Kong in the mid-1980s, Ms. Lau said that she was skeptical of both ends of the political spectrum in the city, but that she had come to favor the pro-democratic camp.  She also told of a recent encounter of her own with the police. As she walked past a street clash one night, officers shined their flashlights at her, an act that prompted her to yell at them, “I used to have a great deal of respect for you, but now I have firsthand reason not to.” For her son, Ms. Lau said she hoped he would learn that there are better ways to fight injustice. Still, she said she had been thinking of rejoining the protests.  “I am against all violence, even from the kids,” she said. “But now I can see that they are being strategic in order to fight authoritarianism — and trying to resist the government.” Katherine Li contributed reporting.']",The parents of young people under siege at a university emerged as a call for compromise. 
"U.S. Offers North Korea ‘Act of Good Will.’ Not Enough, North Says.",2019-11-19,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Tuesday that the United States’ decision to postpone a joint military drill with South Korea was not enough of an incentive for it to return to the negotiating table, and that it would not discuss denuclearization until Washington ended its “hostile policy.” On Sunday, the United States defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, and his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, together announced\u200b  that the allies would postpone a joint air force drill scheduled for later this month. They described it as “an act of good will” aimed at bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table. But the North remained unsatisfied. “We demand that the U.S. quit the drill or stop it once and for all,” Kim Yong-chol, chairman of the North’s Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency on Tuesday. “The suspension of the drill does not mean ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and is not helpful to the diplomatic efforts for the settlement of issues.” Mr. Kim said\u200b, “The U.S. should not dream of the negotiations for denuclearization before dropping its hostile policy” toward the North. North Korea’s demand that Washington first build confidence and remove all threats to its “security and development” before nuclear talks can resume is a harder position than the country has taken so far. In its talks with North Korea, the Trump administration at first demanded that the North dismantle all its nuclear warheads and production facilities before international sanctions against it are lifted. After that approach failed, Washington began trying to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table\u200b by suggesting that it can discuss steps aimed at improving ties and building trust with the North together with the denuclearization of the country. \u200bNorth Korea met with American negotiators in Stockholm early last month to test the new approach, but the meeting ended in just hours without producing an agreement, \u200beven \u200bon when to meet again. The \u200bNorth Korean \u200bstatement \u200bon Tuesday \u200bwas \u200b\u200ba pointed rebuff of President Trump, although it did not mention him by name. In a Twitter post on Sunday, Mr. Trump urged North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to “act quickly, get the deal done,” and hinted that the two leaders might be able to hold another summit meeting. “I am the only one who can get you where you have to be,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding, “See you soon!” But on Tuesday, North Korea \u200baccused the United States of merely trying to buy time, though its leader has given Washington until the end of the year to propose a solution that can satisfy the North. \u200b  Time, the North said in the statement, is on its side. \u200b “We have nothing pressing and have no intention to sit on the table with the tricky U.S.,” it said. In recent \u200bweeks, North Korea has \u200b\u200bissued a series of statements\u200b, as well as conducting numerous missile and rocket tests, to put pressure on Washington as American negotiators worked to bring the country back to \u200bnegotiations. On Sunday, its Foreign Ministry said North Korea had “no willingness to meet” the United States\u200b because it recently passed a resolution against human rights abuses in the North through the United Nations. On Monday, Kim Kye-gwan, adviser to the North’s Foreign Ministry, responded to Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Sunday by \u200bsuggesting that the American leader has been negotiating in bad faith. He said North Korea had offered a lot, like its suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests, in return \u200bfor three summit meetings with \u200bMr. Trump. The Trump administration, he said, has given the North little, as Mr. Trump repeatedly boasts of progress in reducing the threats of North Korea. “We are no longer interested in such talks that bring nothing to us,” Kim Kye-gwan said. “As we have got nothing in return, we will no longer gift the U.S. president with something he can boast of, but get compensation for the successes that President Trump is proud of as his administrative achievements.” Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit meeting in June last year in Singapore, signing a broadly worded agreement for North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. But when the two leaders met again in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, and again on the inter-Korean border in June, they failed to agree on how to put the Singapore deal into effect.']",A canceled military drill was not enough to get the North Koreans back to the table to discuss denuclearization.
"First Comes Snapchat, Then the Bachelor and Spinster Ball",2019-11-19,By Damien Cave and Matthew Abbott,"['ARIAH PARK, Australia — They called it a wet T-shirt contest, but there were no winners or losers. Not many shirts, either.  One man wore nothing but a tool belt, which no one seemed to mind even as the wettest and drunkest of the young and rural Australians — both women and men — tackled each other in the thick red mud, before arising for hugs.  Two hours later, they appeared transformed: black ties for the men, dresses for the women. The Ariah Park Bachelor and Spinster Ball had officially begun. After all, 1,500 people didn’t drive forever to this tiny town (population 493) just for giggles. They were searching for love. “Yes, we’re here to meet people,” said Emme Williams, 22, a veterinary student who walked the fairgrounds in denim shorts with a few girlfriends before arriving at the ball wearing white. “I prefer the ones that don’t yell at you, the ones who want to have a conversation.” In cities, courtship has become efficient to excess. Tinder and other apps can bring intimacy faster than food delivery. But for people trying to meet and mate across Australia’s vast distances, it takes more planning and patience.  Bachelor and Spinster balls — or B&S balls, a fixture in the country since the 1880s, with about 30 each year — aim to help. And they are increasingly the catalyst for a matchmaking hybrid that combines the digital with the raw, communal and real.  The interaction starts online, with friends posting photos and descriptions of their friends in a singles Facebook group before each ball; Ms. Williams was featured scantily clad except for the wool of a freshly shorn sheep. The lucky ones move on to flirting via Snapchat. But then real-life socializing takes over. All weekend in Ariah Park, which is about a five-hour drive west of Sydney, phones largely remained out of sight so eager was everyone for eye-to-eye contact. “You’re limited to three single boys in your town, and you’re related to two of them,” said Ebony Worland, 25, one of the ball’s organizers. “These were built for single women and men to find love in the country, really.” Her own sister, Shelby Worland, 18, found a boyfriend at last year’s ball. Selling tickets this year — about $100 for food, booze and live music, plus a goody bag that included a condom — she explained that her path to coupledom began when someone named Lleyton Neven, a friend of friends, started messaging her on Snapchat.  He lived about an hour away and after he arrived in Ariah Park on Friday, when most ball-goers show up, he found an excuse to seek her out. “I didn’t know how to actually meet, so I said my phone was dead and I asked if she could charge it,” Mr. Neven said. “And now here we are!” Wobbly with beer and affection, he kissed his beloved on the cheek. “One year together!” Not all stories from the balls end so happily.  Just ask Rippy, a.k.a. Shane Anthony Williams (no relation to Ms. Williams). He’s the unofficial photographer of the B&S scene, a railroad worker with a shaved head and gray goatee who has been snapping pictures for no charge since 2009. On his Akubra hat (made famous outside Australia by Crocodile Dundee), he carries cattle tags imprinted with the names and dates of B&S balls, along with others marking specific memories. One commemorates a ball regular named Ezra who died at 19 in a car accident; another recalls a woman he knew from the balls who jumped to her death from a cliff with her 2-year-old child. “It’s hard finding love,” Rippy said, noting that his wife of 30 years was somewhere nearby. “I’d hate to be single again. It’s scary, dead set.” But that’s why the balls matter, he added. Along with the awkward singles, the free-flowing beer and the backfiring pickup trucks known as utes, turned on and off to create fiery explosions called key bangs, there are people who connected at balls and come back to socialize.  “Who here is a couple?” Rippy yelled, meandering through the crowd.  Within a minute, Jess and Matt Chown emerged. He works on sheep farms; she works at an aged-care home for veterans. “We met at a ball in 2011,” Ms. Chown said. “I laid eyes on him and it was love at first sight.” “You know why I come? To do things I can’t do in church,” Mr. Chown said. Standing at least 6-foot-3 and wider than a tree cut for timber, he kicked a trash bin, making a loud clang. Everyone laughed, including his wife.  Ms. Chown, 30, noted that they were all part of a group, “the Rummed-up Rednecks,” that convenes on Facebook and at balls. “It’s a way for us to let out our frustrations,” she said. Nearby, Ms. Williams, the veterinary student, scanned the crowd for a bachelor. After a man offering her flowers moved on, one of her friends, Stephanie Papulia, 22, pointed to a guy in an expensive new ute. “He’s got a Land Cruiser and a mullet,” Ms. Papulia said. “Ticks both boxes.” Ms. Williams pointed to another ute with large antennas. “The bigger the aerial,” she said, “the more he’s overcompensating.” Most of the men in Ariah Park were more “chivalrous,” they said, than their behavior might suggest. But some of the balls in other towns have been dangerous.  In 2017, two men were convicted of raping a woman at a ball in another state. Another man was sentenced to 18 months in prison last year for sexually assaulting two women at the Eel Skinners and Duck Pluckers B&S. In Ariah Park, security staff members walked the fairgrounds continuously.  At the ball, held under the stars after dark, the main problem seemed to be food dye. No one could explain why, but for years, attendees have felt compelled to spit dye onto each other.  The rules against bringing it in were generally ignored. Every few minutes, someone was hauled off after being caught with dye. Glitter, though, was allowed. It floated in the breeze, destined to stay in mullets forever.  And as was the case all day, the ball itself captured the silly, lonely and romantic.  The first band to perform, Whiskey Business, set the tone, playing upbeat country songs about love and traditional living.  Near the center of the stage, men bounced to the music. At one point, Ms. Williams squeezed toward the front, pulling a girlfriend by the hand. Many of the men seemed awkward. Some of the women chose to be bold. “Are you taken?” they asked their intendeds. But near the edges, there was more tenderness, as if the phases of courtship were rippling out in concentric rings.  There, stage right and near the back, a woman in a green lace dress danced with her bearded partner, swaying slowly at half the beat of the music. She leaned forward. Something he said made her laugh.  “I love you,” she told him, staring into his eyes. “I love you.” ']","In the cities, technology has transformed social life.

Dueling Matteos Battle for the Future of Italy,2019-11-17,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pity the weak and wobbly new Italian government. While its incompatible coalition partners pretend to tolerate one another, they are relegated to being nervous bystanders, and potential casualties, in the real fight for power: the Battle of the Two Matteos. Technically speaking, the former center-left prime minister Matteo Renzi and the popular anti-migrant nationalist leader Matteo Salvini may be out of power. But their sparring has come to dominate Italy’s political life and the debate over the country’s direction. The two Matteos share more than just a name. Both are ambitious. Both are extremely talented men in their 40s who have spent their entire professional lives in politics. Each represents a strikingly different vision of Italy’s future. Most of all, they need each other to get back into power.  Mr. Salvini needs the once high-flying Mr. Renzi as a punching bag — mocking him as a “misunderstood genius” whose feats “Italians didn’t notice”— to maintain his Everyman appeal as he seeks to destabilize the government and strengthen his policies against immigrants and the European Union. And Mr. Renzi needs Mr. Salvini as a boogeyman — he called him a “monster” — to elevate his profile and convince liberals that only he can keep the nationalist at bay while pushing forward his pro-globalization, pro-European and pro-American positions.  “Salvini is the perfect enemy from this point of view,” Mr. Renzi said in an interview in his Senate office, decorated with notes from former President Barack Obama.  Mr. Renzi’s support has dwindled since he resigned as prime minister in 2016, and he recently left the Democratic Party he once led to start an offshoot, Italia Viva, which for now is polling at only around 6 percent.  Mr. Salvini stumbled, with a nudge from Mr. Renzi, from his perch as interior minister this summer after dominating an Italian government that wrought havoc on the European Union with its crackdowns on migrants, skepticism about the euro and breaking of budgetary rules.  The removal of Mr. Salvini, a hard-right demagogue who seemed to the establishment a ticking time bomb poised to take control of the eurozone’s third-largest economy, prompted sighs of relief from the markets and Brussels.  But Mr. Salvini’s fall from power has not stopped his incessant campaigning, rattling the awkward government alliance of the populist Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party.  As he racks up electoral victories in regions once considered liberal strongholds, Mr. Salvini has applied excruciating external pressure on the coalition. At the same time, Mr. Renzi has proved himself an expert palace operator, applying internal pressure and gaining outsize influence from his seat in the Senate.  “I am proud of having been very Machiavellian,” Mr. Renzi said, adding that Mr. Salvini clearly did not foresee his play and that everyone prematurely counted him out as dead. “And then with a palace maneuver I sent home Europe’s most dangerous populist. So I proved that the old lion still has claws.”    Indeed, Mr. Salvini might still be in power were it not for him.  This summer, at the height of his popularity, Mr. Salvini pulled the plug on his own coalition with the Five Star Movement, in a bid for new elections. He said he wanted “full powers.”  But the plan backfired, when Five Star, surprisingly, turned to the Democratic Party to form a new parliamentary majority, leaving Mr. Salvini out of power. The two parties had loathed each other till the moment they decided to join forces.  Mr. Renzi had spent the three years since his resignation as prime minister excoriating Five Star as a band of anti-democratic hatemongers.  But when Mr. Salvini overreached, Mr. Renzi pounced. Recognizing Mr. Salvini as a greater threat, he urged his Democratic Party to join forces with Five Star. That well-concealed dagger thrust was just the start of what Mr. Renzi now envisions as a contest between the two men that will take years to unfold and potentially end in an electoral showdown.  “We won the battle inside the palace,” he said. “Now we have to win it among the people.” For the time being, Mr. Renzi said his mission was keeping Mr. Salvini out of power long enough to prevent him from appointing a new Italian head of state in 2022, an institutional position he said represented a final check on Mr. Salvini’s power. In 2014, Mr. Renzi won more than 40 percent of the Italian electorate in European Union elections. But he never was directly elected as prime minister. In 2016, he bet his popularity, and office, on a referendum to streamline Italy’s government drastically and a promise to give future prime ministers greater powers. Opposition came from across the political spectrum and he lost, clearing the way for Mr. Salvini’s rise. Mr. Renzi, who was presenting his economic vision across Italy this weekend, acknowledged that he was now in no position to compete with Mr. Salvini, Italy’s reigning populist, in a popularity contest. (Mr. Salvini declined to comment.)  But the fragmented system Mr. Renzi failed to overhaul now plays in his favor. He has been able to exercise significant sway with small but committed parliamentary support and minimal backing in polls. “I play by the rules that this country has,” he said with a shrug. “I wanted to play tennis, but if you make me play Ping-Pong, I will play Ping-Pong. And don’t complain if you lose.” Once the new government was formed with his loyalists in key positions, Mr. Renzi bailed on the Democratic Party, arguing that it was too stuck in its old leftist ways.  He started his new party, Italia Viva, which has enough parliamentary support to bring down the current government if Mr. Renzi decided to withhold his backing.  Suddenly, Mr. Renzi mattered again. The two Matteos recently faced off on a television talk show under a backdrop depicting them in fencing masks and crossing swords. The cover of the newspaper Il Foglio similarly showed them ready to brawl. “The first rule of Fight Club,” Mr. Salvini was imagined saying, “is to make everybody talk about Fight Club.” The new governing coalition has in the process been relegated to spectator status in the battle of the titan Matteos. As it tries to pass a budget and prevent the closing of a major factory, members are nervous that every misstep, every raised tax and slashed benefit, will push their supporters toward one Matteo or the other. Mr. Salvini, who is by far Italy’s most popular politician with about 40 percent support in the polls, is eager to press his advantage by causing the immediate collapse of the new government. He is using strong showings in regional elections to make the case that the people are behind him. Last month, his candidate trounced an opponent backed by Five Star and the Democratic Party in traditionally liberal Umbria. But Mr. Renzi wants the government to last long enough for Mr. Salvini’s momentum to fade, or so he hopes, and build up his own base.  Both are chasing the same sliver of business-minded voters who have long gravitated toward the Forza Italia party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, at 83, is a faded force.  There is, however, a more fundamental problem for Mr. Renzi: Many Italians simply find him insufferable.  “It’s crazy,” Mr. Renzi said in acknowledgment of the rage against him. “Italians don’t like ambitious people, and I am ambitious,” he said. “I am ambitious for myself; if I weren’t ambitious I wouldn’t have become prime minister at 39.” He attributed the anger to years of character assassination by Five Star, the League and leftist critics in the Democratic Party. He cited the disruption he caused to the Italian establishment as the self-styled “Demolition Man.” He said the church did not like his gay rights laws, and the unions did not like his job market reforms. There is much truth in that critique. But it is also true that Mr. Renzi has a boundless ego and dismissive manner, a tendency to personalize politics, to surround himself with local loyalists and to herald major changes hardly perceived by many Italians. And he’s sneaky. In 2014, he publicly told the prime minister of his own party not to worry about him trying to take his job. Then he took his job.  In 2016, he promised to leave politics if he lost a key referendum. He lost and didn’t leave politics.  In 2019 he said he’d stick with the Democratic Party and would never form his own little party. Then he left the Democratic Party and formed his own little party. His defense has essentially been that everybody flip-flops. “There is not a political leader in Italy today who can say that he hasn’t changed his mind with respect to his own future,” he said recently at the Foreign Press Club, “exactly like I did.”']",Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and the popular anti-migrant leader Matteo Salvini may be out of power.

Blind Student’s Violent Treatment at Oxford Debate Prompts Resignations,2019-11-19,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The Oxford Union, a prestigious, nearly 200-year-old British debating society that counts several high-profile politicians among its alumni, has come under fire for the violent treatment of a blind student from Ghana who witnesses say was forcibly expelled from a packed event hall. The incident has ignited outrage around the country, provoking a wave of resignations from the society and drawing scrutiny of the elite, predominately white organization, especially as videos have spread online showing the student, Ebenezer Azamati, struggling with a security guard who forcefully tried to pry him off a bench.  The society’s president, Brendan McGrath, stepped down under growing pressure late Tuesday, saying that he apologized “profusely and unqualifiedly.” In his resignation letter, he added, “Fundamentally, it is the president’s job to ensure that every member feels welcome at the Oxford Union. This is a goal I have manifestly failed to reach.” At least eight other society members resigned this week, including several in leadership roles. Mr. Azamati, a 25-year-old postgraduate student at Oxford University who is a member of the union, said in a phone interview that he was traumatized by the event, which took place on Oct. 17, and that he was considering legal action. “I never expected anything like that could happen to me in Britain, let alone Oxford,” he said. “I still feel threatened.”  He added that the encounter “keeps playing on my mind.”  The Oxford Union is a private society, independent of Oxford University, though most of its members are current or past students.  In an email, the union said, “We are in ongoing discussions with Mr. Azamati in order to pursue a solution agreeable to all parties, which addresses the structural issues raised; we do not wish to prejudice those discussions with further comment at this time.” Mr. Azamati, who was born blind, went to the hall early on Oct. 17 to reserve a seat before the start of the debate, according to accounts from other attendees published in The Oxford Student, a university newspaper.  He left the hall, and when he returned to take his seat before the debate began, he was told that the room was full. He eventually went back inside and sat down in a seat offered by someone, but he was followed by a security guard. An argument ensued. One video of the encounter shows two men grappling with Mr. Azamati as they try to remove him from his seat. Mr. Azamati is seen clinging to the bench, one hand clasping his union membership card.  Harry Hatwell, a 21-year-old law student at the university, saw the episode from a balcony and said it escalated quickly.  “He literally dragged him by the ankles,” Mr. Hatwell said in an interview, describing the encounter between the security guard and Mr. Azamati, which was only partially captured in the video. Mr. Hatwell said Mr. Azamati eventually walked out of the room. Mr. Azamati, who studies international relations at St. John’s College, part of Oxford University, was hesitant to describe the episode in detail but said it came as a shock. “I don’t know how I walked back to my room,” he said. He described suddenly waking from sleep that night, gasping for air. “I was just shaking.” But days after the altercation, Mr. McGrath, the union president, said that it was Mr. Azamati who had been violent. When Mr. Azamati’s union membership was then withdrawn for two university terms, news of the incident spread and student groups began lining up behind him.  The Oxford University Africa Society condemned his treatment, calling it “violent, unjust, inhumane and shameful,” and organized a protest on Friday. By Monday evening, Jeremy Bararia, the only black member of the union’s governing body, stepped down and called on Mr. McGrath to resign. “I feel that not only as a person of color and African, but as an individual with a sense of morality, I can no longer remain within an institution such as this, so long as you remain in office,” Mr. Bararia said.  Oxford University also condemned the incident and said Monday that it offered its “full sympathy and support” to Mr. Azamati. “The university is writing to the union, pressing hard for answers on how it intends to make amends to Mr. Azamati and what further steps it will take to avoid such an incident being repeated,” Stephen Rouse, a spokesman for the university, said in an email.  The union reinstated Mr. Azamati’s membership after Mr. McGrath dropped his accusation over the weekend. But some union members said that did not go far enough. Mr. Hatwell, who is also a member of the union, said that some members had planned to put forward an impeachment motion against Mr. McGrath, an effort his resignation made the moot. Mr. Hatwell said it was important to show that the union, whose former members include Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other prominent politicians, was accountable. “Boris Johnson used to be president of the union,” he said. “If you ever hold this position for some reason, for better or for worse, matters in British political life, and we need to show that actually what you do, your response to something like this actually matters.” Mr. Hatwell called the guard’s actions “disproportionate” and said that no one from the debate committee or the audience intervened. Mr. Azamati said that he may pursue legal action against the union because he feels something larger than him is at stake. He said that he and his lawyer had sent a letter to the union, “making our legal claims and demands.”  He added that he hopes his case will highlight the need for every society at Oxford and in the broader community to be “accessible to everyone.” Even before the incident, he said, his needs were not taken into account, despite the hefty fee associated with his union membership. For example, he found it distressing as a blind person to have to “compete” for a seat.  “My wish is that society will not be fair only to the able,” he said. “It will not be fair only to a specific section of society.”']","Ebenezer Azamati, a postgraduate student from Ghana, was violently removed from an event at the Oxford Union, a prominent British debating society."
Jennifer Arcuri Says Boris Johnson Cast Her Aside Like a ‘One-Night Stand’,2019-11-17,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — An American businesswoman has accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain of casting her aside “like I am some gremlin” or “some fleeting one-night stand” since  their past relationship became public and drew the scrutiny of a police watchdog.  The woman, Jennifer Arcuri, who is believed to be living in California, made her comments in an interview with the British broadcaster ITV News that is to air Sunday night. “I’ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours,” Ms. Arcuri said, as if addressing Mr. Johnson directly.  “I’ve kept your secrets, and I’ve been your friend,” she said. “And I don’t understand why you’ve blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one-night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn’t — and you know that.” The interview threatens to revive a crisis and comes at a pivotal time for Mr. Johnson, who is actively campaigning across Britain for the Dec. 12 general elections. He became prime minister only in July, replacing Theresa May, after he was elected leader of the Conservative Party.  The timing of Ms. Arcuri’s interview was not lost on Mr. Johnson’s aides. When asked for comment, 10 Downing Street said to contact the Conservative Party, which did not immediately respond on Sunday. But a party spokesman told ITV News that “any claims of impropriety in office are untrue and unfounded,” and that these are “vexatious and politically motivated attacks.”  The statement was in accordance with what has been the party line since Mr. Johnson’s conduct as mayor of London has come under scrutiny. He was accused of giving favorable treatment to Ms. Arcuri by assisting her in securing sponsorship money and taking her on trade missions that she was unqualified for.  Mr. Johnson and Ms. Arcuri have denied any wrongdoing.  The Government Internal Audit Agency reviewed a grant that Hacker House, the company for which Ms. Arcuri is chief executive, received in February from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, and found the award of 100,000 pounds, or about $130,000, to be “appropriate.” But in September, City Hall referred Mr. Johnson to a police watchdog for a possible investigation, saying that the accusations, if true, could amount to misconduct in public office. “It has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms. Jennifer Arcuri, and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms. Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances where she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,” said the referral letter, attributed to the Greater London Authority’s monitoring officer, Emma Strain. “This will take time to thoroughly assess and consider before any decision is taken as to whether it is necessary to investigate this matter,” the police watchdog said in a statement.  The ITV program, “Exposure,” will feature Ms. Arcuri in an episode titled “When Boris Met Jennifer.” Ms. Arcuri said that she has tried in vain to get in touch with Mr. Johnson, seeking help to handle the media scrutiny. She told ITV that she had become “collateral damage” while the prime minister seemed to have escaped unscathed. She said that when she called his personal number, she was passed to someone who spoke Chinese. Another time, she said, Mr. Johnson hung up the moment he heard her voice.  She told the broadcaster that she felt she had been “brushed off” as if she was “one of Kennedy’s girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard.” (She apparently was referring to President John F. Kennedy.)  The show suggests, according to ITV News, that the pair had a four-year affair.  Ms. Arcuri did not directly admit to an affair with Mr. Johnson, according to the broadcaster, but said that “half the people” who reached out to her after the story about their relationship was revealed had advised her to “admit the affair, fall on the sword, get it over with.” When asked if Mr. Johnson — who is believed to be living with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, at 10 Downing Street — had been in love with her, Ms. Arcuri replied that if he was, “then he should have come and get me.” “When?” the journalist John Ware asks in the interview.  “In another life,” Ms. Arcuri says with a resigned smile. “This one didn’t work out.”']",The American businesswoman’s ties to the British prime minister have come under scrutiny.
Hong Kong Violence Escalates as Police and Protesters Clash at University,2019-11-17,"By Edward Wong, Mike Ives, Tiffany May, Katherine Li and Lam Yik Fei","['HONG KONG — Hundreds of Hong Kong activists armed with firebombs and bows-and-arrows on Monday battled riot police who have laid a days-long siege to a university, the most violent confrontation yet in a half-year of protests.  Early Monday, the police tried storming the campus at the main entrance and made some arrests. But the occupiers fought back with dozens of firebombs and set barricades ablaze, forcing the police to retreat. As day broke, the occupiers and the police were still locked in the standoff at Hong Kong Polytechnic University that began Saturday night, and smoke billowed from the grounds. Some protesters on Monday morning raced for the exits, only to be met with volleys of tear gas.  The police used tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and armored vehicles to try breach the barricades all day on Sunday. But activists resisted into the night. One police officer was hit in the leg by an arrow, while student leaders said protesters suffered eye injuries and hypothermia after being struck by the water cannon.  The clashes were the culmination of the most disruptive week of the monthslong protests, a period that has focused a global spotlight on the growing desperation of the pro-democracy activists and aggressive efforts by the police to suppress them. It is a sign the conflict is turning more violent as the territory prepares to hold elections later this month. The activists are struggling against the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing to preserve autonomy for Hong Kong, a political system guaranteed for 50 years by an agreement between Beijing and London. The British handed over the global financial hub in 1997. The rising tensions and the potential for greater control over Hong Kong’s political and legal systems by the Communist Party have raised questions over the long-term commercial viability of Hong Kong and the integrity of its fraying social fabric. In Washington, American officials said they were monitoring the clashes as well as reviewing a report by The New York Times on leaked internal Communist Party documents showing how party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, had set up internment camps to hold one million or more Muslims in another frontier area, Xinjiang.  Trump administration officials and Congress have been holding discussions on whether to impose separate sets of sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. But President Trump has held back for fear of upsetting trade talks. Hong Kong is scheduled to hold district council elections next Sunday. Some residents worry the government might postpone the vote, though Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the territory, has said the elections will be held on time. A small number of supporters of Communist Party rule, as well as Hu Xijin,  the chief editor of Global Times, a state-run news organization in Beijing, had become so outraged by the Sunday clashes that they said the police should use live ammunition. The occupation of the university has forced a weeklong shutdown of a tunnel leading to the business districts on Hong Kong Island from Kowloon, and activists said they planned more traffic blockades on Monday. The university president, Jin-Guang Teng, said Monday morning that he had negotiated a temporary truce with the police, but suggested occupiers still would have to turn themselves in to the police after leaving the campus. The clashes of the past week began when protesters changed from a regular routine of weekend protests to disrupting traffic on workdays. The disruptions and attempts by the police to breach campuses — considered a last refuge by activists — quickly led to protesters occupying five universities, two of which sit astride key transportation routes.  The death of a student from a fall earlier this month and two dramatic violent acts also set the city on edge — a traffic policeman shot an unarmed protester, and activists set a man on fire after he confronted them.  Protesters abandoned four of the universities over the weekend, but those at Polytechnic University held on. Hardcore activists converged there, while more moderate ones left on Sunday as the police surrounded the campus. The police arrested dozens trying to flee, including first-aid volunteers. Mainstream supporters of the movement drove to the campus to try to get the police to back off. On Sunday night, the police threatened to use lethal force if the protesters did not leave. “I know that there is a possibility that the police will fire live bullets on us tonight, but right now, we have no choice,” William Lau, 22, a protester on campus, said around midnight. He estimated there were about 500 activists on site at that time. About 50 were arrested after trying to leave, he said, so others were wary of trying to exit. “The police would never just let us walk out like that,” he said. “I know that some want to leave now but don’t know how, while a fair number want to stay and fight.” Right outside the campus, pro-democracy lawmakers, a top Roman Catholic official, an American pastor and a student leader called on the Hong Kong government to intervene to prevent bloodshed. “I want to seek help from the government to stop the police force from their operation and avoid tragedy,” said Owan Li, a student representative on the university council. As the police fired tear gas, Bishop Joseph Ha tried entering with the lawmakers and the American pastor, William Devlin of the Bronx, but were turned away by the police. “If the police are to launch a clearance, they should use as minimal force as possible because lives are precious,” Mr. Ha said.  Mr. Devlin said in a telephone interview that he had been on campus for about four hours as the clashes unfolded and had left, but was trying to re-enter. “They were not being deterred,” he said of the protesters. “They were ready to be arrested. They said, ‘We stand for freedom, dignity, democracy, human rights.’” Mr. Devlin said he had been on the front line in the late afternoon Sunday when the police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons against protesters. He said he had seen protesters throw 10 to 20 firebombs to deter the police from advancing. At least two were armed with bows and arrows, he said. Louis Lau, the police superintendent, said before midnight that an officer had fired a live round at a vehicle charging toward officers in an area near campus. “Coldblooded rioters can only imitate terror acts,” he said.   Protesters confronted the police throughout the night in nearby neighborhoods to try to draw them away from the campus. The presidents of five universities released a statement calling for restraint by all sides and asking everyone on the campus to leave. Denise Ho, a pro-democracy pop singer who has been banned on the mainland by Beijing, invoked the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre on Twitter and said, “World, please help Hong Kong and save our students!” The police tried sending an armored vehicle across a bridge on the east side of campus. Protesters set the vehicle on fire with bombs, forcing it to retreat. Mr. Hu, the chief editor of Global Times, posted a video of the vehicle aflame on Twitter and said, “Police should be permitted to fire live rounds in this case to counter rioters.” The violence came after protesters at the university on Friday prepared for a long siege, as they poured gasoline into glass bottles to make hundreds or thousands of bombs and practiced throwing those into an empty swimming pool. They also did target practice with catapult-style slingshots and bows-and-arrows. The police began advancing around 10 p.m. Saturday, and the clashes reached a high pitch on Sunday afternoon. In nearby Kowloon Tong on Saturday, Chinese soldiers jogged out of their barracks by Hong Kong Baptist University and cleared bricks from streets that had been placed there by protesters to block traffic. The soldiers wore T-shirts and basketball jerseys, and carried brooms. The Hong Kong garrison of the People’s Liberation Army is based in 19 sites once occupied by the British military. Even though Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since 1997, they almost never venture into the city. The cleanup, which was lauded by Chinese state-run news organizations, prompted a torrent of criticism from local residents. Pro-democracy lawmakers issued a statement saying that the local government and the Chinese military had ignored restrictions imposed on the troops by local laws. Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Mike Ives, Tiffany May and Katherine Li reported from Hong Kong. Paul Mozur and Ezra Cheung contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']","As riot police tried storming a campus occupied by activists, they were met by protesters fighting back with Molotov cocktails and bows-and-arrows."
Iran’s ‘Iron Fist’: Rights Group Says More Than 100 Protesters Are Dead,2019-11-19,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Protests against the Iranian government erupted for a fifth day across the country on Tuesday, as the authorities scrambled to crush the unrest and reports emerged of mounting injuries and deaths. The rights group Amnesty International said that as many as 106 protesters in 21 cities had been killed over the course of the protests, in what would be a dramatic increase, if confirmed, from the 12 reported killed by semiofficial Iranian news agencies. Hundreds of people have been injured over the last week and more than a thousand arrested, according to official Iranian news agencies. Iran’s security forces said protesters had killed two police officers and at least five members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the paramilitary force known as the Basij.  The protests started last Friday in response to a sudden increase in gasoline prices, which ignited widespread anger amid an economic crisis that Iran’s president has called the worst in 40 years. The country is reeling from economic sanctions reimposed by the Trump administration after it pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran. The authorities moved swiftly to quash the protests, but they soon evolved into a broader, sometimes violent, movement against the government, flaring in cities around the country.  “There is no doubt these protests are serious, in terms of their scale and scope,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. “The regime brought down the iron fist much faster. This, to me, indicates they want to nip it in the bud.” As part of its crackdown, the government imposed a near-complete shutdown of the internet on Sunday, in an effort to limit protesters’ ability to organize and get out information, such as videos shared on social media and with news organizations outside Iran. But the unrest has endured, and some Iranians have managed to circumvent the internet shutdown and send out video. Without providing specifics, Amnesty International said that its death toll  was based on “credible reports” and that it had reviewed video and heard from witnesses in Iran. The video shows security forces violently dispersing protesters with firearms, tear gas and water cannons, according to the rights group. In various cities, protesters have also attacked, ransacked and set fire to dozens of government buildings, including religious schools and municipal offices. Demonstrators have also targeted state-run banks, calling them a symbol of their economic grievances and of corruption in the system. On Tuesday, many cities remained restive, with schools and university classes suspended and National League soccer matches canceled. Parliament’s national security committee canceled an emergency meeting Tuesday with heads of the intelligence and security agencies; it said the security chiefs were occupied restoring order. Iran’s military and intelligence agencies have warned that those participating in the unrest will be severely punished. Kayhan, a hard-line newspaper that is considered a mouthpiece of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, wrote on Monday that “thugs” rioting in the streets should be executed by hanging. Although the reports of dead protesters and mass arrests have provoked an international outcry, including in the United States, Europe and the United Nations, Iranian officials have so far resisted calls for a tempered response. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Tuesday warned countries against supporting the protesters in Iran, and other officials have dismissed the unrest as a plot orchestrated by opposition groups and foreign countries trying to destabilize Iran. Even if Iranian officials may be privately acknowledging that the abrupt increase in fuel prices was foolish, they are unlikely to reverse the decision, some political analysts said.  Ayatollah Khamenei himself decreed that the price increase was necessary and appropriate, essentially squelching any further discussion among his subordinates. And a retreat might be seen as a capitulation that would embolden the protesters. “A larger issue here is a structural problem for Khamenei as well as the others — they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge there can be any type of legitimate protest,” said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, an Iran expert who is the director of the School of Public and International Affairs at Virginia Tech.  “They cannot quite acknowledge they have made mistakes,” he said. “The violence is a wonderful indication that they’re afraid. They’re hoping a strong show of force will force this decision down peoples’ throats.” Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.  ']",
"Bridge Collapses in France, Killing Teenage Girl",2019-11-18,By Anna Schaverien,"['A suspension bridge collapsed into a river in southwestern France on Monday morning, plunging the vehicles traveling across it into the water below and killing a 15-year-old girl. Several others were seriously injured, and officials believe there could be at least one person still unaccounted for.  The vehicles tumbled into the Tarn river at Mirepoix-sur-Tarn, a small town about 18 miles from Toulouse. Four people including the teenager’s mother were rescued from the river, according to a statement from Dominique Alzeari, the public prosecutor for Toulouse, published in French news outlets. But the 15-year-old girl — who has not been named by the authorities — could not be saved.  Dozens of firefighters and divers, supported by three helicopters, were called into the rescue operation. Photos of the bridge almost fully submerged in the river as suspension cables dangled overhead circulated on social media.  Three people were in serious condition, including the teenage girl’s mother, and two firefighters were also injured, according to a statement from the local authorities. The teenager’s body was recovered from the river by emergency workers.  At least two vehicles — a car and a truck — were thought to have been on the bridge when it fell, and the authorities have been investigating whether a third vehicle was involved.  Etienne Guyot, the fire service and local security chief, said in a statement that one person was still missing and was being searched for.  The 510-foot metal bridge, which connects the towns of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn and Bessières, was built in the 1930s and renovated in 2003. No structural problems or safety issues were identified in a 2017 inspection, according to representatives from Cerema, the group responsible for such checks in France, who spoke to Radio France.  A further inspection was carried out last year by the Haute-Garonne regional government which confirmed the previous year’s evaluation.  A report by the French Senate, commissioned in 2018 after 43 people were killed in a bridge collapse in Genoa, Italy, found that at least 25,000 bridges in France were in “bad structural condition,” representing roughly 10 percent of the country’s 200,000 to 250,000 bridges. The report, published last June, found that many bridges were aging and suffered from a lack of investment. La Dépêche, a French newspaper that covers Toulouse and southwestern France, reported that the bridge may have snapped because the weight limit was exceeded.  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a news conference on Monday afternoon that the French government had begun an inquiry into the accident.  “At this time, we do not know the precise cause of the accident,” Elisabeth Borne, the French environment minister, said in a statement. ']","Officials were investigating why a suspension bridge in southwestern France collapsed early Monday morning, killing a 15-year-old girl and leaving others seriously injured."
Israel Intercepts Four Rockets Launched From Syria,2019-11-19,By Isabel Kershner,"['Four rockets were launched from Syria toward the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights at dawn on Tuesday, setting off air-raid sirens but causing no harm, according to the Israeli military. The military said that the incoming fire was intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system and that it appeared no rockets had fallen on the Israeli-controlled side of the line. It was not immediately clear if the rocket fire from Syria was meant as a surprise attack or came in response to Israeli activity across its northern frontier. Around the same time as the rocket launches, Sana, the official Syrian news agency, reported that explosions were heard in the vicinity of the Damascus airport.  An Israeli military spokeswoman had no comment on the report from Syria. After decades of quiet, there have been occasional exchanges of fire across the old Israeli-Syrian armistice line as Israel has worked, mostly clandestinely, to curb Iran’s growing influence in Syria, largely under cover of the chaos of Syria’s civil war. Abandoning years of ambiguity over Israeli involvement in specific attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged early this year that Israeli forces had attacked Iranian weapons warehouses at Damascus International Airport.   Israel’s shadow war against Iran became even more public this summer when it carried out a series of strikes in the region, including one that killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria who Israel said were preparing to dispatch armed drones to attack it.  The latest tensions in the north came days after a flare-up across Israel’s border with Gaza to the south. Palestinian militants from Islamic Jihad fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, and Israeli warplanes struck targets in Gaza, in a two-day clash set off by Israel’s killing of a senior Islamic Jihad commander there in a surprise airstrike.  The Syrian authorities and Islamic Jihad also blamed Israel for another, almost simultaneous, missile attack on the Damascus home of Akram al-Ajouri, describing him as a member of the group’s political bureau in Syria. Mr. al-Ajouri survived the attack, but his son and another person were reported killed in the strike. Maintaining its more customary silence in an effort to avoid retaliation, Israel neither claimed nor denied responsibility for that attack.

Two Western Hostages Are Freed in Afghanistan in Deal With Taliban,2019-11-19,By David Zucchino and Adam Goldman,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban on Tuesday freed two Westerners they had held for more than three years in exchange for the release of three senior insurgent leaders, officials said, in a deal that officials hoped could pave the way for Afghan peace talks with the Taliban.  The Westerners were released to American forces by the Taliban, and included an American, Kevin C. King, 63, and an Australian, Timothy J. Weeks, 50, teachers at the American University in Kabul who were abducted in 2016. The key figure being returned to the Taliban is Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s military operations leader and a leading fund-raiser and propagandist before he was captured in 2014.  The exchange was brokered, in part, by the American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, who had earlier negotiated a tentative agreement with the Taliban that would have included terms of an American troop withdrawal. But those talks were abruptly aborted by President Trump in September.  Now, the prisoner exchange could be a step toward restarting talks between the United States and the Taliban, who have said they will stand by the terms negotiated with Mr. Khalilzad.  In announcing that he was willing to free the senior Taliban figures, President Ashraf Ghani said last week that the exchange was intended to “facilitate direct peace negotiations” between the Afghan government and the Taliban. He is also betting that the exchange could nudge the Taliban toward agreeing to at least a partial cease-fire, which Mr. Ghani has set as a precondition to any talks. The Taliban have refused to negotiate with Mr. Ghani’s government until the United States reaches a troop withdrawal deal with the insurgency. Mr. Ghani, who called the swap a “tough but important” decision, has emphasized that the release of the Western hostages was required as a show of good faith by the Taliban in advance of any peace negotiations. A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two Westerners were released to American Special Operations forces in eastern Afghanistan early Tuesday afternoon and appeared to be in fair health. They were  taken to Bagram Air Base in northern Afghanistan.  The three Taliban prisoners were flown to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office,  as part of a highly choreographed exchange, officials said. After the confirmation that the Western hostages had been freed, Taliban officials said that they had custody of the three men in Doha. Also to be included in the exchange were 10 members of the Afghan security forces being held by the Taliban, Afghan and American officials said. Later on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that they had been released. That was not immediately confirmed by Afghan officials.  “All these steps are a positive development for trust building, which can help the peace process,” the spokesman said.  The White House and State Department also alluded to the peace talks in statements that welcomed the Western prisoners’ release. “We see these developments as hopeful signs,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, that the Afghan war “may soon conclude through a political settlement.” In addition to Mr. Haqqani, the Afghan government released Hafiz Abdul Rashid, a senior Taliban commander who had equipped suicide bombers, chosen their targets and moved them from safe houses in Pakistan into Afghanistan. Mr. Rashid, a brother of a member of the Taliban negotiating team in Doha, was captured along with Mr. Haqqani in 2014. The third Taliban member in the exchange was Hajji Mali Khan, a senior commander and an uncle of the deputy leader of the Taliban. The three men are members of the Haqqani network, a brutal wing of the Taliban based in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. The group has been responsible for suicide bombings against Afghan civilians, as well as attacks on Afghan and American forces.  Anas Haqqani’s release was important to the militants, in part, because his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, founded the Haqqani network, where Anas Haqqani was considered a rising star. Recovering American hostages held overseas has been a priority for Mr. Trump, and his national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, was previously the State Department’s top official for managing hostage cases.  Mr. King was the last known American to be held by the Taliban. Another American who disappeared in Afghanistan, Paul E. Overby Jr., is believed to be dead. Mr. Overby disappeared in Khost Province in May 2014 while trying to interview the leader of the Haqqani network. On Tuesday, the family of Mr. King released a statement thanking Trump administration officials and other groups for working to free him.  “This has been a long and painful ordeal for our entire family,”  said Mr. King’s sister, Stephanie Miller. American officials said the Afghan government and the United States had delayed the swap after two attacks within 24 hours of Mr. Ghani’s initial announcement of the deal on Nov. 12. That day, an American convoy was struck by a suicide car bomb in Logar Province in eastern Afghanistan; the American military command said there were no American casualties. On Nov. 13, a suicide car bomb attack in Kabul killed 12 civilians, including three children walking to school. Mr. Khalilzad told Taliban leaders they needed to show good faith by ceasing such attacks, the officials said. When the Taliban blamed local militants, Mr. Khalilzad told them to establish command and control or put him in touch with someone who could, the American officials said. In surrendering three men responsible for killing Afghan civilians and troops, Mr. Ghani risked playing his strongest card against the Taliban with no guarantee that the exchange would lead to his ultimate goal of direct peace talks. He has already faced criticism from some in the Afghan public, and accusations of being strong-armed by the United States into securing the release of two Westerners ahead of other Afghan priorities. The inclusion of the 10 Afghan security force members in the deal could mitigate some of that criticism. The deal also comes at a pivotal political moment, with Mr. Ghani embroiled in a divisive presidential election marred by vote-counting delays and charges of ballot-stuffing and voting fraud.    Still, the militants did not soften their position against negotiating with the Afghan government after Mr. Ghani arranged previous releases of imprisoned Taliban members to mark religious observances. And more broadly, the insurgents have given up very little over 10 months of negotiations with Mr. Khalilzad.  In fact, the peace process began with a major concession by the Trump administration: It agreed to a Taliban demand that Mr. Ghani’s government be excluded from the negotiations, deeply unsettling the Afghan government. That decision elevated the Taliban to an equal negotiating partner without requiring the militants to give up anything significant in return. More recently, the United States has unilaterally reduced its troop numbers in Afghanistan by 2,000, potentially diminishing its leverage in any future negotiations with the Taliban. The father of two schoolchildren killed in the Nov. 13 car bombing criticized Mr. Ghani and the United States for the swap. “The Taliban kill people, and the Americans want to release them?” Abdul Saboor, 45, said in an interview at his home in Kabul on Sunday. Mr. Saboor was wounded and his daughter, Zainab, 10, and son, Hadis, 7, were killed in the bombing. In freeing two Westerners and 10 Afghan security force members, the Taliban are surrendering captives who don’t hold the same strategic or security value as the three Taliban figures.  Just last month, Mr. Ghani’s spokesman said that releasing Mr. Haqqani was a “red line” that would not be crossed without the approval of the Afghan people. But last week, the spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said the decision could create “a path for an honorable peace and ending the war.” David Zucchino reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Adam Goldman from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi from Kabul.']","The two Western teachers held by the Taliban are safe with American forces, officials say, and three Taliban figures are freed.

1969: Queen’s Horses Sold for Slaughter,2019-11-19,By The International Herald Tribune,"['LONDON, Nov. 18 (AP) — Britain’s most famous ceremonial horses — those majestic steeds that carry the queen’s splendidly uniformed bodyguards — may be winding up as steaks in Continental restaurants.  A disclosure today that the Household Cavalry is selling its old horses to slaughterhouses aroused the fury of British animal lovers. The horses, ridden by troops and gold-trimmed trumpeters in plumed helmets, are feature attractions in the Changing of the Guard, coronations and all state processions.  A Ministry of Defense spokesman confirmed reports that some over-age Household Cavalry horses were being sold for slaughter. Few Britons would ever knowingly eat horsemeat, but it is a common dish on the Continent and that is where the carcasses are believed to go.  Emergency Meeting  Top officials at the Ministry of Defense called an emergency meeting this morning to deal with the report, which began with a front-page headline in the Daily Mirror saying, “Queen’s Horses to Be Sold for Meat.”  Buckingham Palace kept aloof from the fray. A spokesman for Queen Elizabeth II said only: “It has nothing to do with us — it is an army matter.”  The Mirror said about 60 horses a year were retired from the Household Cavalry and from the Royal Horse Artillery.  In recent months, the Mirror said, about 15 of these were sold to riding clubs and the rest were killed in slaughterhouses.  The Defense Ministry spokesman said, “The horses have been conditioned all their lives to parades and the noise of London. They would not be at all happy to retire into the quiet of the countryside and we think this is the most humane end for them.”  — The International Herald Tribune, November 19, 1969']",News that horses used in British state ceremonies were being sold to slaughterhouses after they retired sparked fury from animal lovers.
Are West Bank Settlements Illegal? Who Decides?,2019-11-19,By Isabel Kershner,"['The Trump administration’s declaration Monday that Israeli settlements on the West Bank are “not inconsistent with international law” reversed American policy on the settlements and contradicted the view of most countries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel applauded the announcement as a “policy that rights a historical wrong,” while Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said it was an attempt by the Trump administration “to replace international law with the ‘law of the jungle.’” Who is right? What does international law say? What difference does the United States announcement make? Here’s a brief guide. The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council and the International Court of Justice have all said that Israeli settlements on the West Bank violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and has occupied the territory ever since. The Fourth Geneva Convention, ratified by 192 nations in the aftermath of World War II, says that an occupying power “shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” The statute that established the International Criminal Court in 1998 classifies such transfers as war crimes, as well as any destruction or appropriation of property not justified by military necessity. Israel argues that a Jewish presence has existed on the West Bank for thousands of years and was recognized by the League of Nations in 1922. Jordan’s rule over the territory, from 1948 to 1967, was never recognized by most of the world, so Israel also argues there was no legal sovereign power in the area and therefore the prohibition on transferring people from one state to the occupied territory of another does not apply.  The International Court of Justice rejected that argument in an advisory opinion in 2004, ruling that the settlements violated international law. The Israeli Supreme Court and the government do consider settlement construction on privately owned Palestinian land to be illegal. Under the Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, both sides agreed that the status of Israeli settlements would be resolved by negotiation. However, negotiations have stalled and there have been no active peace talks since 2014. Israel has built about 130 formal settlements in the West Bank since 1967. A similar number of smaller, informal settlement outposts have gone up since the 1990s, without government authorization but usually with some government support. More than 400,000 Israeli settlers now live in the West Bank alongside more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Some of the settlements are home to religious Zionists who believe that the West Bank, which Israel refers to by its biblical names of Judea and Samaria, is their biblical birthright. Many secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews also moved there largely for cheaper housing. Some settlements were strategically located in line with Israel’s security interests. Other, more isolated communities were established for ideological reasons, including an effort to prevent a contiguous Palestinian state.  Israel also captured East Jerusalem in 1967, and annexed it. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and much of the world still considers it occupied territory. Most of the world views the expansion of Israeli settlements as an impediment to a peace agreement. While most blueprints for a peace agreement envisage a land swap — Israel retains the main settlement blocs, where a majority of the settlers live, and hands over other territory to the Palestinians — the more remote and populated the settlements, the harder that becomes. Mr. Netanyahu, who is currently fighting to remain prime minister after two inconclusive elections, has promised to annex the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley, constituting up to a third of the West Bank.  In June, the American ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, said that Israel had a right to retain at least some of the West Bank. The Trump administration’s declaration may be seen by supporters of the settlement enterprise as giving a green light to Israeli annexation plans. But Israeli experts cautioned that might not be the case.  “It’s one thing saying the settlements are not in violation of international law and another to say whether they are good for peace or not,” said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Trump administration neither rejected nor endorsed Mr. Netanyahu’s annexation proposal, he said, and it remains “an open question” how it would react if Israel unilaterally annexed West Bank territory.  He and others said that while the policy change could affect the public perception of the settlements, the legal question would have little bearing on a comprehensive peace deal, which is ultimately a political act.  “The settlements are an agreed upon issue for negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians,” said Alan Baker, a former legal adviser to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. “It’s an issue that has yet to be negotiated.” But in the absence of negotiations, the American policy could be used to justify even more settlement construction.']","The United States declared that Israeli settlements on the West Bank are “not inconsistent with” international law, despite decisions by world bodies like the International Court of Justice."
‘I Am Breaking Inside’: Balkan Leader Fears Conflict After E.U. Snub,2019-11-19,By Marc Santora,"['SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Only two months ago, the leader of the small Balkan nation of North Macedonia was riding high, feted by world leaders, praised by the head of United Nations for offering a rare bright spot in an otherwise troubled global landscape and on the shortlist for a Nobel Peace Prize. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had staked his political career and his country’s future on resolving a three-decade-old dispute with neighboring Greece over his nation’s name. And through often tortuous diplomacy and against great odds, he had succeeded. But as he sat outside his office in the capital city, Skopje, that all seemed far away. “I am breaking inside,” he said. The name change was expected to clear the way for talks on North Macedonia joining the European Union, but last month, France vetoed those discussions, arguing that the process of enlarging the bloc needs to be rethought. That threw the government here into turmoil, and more ominously, it is shaking up the status quo in a region where an uneasy peace has existed since the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the wars that followed. “That destroyed me personally, psychologically,” Mr. Zaev, who is stepping down as a consequence of the decision, said during a recent interview. And he was concerned not just about himself and his country, but for the stability of the entire western Balkans. “Nationalism and radicalism can rise again,” he said. “There is a risk to open conflicts inside of the countries again. Also to open conflicts between countries again.” Since the end of the Balkan wars in 2001, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, integrating the former combatants into the European Union has been a central part of fulfilling the longstanding vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. But it has been an uneven path. Slovenia and Croatia are already in the union. Montenegro and Serbia are working on reforms required before membership. Albania and North Macedonia are just trying to start along the long path to accession.  The other two countries in the region — Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina — are not that far along, verging on failed states. The goal of the enlargement process, its supporters say, is to provide the guideposts for better governance. “We are led by the lights given to us by Europe,” Mr. Zaev said. “Now they turned out the lights and we are in the dark. Who knows where we go from here.” European Union expansion into eastern Europe ties former Communist countries to the West, reducing Russian influence, but there are already signs that the undermining of North Macedonia is causing leaders in the region to reconsider their own positions. President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia signed a free-trade agreement with a Russia-led economic bloc despite warnings from Brussels that the deal could jeopardize its membership bid. “We need to take care of ourselves,” he told the Financial Times. “That’s the only way. That’s the only approach.” Western diplomats expressed concern after Serbia conducted joint military exercises with Russia that featured the Russian S-400 and Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missile systems. “We are talking about fantastic systems,” Mr. Vucic said after attending a computer-simulated drill near Belgrade. “If we had S-400, no one would dare overfly Serbia.” He announced plans to buy the weapons, telling state television that he won’t allow Serbia to “be as weak as it was in the 1990s.” Matthew Palmer, an American envoy for the Balkans, warned that Serbia could risk sanctions over the arms deals with Russia, with punishments ranging from visa bans to the denial of export licenses. The competition with Russia has not stopped President Emmanuel Macron of France from delaying European Union expansion. His position no doubt has much to do with domestic politics, and his desire to keep anti-immigrant nationalists on the far right at bay.  But there is also recognition that some of the eastern European nations that are the bloc’s more recent members have been plagued by corruption, and have undermined competitive elections and independent media and judiciaries. Even so, North Macedonia’s boosters are pressing Mr. Macron to reconsider. American diplomats, in particular, view the resolution of dispute between North Macedonia and Greece as a signature triumph of diplomacy. At the Warsaw Security Forum this fall, Daniel Fried, a former United States ambassador to Poland and a member of the Atlantic Council, said that the name deal was “the best thing in the region in many years.” “That is a big deal,” he said. “The Greeks stared down their own nationalist constituency and so did the Macedonia government.” Speaking just days before Mr. Macron’s “non” on moving forward, Mr. Fried said that accession talks were now a “moral imperative.” “The E.U. accession process provides a certain amount of leverage,” he explained. “I want to use that leverage. To not use it, to demonstrate that it was all some kind of moving of the goal posts, would be devastating.” Though American and European diplomats are now scrambling to contain the fallout, it will prove difficult. Bratislav Grubacic, the publisher of VIP news services in Belgrade, said that great damage had already been done. It was no coincidence, he said, that Mr. Vucic will go to Moscow on Dec. 4 to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin. “Russians used to say to Serbia, ‘You decide Kosovo, in whatever way you want, and we will support it,’ ” he said. “But it is clear now that Russia has other ideas. It seems these Russian arms are part of this bigger game.” Even before the decision by France, there was growing concern about Russia taking a more aggressive posture in the region. Those worries were heightened after an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016 that Western intelligence officials say was directed by Russia to deter the country from joining NATO. During an interview this summer, Srdjan Darmanovic, the foreign minister of Montenegro, said that stopping the expansion of NATO was not Russia’s only goal. “I’ve often said that NATO is not Russia’s primary target, but the E.U., as a softer entity,” he said. Unable to rely on the European Union, Mr. Vucic and other Balkan leaders have recently talked about building greater regional cooperation. Mr. Grubacic was dismissive of the idea. “Drug smuggling, criminals and corruption” all are endemic, he said. “If you make regional cooperation agreements, it will be a regional cooperation of gangsters.” Albert Musliu, the head of the Association of Democratic Initiatives in Macedonia, said he cannot recall a moment this fraught since the end of the war. “In the 20th century, we have gone through a lot of hell,” he said. “But it was a hell with a vision.” Even when that vision was wrong and misguided, leaders could tell the people they were taking them somewhere. For the past two decades, that vision has been joining NATO and the European Union. “Now we are without a vision,” Mr. Musliu said. “And when there is no vision, other options start to appear.” And they can be dangerous.  Mr. Musliu worries that outside actors could easily stir up divisions in North Macedonia, where roughly a quarter of the people are ethnic Albanians. Prime Minister Zaev expressed similar concerns, saying it was “dangerous for everybody.” The regions history proves the point, he said — “Recent history, not centuries ago.” Following the postponement of accession talks, he announced that his government would step down in January, to be replaced by a technocratic government until elections in April. When asked why he decided to take such a dramatic step, he said he had no choice. “If we don’t call for elections, nationalism will rise,” he said.  “I am terrified.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.']",The abrupt decision by France to postpone any discussion of North Macedonia joining the European Union is reverberating in an already unsettled region.
A Bullet to the Eye Is the Price of Protesting in Chile,2019-11-19,By Brent McDonald,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — Brandon González, 19, marched with a group of protesters down the main artery of this Andean capital on Oct. 28 when riot police barricading the way to the presidential palace opened fire with tear gas and hardened rubber bullets.  Mr. González, who had come from his hospital job equipped with bandages and gauze to treat injured protesters, picked up a stone and hurled it at a police vehicle pumping tear gas into the crowd. Seconds later, he saw an officer about 25 feet away aim a rifle at his face. “I felt an impact in my eye, and it all went black. I held up my hands so they would stop shooting and then laid on the ground, and they shot me three more times,” said Mr. González, who works as a hospital assistant. “I thought, they are going to kill me.” At least 285 people in Chile have suffered severe eye trauma, mostly from hardened rubber bullets and tear gas canisters fired by Chilean security forces at protesters during the month of unrest. According to the Chilean Ophthalmological Society, that count is expected to rise.  The image of a bandaged eye is now so common it has become a rallying symbol for the protesters in Chile. Even so, the likelihood of such life-altering injury has not deterred demonstrators.  The country’s president, Sebastián Piñera, has struggled to quell nationwide unrest over low wages and a high cost of living, despite conceding to demands for a higher minimum wage and higher basic pension. After protesters upset over a subway fare hike burned Santiago metro stations, President Piñera declared the country “at war against a dangerous enemy” and ordered a militarized police force to patrol the streets.  Since then, the police have been blamed for at least six deaths, more than 6,300 arrests, and 2,400 hospitalizations of protesters. Public prosecutors in Chile are now investigating hundreds of cases of alleged abuses by the police, including torture and sexual violence. The damage to infrastructure and businesses is in the billions of dollars. The Chilean government’s announcement last week that it would hold a referendum in April to replace the Pinochet-era constitution — one of the key demands of protesters — has also not put an end to the unrest.  President Piñera has stood by the police clampdown, claiming that the use of force has been justified in order to maintain order. According to the Chilean police, nearly 1,000 officers have been hospitalized with injuries sustained during protests.  Mario Rozas, the director general of the Chilean police, announced late Tuesday that Chile would suspend the use of nonlethal pellets for crowd control and allow police to fire them only in circumstances of “extreme danger,” the same standard used for live rounds.  The change came a week after a New York Times video documentary revealed that the Chilean police had blinded protesters with rubber pellets, and a few days after a university study found that the pellets contained dangerous amounts of metal.  The number of serious eye injuries at the hands of the police has outraged human rights groups and alarmed medical professionals. On Nov. 8, a 21-year-old college student named Gustavo Gatica was shot by pellets in both eyes and rendered totally blind. For at least 12 victims, the damage to the cornea, iris and optic nerve has been so severe that doctors have had to remove the eye completely. “A tiny ball this size that hits with such force that the eyeball just opens up like a flower,” Dr. Carmen Torres said. “Such damage is very difficult to repair at all.” Dr. Torres is one of a handful of ophthalmologists at Salvador Hospital’s special Eye Trauma Unit, located within tear-gas wafting range of Plaza Italia, the epicenter of the protests. Since mid-October, she and a team of doctors have received more than 211 patients with severe eye injuries resulting from nonlethal rounds. Over a third of patients have arrived with rubber, metal or ceramic fragments still lodged inside their eyes.  “If the pellet passes even near the optic nerve, it damages the ability to transmit information. And if it passes through the center of the eye, it destroys it, explodes it,” Dr. Torres said. “That’s why we are advocating to stop using these projectiles.” What police call a “rubber pellet” is really only partly rubber. A few days ago, at the behest of the Eye Trauma Unit, researchers at the University of Chile conducted an analysis and found that 80 percent of the pellet is composed of denser materials, including lead, that increases the projectile’s velocity and makes it as hard as a skateboard wheel. On a day in late October, the waiting room was crowded with protesters with bandages over one eye. An 18-year-old automotive mechanics student lay on a stretcher worried whether the pellet inside her closed and swollen left eye would leave her blind. A 46-year-old ironworker who was protesting the low minimum wage waited for an implant in his now empty right eye socket. A mother wiped a trickle of blood seeping from her son’s new prosthetic eye as he described the moment a police officer shot him. The officer lifted the rifle up, said her son, Jesús Emerson Llancan. “He shot me, and then he lowered it again. I spun around from the impact and he shot me again in the back here. But by the second hit, I was in shock. I was bleeding so much from my eye.” Half a dozen protesters described a similar moment of coming face to face with an officer who aimed for their heads. There’s no visual evidence to back up each of their claims other than the precise location of their wounds. But videos shared over social media have shown Chilean officers pointing weapons directly at people who appear to pose no physical threat. Other videos appear to show officers shooting indiscriminately into crowds of protesters. “It’s a human rights catastrophe,” said Dr. Enrique Morales, President of the Human Rights Department for the Medical College of Chile, who has been tracking eye trauma from the protests. “If you compare the figures we see of eye injuries in France or in Kashmir or in Palestine, those numbers are much lower,” Dr. Morales said, referring to wounded demonstrators in those places.  The United Nations protocol for use of what it calls “less-lethal weapons” states that rounds should be shot at the lower body, away from the head and vital organs. Chilean police protocols on use of force are comparatively vague. Gonzalo Blumel, Chile’s newly appointed Interior Minister in charge of public security, has denied allegations of human rights abuse by security forces. “Since the first moment, the government has acted with total commitment, not just on the strict compliance of the protocols on the police and army actions. But also with total and absolute protection of fundamental human rights,” he said. It is unclear whether the policy change will have any measurable impact on the violence. Last week, President Piñera acknowledged there have been some abuses, and said they would be investigated. “I think there have been excesses, abuses, noncompliance with the protocols, noncompliance with the rules of use of force, bad judgment or crimes,” Mr. Piñera said. When Mr. González, the hospital assistant was shot, he said that an officer loaded him into a police van and withheld medical attention until hours later, when they deposited him at a public hospital.  “They were taunting me, saying that I will lose my sight, that I’ll have one less eye,” Mr. González said. On Wednesday, Dr. Torres operated on Mr. González, and extracted from his left eye the same black rubber-metal ball she’s seen in other patients. Her prognosis was grim: he will keep his eye, but because of damage to his retinal and optic nerves, he will lose all but five percent of his vision. ']",A bandaged eye is now so common among people protesting inequality in Chile that it has become a rallying symbol.
Afghanistan’s Curse: A Bomb From 2 Wars Ago Crushes a Family Today,2019-11-21,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fatima Faizi,"['DAHANA-E-AHANGARAN, Afghanistan — The three boys were buried on the southern face of the mountain in May. The side-by-side graves of the brothers Amir Khan and Liaqat are marked with a green flag. Mujtaba’s grave is covered in a rocky mound and light from the morning sun. It was a Soviet bomb, dropped from an aircraft decades before in 1986, that killed them this spring in Bamiyan Province. The crudely welded silver cylinder, just bigger than a soda can, was one of many others ejected from a cluster bomb as it fell through the sky before resting in a shaded rocky ravine for 33 years.  Accounts of children finding old bombs and accidentally setting them off have become a central part of Afghanistan’s story, horrifying in how frequently it is repeated. The deaths of the boys in Bamiyan, a relative haven from the fighting all around the country, are a particularly cruel example of the hidden dangers in Afghanistan.  War after war, piling on each other for decades, has left Afghanistan covered in more than 1,000 square miles of mines, unexploded munitions, roadside bombs and shuttered firing ranges, according to Afghan government data. Many hazards have been marked, cordoned off, cleared or avoided.  But many also remain undiscovered. In 2018 alone, around 118 civilians were wounded or killed each month from buried explosives in Afghanistan, according to Afghan government data, a threefold increase since 2013.  Each one, the result of an often-forgotten battle or error, has the power to permanently devastate families and their communities. That was the case on the mountain that looms over the boys’ village: Dahana-e-Ahangaran, a small collection of compounds forming a peninsula of green trees and potato fields along a single dirt road into the surrounding hills. Before May 17, when the bomb exploded, the sandstone mountain was a playground, a place for families to hike or gather, a grazing stop for livestock. Now it is a crime scene, feared and avoided, a shrine of grief. Ultimately, it will be logged as a data point in a galaxy of charts and graphs attempting to describe the destruction inflicted on this country over generations.  For Mohammad Bakhsh, Amir Khan and Liaqat’s father, the mountain has been a lifelong landmark in his back yard. He is 45 now, and was just 6 when the outcropping briefly turned into a battleground. Back then, it was an outpost for the American-supported insurgents who were fighting Soviet invaders. The mountain’s elevation, boulders and view of the surrounding valleys made for ample protection against the military convoys navigating the single road below. Mr. Bakhsh says he does not recall much of the fighting other than that the insurgents had the high ground and the Soviets did not. He does not remember the plane that dropped the bomb that would one day kill his sons and their friend. And he does not remember the day the Soviets killed his father, who was among those fighting the Russians in a nearby village. In the years after, the Soviets left the country, there was a civil war, the Taliban took power, and then the American-led invasion began in 2001.  Dahana-e-Ahangaran has remained almost entirely sheltered from the violence since then: 18 years of relative peace, carrot picking and potato farming.  For Mr. Bakhsh’s sons, and for much of the rest of their community, the mountain was a place both to escape and to forage for refuse that could be sold at the bazaar. Shopkeepers bought scrap metal from its slopes and the ferula plants that grew out of the sand and could be ground up for medicinal use. “I didn’t force them to work, I wanted them to have a better future,” Mr. Bakhsh said of his sons. Liaqat was 14, Amir Khan was 12. On May 17, Mr. Bakhsh, a taxi driver in winter and a potato farmer in summer, started the day by having the boys help push-start their beaten blue station wagon, shoving it down the village’s road until the engine finally caught. It was a daily part of their routine when Mr. Bakhsh was not in the fields. The two boys had already made plans that morning. Alongside Mujtaba, 13, and other boys from their school, Amir Khan and Liaqat — bags in hand for anything they could find and sell — announced they were both “going to the mountain.” Around 11 a.m., an hour or so after Mr. Bakhsh dropped his sons off on the main road that skirts the foot of the mountain, he heard an explosion. Everyone heard it, he said, but he thought little else about the blast until he got home that night.  His four other children were inside their small, mud-walled compound, ready to break their daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan. But Amir Khan and Liaqat were not back from the mountain yet. Mr. Bakhsh, his heart sinking, gathered a dozen people to search through the night. They found the bodies the next morning. United Nations deminers began excavating the area in October, steadily piling up a small set-piece of the Afghan-Soviet war: A Russian parachute flare, steel ammunition tins. Shell casings from Kalashnikovs and heavy machine guns.  The deminers also found one unexploded artillery shell and two Soviet-era bombs like the one that killed the boys. The munitions were destroyed. On the mine-clearing team’s hand-sketched map, the symbol that depicts the site of the explosion looks like a red rising sun. It is simply labeled “accident point.” There is no mention of the boys’ injuries, or the fact that the only way to identify them after the blast was by what clothes they were wearing. Zahra Hassani, a 26-year-old deminer from Bamiyan, said it was the first time she had responded to such an accident. “Clearing this area makes me nervous,” she said, referring to where the bomb exploded. “But this is about kids’ lives.” The bomb that killed the three boys is an AO-1SCh, the Russian designation roughly translating as cast-iron fragmenting munition. The small, poorly welded can — one of 150 or so ejected from a larger canister as it was dropped — contains about 40 grams of high explosives within its cartoonish-looking frame. Soviet cluster munitions are not the only ones littering Afghanistan. Between 2001 and 2002, the United States dropped roughly 1,228 cluster munitions of its own in the country, killing at least 60 civilians. More conventional ordnance dropped by American, NATO and Afghan forces in the years since has added to the threat. And there is more: the pernicious improvised bombs the Taliban hide to attack convoys and patrols. They are one of the leading causes of civilian casualties in recent years.  Nobody knows exactly what set off the bomb that killed the boys. Some in the village said the boys were throwing rocks at it, others said they were trying to pick it up and sell its parts for scrap, even though they had been taught about the dangers of unexploded ordnance and mines in school.  Samiullah, 14, one of the boys who accompanied the three up the mountain, spent the morning with them before returning. They were not finding enough metal to fill their bags, so he wanted to return home. “I told them take my bread in case you’re hungry later, and I left,” Samiullah said. He will not go near the mountain now. The three boys were buried on the mountain because Dahana-e-Ahangaran’s cemetery was full. In the days afterward, Mr. Bakhsh donated his sons’ clothes to the roughly 30 families in the village. He kept two hooded sweatshirts that his younger children now wear.  Every Friday, at 7 a.m., the family piles into the blue station wagon to drive to the foot of the mountain and take the 10-minute hike up to the grave-studded plateau.  Now, without his oldest boys, Mr. Bakhsh has no one at home to help push-start the car. So on a recent Friday, with a cold frost on his fields, Mr. Bakhsh patiently waited until his neighbors appeared, placed their hands on the bumper and pushed.

Qantas Says It Would Back Suit by Flight Attendant Called Racist by Will.i.am,2019-11-19,By Sasha Gattermayr,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian airline Qantas Airways has said it will support a flight attendant if she decides to sue the musician Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas for defamation after he called her a racist on Twitter and posted her name and photograph. Will.i.am, a producer and rapper whose real name is William Adams, was on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney on Saturday during his band’s Australian tour when, he said, the flight attendant became overly aggressive in asking him to stow his laptop before landing. After the dispute between the two, federal police officers were called to meet the musician at the gate. The flight attendant, Will.i.am wrote on Twitter, “clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour.” In a follow-up tweet to his 12.8 million followers in which he posted the flight attendant’s name and picture, he used the hashtag #racistflightattendant. He later deleted the tweet, though the name and image remain in other posts.  Qantas has publicly stood by the flight attendant, saying, “we completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race.” The company said there had been a “misunderstanding” made worse by the musician’s use of noise-canceling headphones. “Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we’d certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this,” a spokeswoman said on Monday. On Twitter, Will.i.am answered a number of people who criticized his actions, including one who predicted that he would face a lawsuit. Australia, with its notoriously strict defamation laws, may offer a particularly favorable environment for one. The country does not have a Bill of Rights, and there is no constitutional protection for freedom of speech. That has helped breed a legal system in which defamation cases are comparatively easy to win. Will.i.am said he had spoken out as an act of resistance against racial discrimination. “I am posting so that this doesn’t happen again,” he wrote. “Everyone deserves to be treated with respect.”']",The musician posted the name and photograph of the airline employee on Twitter after a dispute on a flight in Australia.
Prince Andrew’s Friendship With Epstein Joins a List of Royal Scandals,2019-11-21,By Megan Specia and Alan Yuhas,"['LONDON —\xa0The British monarchy has survived public crises before — religious schisms, revolutions, murderous kings — but this week the royal family scrambled to confront a relatively new opponent: the embarrassing televised interview.  The Duke of York, better known as Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, struggled to defend himself during a 50-minute interview with the BBC as he talked about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier accused of sex trafficking. His interview, widely criticized in the British press as disastrous after it was broadcast last weekend, catapulted a long-simmering controversy into a full-blown scandal for the royal family, among the worst in its modern history. Reacting to the backlash, the prince announced on Wednesday that he was indefinitely stepping away from public life, with permission from the queen. But over the past century, a number of scandals have rattled the British royal family.  The prince’s relationship with Mr. Epstein, whom he met in 1999, has been under scrutiny for years. In the BBC interview, the prince said he had attended dinner parties in which Mr. Epstein hosted “cosmopolitan” figures from politics, academia and business, and the men visited each other’s homes several times.  But Prince Andrew said he had seen “no indication” of wrongdoing by Mr. Epstein at the time. In 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution, and served 13 months in a Florida county jail under a widely criticized plea deal. After his release in 2010, Prince Andrew stayed at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion and was widely criticized for continuing the relationship.  This summer, after the financier was arrested on federal charges and details of allegations against him began to emerge, attention again turned to Prince Andrew’s friendship. In August, Mr. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail. One of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said that Mr. Epstein had trafficked her to Prince Andrew, and that the prince had sex with her three times, an accusation that he denies. As pressure mounted, the prince agreed to the BBC interview. But the response to the broadcast was immediate and vocal, especially around what appeared to be the prince’s lack of sympathy for Mr. Epstein’s victims. Businesses and organizations associated with the prince quickly distanced themselves from him. Prince Andrew was not the first royal of his generation to find himself under fire after a televised interview. His older brother, Prince Charles, in an effort to win back popularity after separating from his first wife, Diana, agreed to appear in a 1994 documentary. But when the prince confessed to adultery, he immediately lost the good will he had been desperately trying to rebuild.  Their father, Prince Philip, said at the time that he did not understand why his son would air his troubles in public, but the interview had been approved in advance by Queen Elizabeth.  A year later, Princess Diana said in an interview that “there were three of us in this marriage,” referring to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his second wife. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after years of separation.  The next year, after Diana died in a car accident in Paris while being followed by the paparazzi, the royal family came under fire for appearing to be “indifferent to the country’s sorrow.” Two decades before Prince Charles’s divorce, the divorce of his aunt, Princess Margaret, from the Earl of Snowdon scandalized the royal family.  For decades, Margaret had found herself at the center of scrutiny from within the royal family and from the public, mostly centered on her love life, at times drawing sympathy and at others attracting admonishment.  Her fun-loving nature and glamorous lifestyle — with parties, extravagant clothes and celebrity friends — became a staple of the British press. But her romance in the 1950s with Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a divorced royal aide, was a tipping point. Her sister, Queen Elizabeth, was head of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. And with memories of the uproar surrounding the abdication of King Edward VIII to marry a twice-divorced American still fresh, there was intense pressure on Princess Margaret to end the affair. The princess chose not to step away from royal life and marry him.  Nearly a decade later, she fell for a photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, who became the Earl of Snowdon after they married. But their tumultuous relationship ended in divorce in 1976.  Princess Margaret’s love life became a major plot point in the Netflix period series “The Crown,” which explores the inner world of the royal family.  Queen Elizabeth’s 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has found himself in hot water over offhand comments to the press. Unlike his wife, who maintains a measured public persona, he can be blunt and prone to gaffes.  Some of his comments have been offensive or outright racist. “If you stay here much longer, you’ll all be slitty-eyed,” he told British students in China during a 1986 visit. “It looks as if it was put in by an Indian,” he said in 1999, pointing to an old-fashioned fuse box in a factory in Scotland. “Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed,” he said during the 1981 recession.  Early this year, he gave up his driver’s license after a collision on a rural road north of London raised questions about his abilities behind the wheel. Two days after the crash, he was photographed driving without his seatbelt fastened and was reprimanded by a police officer.  In the 1920s, Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth’s uncle, was so well known for his indulgences that he was the subject of a song: “I danced with a man who danced with a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales.”  But it was a relationship with one particular woman that ultimately shook the royal family.  In 1930, he met Wallis Simpson, a married woman from Baltimore who traveled in the same high-society circles. After the death of his father, King George V, Edward pursued her despite the opposition of his mother, Queen Mary, and the prime minister at the time, Stanley Baldwin.  When the prince succeeded his father to the throne in 1936, a standoff ensued. Mrs. Simpson sought a divorce from her husband, and the British government advised the new king against marrying her.  The government tried to keep the story out of the British press, but American newspapers broke the news. Within months, King Edward abdicated the throne, saying that it was “impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility” and to remain in power “without the help and support of the woman I love.”  The couple were dogged for years by accusations of being Nazi sympathizers. She denied supporting Hitler, but in 1935 Edward urged members of the British Legion to visit Germany, and in 1937 the couple met Hitler in Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps, embarrassing Edward’s brother, King George VI.  Footage taken in the early 1930s showed Edward raising his hand in the style of a Nazi salute, alongside his mother and niece, the future Queen Elizabeth, who was then 6 or 7, in an apparent pantomime.

Companies Abandon Prince Andrew After Calamitous Epstein Interview,2019-11-19,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Prince Andrew came under heightened pressure on Tuesday as the repercussions of a disastrous interview about his friendship with the disgraced Manhattan financier Jeffrey Epstein spread amid calls that he testify to the F.B.I. A woman who has accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing her as a child said on Monday that the prince should speak to the American authorities. “Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,” the woman, who calls herself Jane Doe 15, said at a news conference in New York. Several companies have moved to distance their brands from an organization supported by the prince called Pitch@Palace, which aims to help entrepreneurs. Those companies include Cisco Systems, which makes network equipment; Aon, a British insurer; and KPMG, a consulting firm. A spokeswoman for Aon said in an email that the company had asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website because it was not a partner of the organization and never had been. The supporters’ page appeared to have been removed from the organization’s website on Tuesday.  British news outlets also reported that the trustees of Outward Bound Trust, a charity that works with young people, would convene this week to discuss removing the prince as a patron.  Prince Andrew, 59, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, tried to defend his relationship with Mr. Epstein in the interview with the BBC, which aired on Saturday, but his sometimes confusing comments have served only to inflame anger at his behavior and at his links to the convicted pedophile. During the talk with the journalist Emily Maitlis, the prince denied any relationship with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was 17, and expressed little remorse for the victims of Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in August.  Asked why he had stayed at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2010 after his host had been released from prison, Prince Andrew said it was “convenient.”  “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,” Prince Andrew said about Mr. Epstein, whom he continued to see after the financier had served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Unbecoming?” Ms. Maitlis said with obvious incredulity, adding, “He was a sex offender.” The prince replied, “I’m sorry, I’m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender.” Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several women who say they were abused by Mr. Epstein, including Jane Doe 15, said on Monday that speaking to the F.B.I. would be the “right and honorable thing to do” for the prince. “I don’t see how he could have not known that there were underage girls, minors, because he did visit homes of Mr. Epstein in New York, in Palm Beach, in the Virgin Islands,” Ms. Allred told the British broadcaster ITV. “I happen to know that there were underage girls in all of those locations,” she added. In the interview, Prince Andrew said he would be “duty-bound” to testify under oath if he were asked and the “legal advice was to do so.” “Undoubtedly, some very strange and unpleasant activities have been going on,” he said, “I’m afraid to say that I’m not the person who can shed light on it, for a number of reasons.”']",The British royal was urged to tell the F.B.I. about his friendship with the disgraced Manhattan financier.
"On West Bank, No One Rests Easy, No Matter What U.S. Says About Settlements",2019-11-19,By David M. Halbfinger,"['OFRA, West Bank — Benny Aumann, 62, a travel agent, admits to harboring a back-of-the-brain kind of insecurity living as an Israeli in Ofra, a Jewish settlement deep in the mountainous heart of territory claimed by the Palestinians. “There’s a feeling that’s always floating above our heads,” he said, that should a peace agreement come about, “we could one day get notice to leave.” Just up the road in Silwad, a Palestinian village whose land was confiscated to establish the Ofra settlement nearly half a century ago, Nihaya Hamed, 35, lives with a very different sort of insecurity. She is raising four girls and a 7-year-old boy, who she fears will grow up to risk jail, or worse, by demanding his human rights, like the older youths who used to clash with Israeli troops outside the windows of her home every Friday.  The announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday that the United States no longer views Israeli settlements on the West Bank as necessarily violating international law has done little to change the essential insecurity on both sides of the conflict’s front line. While experts debated whether the announcement gave Israel a green light to annex parts of the West Bank or flouted established international law, the only practical effect in the West Bank on Tuesday was a subtle shift in morale: It left Israeli settlers feeling slightly more confident and Palestinians slightly more depressed. “I love this declaration, because it fits with my ideology, my opinions,” said Yossi Leibovitz, 57, who has lived in Ofra for 23 years and, like most of his neighbors, identifies with Israel’s national-religious movement: Orthodox Jews and Zionists who believe that Israel’s sovereignty and Jewish population should sweep over the biblical land of Israel all the way to the Jordan River.  “But if you ask me if it will change anything, it will not,” Mr. Leibovitz said. “Because there will come another administration, and they will say something different.” Ms. Hamed, too, said the Trump administration’s policy shift  would change little, but for a different reason. “America is biased,” she said. “The U.S. is pro-Israel, this is certain.” Still, she said, it did chip away at one of the few ways that Palestinians could console themselves about the failure of their national project: that at least they were legally in the right. Ofra and Silwad are yoked together by a half-century’s bitter history but kept apart by a skinny road, a small army post and rules barring visits to each other’s neighborhoods.  Silwad’s 7,000 residents, looking across the road, might covet Ofra’s idyllic subdivisions, with rows of red-roofed bungalows shrouded by enviably irrigated gardens and backyards. But at least, Ms. Hamed said, they knew that the settlers were outlaws in the eyes of much of the world. “Seeing it as a crime was helpful,” she said. “Legally, politically and emotionally.” Ofra was in many ways the ur-settlement on the West Bank when it quietly took shape in 1975, as religious activists who believed Jews have a divine right to the West Bank started sleeping in an old Jordanian army post, then persuaded the defense minister — Shimon Peres, who would later become a champion of the Israeli peace camp — to let them make it their home. The location was provocative: north of Ramallah along the Samarian mountain ridge, in the heart of the West Bank’s Palestinian population, where settlement attempts had always been blocked. And the way it was settled — below the radar at first, with the aim of creating facts on the ground — set the mold for scores of other settlements that began as outlaw projects. It also violated international law and Israeli law in many ways, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, among other critics. Chief among those: The Geneva Conventions bar an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into occupied territory, and an occupying power may not confiscate privately owned land for its own purposes. While Israel rejects the argument that it is transferring people into occupied territory — Jews have lived there for thousands of years and settlers are moving are there voluntarily, Israel says — Israel considers settlement on privately owned Palestinian land to be illegal. As Ofra grew into a Jerusalem suburb of 900 families and some 3,700 residents, some 60 percent of the settlement was built on land registered as the property of Palestinians, many of them in Silwad, B’Tselem reported in 2008. The group called it “the largest unauthorized outpost in the West Bank.” “They know this is not their land,” Ms. Hamed said, standing outside her home in Silwad. If the Trump administration was firmly on Israel’s side, she said, even Palestinian leaders were only giving lip service to the cause while quietly doing Israel’s bidding. Her people have few international allies and, for the foreseeable future, little hope, she said. “Where is there for us to go? I’m seriously asking,” she said. “To whom should we apply?” Naer Alawi, a furniture maker in Silwad, said it was pointless to expect help from the rest of the world. For all the years foreign diplomats called the settlements illegal, he said, they still did nothing to stop them from expanding. And it was the international community that brought Israel into existence, he said. “We’ve been seeking justice from those who caused the problem in the first place,” he said. To Ofra’s residents, however, calling Ofra illegal is like calling Tel Aviv a settlement. “This is like any other place in the land of Israel,” said Mr. Leibovitz, an insurance agent who moved to Ofra with his wife, Michal, and their four children in 1996, then had two more, and now are raising two foster children. The Leibovitz home sits next to vacant lot where nine homes were demolished in 2017, after settlement opponents, in a rare victory, were able to prove they had been built on private Palestinian land. But Mr. Leibovitz said their own home and most of their neighbors’ were no different. That should not matter, he argued: No owner has ever surfaced, and no owner was living on or cultivating the land before Israel took control. Jordan’s king gave away West Bank land to many people before Israel conquered the territory in 1967, he said, and “nobody knows who owns what.” Ms. Leibovitz, 56, a rehabilitation nurse at Hadassah Hospital on Mt. Scopus, said that sovereign Israel was settled just the way places like Ofra were — an argument that opponents of Israel’s right to exist often make to attack Zionism — so why should what happened since the occupation began, in 1967, be treated any differently from what happened before Israel’s founding in 1948? “Why should those 19 years make such a huge difference in resettling the land?” Ms. Leibovitz asked. Over an hourlong talk in the family’s tile-floored living room, Mr. Leibovitz said that as a religious man, he believed the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, but that “also in the Bible, it’s written that we will not receive this land all at once, but slowly, slowly.” “In the meantime, it’s very important that we treat others nicely,” his wife said. So what about their neighbors in Silwad? Continued settlement and the potential annexation of the West Bank will pose a dilemma for Israel, the Leibovitzes acknowledged: whether to grant full citizenship rights to the Palestinians or keep them in a second-class status. They spoke of limited “autonomy” for Palestinians. Others say that is apartheid. “It’s a very complex situation,” Ms. Leibovitz said. For all his Zionist fervor, Mr. Leibovitz said he would be willing to pull up stakes himself if “true peace” required abandoning the settlements. But then he said he did not believe a true peace would ever come. Instead, he said, he hopes his Palestinian neighbors will eventually seek a better life somewhere else. “Slowly, slowly,” he said again. “And maybe they will go.” Rina Castelnuovo contributed reporting from Ofra, Mohammed Najib from Silwad, and Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem.']","Palestinian and Israeli residents of the West Bank say the new American stance, that Israeli settlement is legal, does nothing to change their fundamental insecurity."
Sweden Drops Julian Assange Rape Inquiry,2019-11-19,,"['By Elian Peltier LONDON — The Swedish authorities announced on Tuesday that they would end an investigation into allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Julian Assange, the embattled WikiLeaks founder, that date from 2010. “The evidence is not strong enough to form the basis of an indictment,” said Eva-Marie Persson, Sweden’s deputy director of public prosecutions. “In such a situation, the preliminary investigation should be discontinued, and that is what has happened.” Mr. Assange, 48, is still in a British prison awaiting a United States extradition hearing, raising questions about whether the end of the Swedish investigation would clear the path for that process to continue.  “This clears one hurdle away for Julian Assange,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It brings the focus on the extradition process, and what British authorities will be willing to do.” Sweden began investigating Mr. Assange in 2010, after two women accused him of assaulting them during separate sexual encounters while he was visiting Stockholm. When the Swedish authorities issued a European arrest warrant in 2012 seeking his extradition from Britain for questioning over “suspicion of rape, three cases of sexual molestation and illegal coercion,” he fled to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Mr. Assange and his lawyers said they feared that if he returned to Sweden, he would then be extradited to the United States from there. He remained in self-imposed exile in the embassy for seven years, until his arrest in April after Ecuador revoked his asylum status.  Ms. Persson said that investigators had questioned again the individuals who had been interviewed in 2010 and spoken to two additional people who had not previously been interviewed. She said that the investigators had found the accusers credible and their statements reliable but that some parts of the testimonies were contradictory. In 2010, Anna Ardin, a Swedish woman who later spoke publicly about the incident, accused Mr. Assange of forcing her to have unprotected sex. A second woman said Mr. Assange had penetrated her without a condom as she was sleeping during the same trip to Stockholm.  “Memories fade for natural reasons,” Ms. Persson said, but she emphasized that the “injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events.” “Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed,” Ms. Persson said about one of the complainants. “However, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.” Asked by reporters about the length of the procedure — almost 10 years — Ms. Persson said that the extensive news coverage could have affected the case’s viability. “You have to consider how much the witnesses will have read and heard from the media,” she said. The Swedish authorities dropped the investigation in 2017,  but it was reopened this year after Mr. Assange was arrested in London and a lawyer for one of the alleged victims asked for it to be revisited, the prosecutor said. Mr. Assange, who is Australian, has always denied the accusations, and his lawyers have repeatedly accused the complainants of trying to unjustly slur the WikiLeaks founder. Mr. Assange was detained last year and jailed for jumping bail after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its protection of him. The United States is seeking his extradition over accusations that he tried to assist in a breach of classified data.In September, a British court ruled that Mr. Assange must stay in a British jail until his extradition hearing, which is planned for early next year.  The Justice Department has indicted Mr. Assange on a slew of charges including 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act, accusing him of the solicitation, acquisition, and publication of classified information from the former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. The charges raised questions about press freedom, and critics have expressed concern that the case could set a precedent to criminalize future acts of national security journalism. The end of the Swedish investigation into the sexual assault allegations simplifies matters for the United States government in its effort to extradite him to American soil. Put simply, it means there is now only one country, not two, that would like the British authorities to transfer custody of him for further legal proceedings.  The Justice Department declined to comment on how the end of the Swedish investigation would affect its case.  But Mr. Assange’s lawyers welcomed the Swedish decision on Tuesday and said that it was time to turn to the American extradition request. Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor in chief of WikiLeaks, echoed that sentiment in a statement published by the group. “Sweden has dropped its preliminary investigation into Mr. Assange for the third time, after reopening it without any new evidence or information,” he said. “Let us now focus on the threat Mr. Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.” Elisabeth Massi Fritz, a lawyer for one of the women who made allegations against Mr. Assange, said in an emailed statement that she and her client do not share the prosecutor’s assessment. She said there are logical reasons why the oral evidence from nine years ago has changed and said that if the earlier investigation had included more detailed questioning, “then the interviews would have been of higher quality and we would have been able to use them today.”  “Unfortunately, that is not the case,” Ms. Massi Fritz said. “The only right decision would have been to interview the suspect in London.” Megan Specia contributed reporting from London, Christina Anderson from Stockholm and Charlie Savage from Washington.

‘Our Patience Is Over’: Why Iraqis Are Protesting,2019-11-20,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['SADR CITY, Iraq — In the morning, the squarely built father of four wore flowing tribal robes to receive visitors in his garden, but by early afternoon he was in jeans, traveling light, his cellphone in one hand and his to-do list in his head. He had a half dozen stops before he reached Tahrir Square in Baghdad, ground zero for the demonstrations now shaking Iraq. The man, Bassim al-Kaabi, 41, is one of scores of people organizing the protests from Sadr City, a vast, impoverished neighborhood of Baghdad with a history of defying the government. “Let us be frank, we are poor people in Sadr City and we need many things: schools, health clinics, jobs,” said Mr. al-Kaabi, who drives a taxi to support his family.  “What is a pity is that we believed the politicians who said, ‘vote for us and we will do our best for you,’” he said. “But then we found they were liars and so now we are saying, ‘enough.’” For the last five weeks, more than 200,000 Iraqis across the country have gathered on any given day to demonstrate against the government. Security forces have killed at least 320 and wounded about 15,000, according to the United Nations office in Iraq.  The protesters are angry about corruption, unemployment and Iran’s influence. Many are educated, idealistic young people, who are mostly urban and secular. But the largest group are working-class and poor Shiite Muslims, either from the southern part of the country or with origins there.  These Iraqis have suffered decades of economic deprivation as well as government oppression by the Sunni Muslims, who controlled the government during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. And they have a history of violent resistance. They feel frustrated that having endured Saddam Hussein’s reign, the civil war that followed his overthrow and then the invasion of the Islamic State, their lives have seen little improvement.  Most of Sadr City’s residents are descended from people who migrated from Iraq’s south, and retain rural and tribal ties there. So the neighborhood offers a window into the passions driving the current protests and its roots in southern Iraq’s tradition of defiance.  With more than three million inhabitants, Sadr City is crowded and littered. Its larger boulevards give way to smaller unpaved streets and cracked asphalt alleys.  Public baths are a feature of life, a place for male bonding and a rare source of plentiful hot water. As in much of Baghdad, electricity is rarely on for more than half the day, but hardly any family can afford its own generator, so vast spider webs of wire spin out from ones shared by a neighborhood.   The heat in the summer means life is lived on the street, and in makeshift gardens and empty lots. People sleep on the roofs to escape the indoor swelter.  Despite the deprivation, Sadr City is a place of intense energy that has produced some of Iraq’s best musicians and poets, as well as painters and sculptors. “Sadr City was always like a quarry filled with clay and when you dig deep, you find jewels,” said Wagih Abbas, a poet and well-known Iraqi writer, who grew up in Sadr City.  Mr. al-Kaabi, known as Abu Tiba to his family and fellow protest organizers, lives with his wife and children in a small house his father built. On his street is a median strip. Like his neighbors, he has transformed the part outside his house into a small garden. Abu Tiba’s father tends it and has made the  tight space into a haven of flowers and fruit trees — a reminder of the southern Iraqi gardens of his childhood. There are brilliant orange-pink lantanas, red desert roses, flowering jasmine and an apple and a fig tree.  His neighbor has turned a similar garden into an outdoor reception room, scattering it with carpets to receive friends and relatives. In one corner are two large birdhouses with singing canaries that taunt the chickens wandering in the grass. It is possible to sit here and forget the surrounding noise and ugliness. Earlier this month, Abu Tiba’s day started in earnest when he tore himself away from his garden and set out to prepare for the demonstrations.  Like many in Sadr City, he still has family in the south. His cousin was executed by Saddam Hussein, and he has endured the humiliation of a corrupt system — paying for a government job only to be denied the position. “The nature of Sadr City is tribal and the ethic of the tribe is that if something happens to one person, then everyone starts to help in their own way,” he said, explaining why it has been so easy to rally his neighborhood.  He stopped first on a street corner where a friend who runs a catering business was supervising young men stirring six caldrons bubbling with lentil and soybean soup — enough to serve 500 protesters. Next was a quick visit to one of Sadr City’s oldest markets, where butchers and fishmongers, greengrocers and cloth sellers work cheek by jowl.  One butcher closed early to make sandwiches for protesters’ dinners. Nearby a fruit seller plucked Abu Tiba’s sleeve and showed him a large burlap blanket heaped on the floor, then whipped it away like a magician to reveal 100 watermelons he had readied to take to Tahrir Square.  At a cloth store, the deaf son of the owner had been collecting money from other stalls. He signed to Abu Tiba that he now had $140 and would be making sandwiches for the demonstrators; could someone take them to Tahrir Square? Yes, someone could, Abu Tiba nodded. It is easy to find transport to the demonstrations; in Sadr City, ancient taxis spew fumes next to horse-drawn wagons and thousands of tuk-tuks. Rarely seen in more affluent Baghdad neighborhoods, the three-wheeled, motorized tuk-tuk has become the demonstrators’ unofficial bus and ambulance service.  “This is a revolution of the poor, of the disappointed,” Abu Tiba said. The first settlers in Sadr City, mostly poor farmers and fishermen, came more than 60 years ago to escape the punishing feudal system run by wealthy sheikhs who cared little for those who worked their fields and harvested their date trees.  Revolt and resistance was part of their identity. Their grandfathers in the south resisted British efforts to colonize Iraq in 1920. They lost that battle but not their suspiciousness of outsiders.  Most Sadr City residents, like many people in southern Iraq, are followers of Muqtada al-Sadr, a nationalist and populist Shiite cleric and leader whose family long resisted the authority of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party.  The dictator assassinated Mr. al-Sadr’s father and brothers, and tortured to death other family members. Those loyal to the Sadr family suffered as well.  There was forced conscription during the Iran-Iraq war, from 1980 to 1988. “Almost every family was touched by this,” said Mr. Abbas, the Sadr City poet.  There was routine targeting of anyone trying to pray in public, which Saddam Hussein saw as an effort to rally the Shiites against the ruling Sunnis, said Sheikh Jalil al-Sarkhi, 70, a cleric and Sadr City native, who leads a modest mosque there. “I could be arrested just for carrying a prayer rug,” he said.   Those decades of resistance prepared Sadr City for its fight against the Americans.  Mr. al-Sadr wanted the United States military out of Iraq. When the Americans came and tried to subdue his militias, United States soldiers were relentlessly attacked.  Roadside bombs targeted Humvees, and booby traps littered the neighborhood. Children were used as lookouts. Sadr City today remains armed and ready to defend its own.  The Sadr Organization, of which Abu Tiba is a member, and which has ties to Mr. al-Sadr’s militia, is helping to coordinate the protests from the neighborhood. Its members are thick on the ground at the protests, controlling strategic positions.  In midafternoon, Abu Tiba met with leaders of his sub-tribe, the Al Bunda. There were about 20 men in tribal robes and their sons and a few daughters, dressed neatly as if for the first day of school; they climbed into minibuses, taxis, a pickup truck and a jeep.  As they drove off, all of Sadr City seemed to be coming along with them. At a traffic circle, a father and daughter clambered into the pickup. Everyone was waving flags and honking horns.  Abu Tiba’s group parked more than a mile from the protests and unfurled its tribal flag.    Out of nowhere some of the men produced instruments — a large drum and the traditional southern reed flute. The group half walked, half danced the final mile, chanting, “Shala kala, kulhom haramiya” or “Pull them out by the roots, all of them are thieves.” A woman who had brought her five children — all wearing tribal flags — said she had come from Sadr City to support “our brothers.”  “Really I want change,” said Najla Latif, 42. “Our patience is over now, we waited 16 years after Saddam and we still have nothing.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.']","Sadr City residents have come in droves to Baghdad’s protests, driven by anger at the Iraq government’s neglect and fueled by their long history of defiance."
"Hong Kong Protests: Over 1,000 Detained at a University, and a Warning From Beijing",2019-11-19,"By Elaine Yu, Steven Lee Myers and Russell Goldman","['HONG KONG —\xa0About 50 protesters remained holed up inside a Hong Kong university on Tuesday evening after a three-day standoff between students and the police turned a prestigious institution into a battlefield and ended with hundreds of young people behind bars.   More than 1,000 protesters who had spent the previous day clashing with the police were detained after heavily armed officers surrounded the school on Sunday and gave the protesters few options but to surrender and face arrest. A number of students had escaped by rappelling from a nearby bridge to be whisked away by waiting motorbike drivers, while others failed in an attempt to flee through a sewage pipe.     As much of the territory remained gripped by the drama at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the central government in Beijing on Tuesday condemned a decision by a Hong Kong court that overturned a ban on face masks worn by protesters. The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, and have expanded to include a broad range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy. Here’s the latest: Pinned in from all sides by the police, most of the campus occupiers had surrendered or fled the PolyU campus by Tuesday morning.  By then, on the third day of a standoff, only 100 protesters remained inside. Several hours later, the remaining holdouts numbered around 50.  The protesters — many of them high school and university students, and some armed with bows and arrows and homemade weapons — held the police at bay for three days in what became the most violent confrontation in six months of protests. The battle at PolyU, in which the police fired more than 1,000 cans of tear gas and rubber bullets, represented the force’s most direct intervention onto one of the city’s university campuses. Ted Hui, a pro-democracy lawmaker who stayed on campus during the clashes, escorted several dozen students out of the university on Tuesday evening. “This is not a surrender, and we are not turning ourselves in,” he said. “We are simply leaving.”   The departing protesters were searched by the police, and those older than 18 were put into a police van to be booked.  Mr. Hui, a member of the city’s Legislative Council, was not arrested, a distinction that he said “shows there is political selection in who they arrest and that there are arbitrary arrests.”   The remaining occupiers said that they would not resist the police, but that they would not leave until officers entered the campus to arrest them.  At least 200 of the protesters who left the campus were minors, Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, said in a news conference on Tuesday.  Those under 18 were questioned by the police but were not arrested on the spot. They may still face arrest pending further investigation, Mrs. Lam said.   She said the “special arrangements” for minors were intended to achieve “a peaceful and reconciliatory resolution.” Video from inside the university showed an eerily deserted campus covered in trash and debris, a ransacked convenience store, boxes of unused petrol bombs, and the words “Liberty or death” emblazoned on a building. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority treated about 80 injured people from the university at emergency rooms on Tuesday morning. Another 200 from the campus were later sent to local hospitals.  Separately, Albert Ho, a former pro-democracy lawmaker, said he had been assaulted on his route home from work. The motivation of that attack was unclear.     About 1,100 people were detained near the PolyU campus on Monday and Tuesday, said Kwok Ka-chuen, a police spokesman. That figure would represent the largest roundup of protesters on a single day, making up almost a fifth of the total arrests since the protests began in June.  Those arrested on Monday and Tuesday were charged with offenses that included rioting and possession of offensive weapons. Rioting carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and many of the PolyU protesters were reluctant to surrender in order to avoid the charge.  Mr. Kwok said that 1,458 rounds of tear gas and 1,391 rubber bullets were fired on Monday, putting a figure to the dizzying display of smoke and gunfire witnessed on the second day of the siege.     At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was the site of clashes with the police last week, more than 3,900 Molotov cocktails were seized on Monday, representing the most found in a single location, he said.  He called the prestigious university a “manufacturing base” for fire bombs.  A number of protesters who had left PolyU on Tuesday, including several wrapped in emergency Mylar blankets, waited to be taken to a hospital. Some appeared to be suffering from effects of hypothermia after being struck by a police water cannon.    In Beijing, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress took the unusual step of criticizing a Hong Kong court’s ruling that struck down a contentious ban on the wearing of face masks in public, effectively saying that the central government alone has the authority to rule on constitutional issues in the territory.  The Hong Kong High Court found that the ban, enacted in October, violated the territory’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. In a statement released on Tuesday, a spokesman for the standing committee warned that the ruling “seriously weakened the lawful governing power” of the Hong Kong government. The National People’s Congress, the country’s top legislative body, has the authority to interpret legal matters involving national issues — and to change the Basic Law itself. The timing of the ruling raised new fears of Beijing’s efforts to erode the territory’s autonomy. “When the state loses, she changes the rules of game,” Joshua Wong, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Twitter. “Beijing never intends to play by the rules.” Article 158 of the Basic Law gives the congress the final authority over interpreting whether the Basic Law conflicts with national law. It also calls on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal to seek the legislature’s interpretation in considering cases whose legal significance extends to national issues.  The statement suggested that Beijing was prepared to act decisively to restore the mask ban, but the implications could be much greater, showing that there are limits of the national government’s tolerance for an independent judicial system that has been a pillar of Hong Kong’s singular political and economic status. In another statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s office that handles Hong Kong affairs also criticized the court’s decision to overturn the ban, saying that it had “a gravely negative social impact” and “brazenly challenged the authority of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and the governance powers of the chief executive conferred by the law.” Hong Kong’s embattled police force, once regarded as “Asia’s finest,” has a new boss.   Tang Ping-keung, formerly the territory’s No. 2 police official, was named commissioner of police on Tuesday after approval from the central government in Beijing. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr. Tang blamed the public for tolerating the protests and encouraging their violent acts. “If everyone had come out earlier to condemn the violence, society would not have turned into this state in five months,” he said.  “We can only end the unrest with society’s condemnation, reflection by the rioters, plus our appropriate tactics,” he added. Mr. Tang also rejected a key demand of the protesters: setting up an independent commission to investigate police conduct during the protests. “Our staff might think they are being particularly targeted if the well-established mechanism is bypassed,” he told the Post. “We will be disappointed.” Katherine Li and Tiffany May contributed reporting.']","After a three-day standoff with the police, about 50 protesters remained on the campus of a besieged university.

Extinction Rebellion Co-Founder Apologizes for Holocaust Remarks,2019-11-21,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A founder of the climate activism group Extinction Rebellion apologized on Thursday for the “crass words” he used to describe the Holocaust as “an almost normal event” and just another ugly episode in human history.  The founder, Roger Hallam, said in an interview with the German weekly Die Zeit that among various genocides that had occurred in previous centuries, the Holocaust, in which the Nazis killed millions of Jews during World War II, was not that unusual.  “The fact is that in our history, millions of people have been regularly killed under dire circumstances,” Mr. Hallam, who is British, said in excerpts published online on Wednesday. “To be honest, you could say: This is an almost normal event.”  Mr. Hallam’s remarks were made ahead of the German publication of his book, “Common Sense for the 21st Century.” In the book, which was published in Britain in September, he draws parallels between the Holocaust and the threats posed by the climate crisis. He warns against the potential “slow and agonizing suffering and death of billions of people” from global warming, and argued that with current estimates, the number of victims would be “12 times worse than the horror of Nazism and Fascism in the 20th century.” After Mr. Hallam’s comments, his German publisher announced that it had immediately halted the book’s delivery in Germany.  As the backlash grew against Mr. Hallam on Thursday, ahead of the publication of the full interview, politicians, Holocaust memorial groups and other environmental activists unequivocally denounced his statements.  Luisa Neubauer, a German climate activist with the group Fridays for Future, told the German newspaper Bild that such words were “insane.” She said in a phone interview on Thursday, “No matter who says those words, it is doing harm to our democracy, to our understanding of the past and the incredible crimes that have been committed.” Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, wrote on Twitter using the hashtag #ExtinctionRebellion, “The Holocaust is more than millions of dead and horrific torture methods.” He added, “We must always be aware of that so we can be certain: never again!” Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Bild it was not enough that Extinction Rebellion had distanced itself from Mr. Hallam. The movement must make it clear “whether it wants to tolerate such views in its ranks,” he said. “As keen as they criticize climate change deniers,” he said, “they should also do it with Holocaust relativizers.” Mr. Hallam’s remarks come at a time when some in the climate change movement have turned to disruptive tactics to drive home their message. Extinction Rebellion protesters, in particular, have employed methods such as delaying commuter trains on the London Underground, blocking roads and bridges around the British Parliament, staging a “funeral march” during London Fashion Week and lying in pools of fake blood outside the New York Stock Exchange. The group, which was founded in 2018, has also staged demonstrations in Australia, France and Germany.  Affiliates sought to distance themselves from Mr. Hallam’s comments, with a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion Germany saying that he was in favor of excluding Mr. Hallam from the movement. The German branch wrote on Twitter that Mr. Hallam was “no longer welcome in XR Germany.” Extinction Rebellion UK “unreservedly” denounced Mr. Hallam’s remarks, saying in a statement that although it favored “restorative measures,” in some cases, “exclusion is necessary.”  Mr. Hallam, a former organic farmer in Wales who pursued a Ph.D. in civil disobedience at King’s College London before pausing his studies, is recognized as a driving force behind Extinction Rebellion. But he is also seen by some in the group as a liability who may say something extreme when talking to the news media. XR Jews, an arm of Extinction Rebellion, said in a statement, “The words that we use are important.”  It added: “No one should talk about a people’s traumatic history in a throwaway manner, even if the point is to raise awareness about a deadly serious issue. In doing so, they may embolden those who already threaten that community.” Extinction Rebellion’s actions have provoked debate about the most effective way of bolstering support for protecting the environment. Mr. Hallam has pushed the group to replicate the disruption methods used by the civil rights movement in the United States and the “Yellow Vest” activists in France. Other climate activists, like Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who galvanized a global youth movement to call for urgent action on the crisis, have employed different methods. In September, she scolded American lawmakers in Congress, demanding that they read the latest science on the threats posed by climate change. She also told officials at the United Nations, her voice brimming with rage, “The eyes of all future generations are upon you.” After excerpts from the interview were published, Mr. Hallam acknowledged “cultural insensitivity” in a statement published on Facebook on Thursday and said that his comments had been taken out of context.  “I am sorry for the crass words that I used,” he said, adding that his intention had been “the exact opposite of ‘downplaying the Holocaust.’” “I realize that in the interview I got sidetracked into an unnecessary debate about where the Holocaust sits in terms of horrific genocides.” Nevertheless, some Extinction Rebellion activists feared that the group’s message could be drowned out by Mr. Hallam’s initial comments. But Ms. Neubauer said: “The climate justice movement is so much stronger than the words of a single person. Yet the incident must make us more aware and sensible of our language and the visibility of key figures.” Alex Marshall contributed reporting from London, and Christopher Schuetze from Berlin.']","In an interview in Germany, Roger Hallam said of the massacre of millions of Jews during World War II, “This is an almost normal event.”"
Arab Thinkers Call to Abandon Boycotts and Engage With Israel,2019-11-20,By David M. Halbfinger,"['Boycotting Israel is a failure, and has only helped that country while damaging Arab nations that have long shunned the Jewish state, according to a small new group of liberal-minded Arab thinkers from across the Middle East who are pushing to engage with Israel on the theory that it would aid their societies and further the Palestinian cause. The group has brought together Arab journalists, artists, politicians, diplomats, Quranic scholars and others who share a view that isolating and demonizing Israel has cost Arab nations billions in trade. They say it has also undercut Palestinian efforts to build institutions for a future state, and torn at the Arab social fabric, as rival ethnic, religious and national leaders increasingly apply tactics that were first tested against Israel. “Arabs are the boycott’s first — and only — victims,” Eglal Gheita, an Egyptian-British lawyer, declared at an inaugural gathering this week in London. Calling itself the Arab Council for Regional Integration, the group does not purport to be broadly representative of Arab public opinion. Its members espouse a viewpoint that is, to put it mildly, politically incorrect in their home countries: Some have already been ostracized for advocating engagement with Israel and others said they feared retribution when they return. Still, the few dozen members include more than a few well-known figures in places as far-ranging as Morocco, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, many of whom have begun to speak out, to varying degrees, in favor of engagement with Israel. The most recognizable name — to Western eyes, at least — may be that of Anwar Sadat, nephew and namesake of the Egyptian president who struck the first Arab peace treaty with Israel. He is also a critic of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was expelled from Egypt’s Parliament in 2017. One of the council’s main organizers, Mustafa el-Dessouki, the Egyptian managing editor of an influential Saudi-funded newsmagazine, Majalla, said that as he has wandered the region in recent years he has met many like-minded Arabs “who had kind of been waiting for somebody like me to come along.” Arab news media and entertainment have long been “programming people toward this hostility” toward Israel and Jews, he said, while political leaders were “intimidating and scaring people into manifesting it.” But many Arabs — even, to his surprise, in Lebanon, a bitter Israeli enemy — “actually want to connect with Israelis,” he added. To a degree, the group also reflects the geopolitical alignment now linking the Persian Gulf nations and other predominantly Sunni Muslim countries with Israel, against Iran and its Shiite proxies in the region, said Mr. el-Dessouki’s co-organizer, Joseph Braude, an American author and Middle East analyst of Iraqi-Jewish descent. “The sense of Israel being somehow a greater friend or lesser enemy than Iran is a factor here,” he said. But it is also one that will not last forever, he said, creating an urgency to build ties “based on common humanity, not some fleeting shared-security concern.” For the Palestinians, the council’s arguments fly in the face of decades of efforts to isolate Israel in the hope that this would force it to make concessions at the negotiating table. Even Palestinian leaders who do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement oppose fully normalizing Arab relations with Israel, arguing that Israel’s diplomatic gains from the Oslo peace process had only encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand settlements on the West Bank. Husam Zomlot, who leads the Palestinian mission to the United Kingdom and did the same in Washington until the Trump administration closed that office, belittled the new council’s members as an “extreme fringe of isolated individuals.” From Tunisia, whose new president has called it treasonous to engage with Israel, he said, to Lebanon, where protesters are waving the Palestinian flag alongside their own, “the sentiment of the vast majority of the Arab world is going in the other direction.” “They are playing into the hands of Netanyahu,” Mr. Zomlot said, because Mr. Netanyahu wants to “convince the Israeli electorate that he can have the cake and eat it too: keep the occupation and still normalize relations with the Arab world.” Mr. Netanyahu, indeed, has long posited that Arab nations are so eager to engage with Israel, culturally and commercially, that they will come around to normalizing ties even in the absence of a Palestinian state. The Arab Council’s members, however, explicitly reject the view that it is possible for Arab countries to reach formal diplomatic relations with Israel without resolution of the Palestinian conflict. And they argue that polls show that when Israelis are offered the enticement of acceptance by Arab nations, they become more willing to compromise, even by giving up land.  Mr. Sadat, for one, heaped enormous criticism upon Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and of its own Arab citizens, as well as for “supporting the current autocratic regime in Egypt.” All those things, he said, were adding to what he called the “Egyptian guilt quotient” over having made peace with Israel in the first place. Some participants urged measures like establishing a teachers college and research institute with campuses in Casablanca, Amman, Haifa and Manama. And an Iraqi counterterrorism expert living in Germany, Jassim Mohammad, urged Arab security services to stop the spread of “radicalism and hate” in the media, schools and mosques and to spread “corrective content about Israel and Jews” instead. He called this a “matter of Arab national security.” “The tools of scapegoating and blame deflection that initially targeted Jews and Israel have long since found new, local targets,” Mr. Mohammad wrote, like ruling elites or rival ethnicities and sects. The attendees received piped-in encouragement from Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who commended them for speaking out and said that nurturing stronger Arab-Israeli ties was vital to “any realistic possibility of an enduring peace” and a two-state solution. Mr. el-Dessouki said some members were attending at considerable risk. Egyptian citizens, including Mr. Sadat, were warned not to attend by security officials, he said. Members praised  a Lebanese cleric from Tripoli, Saleh Hamed, who attended in spite of the possibility of reprisal upon his return. “We do not deny the rights of the Jews to have a country,” Sheikh Hamed said, citing the Prophet Muhammad’s kindness toward Jews. But he was careful to add that the Palestinians “should have their lands according to the 1967 borders.” Sukayna Mushaykhis, a Saudi news anchor in Dubai, recalled seeing Lebanese officials abruptly exit a meeting in San Francisco when they learned that their hosts were Jews. “And yet today,” she said, “I hear a man of faith coming from a state that is governed by Hezbollah, and he talks with so much bravery and courage.” The group met privately, citing security concerns, but allowed The New York Times to monitor the proceedings, which were held in Arabic, by live stream on the condition that it not report on them until the conference had concluded. The conference was funded strictly by American donors, but organizers said they planned to raise money in the region as a going concern. They stressed that they received no aid from any government and that no Israelis were involved in any way. In a founding document, the members urged their adversaries to debate them constructively “rather than resort to old methods of silencing critics and demonizing reformers.” Only one Palestinian was in attendance: Mohammed S. Dajani Daoudi, an academic who said he lost his post at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem after his bridge-building efforts with Israelis led him to take a group of Palestinian students to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust. Mr. Dajani called for educating a new generation of peacemakers, lamenting that the Oslo process had failed to achieve peace in part because the “peace discussed between diplomats and generals was never fully matched by preparations for a wave of peace between peoples, allowing spoilers on both sides to win the day.” Asked why the only Palestinian participating was already something of an outcast, Mr. Braude said that younger Palestinians were interested, but that there were none well-established enough in their careers yet to withstand the blowback.  “We didn’t want to burn them,” he said.']",
Ex-Worker at U.K. Consulate in Hong Kong Says China Tortured Him,2019-11-20,By Amy Qin,"['BEIJING — A former employee of Britain’s consulate in Hong Kong said on Wednesday that the Chinese secret police tortured and beat him, deprived him of sleep and hung him in a spread-eagled pose for hours as they sought information about what they alleged was foreign interference in the protests that have convulsed the city. In a statement posted on Facebook, Simon Cheng spoke out publicly for the first time since he was detained in early August at the end of a business trip from Hong Kong to mainland China. When he was released after 15 days, the Chinese authorities said Mr. Cheng had confessed to unlawful activities. “I deny the arbitrary accusations against me made by the authorities which were obtained through an illegal process, including using torture, threats and coercion,” Mr. Cheng, 29, said in his statement. “I speak out now because the case is relevant to the public interest on knowing the flawed judicial process in mainland China.” The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he had summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to express outrage at what he called “the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China’s international obligations.” “Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team,” Mr. Raab said, according to the Foreign Office. “We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture.” A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, criticized the summoning of the  ambassador and reiterated an earlier statement by the police in Shenzhen, the mainland city near Hong Kong where Mr. Cheng was held, saying that they had protected his legal rights and that he had confessed to breaking the law. Mr. Cheng’s accusations of extrajudicial torture of a Hong Kong resident could further inflame the protests, which began in June as a demonstration against an unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland, tapping into deeper concerns in the former British colony about China’s notoriously opaque judicial system. The demonstrations have since morphed into a pitched battle between protesters, the police and the government over the city’s future, and they took a more violent turn this past week as protesters fought off a police siege of a university campus. Mr. Cheng’s account also pointed to a deep belief among Chinese officials that the protests have been organized and backed by foreign powers as part of a broader effort to undermine the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Cheng worked on the consulate’s business-development team. There has been no concrete evidence of direct foreign interference in the protests. But the Chinese authorities have latched onto statements of support from politicians as evidence of a wider conspiracy. That view received a boost on Tuesday when the United States Senate passed a bill that could authorize Washington to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses in the territory.   Mr. Cheng’s account of his experience in mainland police custody could not be independently verified, but his description closely mirrors similar cases in which activists have been pressured to make confessions for propaganda purposes. “Rather than finding the truth,” he wrote, “the interrogations are more likely to fulfill and prove their pre-written play by filling in the information they want from the detainees.” According to Mr. Cheng’s account, the British consulate general instructed staff earlier in the summer to gather information about the protests, including by joining social media groups and talking to protesters, to evaluate travel alerts and to learn more about the involvement of British citizens.  Mr. Cheng said he personally supported the movement and had joined several demonstrations, but insisted he did “nothing illegal or illegitimate.” He added that he knew several mainland Chinese protesters and had previously tried to organize a discussion group on topics including Chinese society.  On Aug. 8, Mr. Cheng traveled to Shenzhen for a business conference. He was detained by uniformed Chinese police officers as he was crossing the border to return to Hong Kong. He said that he was carrying money given to him by the parents of a mainland Chinese protester to pay for legal bills.  From there, Mr. Cheng wrote, he was sent to Shenzhen by high-speed train and handed over to plainclothes police officers, who photographed him, tried to break into his iPhone and collected his biometric information. Then, in Mr. Cheng’s telling, he was strapped into an iron interrogation chair, and the questioning began. Throughout the ordeal, officers pressed Mr. Cheng for information about his role and the role of Britain and mainland Chinese in what they called the “riots.”  For most of the 15-day detention period, Mr. Cheng said he was held in solitary confinement and not allowed to contact relatives or lawyers. His glasses were confiscated. Under threat of violence, he gave up his iPhone password and confessed to soliciting prostitution. The harshest interrogations took place outside the detention center, where Mr. Cheng said he was handcuffed, shackled, blindfolded and hooded and driven to a secluded place.  When he realized torture was a possibility, Mr. Cheng wrote, he told the officers, “I will confess whatever you want, torture is not necessary.” “They said it is not torture but ‘training’,” he added. Mr. Cheng said he was hung for hours in a spread-eagle pose. He was beaten to keep him awake. If he dozed off, he was forced to sing the Chinese national anthem.  After the police saw the extent of his physical injuries, Mr. Cheng wrote, the physical torture gave way to solitary confinement. He said he also saw other prisoners who he thought were protesters. Mr. Cheng said he gave the police information under intense pressure, including internal emails from the British Consulate and the names of some protesters. He was also videotaped expressing remorse for soliciting prostitution and betraying the motherland. But he said he had refused to confess what the officers wanted: that Britain had helped instigate the riots, that he had been involved in the violence and that he had used his consulate salary to bail out detained mainland Chinese protesters.  At dawn on Aug. 24, the police escorted Mr. Cheng to the Hong Kong border. He was  debriefed by consular officials, who granted him extended paid leave. Mr. Cheng said he has since fled Hong Kong to an undisclosed place and is hoping to obtain asylum.  “I won’t give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life,” he wrote, “no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face, and no matter how my reputation will be stained, and no matter whether my future would be blacklisted, labeled and ruined.” Claire Fu contributed research.

Israel Launches Airstrikes in Syria to Target Iranian Forces,2019-11-20,By Megan Specia,"['Israel said it carried out airstrikes early on Wednesday against Iranian forces near the Syrian capital, in response to an Iranian attack on Israel a day earlier, potentially escalating tensions along Israel’s northeastern border. The strikes killed at least 21 people, according to a rights monitoring group. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that the strikes near Damascus were focused on Iranian and Syrian “terror targets,” and noted that a Syrian air defense missile had been fired in retaliation “despite clear warnings to refrain from such fire.”  “As a result, a number of Syrian aerial defense batteries were destroyed,” the statement read.  There have been sporadic flare-ups across the old Israeli-Syrian armistice line. Israel has clashed there with Syrian and Iranian forces based in Syria as Iran’s influence has grown in the war-torn nation. On Tuesday, four rockets were launched from Syrian territory toward the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights but caused no injuries, according to the Israeli military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Wednesday that the strikes had been intended to hit military sites of the Iranian Quds Force and Syrian military targets “after a barrage of rockets was launched at Israel.” “I have made it clear that whoever hurts us — we will hurt him,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “We will continue to vigorously maintain the security of Israel.” Benny Gantz, the chief rival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement affirming his support of the strikes, despite the country’s fraught internal politics. On Wednesday, Mr. Gantz failed to form a new government ahead of a looming deadline.  “We must maintain and strengthen deterrence on all fronts,” Mr. Gantz said on Twitter. Even in an agitated political period, he said, he would support any responsible government action “to strengthen the security of Israeli citizens.” The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors casualties from the war in Syria, said that at least 21 people were killed on Wednesday, and most were believed to be Iranian fighters. One woman was injured by shrapnel. The Syrian state-run news outlet SANA reported that two civilians were among the dead, though that information could not be independently confirmed.  The monitoring group said the strikes were carried out around 1:30 a.m. and targeted weapons warehouses belonging to the Quds Force in two Damascus suburbs and other locations, including the Mezzeh air base.  The Quds Force is the branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps responsible for foreign operations. It has had a growing presence in Syria, supporting the government of President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s yearslong civil war. The Israeli military also warned Syria against “allowing further attacks against Israel.” “We will continue operating firmly and for as long as necessary against the Iranian entrenchment in Syria,” it said.  Ofer Zalzberg, an Israeli analyst for the International Crisis Group, said Israeli officials had been concerned since an attack in September on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco oil facilities — which some blamed on Iran — that Iran could be preparing for something similar in Israel.  He said that it was hard to tell whether the current flare-up would lead to an extended escalation, but that the situation was a “renegotiation of several rules of the game” at a time when Iran’s leadership is struggling with major domestic issues. Large-scale protests have gripped Iran since last week in response to a sudden increase in gasoline prices, and the Iranian authorities have cracked down, with the government imposing a near-complete shutdown of the internet. “Iran is doing something new from Israel’s point of view, and this changes the dynamic,” Mr. Zalzberg said of the four rockets fired into Israel on Tuesday. He said that based on information from intelligence officials, the rockets might have been a response to an undisclosed Israeli operation in Syria over the weekend. The Israeli military rarely acknowledges operations in Syria, but is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in the country since Syria’s civil war began, aimed at curbing Iranian influence. “What triggered all of this? Why are the parties renegotiating rules of the game?” Mr. Zalzberg said. “I don’t think that this is likely to lead to war, but it could lead to an exchange of blows that these parties aren’t prepared for.” Hwaida Saad, David Halbfinger and Myra Noveck contributed reporting.']",The strikes came a day after rockets were fired across the border into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.
One of World’s First Printed Christmas Cards Goes on Display,2019-11-21,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — For many, Christmas would not be the same without a house brimming with cards from their nearest and dearest, stamped and sent by mail or hand-delivered in the heart of the season. For others, the printed card is an artifact of a bygone era. Putting pen to paper — and mailing it — is too much of a hassle. But in an era of e-cards, emojis and GIFs, a London museum has put on display what the Smithsonian and the Victoria and Albert Museum call the world’s oldest printed Christmas card. Dating to 1843, it serves as a reminder of the enduring power of a holiday tradition. The card was one of 1,000 commissioned by a British civil servant, Henry Cole, and illustrated by the artist John Callcott Horsley, the Charles Dickens Museum in central London said. “A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you,” the greeting reads. The illustration depicts a scene likely to be reproduced around many dining tables this year: generations of a family sitting together as they tuck into a meal with wine glasses in hand. The sender’s language, perhaps more affectionate than is traditional today, offers little clues about the card’s age. Addressed to “My very dear father and mother,” the card is signed, “from their loving son, Joe.” In the 176 years since they were produced, only 21 of the originals are known to have survived. The card is on loan to the Dickens museum from a book dealer in San Francisco. More than a century after its inception, the Christmas card is still firmly embedded in the holiday. Research from the Greeting Card Association found that 1.6 billion Christmas cards were bought in the United States last year.  For the past decade, consumers have spent an average of $28 a year on holiday greeting cards and postage, according to the National Retail Federation of America.  Greeting cards are also bucking the overall trend of declining volumes of mail — the quantity of first-class mail delivered through the United States Postal Service is a little more than half what it was 20 years ago.  “There was somewhat of a decline when it came to greeting cards since the mid-1990s, but that decline has stopped in the last five years,” Peter Doherty, the executive director of the Greeting Card Association, said in an interview on Wednesday.  The increase in cards sales can be attributed, in part, to millennials, Mr. Doherty added.  “Younger customers who have grown up mostly receiving messages in digital formats are, in a sense, rebelling a little bit by buying greeting cards,” he said.  In addition, online services that create and mail customized cards are increasingly popular with younger generations that want personalized, luxury greeting cards to communicate with their friends and family, according to research from the Postal Service.  In the 19th century, Mr. Cole seized on technological advances and employed a little commercial nous to sell his 1,000 Christmas greetings for one shilling each — an old currency division worth about $4 in today’s money, according to estimates from Britain’s National Archives. But the cards were considered a flop, and it took five years for the next Christmas card to be designed. “They didn’t sell well,” said Simon Eliot, professor emeritus at the Institute of English Studies at the University of London and the guest curator of the exhibition at the Charles Dickens Museum.  “It must have cost Cole a great deal to have them hand-painted by a recognized craftsman, so I suspect that the realized profits, if any, were negligible,” Professor Eliot added.  But by 1877, the museum said, the idea had caught on, and more than 4.5 million Christmas cards were posted in Britain that year. In 2001, an anonymous buyer paid nearly $30,000 at auction for one of the few remaining original Christmas cards, which were produced the same year as the publication of Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol.” The card industry has also been squeezed by another phenomenon: an increasing concern for the environment. “Sending billions of bits of cardboard around the world uses so much fuel,” said Alex Furness, the co-founder of DontSendMeACard.com, a platform that allows users to send e-cards and donate what they would have spent on postage to a charity of their choosing in Australia, Britain, Ireland or the United States.  “Christmas is certainly the main event for us, and people still want to mark the end of the year,” Mr. Furness said. “But with an e-card, they get to completely reduce their carbon footprint.”  Other Christmas traditions have also come under the microscope, including what songs should be removed from holiday playlists and when to put up festive displays. This month, a couple in Texas ran into trouble for erecting inflatable snowmen in their front yard in San Antonio.  Nick Simonis Jr. and his family were told by their homeowners’ association: too soon.']","The card, dating from 1843, is a symbol of an enduring holiday tradition in an era of e-cards and GIFs.

Hitler’s Birth Home in Austria to Become a Police Station,2019-11-20,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — After years of wrangling over the future of the butter-yellow house in Austria where Hitler was born, the authorities have decided to turn the building into a police station, in a bid make it less of a magnet for neo-Nazis. With the move, announced by the interior minister on Tuesday, the Austrian authorities hope to send a clear message to supporters of far-right extremism that the three-story building in downtown Braunau am Inn, near Austria’s border with Germany, will not be a shrine to Hitler. “The future use of the house by the police should send an unmistakable signal that the role of this building as a memorial to the Nazis been permanently revoked,” Wolfgang Peschorn, the interior minister of Austria, said in a statement. The building has posed a problem for the authorities for the past seven decades. The building’s owner had refused for years to renovate it, making tenants hard to find. Admirers of Hitler, born there in 1889, kept returning. The Interior Ministry took over the main lease from the family that owned the building in 1972 to ensure it had the final say on the use of the building. In 1984, the government sought to acquire the building outright from Gerlinde Pommer, a descendant of the original owners, who by that time had sole possession of the property, but she refused to sell. At the same time, she also refused to invest in the building, making it difficult for the government to find a tenant who met the requirement to use it only for administrative, educational or social services purposes. In 2017, the government seized the building from Ms. Pommer, bringing an end to the dispute.  A redesign competition for the building’s new purpose will begin this month, with work on the building to start next year, Mr. Peschorn said.  The competition will be open to architects from across the European Union in hopes of finding a concept that will ensure the “innovative use and function of the space.” The winner will be announced in 2020, the Interior Ministry said.  Over the years, the house has served as a makeshift museum, a school and a library. For more than three decades an organization offering support and integration assistance for disabled people ran a workshop in the building, but the group moved out in 2011 because the owner refused to bring the building up to code.  After World War II, veterans from Austria and neighboring Germany flocked to the house, especially on Hitler’s birthday. Although the neo-Nazi supporters had dwindled recently, the house remained under constant surveillance for potential problems.  Fascination with Hitler continues unabated more 70 years since the end of World War II. Sales of his paintings and memorabilia continue to draw crowds and criticism. On Wednesday, the Hermann Historica auction house in Munich is putting up for sale a top hat worn by Hitler and a cocktail dress that belonged to Eva Braun, his longtime companion.  Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association, wrote to the owner of the auction house asking him to withdraw the sale, citing the rise of anti-Semitism across Europe and the “many millions of lives lost as a result of National Socialism,” including the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. “We believe the sale of such memorabilia has little intrinsic historical value, but instead will be bought by those who glorify and seek to justify the actions of the greatest evil to affect Europe,” he said. “The trade, therefore, in such items should simply not take place.”']",The authorities decided to turn the house in Braunau into a law enforcement hub to deter neo-Nazi pilgrims.
"In Warning to Hong Kong’s Courts, China Shows Who Is Boss",2019-11-20,By Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — After months of relative restraint, China’s Communist government this week took its most decisive steps to intervene in Hong Kong’s political crisis, signaling a more forceful response that could further inflame tensions in the Chinese territory. China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress, warned that it would use its authority, if necessary, to overrule the territory’s judiciary. It followed a Hong Kong court’s ruling on Monday overturning a contentious ban on wearing face masks, which protesters have used to shield their identities from the police. The warning struck at the very heart of what has fueled the unrest, a concern about Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong. The protests began in June over another legal issue: legislation allowing the extradition of criminal defendants into the opaque and notoriously injudicious judicial system of the mainland. While the bill has since been withdrawn, Beijing has not yielded an inch from its view that the Communist Party remains the ultimate arbiter of justice. That position is especially fraught for Hong Kong, where the court system has been a defining feature of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that promises the territory significant autonomy. “It represents a new stage in Hong Kong’s protest movement,” Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said of the warning from the National People’s Congress, a body that functions as a rubber stamp of the party’s policy agenda. “It has reached the stage of a very direct conflict over sovereignty.” Although Chinese officials have intensified their denunciations of the protesters as extremists and even blamed the “black hands” of western nations in stoking unrest, they have until now largely left the handling of the crisis to the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam. Now, Beijing’s patience appears to be wearing out. Last week, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, toughened his tone. Mr. Xi, who has stirred internal rumblings over the handling of the protests, declared during a visit to Brazil that “the most urgent task” in Hong Kong was “to halt the violence and chaos and to restore order.” A more aggressive strategy is not without risks for Beijing. The protests have left thousands injured, caused significant material and economic damage, and resulted in the arrest of about 700 people during a siege at one campus this week. It has also rattled international confidence in Hong Kong’s unique financial and political status since Britain returned sovereignty to the mainland in 1997. The warning from the National People’s Congress affirmed fears that Beijing is bent on steadily increasing its influence over the territory’s affairs, abandoning its promises to preserve the city’s distinct historical, political and cultural characteristics. On Tuesday, the United States Senate unanimously passed legislation that could authorize the government to impose sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses in the territory. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the bill, saying it “interferes in China’s internal affairs” and violates the norms of international law and relations. The Hong Kong government said the bill was “unnecessary and unwarranted” and would damage Hong Kong’s relationship with the United States. The increasingly barbaric convulsions of violence on both sides have changed the calculus in Beijing, which has been telegraphing a potentially harder line. When a garrison of the People’s Liberation Army in Hong Kong sent unarmed soldiers out of their barracks to help clean up debris from a street on Saturday, some of them wore shirts identifying them as members of a counterterrorism unit normally based on the mainland. In August, the Chinese military sent thousands of new troops into the city as part of what it called an annual rotation. China has never confirmed the total number of mainland soldiers in the territory, raising fears that it has quietly bolstered the force. In some ways, the protesters’ use of increasingly creative makeshift weapons, including bows and arrows, slingshots and explosives, has played into China’s narrative. The state media has used images from the streets as evidence of the spiraling dangers of unchecked popular protests, which are banned on the mainland. “The violent crimes are a ‘virus’ threatening Hong Kong society and a common enemy that is a scourge to all humankind,” The People’s Daily, the chief newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an editorial on its front page on Tuesday. “The savagery of the Hong Kong rioters has already transgressed the bottom line of human morality and civilization, and no country or civilized society would ever permit it.” That a court in Hong Kong would overturn an emergency decree by the executive branch — something inconceivable in China — stoked similar outpourings of outrage in China’s choreographed state media. In a statement released the morning after the ruling, a spokesman for the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, Zang Tiewei, said overturning the mask ban had “seriously weakened the lawful governing power” of Hong Kong’s government. He went on to say that the ruling did not comply with the Basic Law, the constitution-like document that governs relations between the territory and the central government. The legislature has not moved to overturn the ruling — yet. Still, it strongly indicated that the government in Beijing, not the courts, should decide matters of national security. The court’s decision “triggered totally malign consequences,” the Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid, said on Tuesday in an editorial welcoming the decision by the state to intervene. “It gave encouragement to the rioters and left the Hong Kong police force bewildered.” Article 158 of the Basic Law does give the Congress the authority to interpret whether Hong Kong’s legal affairs comply with national law, but typically it has only acted when the courts there have sought such interpretations. Julian G. Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University’s Maurice A. Deane School of Law in New York, said in an emailed message that the statements pre-empted the normal review process. It suggested that Beijing worried that the highest judicial body, the Court of Final Appeal, could also rule against the mask ban. “Issuing what looks like a news release before issuing an interpretation seems presumptuous and maybe a little panicky,” he said. It is exactly things like this — a ruling by an independent court — that protesters say they are now fighting for on the streets. “It will completely destroy ‘One Country, Two Systems’ separation of powers and rule of law,” Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents Hong Kong’s legal sector, said of a move by the National People’s Congress. “So many Basic Law provisions are at stake here.” Whatever happens next — whether Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal reverses the reversal, or Beijing overrides the courts — will be viewed as more evidence of the Communist government’s push to impose greater and greater control over the city’s affairs. After all that has happened, that might be the point.  On the same day as the warning to Hong Kong’s judiciary, the State Council in Beijing announced that it had approved the appointment of a new police chief in Hong Kong — another reminder that the central government has the final say. Tang Ping-Keung, the new chief, has trained and studied extensively in the mainland, as well as at the F.B.I.’s academy in Quantico, Va. Wei Leijie, a law professor at Xiamen University in southeastern China, said that the political crisis in Hong Kong had reached a level obliging the authorities to consider stronger measures. “Soft things need to be hardened,” he said, “and the hard things should be made more specific.” Chris Buckley in Beijing and Elaine Yu and Tiffany May in Hong Kong contributed reporting.

"As Violence Grips Bolivia, Congress Moves Toward New Elections",2019-11-20,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Elisabeth Malkin,"['EL ALTO, Bolivia — Bolivia’s congress on Wednesday scrambled to find a way to call new elections, hoping to chart a path out of the turmoil gripping the country a day after the military opened fire on protesters blocking fuel and food from reaching La Paz, the nation’s main city. Eight people were killed, a human rights official said, in the clashes outside a major fuel depot in El Alto, a working-class city in the mountains outside La Paz that had been blockaded for days by supporters of the ousted president, Evo Morales. Mr. Morales was driven from office earlier this month after 14 years in office, following a disputed election in which he claimed to be the winner. He fled the country and took asylum in Mexico, having lost the allegiance of the military and police. But Mr. Morales, the country’s first Indigenous president, still has legions of supporters among the country’s Indigenous groups and among rural coca growers, who have taken to the streets to call for his return. “There is no reason for me to be out of Bolivia,” he said on Wednesday at a news conference in Mexico City. He argued that he is currently the president, as well as the president-elect, but he said he did not object to a new election, provided that it was organized under a new law approved by congress. “If the solution is new elections, I don’t oppose it,” he said. “They are welcome.” Eva Copa, the president of the Bolivian Senate and a member of Mr. Morales’s leftist party, which holds a two-thirds majority in the congress, said that the previous election would be annulled as part of a bill that would appoint a new election commission and fast-track a new vote. “This is a clear signal to show the country that we as two-thirds have all the will to advance and provide a route for these elections,” Ms. Copa told reporters in La Paz. Later Wednesday, Jeanine Añez, an opposition senator who has become the country’s interim leader, announced that she would send her own bill to hold a new election to the Bolivian congress. Her bill would also annul the disputed Oct. 20 vote, and speed up the establishment of a new electoral authority that would set a timetable for elections. The country has grown increasingly desperate for a solution. In El Alto late Tuesday night, witnesses said, a military unit guarding the Senkata gasoline plant opened fire on protesters who had surrounded the plant for over a week. By blocking tankers from leaving the plant, Mr. Morales’s supporters were able to cut off La Paz’s main source of gasoline and food, causing acute shortages. At least eight people were reported killed. In El Alto, inside the church of San Francisco de Asís, the bloodied bodies of five young men with gunshot wounds lay on pews, covered with Bolivian flags on which lay the large-caliber bullets that were said to have killed the men. Hundreds of residents gathered to pay their respects.  Family members of at least two of the dead said they had merely walking to work when they were shot by soldiers. Bolivia’s armed forces said in a statement on Tuesday that violence had flared outside Senkata after the military temporarily broke the protesters’ siege in an effort to lead a convoy of gasoline trucks from the plant to La Paz. Protesters responded by storming the plant and breaching its walls with dynamite, before being repelled by soldiers, witnesses said. Bolivia’s new defense minister, Fernando López, told reporters on Tuesday that “not one bullet” had been fired by the military at Senkata, an account that was contradicted by a dozen witnesses who had gathered at the church that night. Residents directed their anger at Ms. Añez, who last week signed a decree shielding security forces from criminal prosecution when maintaining public order. “This is their decree, right here,” Jessica Quispe said between sobs while touching the body of her brother Ronald. “He was just going to work.” A few hundred feet away, dozens of heavily armed soldiers and armored vehicles guarded the perimeter of the fuel plant, as military helicopters circled overhead.  The deaths set off unrest in large parts of El Alto, a traditional stronghold of Mr. Morales on a frigid plateau above La Paz. Protesters on Tuesday sealed off roads with barbed wire and burned debris. They pulled down pedestrian overpasses onto the highway to block tanker trucks from reaching the plant.  On Wednesday, mourners marched through El Alto. Fuel shortages have crippled the administrative capital in the valley below. Hundreds of La Paz’s public minibus drivers blocked off main access points to the city to demand gasoline.  In El Alto, residents said the new outbreak of violence merely strengthened their resolve to resist Ms. Añez’s government. Anatoly Kurmanaev reported from El Alto, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.']","At least eight died as the military tried to break a siege of a gasoline plant by supporters of the ousted president, Evo Morales.

More Than 140 Nazca Lines Are Discovered in Peruvian Desert,2019-11-21,By Iliana Magra,"['A huge carving of a monkey with its tail twirled in a spiral; vast, geometric images of a condor and a hummingbird; an immense spider — the 2,000-year-old Nazca Lines in Peru have awed and mystified modern viewers since they were first seen from the air last century. Now, 143 more images have been discovered, etched into a coastal desert plain about 250 miles southeast of Lima, the Peruvian capital. The Japanese researchers who found them combined on-the-ground work with the most modern of tools: satellite photography, three-dimensional imaging and, in one case, artificial intelligence. The newly discovered carvings, or geoglyphs, depict human forms and a broad variety of animals, including camelids, a group of mammals that includes llamas and alpacas; cats; fish; and snakes, according to the research group from Yamagata University.  The shapes, some of which are believed to date from at least 100 B.C., were mainly identified in the western side of the area through fieldwork — picking through pottery remnants, stones and soil — and by analyzing high-resolution imagery, the university said in a statement last week. The largest are more than 300 feet long. But one geoglyph was revealed as a result of a collaboration between the university research team and Watson, IBM’s artificial intelligence system. When the university and IBM Japan analyzed data with software called Watson Machine Learning Community Edition, they identified various candidates for “biomorphic” shapes. The university said the researchers then chose one of them and, after conducting work on the ground in 2019, discovered a previously unknown, 16-foot figure of a human standing on two feet.  The Nazca Lines cover an area of about 173 square miles and are thought to have been scratched into the earth from 500 B.C. to A.D. 500. The shapes are best seen from the air, and many are impossible to discern from the ground. UNESCO has designated the Nazca Lines a World Heritage site that bears witness to “the culture and magical-religious tradition and beliefs,” artistic and technical skills, and land use techniques of societies in pre-Columbian South America.  Masato Sakai, a professor of cultural anthropology and Andean archaeology who led the research team, said in a video about the discovery that the enigmatic drawings must become more visible to ensure their survival. “The most important point is not the discovery itself,” Professor Sakai said, adding that the lines were “facing a crisis of destruction.” “They should be cleaned up,” he said. “If they become clearly visible, they will be protected as important cultural heritages.” In 2014, Greenpeace activists left marks on the protected site after they entered the area to place a sign promoting renewable energy. And nearly two years ago, a truck driver was arrested after he intentionally drove his tractor-railer off the Pan-American Highway, which runs through the archaeological site, and damaged three straight-line geoglyphs, Peru’s culture minister said at the time.  All of the Nazca works were created by removing the darker top layer of earth to reveal the white sand beneath.  The new findings are categorized into two types that differ in scale and purpose.  The representational group, depicting animals and anthropomorphic figures, includes figures that usually span less than 165 feet, according to the university. The other, more abstract and geometric group, includes much larger shapes. The longest one stretches more than 330 feet. Part of the fascination with the Nazca Lines derives from the mystery of their function.  In his 1968 best seller, “Chariots of the Gods?,” Erich von Däniken, a Swiss author, suggested that they might have served as landing strips for aliens.  But archaeologists say they believe some of the etchings played a role in astronomical rituals. The Yamagata University team said that geometric shapes signified places where people held ceremonies that involved the breaking of ceramics, while the smaller, representational figures, which were found close to paths or slopes, are believed to have been travel markers, “designed to be looked at.” The researchers plan to use another IBM system, called PAIRS, to organize data collected from the ground over the past 10 years and conduct more groundwork to create a map of the geoglyphs.  And they hope to solve the mysteries that remain about the ancient, sprawling figures and shapes.  “By gaining a detailed understanding on where the figures are located and when they were used,” the university said, “researchers aim to attain a closer look into the worldview of the people who made and used these geoglyphs.” Makiko Inoue and Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.']","A team of Japanese researchers combined on-the-ground archaeology with modern technology, including artificial intelligence, to identify the 2,000-year-old images."
"Iraq Officials, Responding to Times Report, Deny Aiding Iran",2019-11-19,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['Several senior Iraqi officials named in a New York Times report based on leaked Iranian intelligence cables denied on Monday that they were close to Iran or that they had given sensitive information to its government.  The report, based on about 700 pages of secret Iranian intelligence cables obtained by The Intercept and shared with The Times, was published online early Monday and shed light on the extent of Tehran’s reach inside Iraq’s power circles.  The cables record years of effort by the Iranians to cultivate senior Iraqi politicians, some of whom were said to have passed on information and to have committed to helping the Islamic Republic. The leaked documents describe in detail Iran’s efforts to obtain informants and to persuade Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides.  The cables date from 2014 and 2015, when Iraq was under siege by militants from the Islamic State and Iran’s help was critical to its survival.  In the Times article, the cables’ descriptions of the connections to Iran of several senior Iraqi officials, including the current prime minister, Adil Abdul Mahdi, and a former prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, are detailed at length. They include direct quotes attributed to the Iraqis in reports filed to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, or M.O.I.S. Some of those officials on Monday expressed private dismay, public outrage or both, at being mentioned in the article. Among them were Mr. al-Abadi, the former prime minister, and Lt. Gen. Hatem al-Maksusi, who at the time he was mentioned in the cables was commander of military intelligence in Iraq’s Defense Ministry.  Mr. al-Abadi denied that he had attended a private meeting with an Iranian agent who went by the name Boroujerdi, as recounted in the cables. In a statement on Facebook, he said, “We categorically deny that such a meeting took place.”  Mr. al-Abadi said: “There was no such meeting on his schedule and it is unreasonable that a figure like the prime minister would meet and coordinate with a person with an obscure and unknown rank. It is a stupid and suspicious claim.”  Another Iraqi cited in the article, Bayan Jabr, a former transportation minister, criticized The Times report for not fully quoting his response to the description in the cables of his relationship with the Iranians. The cables said Mr. Jabr had agreed to a request from Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, to fly planeloads of weapons and others supplies through Iraqi airspace to Syria to help the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against American-backed rebels.  According to the cables, Mr. Jabr granted the request.  Mr. Jabr was quoted in the Times article as saying that the flights were carrying humanitarian supplies and religious pilgrims. His office restated that on Monday, and said the article should have noted that at the time, Mr. Jabr had not yet officially taken up the position of minister, and that the planes were “subject to periodic searches by the Americans.”  Another figure mentioned in the cables, and in the Times report, Salim al-Jabouri, the speaker of Iraq’s Parliament in 2014 and 2015, questioned the timing of the article and said it might have been published “to incite the street” against the government. Popular opinion in Iraq is already running heavily against the government, with protests underway throughout the country.  General al-Maksusi played down the significance of the Times report. He was depicted in the cables as putting all of Iraq’s military intelligence at the service of Iran. In comments published in the Times article, he denied working for Iran but praised the country for helping Iraq fight the Islamic State. He said he had also worked closely with the United States.  On Monday, a statement put out by General al-Maksusi’s office said that “military intelligence worked closely” with a committee made up of representatives of four countries after 2014 — Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq — “in the fight against ISIS.”  “The details mentioned in the report did not come up with something new,” the statement said. “It’s natural that intelligence information would be exchanged when there is an agreement on intelligence sharing.”  The leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from the Persian and shared them with The Times. The Intercept and The Times verified the authenticity of the documents but do not know who leaked them. The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to “let the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","Several current and former Iraqi officials, named in leaked spy cables, said they had not provided Tehran with sensitive information.

Rodrigo Duterte Calls for Ban on Public Vaping in the Philippines,2019-11-21,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has ordered a sweeping ban on vaping in public, threatening to use the police and military to enforce what observers in the country have called a draconian order. When Mr. Duterte, a former smoker, announced the ban in a speech on Tuesday, his statement caught many Filipinos by surprise but was largely ignored. But he reiterated the order on Wednesday in a long and at times rambling speech before the Department of National Defense, saying that vaping was “toxic” and could now be done only in private. Mr. Duterte ordered the police to arrest anyone caught vaping in public in the Philippines, a largely Catholic nation in Southeast Asia that has some of the region’s toughest smoking laws. Mr. Duterte said that many Filipinos, particularly young ones, used vaping devices without realizing the dangers they posed. This month, the Philippine Health Department reported the first case of vaping-related lung injury in the country. A 16-year-old girl was said to have been vaping for half a year before being hospitalized in October; she has since been released. In the United States, cases of vaping-related illnesses have surged in recent months, with at least 44 deaths reported. The Trump administration recently pulled back from a vow to ban many flavored e-cigarette products, saying that businesses would suffer. Mr. Duterte, who recently revealed that he has a neuromuscular disease, said he understood “youthful negligence” even as he said the state was empowered to protect its people.  “The safest way to do it is in your house,” he said. “But if you are not that stupid, when you do that, you contaminate your children in the family.” Mr. Duterte has been known to issue contentious policies. A popular anecdote from his time as mayor of the southern city of Davao holds that he once forced a foreign tourist to eat a cigarette for smoking in public. Mr. Duterte often claims that in Davao, “nobody, but nobody” can be seen smoking on the streets. “As you know, nicotine is an addictive devil,” he said on Wednesday. “And if you have to have a fix, well, you have to find some latrine there anywhere, but not in the madding crowd.” He said that he had yet to write a formal executive order for the directive, but that there was an existing law against distributing toxic materials in public places. A spokesman for the National Police, Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, said the police would follow Mr. Duterte’s order, and added that a 2017 executive order gave them legal backing for the “establishment of smoke-free environments in public and enclosed places.” Senator Pia Cayetano, who leads the Senate’s powerful Ways and Means Committee, which determines the country’s tax policies, said that while e-cigarettes were associated with some health risks, advocates say that the devices are effective in helping tobacco smokers quit. The question is whether to ban vaping outright or to strictly regulate it, and Ms. Cayetano said she favored regulation. However, she said that public health was paramount and should “take precedence over any business or commercial interest.” In June, the country’s Health Department introduced strict controls on the retail sale of nicotine shots, the liquid that fills e-cigarettes. But vaping industry representatives have sought to stop the regulation in court. Emer Rojas, the president of an antismoking lobby, the New Vois Association of the Philippines, said that Mr. Duterte’s public statements about vaping could be intended to show the seriousness of his order. But Mr. Rojas said that deaths linked to vaping had been on the rise around the world, while deaths associated with regular cigarettes were recorded only after years of abuse. “E-cigarettes may be more deadly since people get sick and die in just a few years of vaping,” said Mr. Rojas, a survivor of laryngeal cancer who said he had smoked for 25 years.']",The Philippine president called on the police and military to help in enforcing the ban.
Two Americans Killed in Helicopter Crash in Afghanistan,2019-11-20,By David Zucchino,"['BAMIAN, Afghanistan — Two American service members were killed on Wednesday in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, the American military in Kabul said in a statement. The military said the cause of the crash was under investigation. “Preliminary reports do not indicate it was caused by enemy fire,” read a statement from United States Forces Afghanistan. But a Taliban spokesman said the helicopter was shot down in Logar Province in eastern Afghanistan around 1 a.m. The militants, however, often issue false or exaggerated claims. The American military statement did not disclose the time or location of the crash. The identities of the two service members were withheld pending notification of the next of kin. It was not known which branch of the military they were from.  The deaths brought the number of American service members killed during combat operations this year to 19. That is the highest yearly total since 2014, when the Pentagon announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan. More than 2,400 Americans troops have died in combat since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, according to the website icasualties.org. The most recent American combat death before Wednesday’s crash was Sgt. First Class Jeremy W. Griffin, 40, a Special Forces soldier from Greenbrier, Tenn. The Pentagon said the soldier was killed by small-arms fire while fighting alongside Afghan commandos in Wardak Province. Casualties among Afghan security forces and Afghan civilians are also at high levels this year, reflecting an upsurge in fighting  by all sides during and after 10 months of peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban. President Trump declared the talks dead Sept. 7. Although the Afghan and American militaries  no longer publish Afghan government casualties, an estimated 50,000 Afghan security force members have been killed in the last five years — sometimes more than a dozen a day. In the first nine months of this year, 2,563 civilians were killed and 5,676 were wounded in the conflict, the United Nations reported. From July 1 to Sept. 30, the U.N. recorded the highest number of civilian casualties in a single quarter since the agency began systematically documenting casualties 10 years ago. The crash Wednesday came a day after the Taliban released two Westerners abducted in Kabul in 2016 in exchange for three Taliban leaders held by the Afghan government. The Taliban also released 10 Afghan service members as part of a negotiated agreement. ']",The U.S. military in Kabul said preliminary reports indicate the crash was not caused by enemy fire.
"What’s Next for Netanyahu, and Israel?",2019-11-21,By Isabel Kershner,"['The corruption charges brought against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday not only threaten his political future, they also present the country with an unprecedented legal quandary. Mr. Netanyahu, the country’s longest serving prime minister, also holds the dubious distinction of being the first to be indicted while in office. He has denied the allegations against him. Israel was already struggling to choose a leader who could form a new government after two inconclusive elections this year. Mr. Netanyahu’s indictment adds further uncertainty to a chaotic political landscape.  Here are some ways it could play out: Israel does not have a constitution. Its primary governing principles are enshrined in what are known as the Basic Laws, one of which addresses a prime minister facing trial.  Under that law, Mr. Netanyahu can remain under indictment and even stand trial while in office. Lawmakers could vote to oust him only after all appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years. But watchdog bodies are planning nonetheless to challenge Mr. Netanyahu’s continued tenure in court. The provision dealing with a prime minister facing trial has never been interpreted by the Supreme Court so there is no precedent, argued Suzie Navot, a professor of constitutional law at the Striks School of Law near Tel Aviv.  “Without interpretation it’s meaningless,” she said.  Ms. Navot noted, for example, that the Basic Law does not differentiate between a prime minister charged with a lesser crime like failing to pay taxes, or a major one like accepting bribes. Bribery, the most serious of the charges against Mr. Netanyahu, carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.  In two cases in the 1990s, the Supreme Court ruled that an ordinary government minister or deputy minister must be fired immediately upon being charged. But these ministers can easily be replaced. If a prime minister resigns, the entire government falls, adding to the significance of any decision by the court.  Those earlier rulings stemmed from petitions filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a nongovernmental group. The group argues that the same standard should apply to a prime minister and is preparing to go back to court. “A prime minister under indictment is unfit to serve,” said Tomer Naor, the group’s chief legal officer. “For a prime minister, but not a health minister, to be able to continue in office is completely absurd.” But such a finding by the court would be likely to draw fire. Right-wing politicians are already seeking to curb the Supreme Court’s powers, so a ruling that ousts Mr. Netanyahu would be viewed by some as overreaching. Ayelet Shaked, a right-wing legislator and former justice minister, recently warned the Supreme Court justices against involvement in the political process, describing any attempt to do so as “tantamount to a coup.” Gad Barzilai, a professor of law at the University of Haifa, said it was “doubtful” that the court had the authority to force a quick resignation. Like any lawmaker, Mr. Netanyahu could ask for parliamentary immunity from prosecution, but whether he has a practical path to securing it soon is unclear. Immunity can be granted by a parliamentary committee and then a vote by the full Parliament. Ordinarily, a lawmaker would have 30 days after being charged to put in a request. But after two inconclusive elections and months of political paralysis in Israel, the committee is not functioning — and may not resume work for months, until another election is held and a government is formed.  Rebel members of Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party could demand a primary election to choose a new leader. If Mr. Netanyahu, who has denied all wrongdoing, survives as party leader, he could still run in a national ballot for another term.  If he were to lose a primary election, he would no longer be Likud’s candidate for another term as prime minister.  Since neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his main challenger, Benny Gantz, was able to form a government after the last election, the task has been given to Parliament, which has three weeks to try to choose a prime minister who has the backing of a majority of its members. If Parliament fails, Israel will hold another election.  If Mr. Netanyahu wins that election, despite the charges, President Reuven Rivlin would have to decide if it were appropriate to task him with forming a government. In many respects, the law is not clear. Mordechai Kremnitzer, a former dean of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center, said a large segment of the public believes that a prime minister continuing to serve while charged with serious crimes is “an intolerable combination.”  “Everyone feels there is something askew here,” Mr. Kremnitzer said, adding that a prime minister cannot “go to court from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. and from 4 p.m. run the country.”']","The corruption case against Benjamin Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister indicted while in office, has raised unprecedented legal questions for both him and the country."
"At Odds With Labour, Britain’s Jews Are Feeling Politically Homeless",2019-11-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — At a synagogue west of London, a rabbi made an astonishing plea: Vote against the Labour Party in the coming general election, he urged his congregants, because its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, poses “a danger to Jewish life as we know it.” On the second day of Rosh Hashana in north London, another rabbi warned of the opposite: that browbeating Jews into opposing Labour because of anti-Semitism “can only stoke people’s fears.” And on the eve of a recent Shabbat at Alyth, another north London congregation, a rabbi closed his sermon by marveling at how Jews, once just a small constituency, had suddenly become “a talking point” in this race. As Britain prepares for its most seismic election in decades, one that will decide its relationship to Europe and place in the world, few voters face such an anguished choice as the country’s 300,000 Jews. With anti-Semitism surging in Europe and the United States, the debate over how to vote in Britain’s election has already rattled rabbinical conventions, strained friendships and started a war of letters in the left-wing press, as many Jews wrestle with nerve-racking options. Jews overwhelmingly opposed Brexit, the main plank of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s campaign, dreading an emboldened far right and the splintering of a European project at the root of post-World War II peace. But they also flinch at handing power to Mr. Corbyn, seen by many as the only person who can stop Brexit, pained as they are by an avalanche of anti-Semitism accusations against the party. “I feel quite torn,” said Keith Kahn-Harris, a sociologist and writer who attends Alyth. “The issue in the Jewish community at the moment is anti-Semitism is something you can’t hold your nose for, the one thing you can’t overlook, which I understand. But for me, there are multiple things I can’t overlook, and it’s very difficult to know how to balance them.” The quandary has consequences far beyond the .5 percent of Britons who are Jewish. Labour’s hopes of unseating Mr. Johnson hang on its appeal as the gentler and more upstanding of Britain’s main parties, a case that Mr. Corbyn made to great effect in the 2017 election and that should have been bolstered by Mr. Johnson’s hardball tactics as prime minister. But the anti-Semitism scandal is “gravely damaging Labour’s reputation as the nice party,” said Glen O’Hara, a historian at Oxford Brookes University. And it has frustrated voters already dubious of Mr. Corbyn’s anti-Brexit bona fides. Rabbis used to joke that when young Jews became a bar or bat mitzvah, tradition held that they be given lifelong membership in the Labour Party. But no longer. Many Jews now feel sharply at odds with Labour, and politically homeless in Britain. A number of Labour lawmakers have quit the party over the issue since February. The Jewish Labour Movement, a 100-year-old socialist group, decided not to campaign nationally for Labour for the first time in its history. And the Jewish Chronicle, Britain’s most influential Jewish newspaper, ran a front-page editorial beseeching non-Jews to heed the paper’s fears of a Corbyn government. The dread felt by British Jews reflects wider alarm over a rise in anti-Semitism on the hard left and the hard right in Europe and the United States. Britain’s Conservative Party, pulling a page from Republicans in the United States, has tried to capitalize, courting Jews angered by the anti-Semitism scandal within Labour. But some British Jews are wary of seeing the cause weaponized in the heat of an election. Distrustful of Mr. Johnson’s own record of racist and Islamophobic remarks, and fearful of far-right violence against Jews in the United States, they are trying to persuade people to consider how a Johnson government could hurt not only Jews but other vulnerable groups.  “Undeniably, the vast majority of British Jews recognize there’s a problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, and it’s been really painful,” said Tommer Spence, who recently helped start a group called Jews Against Boris. “We strongly feel that the response to that is not to turn to a leader who is willing to engage in far-right rhetoric, appeal to nationalist instincts and throw other minorities under the bus, because it could be us next. None of us are safe while he’s doing that.” Labour said in a statement that it was “taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism” in the party. “Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, hatred and bigotry,” a party spokeswoman said.  But British Jews, some of whom were already drifting rightward in recent decades, have accelerated their retreat from Labour since Mr. Corbyn  became leader in 2015. An ardent anticapitalist and anti-imperialist, Mr. Corbyn once defended a mural featuring grotesque caricatures of hooknosed Jewish bankers. He accused longtime Britons who were Zionists of failing to “understand English irony.” And several whistle-blowers have accused Corbyn allies of interfering in the party’s anti-Semitism complaints process. Labour is now under investigation by Britain’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission. In recent weeks, one Labour candidate quit after being accused of calling a Jewish colleague “Shylock,” a reference to the moneylender in Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice,” and another left the race after revelations that she compared Israel to “an abused child who grows up to become an abusive adult.” Scholars say certain strains of anticapitalism have historically risked casting Jews as a class of rich conspirators oppressing working people. Some of Mr. Corbyn’s supporters also stridently oppose Israel, occasionally resorting to anti-Semitic tropes to make their points. Some Jews are imploring friends and relatives to vote Labour to stop Brexit, whatever their qualms. They point to the Conservatives’ own record on anti-Semitism: This week one parliamentary candidate was suspended after he was found to have said parts of Holocaust history were “fabricated,” and another was suspended for saying British Jews returned from Israel “brainwashed” and “extremists.” But many others chafe at Labour’s attempts to deflect criticism, and say arguing that the stakes are too high to send the party a message on anti-Semitism belittles a core moral obligation.  The issue is particularly vexing for younger voters, who make up Mr. Corbyn’s core vote. “There really is no good option for us as young Jewish people,” said Hannah Rose, a student who worked for one of the lawmakers who quit Labour. “It shouldn’t be up to marginalized groups to have to stand up again and again to try to convince people they’re telling the truth. Where’s the solidarity? Does it apply to Jewish people? Where’s our comradeship?” The exodus of Labour lawmakers this year has extinguished some Jews’ hope that the party could change. But with political allegiances shifting on all sides, Labour stands a chance of cobbling together a minority government, a prospect that strikes fear in Jews worried about Corbyn allies downplaying, for instance, anti-Jewish hate crimes. “The Jewish community is a tiny part of the country that’s always suffered from prejudice, and it has relied for a long time on relations with the central government,” said Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who is representing a complainant in the equalities watchdog’s investigation into Labour. “And there will be a government instead which the mainstream Jewish community has effectively severed ties with, and that’s extremely worrying.” Online and over Shabbat dinners, arguments about the election have grown bitter. Those grudgingly planning to vote for Labour have been called traitors to the community and self-hating Jews. Anti-Corbyn die-hards, on the other hand, have been branded the handmaidens of a hard Brexit. The conundrum facing British Jews owes in large part to the country’s winner-take-all voting system, which renders many votes for smaller parties useless. In a heavily Jewish north London seat, though, the Liberal Democrats, a centrist anti-Brexit party, have stormed into the lead in some polls by running Luciana Berger, a Jewish, ex-Labour lawmaker who has faced a raft of anti-Semitic abuse. The election has even thrown rabbinical conventions into turmoil. Rabbi Jonathan Romain, for one, took the extraordinary step recently of telling his congregants to vote for whichever party would keep Labour out of power, shattering a long-held tradition in British synagogues that rabbis stay strictly out of party politics. “I felt we were in a new situation, and a new political reality superseded normal considerations,” he said in an interview. “It wasn’t time to tut-tut from the sidelines.” But other rabbis disagree, making the case  that being Jewish is more about showing solidarity with all marginalized people than protecting Jews. “If we turn away from these values, turn inward, we will betray our purpose and our destiny,” Howard Cooper, a rabbi in north London, said in his Rosh Hashana sermon. In the back of some Jews’ minds is another dread: that if Labour loses the election, strengthening the right’s grip on power and ushering in a hard Brexit, an aggrieved pro-Corbyn left will unjustly turn on Jews for raising a ruckus over anti-Semitism. “It’s one of my biggest worries,” said Emily Hilton, another founder of Jews Against Boris. “That Labour will lose and everyone will blame the Jews.”']","Once Labourites practically by birth, they are feeling an anti-Semitic chill, leaving many stuck with a choice among lesser evils in the election."
Malta Arrests Businessman as ‘Person of Interest’ in Journalist’s Killing,2019-11-20,By Richard Pérez-Peña,"['The authorities in Malta arrested a prominent businessman on Wednesday in connection with the killing of the country’s best-known investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had accused companies and politicians tied to him of corruption. The businessman, Yorgen Fenech, was detained on his yacht just after it left port, as he tried to leave the country, local news outlets reported. The arrest is the biggest development in almost two years since the killing of Ms. Caruana Galizia, a case that had appeared to be stalled. Her family and friends have said that the government has no interest in solving it. The police declined to comment about the arrest, but Prime Minister Joseph Muscat confirmed to reporters that Mr. Fenech had been detained in connection with the murder case. The announcement came a day after another man suspected of being a go-between in the killing was arrested, but it was not clear how, or whether, the two arrests were linked. Mr. Muscat had offered clemency to the man arrested on Tuesday — his name was not released — if he would identify the person who had ordered the killing. Ms. Caruana Galizia, 53, was killed in a car bombing on Oct. 16, 2017, after years of making enemies of many of the most powerful people in a nation that has become known for smuggling and money laundering. Her reports were often described as flimsy and reckless, but she uncovered and drew attention to multiple scandals.  Mr. Fenech leads his family’s business, the Tumas Group, which owns hotels, casinos and commercial real estate. He is also a major investor in a shipping terminal and an energy company, Electro Gas Malta, a favorite target of Ms. Caruana Galizia’s.  While the company was trying to arrange financing to build a major power plant, she said the government’s backing for the project was tainted by corruption. The Daphne Project, a consortium of journalists and news organizations committed to continuing her work, reported that a natural gas deal related to the project could cost taxpayers millions of dollars. In the last months of her life, Ms. Caruana Galizia had also focused on a mysterious company called 17 Black. After she was killed, it was revealed that 17 Black had arranged to make payments from a bank account in Dubai to Panama companies owned by high-ranking officials in Mr. Muscat’s government. Last year, a leaked government investigative report revealed who owned 17 Black: Mr. Fenech. Six weeks after Ms. Caruana Galizia was killed, the Maltese authorities arrested 10 people in the case, but only three were charged, and none have stood trial.

Labour Party Manifesto: Corbyn Plan Offers ‘Radical Answers’ for the U.K.,2019-11-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — In a bid to re-energize his election campaign, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, unveiled the party’s most left-wing agenda in a generation on Thursday, vowing to tax the wealthy to renationalize large parts of the country’s utilities and railways, reduce carbon emissions, and pay for better health care and schools.  For all the focus on Brexit in the lead-up to the election next month, the release of Labour’s manifesto was a reminder of the yawning ideological gap between Britain’s two main parties. Heeding calls from Labour activists to embrace a more radical plan than it did in the 2017 race, Mr. Corbyn significantly increased Labour’s taxing, borrowing and spending goals. Analysts said he was bargaining that anger at a decade of austerity, stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and the rising toll of climate change would motivate voters to kick out the Conservatives after nine years in government. While publicizing the plan in Birmingham, Mr. Corbyn said he welcomed the ire of Britain’s political establishment. “I accept the opposition of the billionaires, because we will make those at the top pay their fair share of tax to help fund world class public services for you — that’s real change,” Mr. Corbyn said. He called his proposal “the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades.” But while some of Mr. Corbyn’s policies have proved popular with voters, he himself has not, a liability that analysts believe will be difficult for Labour to overcome next month. And even if the party erases its steep polling deficit and fares well in the vote, Labour is likely to need the help of smaller, more moderate opposition parties in order to take power, potentially hemming in some of its plans. Still, Mr. Corbyn said on Thursday that “radical answers” were needed to deal with Britain’s problems, vowing to undo decades of privatization ushered in by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The party proposed nationalizing the railways, water companies, the Royal Mail, energy providers and broadband services. It intends to raise taxes by 83 billion pounds a year, or $107 billion, with the increases aimed at big businesses and high earners. And it wants to put Britain “on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s,” the manifesto says. The Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has also made public spending increases a centerpiece of his campaign, putting him at odds with his own party’s long history of fiscal restraint. But in other ways, Mr. Johnson’s government has turned rightward even as Labour veers to the left, pledging new police powers and reaching a “hard” Brexit deal with Brussels that envisions the country cutting ties with the European market in order to strike new trade deals around the world. Conservative leaders described Labour’s plan as a “reckless spending spree” and said Mr. Corbyn had no plan for Brexit. Mr. Corbyn, for his part, repeated what has become the go-to attack line of his campaign: that in Mr. Johnson’s zeal to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States, American companies will take over Britain’s National Health Service, an accusation Mr. Johnson has denied. “We will never let Donald Trump get his hands on our N.H.S.,” Mr. Corbyn said on Thursday. Labour intends to renegotiate a Brexit deal with Brussels upon taking office, one that keeps Britain closely tied to Europe, and then hold a second referendum, with voters getting a choice between that deal and staying in the European Union. But Mr. Corbyn has not bowed to considerable pressure from all sides to declare what side he would take in that referendum. While the Conservatives are campaigning on a tough law-and-order platform, Mr. Corbyn took the opposite tack on Thursday, pledging to close two immigration removal centers. And he vowed to reckon more seriously than any previous British government has with the toll of colonialism, saying the party would “conduct an audit of the impact of Britain’s colonial legacy to understand our contribution to the dynamics of violence and insecurity across regions previously under British colonial rule.”']",The opposition leader proposed a $100 billion tax increase on the wealthy to pay for a sweeping nationalization program and hikes in spending for education and health care. 
Lebanon Protesters Shut Down Parliament and Clash With Police,2019-11-19,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Protesters on Tuesday stopped Parliament from convening to discuss a package of controversial laws that critics fear could provide amnesty for past corruption, as crowds blocked roads leading to government buildings and skirmishes broke out with the riot police. The action comes on the 34th day of widespread antigovernment protests that have both galvanized and paralyzed the country, and the protesters’ success seemed likely to sharpen tensions between the government and the people. Several lawmakers had said before the Parliament session was postponed that they would boycott the session, but others on Tuesday could not get through the roadblocks on streets surrounding government buildings.  The session had already been pushed back once: Protesters vowed last week to form a human chain to prevent lawmakers from gathering.  Scuffles broke out on Tuesday at the barbed-wire barrier between the public square where demonstrators have gathered day and night and the government palace overlooking it. The riot police were seen beating some protesters with sticks and knocking them to the ground.  Nearby, shots were fired into the air as protesters blocked a convoy of cars attempting to carry a lawmaker to the Parliament building.  Since former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his cabinet resigned on Oct. 29, the country’s powerful political blocs have been reluctant to form a new government of nonpolitical experts, as the protesters have demanded. Instead, after weeks of deliberation during which the economy slid further toward crisis, the parties proposed a new candidate for prime minister: Mohammad Safadi, a wealthy former finance minister.  The protesters rejected him immediately, saying he was too closely identified with the political class they want swept from power. The move is just one of a series of proposed changes that the protesters have rejected as half measures that would do little to overhaul Lebanon’s sectarian political system, eradicate government corruption or save the crumbling economy.  Among the laws that were to be discussed on Tuesday was amnesty for certain prisoners, including those convicted of drug-related crimes, those accused of joining a terrorist organization and those accused of shooting weapons.  The proposal has long been popular in parts of the country where many residents have been prosecuted over such crimes, but protesters and civil society activists have questioned whether such amnesty could be applied equitably and safely. And critics warn it could potentially be extended to provide blanket amnesty for past corruption. The demonstrations, which by some measures have at times drawn a quarter of Lebanon’s population into the streets, have been largely peaceful.  But at least four people have been killed in events related to the protests. Last week, a soldier shot a man who was helping to block a road in the town of Khalde. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.']",Crowds blocked roads leading to government buildings to stop lawmakers from laws that critics fear could provide amnesty for past corruption.
Parents of Besieged Hong Kong Protesters Come to the Front Lines,2019-11-19,By Tiffany May and Paul Mozur,"['HONG KONG — One mother fell to her knees before riot police officers and begged for her daughter’s release. Another promised she would boil soup for a trapped son before he made a desperate escape across police lines. From a distance, a father got his first glimpse of his son in days — as the son was led away in handcuffs. As the police siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University trapped more than 1,000 pro-democracy protesters this week, another group entangled in the city’s crisis has turned conspicuously outspoken: their parents.  The voices of mothers and fathers, racked by fear and anger, emerged as a call for compromise in the standoff on the campus, where on Tuesday several dozen holdouts remained.   Many parents worried not only about the safety of students in Hong Kong’s increasingly violent protests, but also about the longer-term consequences for young adults whose lives could now be upended by abruptly truncated educations, criminal charges and prison.  At the same time, parents said their exposure to the police tactics — some have seen police beatings or been hit with nonlethal projectiles themselves in the mayhem —  had made them more sympathetic to their children’s choices to defy and resist.    “If it were not for my daughter being inside, I would not have stood so close to the front,” said Sam Ho, a 43-year-old interior designer. His 17-year-old daughter told his wife that she had gone to the school, known as PolyU, to return books on Sunday. Soon after, her online communications cut off. Without telling her parents, she later joined a pro-peace prayer meeting on campus. That day, the police blocked exits to the campus after protesters had set fire to a bridge, stopping traffic on a key tunnel nearby. The move effectively trapped the protesters, leaving them to fight it out or leave in handcuffs. It also drew demonstrators from across the city into violent confrontations with the police as they sought to rescue people from the standoff.  “Before, I wondered whether some things the protesters, or those who appeared to be protesters, did cross a line. But now I have a deeper understanding of why they had to use those tactics,” said Mr. Ho, adding that he had been most worried that the police would hit and kick his daughter. Video footage of a number of arrests outside the campus showed police officers beating detained students.  Mr. Ho was so distraught on the first night that he joined three parents in a wild rescue bid. The group scaled a high chain-link fence to get onto campus, but abandoned their attempt after one was shot by the police with a beanbag round and tumbled into the bushes.  Being close to the action changed Mr. Ho’s thinking on the petrol bombs that protesters were hurling toward riot officers. “The Molotov cocktails they throw are mainly to create a distance from the police,” he said. Mr. Ho was one of a few hundred parents, many with students inside, who sat near police lines wearing masks and holding signs with messages like “Save the kids, don’t kill our children” and “They are children of God! Let them go!” Many said they had come out simply to be close to their children inside the campus, just hundreds of feet away.  At a news conference they held on Tuesday, the parents made pleas to the Hong Kong authorities, questioning the uncompromising language that has become standard in the city’s political impasse.  Several criticized the authorities for having labeled everyone on campus as rioters. For months, Hong Kong’s police and government, along with China’s state news media, have used the term “rioter” to describe protesters, whether peaceful or violent. “Why should all the students inside be charged with rioting no matter what role they played? What kind of logic is this?” said Chu Chan, a 50-year-old warehouse worker. Her son had remained on campus because he feared a rioting charge that can carry a 10-year prison sentence. As of Tuesday afternoon, he was still on campus. Ms. Chan said her son was studying to be a social worker and cared about others.  “When I heard he was inside PolyU, I began shivering,” she said. “I started to blame him, but then I remembered that he was probably feeling more helpless than me inside. I cannot condemn him.” For the parents, potential incarceration of their children is just one concern. Food supplies ran low during the days-long deadlock, cellphone signals were intermittent and the water supply was eventually cut off.  On Sunday evening, the police warned that they could use live rounds against the protesters. Students inside said that food and supplies were inadequate and that they were without medical care after first-aid workers were arrested. During a police raid on Monday morning, explosions and shots boomed off buildings.  Then came the escape attempts. Some students glided down ropes off bridges and jumped onto the backs of waiting motorcycles. Others made futile charges through plumes of tear gas in an attempt to break through cordons of armed riot police officers. Dozens took to the sewers in a subterranean dash for freedom but turned back, sickened by the fetid dankness.  Rescuers said that at least 200 protesters in all had managed to escape. Around 70 were sent to the hospital for hypothermia and dizziness after their failed sewer gambit.  In total, the police said 1,100 had been arrested or registered among a group of secondary school students who were allowed to leave early Tuesday morning. Mr. Ho’s daughter was among that group. Later Tuesday, a pro-democracy lawmaker, Ted Hui, led most of the remainder of the students peacefully off campus to be arrested. By evening,  about 50 remained.  The parents’ fears struck a nerve for a movement that has made heavy use of family analogies. Volunteer drivers who speed protesters away from the police and ferry them around the city are often called “parents” and refer to their activities as “picking up the kids.” Family support networks, rarely evident during street clashes, keep protesters — many of whom are young students — supplied with food, water and even gas masks. The protests also have caused familial strife.  Eva Lau, a 51-year-old businesswoman, said that while she had attended peaceful marches, she disagreed with her 22-year-old son over his attendance at protests that descend into violence and vandalism. On Sunday evening, as fiery clashes between protesters and the police at PolyU escalated, her son said he wanted to attend the pro-peace prayer meeting at the school. When she tried to dissuade him, she said, he told her that “if everyone thought like you, then no one would be left to protest anymore.” A native of Hunan Province in mainland China who came to Hong Kong in the mid-1980s, Ms. Lau said that she was skeptical of both ends of the political spectrum in the city, but that she had come to favor the pro-democratic camp.  She also told of a recent encounter of her own with the police. As she walked past a street clash one night, officers shined their flashlights at her, an act that prompted her to yell at them, “I used to have a great deal of respect for you, but now I have firsthand reason not to.” For her son, Ms. Lau said she hoped he would learn that there are better ways to fight injustice. Still, she said she had been thinking of rejoining the protests.  “I am against all violence, even from the kids,” she said. “But now I can see that they are being strategic in order to fight authoritarianism — and trying to resist the government.” Katherine Li contributed reporting.']",The parents of young people under siege at a university emerged as a call for compromise. 
"Dozens of Babies Died Because of U.K. Hospital Failings, Report Finds",2019-11-21,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — Dozens of babies and three mothers died at hospitals in England over four decades because of major staff failings, in what experts said could become the biggest maternity scandal in the history of Britain’s National Health Service. The problems at the facilities that make up the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust from 1979 to 2017 resulted in dozens of stillbirths as well as the deaths of newborns and women who had just given birth, an independent investigation ordered by the government in 2017 has found. It also cited more than 50 cases of injury. The findings were summarized in an interim report first disclosed by The Independent and seen by The New York Times. It identifies hundreds of cases of repeated failings and clinical errors by doctors, midwives and hospital bosses, as well as a lack of transparency and honesty.  A senior official at the National Health Service called the findings a major and disturbing scandal. More and more people are coming forward by the day, he said, adding that the problems may well extend beyond the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. In one case at Shrewsbury and Telford, a baby suffered a brain injury at birth because the medical staff monitored the wrong heartbeat and thus missed signs of distress, the report said. In another, the hospital failed to notify a mother that her baby’s body had been returned from a post-mortem examination, and then advised her not to look at the body because it had decomposed during the delay, it said.  The report, written by a midwife, Donna Ockenden, warns that even now hospital staff members have not absorbed the lessons of their past failings. “The number of cases we are now being requested to review seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort,” the report says. “It will take time, confidence and considerable and meaningful staff effort from ‘Ward to Board’ to change this, and it will require strong leadership and the support and receptiveness of senior managers.” The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust said that it had not been made aware of the interim report, but that it had already made improvements to its maternity service. “On behalf of the trust, I apologize unreservedly to the families who have been affected,” said Paula Clark, the interim chief executive of the Trust.  Ms. Clark said: “I would like to reassure all families using our maternity services that we have not been waiting for Donna Ockenden’s final report before working to improve our services. A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases.” The inquiry into the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was prompted by a campaign by a couple demanding answers about the death of their first child in 2009. In an interview, the mother, Rhiannon Davies, said the scope of the failings revealed in the report was “horrific” but not surprising. “Exposing these details has been our reality for the past decade,” she said, “but yet we have been treated like we are guilty of something, whereas the midwives and hospital staff have been treated like the victims.” Ms. Davies was skeptical about claims that conditions had already improved. “They keep saying that lessons are being learned, but we keep getting confronted with the same abuses,” she said. “Why should we believe that anything will change now?” Ms. Davies’s daughter died after midwives at Ludlow Hospital failed to identify signs that the newborn was in critical condition and left her alone in a crib, she said. The child was airlifted to another hospital but died six hours after birth. The hospital also failed to classify Ms. Davies’s pregnancy as high-risk, even though she had a series of serious medical problems and was in and out of the hospital for two weeks before giving birth, she said.  In their decade-long battle for an investigation into their daughter’s death, Ms. Davies and her husband, Richard Stanton, had to threaten a judicial review of the hospital’s investigation of the death before they were granted an inquest, she said.  In 2013, that investigation by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which examines unresolved complaints against the government and the National Health Service, concluded that the child had died as a result of serious failings in care and that her death could have been avoided. Today, more than 600 cases of possible malpractice in the maternity wards of the Shrewsbury and Telford Trust are being investigated as more families come forward. The N.H.S. is carrying out a parallel investigation into the Trust. The West Mercia Police, which has jurisdiction over the trust, said it would wait for the findings of the independent inquiry before considering any criminal proceedings. “I feel like I’ve been pushing this huge boulder that could roll back and crush me at any point,” Ms. Davies said, “and indeed it has, many times. But now maybe, just maybe, it has some momentum and can roll without me.”']",
Retirement Home Told a Nun She Couldn’t Wear Religious Attire,2019-11-21,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — A Catholic nun who was told she could stay in a retirement home in France only if she stopped wearing religious clothing was wronged, French officials say, in a case that they say misinterpreted the country’s laws prohibiting religious attire in some public spaces. The nun, who is over 70 and has not been publicly identified, had been living in a convent in southeastern France when she decided to retire in Haute-Saône, her native region farther north.  Her application to live in a unit in a publicly funded retirement home in Vesoul, a town about 55 miles northeast of Dijon, was accepted in July. But the home, which is run by the local authorities, specified that she would have to accommodate the other residents by not wearing her religious habit or veil.  In a letter sent to the nun, and seen this week by the news outlet Agence France-Presse, the retirement home told her that “all ostentatious signs of belonging to a religious community cannot be accepted in order to guarantee everyone’s serenity.”  “Religion is a private matter and must remain so,” the letter said.  The nun did not agree to go without her habit, and the local parish helped her rent a private apartment instead. Officials now say that the retirement home wrongly applied France’s secularism laws, and Alain Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, apologized in a statement on Tuesday.  “This error of judgment is very regrettable,” Mr. Chrétien said, adding that he was “personally” committed to finding the nun a spot in a public retirement home if she so wished. France has faced numerous heated debates over the place of religion in society in recent years, centered on the concept of laïcité, a policy of state secularism that first emerged during the French Revolution and took form in the 19th century, culminating in a landmark 1905 law on the separation of church and state.  A cultural aversion to public expressions of all faiths still holds strong, but in recent years, it has focused on Muslim attire, especially women wearing head scarves. Recently, a local politician asked a Muslim mother on a school trip in Dijon to remove her hijab, igniting weeks of vitriolic nationwide debate.  The nun’s case had gone unnoticed until this week, when the Rev. Florent Belin, the parish priest in Vesoul, mentioned her in his monthly newsletter, lamenting that she had been forced to find her own apartment.  “People harp on with principles of laïcité that are not understood,” Father Belin wrote. “Old demons, mismanaged fears are blocking situations.” This week, Claude Ferry, the head of the public organization that manages the retirement home, told France Bleu, a network of local radio stations, that the nun had declined the spot in the home because she “did not want to accept the rules, which are the same for everyone.”  But French officials say those rules are a misguided use of France’s national policy.  Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that helps the government enforce laïcité, said that France’s religious neutrality restrictions applied only to state employees and other public servants on the job, not to the general public.  Mr. Cadène said in a telephone interview that the nun’s case was “the very demonstration” of a “wrong interpretation of laïcité.” “Under the rule of law, you don’t ban something because it displeases this or that individual. You only ban it if it is objectively disturbing public order,” he said. “And that is obviously not the case when you have simple citizens who are wearing religious attire and who don’t represent any public administrations.”  Mr. Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, said in an interview published by the magazine Le Point on Wednesday that the retirement home’s staff had committed a “big blunder” but that state employees were sometimes “paralyzed” when dealing with the “inflammable” issue of secularism.  “The topic is not consensual, because everyone has their own definition,” he said.  For Mr. Cadène, that is partly because debates over Muslims in France have led to a “great confusion” about secularism laws and have shifted public discourse toward a stricter understanding of laïcité.  “By constantly trying to extend neutrality, first by targeting a specific religion, it always winds up extending to other religions and beliefs,” he said. “It’s a real danger.”']",Officials apologized and said the case was an incorrect interpretation of France’s secularism law.
U.K. Conservative Party Scolded for Rebranding Twitter Account,2019-11-20,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The governing Conservative Party in Britain was criticized by Twitter on Wednesday for “attempts to mislead people” after it temporarily changed the name of one of its accounts on the social media site to “factcheckUK.” The name change was made during the first election debate on Tuesday between the Conservative leader, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. Truth and trust were at the forefront of the debate — and have been a focal point of the campaign so far. The election is set for Dec. 12.  At one point during the televised debate, the moderator, Julie Etchingham, asked, “Does the truth matter in this election?” “I think it does,” Mr. Johnson replied. The audience burst out laughing.  The Conservatives’ verified account was originally named CCHQPress, for Conservative Campaign Headquarters.  Under the new name, the account minimized references to its political allegiances, swapped out a photograph of Mr. Johnson from its cover, and used a white check mark in a magenta circle as a profile picture. It also offered what was described as a “breaking factcheck.” The account was described as “Fact checking Labour from CCHQ.” After the debate ended, the account reverted to its original name and appearance. Twitter said in a statement on Wednesday that the move had been an effort “to mislead people.” “Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information — in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate — will result in decisive corrective action,” the social media site added in an email. Twitter, which announced a ban on political ads last month, said it was “committed to facilitating healthy debate” during the British election campaign. The debate was the first major head-to-head between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corbyn, and a major opportunity for the rival leaders to lay out policies — not least their approach to Britain’s efforts to leave the European Union.  During the debate, the renamed Conservative account posted tweets claiming to debunk Mr. Corbyn’s statements as well as tweets commenting favorably about Mr. Johnson’s performance. It framed the prime minister’s statements and his party’s claims as “facts.” The name change was noted on Twitter during the debate, and attracted widespread opprobrium.  Full Fact, a fact-checking charity, said the temporary rebrand was “inappropriate and misleading” and urged voters not to mistake the account for an independent organization.  The Electoral Commission in Britain said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that voters were “entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners” before an election. The organization called on all involved to “undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency.” The Labour Party, in a Twitter post, called the name change “a laughable attempt to dupe those watching” the debate.  Other opposition politicians were similarly indignant. “This is straight out of Donald Trump or Putin’s playbook,” Tom Brake, a member of parliament for the Liberal Democrats, said on Wednesday. “People know they can’t trust a word that Boris Johnson or the Conservatives say.” Before the 2016 referendum on whether to exit the European Union, the Leave campaign — of which Mr. Johnson was a leading figure — was accused of lies and misinformation about Britain’s prospects after any withdrawal. James Cleverly, the Conservative Party chairman, defended the renaming of the Twitter account. He said in a post-debate interview that he was “absolutely comfortable” with the party’s digital team challenging the Labour Party’s claims. Mr. Cleverly said that the Twitter handle of the account had remained @CCHQpress and that the name clarified “the nature of the site.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and Conservative lawmaker, also defended the party’s actions.  “We were standing up,” he told Sky News on Wednesday. “Jeremy Corbyn could not answer the basic questions on Brexit nine times.” The Conservative Party’s social media strategy has drawn criticism before.  The party drew scrutiny this month when an altered clip was posted of a televised interview with Keir Starmer, Labour’s spokesman on Brexit, that made it appear as though Mr. Starmer had hesitated to answer a question on his party’s position on the withdrawal. But in the original live interview, Mr. Starmer had given a lengthy response to the question.

"U.S. Offers North Korea ‘Act of Good Will.’ Not Enough, North Says.",2019-11-19,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Tuesday that the United States’ decision to postpone a joint military drill with South Korea was not enough of an incentive for it to return to the negotiating table, and that it would not discuss denuclearization until Washington ended its “hostile policy.” On Sunday, the United States defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, and his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, together announced\u200b  that the allies would postpone a joint air force drill scheduled for later this month. They described it as “an act of good will” aimed at bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table. But the North remained unsatisfied. “We demand that the U.S. quit the drill or stop it once and for all,” Kim Yong-chol, chairman of the North’s Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency on Tuesday. “The suspension of the drill does not mean ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and is not helpful to the diplomatic efforts for the settlement of issues.” Mr. Kim said\u200b, “The U.S. should not dream of the negotiations for denuclearization before dropping its hostile policy” toward the North. North Korea’s demand that Washington first build confidence and remove all threats to its “security and development” before nuclear talks can resume is a harder position than the country has taken so far. In its talks with North Korea, the Trump administration at first demanded that the North dismantle all its nuclear warheads and production facilities before international sanctions against it are lifted. After that approach failed, Washington began trying to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table\u200b by suggesting that it can discuss steps aimed at improving ties and building trust with the North together with the denuclearization of the country. \u200bNorth Korea met with American negotiators in Stockholm early last month to test the new approach, but the meeting ended in just hours without producing an agreement, \u200beven \u200bon when to meet again. The \u200bNorth Korean \u200bstatement \u200bon Tuesday \u200bwas \u200b\u200ba pointed rebuff of President Trump, although it did not mention him by name. In a Twitter post on Sunday, Mr. Trump urged North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to “act quickly, get the deal done,” and hinted that the two leaders might be able to hold another summit meeting. “I am the only one who can get you where you have to be,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding, “See you soon!” But on Tuesday, North Korea \u200baccused the United States of merely trying to buy time, though its leader has given Washington until the end of the year to propose a solution that can satisfy the North. \u200b  Time, the North said in the statement, is on its side. \u200b “We have nothing pressing and have no intention to sit on the table with the tricky U.S.,” it said. In recent \u200bweeks, North Korea has \u200b\u200bissued a series of statements\u200b, as well as conducting numerous missile and rocket tests, to put pressure on Washington as American negotiators worked to bring the country back to \u200bnegotiations. On Sunday, its Foreign Ministry said North Korea had “no willingness to meet” the United States\u200b because it recently passed a resolution against human rights abuses in the North through the United Nations. On Monday, Kim Kye-gwan, adviser to the North’s Foreign Ministry, responded to Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Sunday by \u200bsuggesting that the American leader has been negotiating in bad faith. He said North Korea had offered a lot, like its suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests, in return \u200bfor three summit meetings with \u200bMr. Trump. The Trump administration, he said, has given the North little, as Mr. Trump repeatedly boasts of progress in reducing the threats of North Korea. “We are no longer interested in such talks that bring nothing to us,” Kim Kye-gwan said. “As we have got nothing in return, we will no longer gift the U.S. president with something he can boast of, but get compensation for the successes that President Trump is proud of as his administrative achievements.” Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit meeting in June last year in Singapore, signing a broadly worded agreement for North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. But when the two leaders met again in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, and again on the inter-Korean border in June, they failed to agree on how to put the Singapore deal into effect.']",A canceled military drill was not enough to get the North Koreans back to the table to discuss denuclearization.
"First Comes Snapchat, Then the Bachelor and Spinster Ball",2019-11-19,By Damien Cave and Matthew Abbott,"['ARIAH PARK, Australia — They called it a wet T-shirt contest, but there were no winners or losers. Not many shirts, either.  One man wore nothing but a tool belt, which no one seemed to mind even as the wettest and drunkest of the young and rural Australians — both women and men — tackled each other in the thick red mud, before arising for hugs.  Two hours later, they appeared transformed: black ties for the men, dresses for the women. The Ariah Park Bachelor and Spinster Ball had officially begun. After all, 1,500 people didn’t drive forever to this tiny town (population 493) just for giggles. They were searching for love. “Yes, we’re here to meet people,” said Emme Williams, 22, a veterinary student who walked the fairgrounds in denim shorts with a few girlfriends before arriving at the ball wearing white. “I prefer the ones that don’t yell at you, the ones who want to have a conversation.” In cities, courtship has become efficient to excess. Tinder and other apps can bring intimacy faster than food delivery. But for people trying to meet and mate across Australia’s vast distances, it takes more planning and patience.  Bachelor and Spinster balls — or B&S balls, a fixture in the country since the 1880s, with about 30 each year — aim to help. And they are increasingly the catalyst for a matchmaking hybrid that combines the digital with the raw, communal and real.  The interaction starts online, with friends posting photos and descriptions of their friends in a singles Facebook group before each ball; Ms. Williams was featured scantily clad except for the wool of a freshly shorn sheep. The lucky ones move on to flirting via Snapchat. But then real-life socializing takes over. All weekend in Ariah Park, which is about a five-hour drive west of Sydney, phones largely remained out of sight so eager was everyone for eye-to-eye contact. “You’re limited to three single boys in your town, and you’re related to two of them,” said Ebony Worland, 25, one of the ball’s organizers. “These were built for single women and men to find love in the country, really.” Her own sister, Shelby Worland, 18, found a boyfriend at last year’s ball. Selling tickets this year — about $100 for food, booze and live music, plus a goody bag that included a condom — she explained that her path to coupledom began when someone named Lleyton Neven, a friend of friends, started messaging her on Snapchat.  He lived about an hour away and after he arrived in Ariah Park on Friday, when most ball-goers show up, he found an excuse to seek her out. “I didn’t know how to actually meet, so I said my phone was dead and I asked if she could charge it,” Mr. Neven said. “And now here we are!” Wobbly with beer and affection, he kissed his beloved on the cheek. “One year together!” Not all stories from the balls end so happily.  Just ask Rippy, a.k.a. Shane Anthony Williams (no relation to Ms. Williams). He’s the unofficial photographer of the B&S scene, a railroad worker with a shaved head and gray goatee who has been snapping pictures for no charge since 2009. On his Akubra hat (made famous outside Australia by Crocodile Dundee), he carries cattle tags imprinted with the names and dates of B&S balls, along with others marking specific memories. One commemorates a ball regular named Ezra who died at 19 in a car accident; another recalls a woman he knew from the balls who jumped to her death from a cliff with her 2-year-old child. “It’s hard finding love,” Rippy said, noting that his wife of 30 years was somewhere nearby. “I’d hate to be single again. It’s scary, dead set.” But that’s why the balls matter, he added. Along with the awkward singles, the free-flowing beer and the backfiring pickup trucks known as utes, turned on and off to create fiery explosions called key bangs, there are people who connected at balls and come back to socialize.  “Who here is a couple?” Rippy yelled, meandering through the crowd.  Within a minute, Jess and Matt Chown emerged. He works on sheep farms; she works at an aged-care home for veterans. “We met at a ball in 2011,” Ms. Chown said. “I laid eyes on him and it was love at first sight.” “You know why I come? To do things I can’t do in church,” Mr. Chown said. Standing at least 6-foot-3 and wider than a tree cut for timber, he kicked a trash bin, making a loud clang. Everyone laughed, including his wife.  Ms. Chown, 30, noted that they were all part of a group, “the Rummed-up Rednecks,” that convenes on Facebook and at balls. “It’s a way for us to let out our frustrations,” she said. Nearby, Ms. Williams, the veterinary student, scanned the crowd for a bachelor. After a man offering her flowers moved on, one of her friends, Stephanie Papulia, 22, pointed to a guy in an expensive new ute. “He’s got a Land Cruiser and a mullet,” Ms. Papulia said. “Ticks both boxes.” Ms. Williams pointed to another ute with large antennas. “The bigger the aerial,” she said, “the more he’s overcompensating.” Most of the men in Ariah Park were more “chivalrous,” they said, than their behavior might suggest. But some of the balls in other towns have been dangerous.  In 2017, two men were convicted of raping a woman at a ball in another state. Another man was sentenced to 18 months in prison last year for sexually assaulting two women at the Eel Skinners and Duck Pluckers B&S. In Ariah Park, security staff members walked the fairgrounds continuously.  At the ball, held under the stars after dark, the main problem seemed to be food dye. No one could explain why, but for years, attendees have felt compelled to spit dye onto each other.  The rules against bringing it in were generally ignored. Every few minutes, someone was hauled off after being caught with dye. Glitter, though, was allowed. It floated in the breeze, destined to stay in mullets forever.  And as was the case all day, the ball itself captured the silly, lonely and romantic.  The first band to perform, Whiskey Business, set the tone, playing upbeat country songs about love and traditional living.  Near the center of the stage, men bounced to the music. At one point, Ms. Williams squeezed toward the front, pulling a girlfriend by the hand. Many of the men seemed awkward. Some of the women chose to be bold. “Are you taken?” they asked their intendeds. But near the edges, there was more tenderness, as if the phases of courtship were rippling out in concentric rings.  There, stage right and near the back, a woman in a green lace dress danced with her bearded partner, swaying slowly at half the beat of the music. She leaned forward. Something he said made her laugh.  “I love you,” she told him, staring into his eyes. “I love you.” ']","In the cities, technology has transformed social life.

"After 2 Elections and 3 Tries, Israel Is No Closer to Forming a New Government",2019-11-20,By Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger,"['After two deadlocked elections and three failed attempts at forming a government, Israel’s yearlong political paralysis was no closer to a cure on Wednesday, as Benny Gantz, the centrist military leader who had tried to dislodge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from power, angrily admitted he had not succeeded. Mr. Gantz’s acknowledgment hours before a midnight deadline propelled a deeply divided Israel into a new, uncharted phase of political chaos and increased the likelihood that the country would be forced to hold a third election. As if that were not enough for Israelis to digest, there were reports Wednesday night that Mr. Netanyahu could be indicted on long-expected corruption charges as soon as Thursday, and that Israeli security officials were bracing for an escalation along the northern border after an Israeli airstrike against Iranian forces near Damascus killed at least 21 people.  Mr. Gantz, of the Blue and White party, named for the national colors, informed Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, that he was returning the mandate to form a government, and then delivered a lengthy denunciation of Mr. Netanyahu in a televised news conference. Directly addressing the prime minister repeatedly, Mr. Gantz lambasted Mr. Netanyahu for insisting on maintaining his “extremist” right-wing, ultrareligious bloc instead of trying to build a unity government from the center. And he accused Mr. Netanyahu of trying to foment a “civil war” by scapegoating Arab lawmakers. “I will not cooperate with an effort to turn the majority of the people to a hostage being held by a small group of extremists,” Mr. Gantz said. “I will not be prepared to impose a radical agenda on the majority of the people who have chosen differently. And I will not accept the delegitimacy of any part of the Israeli public.” Both Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu sought to disavow responsibility for pushing the country toward a third election which, financially, will cost Israel more than $750 million, equal to about a third of its current budget deficit, as well as the economic loss of giving the country a day off.  “I was prepared to make radical concessions in order to form a stable and unified government,” Mr. Gantz said. “If you had only known the depth of this willingness, some of you might be angry with me. But the good of Israel comes first, above any other consideration.” For his part, Mr. Netanyahu, in a video posted on Twitter, insisted that he was “willing without preconditions to enter immediate discussions with you, even tonight, to form a unity government.” But he insisted that Mr. Gantz’s failure was his alone, and accused him of having been willing even to align with Arab lawmakers, whom Mr. Netanyahu called “terror supporters.” Israel has been stuck in political limbo since April, when the first of two inconclusive elections was held. The second took place in September.  In both elections, Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu emerged neck and neck, each falling well short of a majority. Each was given a chance to assemble a majority coalition and failed. At this point, there is no presumption that a third vote would produce a significantly different outcome. The charge of forming a government now goes to Israel’s Parliament, which will have 21 days to come up with a candidate — any candidate, including Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Gantz — who could command a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat house.  Mr. Gantz called that period “21 vital days in which Israeli democracy will be put to its greatest test.” He urged Mr. Netanyahu to put self-interest aside. “Netanyahu, this country is not your own,” he said. “This country is not my own. This country belongs to its citizens. Liberate this country from your chokehold and come in to negotiate directly, now.” If that final stage, which Israel is entering for the first time in its history, also fails to produce a government, Parliament would be dissolved and Israel would start preparing for its next election, most likely in the spring. Both Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and leader of the conservative Likud, and Mr. Gantz, a centrist and relative political newcomer, have said they wanted to join forces in a broad government of national unity based on their two large parties.  But they have failed to agree on a power-sharing arrangement.  The negotiations have been complicated by, among other things, Mr. Netanyahu’s legal situation. He is facing possible indictment in three graft cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.  Mr. Gantz has said he would join a unity government with Likud, but that he would not serve under a prime minister facing indictment. Likud has insisted that Mr. Netanyahu is its leader and has refused to entertain the idea of a governing coalition without him at the helm. Recent talks have focused on a deal in which the two men would rotate the premiership, but they could not agree on the terms. Mr. Gantz’s only other option for forming a government was doomed earlier Wednesday. There had been speculation that he could form a narrow, minority government without Mr. Netanyahu and his right-wing and ultra-Orthodox allies. Such a coalition would have required the support of Arab parties and Avigdor Liberman’s ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party.  On Wednesday, Mr. Liberman ruled out any prospect of going along with that plan. At a news conference, he described the Arab politicians as an anti-Zionist “fifth column.”  A former coalition partner of Mr. Netanyahu’s, Mr. Liberman also rejected returning to a narrow government with Mr. Netanyahu and his ultra-Orthodox allies, describing them, too, as increasingly anti-Zionist. The first election, in April, gave Mr. Netanyahu an advantage, but he failed to assemble a majority coalition, prompting a second election. In the September election, Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party won 33 seats, edging ahead of Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud, which won 32. But Mr. Netanyahu secured the endorsements of 55 right-wing and religious members of Parliament for the premiership, one more than Mr. Gantz did, and he was given the first chance to try to form a government. When he failed, Mr. Gantz was then given four weeks to try. A major sticking point in the negotiations for a unity coalition was Mr. Netanyahu’s insistence that he go first as prime minister under any rotation agreement.  Taking the leadership role first was important to Mr. Netanyahu because if he held any post lower than prime minister, he would have to resign immediately if indicted. As prime minister, current Israeli law would allow him to remain in office until a final court verdict, after appeals have been exhausted, a process that could take years.  That was a non-starter for most of the Blue and White leadership. The party had repeatedly pledged to its voters not to serve in a government under a prime minister facing a serious indictment. In addition, Mr. Netanyahu insisted on bringing his entire right-wing, religious bloc of 55 members of Parliament into any coalition, over Blue and White’s vehement objections. The talks for a unity government meant to heal national rifts took place in an atmosphere of unfettered divisiveness. Mr. Netanyahu accused Mr. Gantz of having plotted all along to form a narrow government with the support of Arab members of Parliament, and described such a government as “dangerous for Israel.” Netanyahu critics denounced the prime minister’s rhetoric as racist, saying it incited violence.

Blind Student’s Violent Treatment at Oxford Debate Prompts Resignations,2019-11-19,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The Oxford Union, a prestigious, nearly 200-year-old British debating society that counts several high-profile politicians among its alumni, has come under fire for the violent treatment of a blind student from Ghana who witnesses say was forcibly expelled from a packed event hall. The incident has ignited outrage around the country, provoking a wave of resignations from the society and drawing scrutiny of the elite, predominately white organization, especially as videos have spread online showing the student, Ebenezer Azamati, struggling with a security guard who forcefully tried to pry him off a bench.  The society’s president, Brendan McGrath, stepped down under growing pressure late Tuesday, saying that he apologized “profusely and unqualifiedly.” In his resignation letter, he added, “Fundamentally, it is the president’s job to ensure that every member feels welcome at the Oxford Union. This is a goal I have manifestly failed to reach.” At least eight other society members resigned this week, including several in leadership roles. Mr. Azamati, a 25-year-old postgraduate student at Oxford University who is a member of the union, said in a phone interview that he was traumatized by the event, which took place on Oct. 17, and that he was considering legal action. “I never expected anything like that could happen to me in Britain, let alone Oxford,” he said. “I still feel threatened.”  He added that the encounter “keeps playing on my mind.”  The Oxford Union is a private society, independent of Oxford University, though most of its members are current or past students.  In an email, the union said, “We are in ongoing discussions with Mr. Azamati in order to pursue a solution agreeable to all parties, which addresses the structural issues raised; we do not wish to prejudice those discussions with further comment at this time.” Mr. Azamati, who was born blind, went to the hall early on Oct. 17 to reserve a seat before the start of the debate, according to accounts from other attendees published in The Oxford Student, a university newspaper.  He left the hall, and when he returned to take his seat before the debate began, he was told that the room was full. He eventually went back inside and sat down in a seat offered by someone, but he was followed by a security guard. An argument ensued. One video of the encounter shows two men grappling with Mr. Azamati as they try to remove him from his seat. Mr. Azamati is seen clinging to the bench, one hand clasping his union membership card.  Harry Hatwell, a 21-year-old law student at the university, saw the episode from a balcony and said it escalated quickly.  “He literally dragged him by the ankles,” Mr. Hatwell said in an interview, describing the encounter between the security guard and Mr. Azamati, which was only partially captured in the video. Mr. Hatwell said Mr. Azamati eventually walked out of the room. Mr. Azamati, who studies international relations at St. John’s College, part of Oxford University, was hesitant to describe the episode in detail but said it came as a shock. “I don’t know how I walked back to my room,” he said. He described suddenly waking from sleep that night, gasping for air. “I was just shaking.” But days after the altercation, Mr. McGrath, the union president, said that it was Mr. Azamati who had been violent. When Mr. Azamati’s union membership was then withdrawn for two university terms, news of the incident spread and student groups began lining up behind him.  The Oxford University Africa Society condemned his treatment, calling it “violent, unjust, inhumane and shameful,” and organized a protest on Friday. By Monday evening, Jeremy Bararia, the only black member of the union’s governing body, stepped down and called on Mr. McGrath to resign. “I feel that not only as a person of color and African, but as an individual with a sense of morality, I can no longer remain within an institution such as this, so long as you remain in office,” Mr. Bararia said.  Oxford University also condemned the incident and said Monday that it offered its “full sympathy and support” to Mr. Azamati. “The university is writing to the union, pressing hard for answers on how it intends to make amends to Mr. Azamati and what further steps it will take to avoid such an incident being repeated,” Stephen Rouse, a spokesman for the university, said in an email.  The union reinstated Mr. Azamati’s membership after Mr. McGrath dropped his accusation over the weekend. But some union members said that did not go far enough. Mr. Hatwell, who is also a member of the union, said that some members had planned to put forward an impeachment motion against Mr. McGrath, an effort his resignation made the moot. Mr. Hatwell said it was important to show that the union, whose former members include Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other prominent politicians, was accountable. “Boris Johnson used to be president of the union,” he said. “If you ever hold this position for some reason, for better or for worse, matters in British political life, and we need to show that actually what you do, your response to something like this actually matters.” Mr. Hatwell called the guard’s actions “disproportionate” and said that no one from the debate committee or the audience intervened. Mr. Azamati said that he may pursue legal action against the union because he feels something larger than him is at stake. He said that he and his lawyer had sent a letter to the union, “making our legal claims and demands.”  He added that he hopes his case will highlight the need for every society at Oxford and in the broader community to be “accessible to everyone.” Even before the incident, he said, his needs were not taken into account, despite the hefty fee associated with his union membership. For example, he found it distressing as a blind person to have to “compete” for a seat.  “My wish is that society will not be fair only to the able,” he said. “It will not be fair only to a specific section of society.”']","Ebenezer Azamati, a postgraduate student from Ghana, was violently removed from an event at the Oxford Union, a prominent British debating society."
"Trudeau Won the Election, but Hasn’t Won Over Western Canada",2019-11-20,By Ian Austen,"['LONGVIEW, Alberta — Justin Trudeau, beginning his second term as Canada’s prime minister, unveiled his new cabinet in Ottawa on Wednesday. Thousands of miles away, in the western Canadian province of Alberta, John Scott, a rancher, had a few words of advice for him.  “Trudeau hates us, but he’s going to have to learn that he’s going to have to deal with us,” Mr. Scott said last week, bouncing around his land in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in a sport-utility vehicle. Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party won enough seats in the Canadian Parliament to hang on to power with the support of other left-of-center parties. But it did not win the popular vote. The vast prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan voted overwhelmingly for its main opponent, the Conservative Party.  Mr. Trudeau found himself without any Liberals from the two oil-producing provinces when he appointed his new cabinet. It’s a reflection of the strong distaste that this part of Canada has for the prime minister and his party — and the challenges that will present as he tries to unify a country increasingly fractured by region. The bad feelings in the western part of the country are mostly animated by a perception that Mr. Trudeau is undermining the oil and gas industry, the economic lifeblood of the west. There is also a sense that he is unwilling to help the provinces as they are going through a period of economic pain. “For most Albertans, much of this revolves around a basic hostility on the part of the Trudeau government to our energy sector,” said Jason Kenney, a former federal Conservative cabinet minister who became Alberta’s premier earlier this year.  In a bid to reach out to the West, Mr. Trudeau named Chrystia Freeland, his former foreign minister, to handle relations with the provinces, and gave her the largely ceremonial title of deputy prime minister.  Ms. Freeland grew up in part on a farm in Alberta although she now represents a downtown Toronto electoral district and has spent most of her adult life in Europe and the United States. Mr. Trudeau also named Jim Carr, a former cabinet minister from the prairie province of Manitoba, as an adviser on western provinces. Mr. Kenney, the Alberta premier, has become the most prominent political critic of Mr. Trudeau since the election. He relentlessly attacks the prime minister in interviews, and has spent 30 million Canadian dollars, or about $22.7 million, on a push to respond to critics of Alberta’s oil industry and the oil sands, which many environmental groups argue is an exceptionally polluting energy source. While Mr. Trudeau rejects Mr. Kenney’s position that his policies are undermining Alberta’s oil and gas industry, the sector is unquestionably at the heart of anti-Trudeau sentiment in the west.  More than a year before Mr. Trudeau first took office in November 2015, global oil prices collapsed. The price most commonly paid for Alberta oil has been stuck at half or less of its most recent peak of $86.56, back in July 2014.  The province has gone from begging for workers to take high-paying jobs, particularly in the oil sands, to an unemployment rate higher than the national average. Its budget has been hit by falling tax revenues as well as decreased royalty payments from oil and gas companies. But Mr. Trudeau has taken some extraordinary steps to help mitigate these problems.  Last year, he spent 4.5 billion Canadian dollars to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, which links landlocked oil sands with a port farther west near Vancouver, British Columbia. He is now spending billions more to increase its capacity, a plan opposed by British Columbia’s government. The project has been bogged down by legal challenges, particularly ones from Indigenous groups in British Columbia. That has led many Albertans, including Mr. Scott, the rancher, to speculate about the prime minister’s motives. “Trudeau bought the pipeline so he can stall everything — that’s my own personal opinion,” said Mr. Scott, whose ranch with its breathtaking views of the Rockies doubles as a location for feature film making, and supplies filmmakers with horses, buffalo, cattle and other animals.  “And that’s what’s killing us right now,” he said. “We’ve got a great product but where are we’re going to sell it if we can’t get it out of here?” There is also a sense within Alberta that the rest of the country is unwilling to help out the province during its current troubles. Gary Mar, a former Conservative cabinet minister in Alberta who is now the president of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, keeps the blinds drawn in his downtown Calgary office to shield his view of swathes of empty space in neighboring buildings. He estimates that the province of 4.4 million people has lost about 100,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry over the last four years, something that, he says, the prime minister has not sufficiently recognized.  “That is, in part, what fuels the sense of anger,” he said.  Eleanore Catenaro, Mr. Trudeau’s press secretary, said the government was “determined to see the Trans Mountain Expansion project completed,” noting that despite the court challenges, work has already begun. She also pointed out that the government was supporting four pipeline projects other than Trans Mountain involving Alberta and Saskatchewan. “These projects demonstrate our support of Canada’s energy industry and its workers,” she said. To some extent, the discontent with Mr. Trudeau is an offshoot of structures in the Canadian government that predate him.  The way federal tax revenues are distributed, for example, has long rankled people in the west. Even with oil industry in a slump, Alberta provides a disproportionately large chunk of the federal government’s revenues. But to make sure that Canadians have roughly the same level of basic services in areas like health care and education, the federal government helps provinces with weaker economies.  This year Alberta will get no help from the federal government because comparatively its economy remains strong, even though Mr. Kenney has cut spending to make up for lost income from the oil downturn. But Quebec just posted a budget surplus of 4.8 billion Canadian dollars after receiving 13 billion dollars from the federal government.  On top of that, Mr. Kenney said that changes to environmental review laws introduced, but not passed, by Mr. Trudeau’s government before the election will cripple the oil and gas industry. And Mr. Trudeau will impose a federal carbon tax that includes consumers in the province at the beginning of next year. “You’ve got at least two provinces who have made a hugely oversized contribution to the federation, to prosperity, to fiscal balances,” Mr. Kenney said, referring to Alberta and Saskatchewan, “that are feeling increasingly like they’re not at home in their own country.” This sentiment, Mr. Kenney said, explains the so-called Wexit movement, a push for Alberta and Saskatchewan to break away from the rest of Canada.  “A lot of people brandish this threat because they think it will maximize leverage,” he said, comparing it to Quebec’s history of pushing for separatism.  But it seems more talk than a serious political movement at the moment, although it has attracted news coverage of rallies of a few hundred people calling for a referendum on leaving Canada. A Wexit Party has been registered with federal election officials. “Some people want to talk about separatism but that’s because they want to stir the pot,” said Janet Brown, who conducts political polling in Alberta for news organizations. She added, “Not many Albertans see it as a very practical solution. But Albertans still do want a better deal.” Mr. Kenney does not support separation. He has appointed a panel to make recommendations on how Alberta might pull back from the federal system in other ways by, for example, taking over its citizens’ public pension plan or no longer relying on the federal government’s tax collector to handle provincial income tax.  Not every Albertan backs Mr. Kenney’s pugilistic approach to relations with the rest of Canada.  Not far from Mr. Scott’s ranch, Gordon Cartwright presides over the venerable D-Ranch, which sits on land his family has owned or worked even before Alberta became a province in 1905. To Mr. Cartwright, who was part of a group that successfully fought a natural gas pipeline through their area, Alberta’s governments have become “captured by the oil industry.” And he thinks his province has to work with the rest of the country, not fight it. “There’s going to be a pocket of Albertans that think they want to be separate,” he added. “It’s always a symptom of when things are under stress. But it’s usually better to work on a marriage.”']","As Justin Trudeau officially begins his second term, a sense of alienation from the rest of the country is the dominant sentiment in the oil-producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan."
"Iran Declares Protests Are Over, but the Evidence Suggests Otherwise",2019-11-21,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['The Iranian authorities moved Thursday to project the appearance of normalcy after a week of violent protests over gasoline price increases, partly restoring internet access and decreeing that the mayhem that convulsed the country was really a foreign-backed failure. But other developments suggested that a severe crackdown was underway in response to the street clashes, rioting and destruction that had upended life in dozens of Iranian cities and towns — and that the uprisings had not been completely crushed.  Doctors reported that hospitals were overfilled with people injured in the protests. They also said the Health Ministry had ordered all hospitals in Tehran and other cities to cancel elective surgeries because of the influx of emergency cases.  Iran’s student union said plainclothes agents of the pro-government Basij militia, hiding inside ambulances to evade restrictions on entering campuses, had seized more than 50 students at Tehran University after protests there. The government also came in for some extraordinary criticism from the nation’s writers guild over what amounted to an internet blackout that started on Sunday in the nation of 80 million, effectively obscuring much of what was happening during the protests. NetBlocks, a firm that tracks cybersecurity, said the shutdown had disconnected almost the entire country. “Shutting down the internet and cutting the access of Iranians and the outside world to the news is the latest tactic to crush protests without the eyes of the world on you,” the guild said Thursday in a statement posted on Telegram. President Trump, whose sanctions are at least partly blamed for Iran’s economic travails, broke six days of silence on the protests. Iran had become so unstable, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “that the regime has shut down their entire Internet System so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country.”  Later Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who shares Mr. Trump’s antipathy toward Iran’s hierarchy, appeared to validate its suspicions that the United States was abetting the protests. In his own Twitter posting, Mr. Pompeo said that he had asked protesters to send him videos and other evidence of the crackdown, and that the United States would “expose and sanction the abuses.” Amnesty International has said that more than 100 Iranians were killed in the protests, some by security forces using live ammunition to disperse and intimidate crowds. The government, which has portrayed the protesters as rioters and thugs inspired and paid by foreigners, has called the Amnesty report propaganda. “Any casualty figures not confirmed by the government are speculative and unreliable, and in many cases part of a disinformation campaign waged against Iran from outside the country,” Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s United Nations mission, said Wednesday in a Twitter post. A spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the elite force responsible for national security, said that several leaders of the unrest with dual citizenship and ties to foreign governments had been arrested. The semiofficial Fars News Agency reported that rioters had looted and burned chain stores in a number of Tehran suburbs, and that some had “received $60 for each place set on fire.” The Fars account did not specify who had supposedly provided that money. Despite the government’s clampdown on internet connectivity and censorship of what could be officially reported, Iranians who saw or participated in the protests found workarounds to transmit video and text of what they had witnessed.  The videos and postings, although anecdotal, depicted fear, bitterness and anxiety. Pejman Gholipour, 18, for example, went shopping Monday in the city of Karaj for a suit to wear to his brother’s wedding. On Wednesday, his family held a funeral for him in their coastal town of Langaroud, according to an Iranian journalist, Yasin Namakchian. Mr. Gholipour had been caught up in one of the protests when security forces opened fire and he was struck. Mr. Namakchian, who is from the same city as Mr. Gholipour, announced his death on Twitter. Not far from where Mr. Gholipour was killed, an unidentified young man’s lower leg was nearly severed by a bullet. A video showed protesters dragging him on the ground in the midst of clashes and sirens. Someone shouted “Stop, wrap his leg!” Blood oozed from his jeans as his partly severed leg dangled, according to a video shared on social media by another journalist in Iran. President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the government had vanquished what he called foreign enemies instigating the unrest and that calm and order had been restored.  But Mr. Rouhani’s public show of bravado and unity belied signs of severe strain within the government hierarchy over the gasoline price increases and the response. Iranian media reported that during an emergency government meeting the same day, Mr. Rouhani argued with a conservative politician who had questioned him on the price increases and that Mr. Rouhani had stormed out. What started as relatively peaceful demonstrations over the increases shifted within days to a violent revolt against the system. As security forces were mobilized to stop them, the protesters became more brazen, suggesting a new phase in the dynamic of resistance and repression that has punctuated Iran’s history since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In many cities large and small, the streets look like war zones. Smoke and fire engulfed multiple buildings, banks and shops. Shattered glass and debris spread across major roads with no sign of commerce or traffic. Three residents of Tehran reached by phone said that the affluent northern part of the city was quiet, but that unrest persisted in middle-class and working-class neighborhoods. They said the capital had the appearance of a heavy security zone, with swarms of anti-riot police on motorcycles and Special Forces lined up on nearly every major road. Plainclothes Basij militia members were also out on the streets. “It’s definitely not normal. We are not leaving the house unless we have to and nearly all official business has come to a halt,” said Sara, a translator in Tehran who did not want her last name published.  She said patients at her husband’s medical clinic had canceled and many people were reluctant to send their children to school. The mayor of Shiraz, where clashes have been severe, said on Wednesday that transportation infrastructure in four of the city’s districts have been destroyed. The owner of a popular hypermarket, Refah, the Iranian equivalent of Walmart, said shops in three of its locations had been ransacked. Even political figures appeared bolder in their criticism of the government. One of Iran’s most prominent political activists close to the reformist faction, Abulfazl Ghadiani, issued a statement blaming Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has thrown his weight behind the gas increase policy and effectively shut the door to any reconsideration. “The main and final person responsible for the blood being spilled is Mr. Khamenei. He must be held accountable,” Mr. Ghadiani said. As news of the unrest dominated, the judiciary quietly moved to close a contentious espionage case against wildlife conservationists whose plight had gripped both Iranians and the international community. Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence had concluded that the conservationists, from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, were not spies. But the Revolutionary Guards, who operate a parallel intelligence bureaucracy, prosecuted the charges anyway. One defendant, Morad Tahbaz, an Iranian American from Connecticut, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and a co-defendant, Niloufar Bayani, a former project consultant and scientist for the United Nations environment agency, was sentenced to eight. They were both convicted by a Revolutionary Court for collaborating “with an enemy state.” The authorities also seized Ms. Bayani’s income from her United Nations employment. Four other co-defendants received sentences of between six and eight years. Two remaining co-defendants still await their verdict, according to an account posted by the Center for Human Rights in Iran.']","Signs of a severe crackdown over the protests were evident, including a Health Ministry order canceling elective surgeries because of an influx of emergency cases.

"Israel’s Netanyahu Indicted on Charges of Fraud, Bribery and Breach of Trust",2019-11-21,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted Thursday on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a set of long-running corruption cases, throwing his political future into doubt and heightening the uncertainty and chaos surrounding Israel’s fitful, yearlong struggle to choose its next leader. Mr. Netanyahu, 70, who in July became the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, now also has the distinction of being the first to be indicted while in office. The cases against Mr. Netanyahu involve allegations of giving or offering lucrative official favors to several media tycoons in exchange for favorable news coverage or gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The indictment threatened to open a dangerous new challenge to Israel’s democracy, as the nation’s top prosecutor and its premier accused each another of subverting the rule of law. “The public interest requires that we live in a country where no one is above the law,” Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said in a televised evening news conference. In a defiant speech an hour later, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the case against him was built on lies and political animus. He declared that it was the police and prosecutors who should be called to account, urging Israel’s citizens to “investigate the investigators.” By turns fiery and maudlin, he told Israelis that they were “witnessing an attempted coup.” “I will not allow lies to prevail,” he vowed. “I will continue to lead this country.” Mr. Netanyahu is not legally required to step down. But with Israel’s political system already in uncharted territory, having failed to settle upon a new prime minister despite two elections and three attempts at forming a government since April, the criminal case against him could make it far more difficult for him to retain power. After his chief rival, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, failed to form a government by the Wednesday deadline, that task shifted to Parliament. If no lawmaker is successful in assembling a 61-seat majority over the next three weeks, a third round of elections will be called. While Mr. Netanyahu has maintained strong support from his political base so far, polls have shown that a formal indictment would change many minds, including among many right-wing voters. “We’ve seen consistently that a big majority of the public, about two-thirds, do not think a prime minister can serve and at the same time try to clear his name in court,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. In an October survey by the institute, nearly half of right-wing voters concurred. There were already signs of unrest in Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, as a popular younger lawmaker, Gideon Saar, called Thursday for a primary contest for prime minister, and said he would be a contender.  Even if Mr. Netanyahu fends off intraparty challengers, and assembles a viable coalition in Parliament, Mr. Plesner said that the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, might balk at assigning him the task of forming a government while he awaits trial. In addition, critics are expected to petition the Supreme Court to rule that Mr. Netanyahu must step down.  Existing law requires an ordinary government minister to resign when under indictment but whether that law applies to a prime minister has not been tested. There are also legal questions about whether the president may allow an indicted lawmaker to form a government. The decision by Mr. Mandelblit to prosecute the prime minister capped a drawn-out process that has loomed over Israel politics for two years, weakening Mr. Netanyahu politically and emboldening the center-left.  Mr. Netanyahu has fomented right-wing anger at Israel’s judiciary and law-enforcement community for months, accusing them of trying to bring him down. Alluding to that, Mr. Mandelblit warned against “violent and belligerent discourse against law enforcement officials,” which he called “playing with fire.” “Law enforcement is not a choice,” he added. “This is not a matter of left or right. This is not a matter of politics.” Mr. Netanyahu asked for the public’s sympathy, saying “my blood has been spilled,” along with that of his wife and son, in unfair attacks in the Israeli news media. The corruption cases helped fuel the rise of the Blue and White party, led by Mr. Gantz, whose animating idea was that the allegations disqualified Mr. Netanyahu from continuing to serve. Mr. Gantz issued a one-sentence statement late Thursday: “This is a very sad day for the state of Israel.” The No. 2 official in Blue and White, Yair Lapid, was more pointed: “If he still cares about the country he should do one more thing for it,” he said of Mr. Netanyahu. “Resign.” The cases have also slowly emboldened rivals within Likud. Mr. Saar said that “it will not be reasonable” to expect that Mr. Netanyahu could succeed in a third election, after having twice failed to form a government and now with the additional baggage of criminal charges.  “We need to set a Likud leadership primary,” he said at a Jerusalem Post conference on Thursday. “I’ll be able to form a government and I think I will be able to unify the nation.” Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, has focused enormous energy on persuading his supporters that the sprawling investigations were trumped-up and motivated by partisan bias, and on seeking to gain immunity from prosecution as long as he remains in office. For months as the investigations dragged on, Mr. Netanyahu complained that the Israeli left, the news media and law enforcement agencies were conspiring to oust him by legal means because they could not defeat him at the ballot box. In striking parallels to President Trump’s characterizations of the investigations against him, Mr. Netanyahu has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” and his allies have called it the product of a “deep state” conspiracy against Mr. Netanyahu — though Mr. Netanyahu himself appointed many of the key law-enforcement officials investigating him. Indeed, Mr. Mandelblit was once Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet secretary, perhaps his closest adviser in the government. The prime minister also seemed to work feverishly to use the legislative and political processes to aid his defense. Last December, he called a snap election for April, calculating that he might win a strong re-election mandate if the ballots were cast before Mr. Mandelblit announced whether he planned to seek an indictment. Then, having scheduled the vote, he argued that Mr. Mandelblit ought to delay announcing his decision until after it, to avoid unfairly influencing the outcome. Neither gambit worked: Mr. Mandelblit announced his intention to seek bribery and other charges 40 days before the April 9 vote. After the April election ended inconclusively, Mr. Netanyahu’s allies pushed a bill in Parliament to give all members, including Mr. Netanyahu, immunity from prosecution. It was abandoned when critics, including members of his party, called the idea authoritarian and antidemocratic.  He also reportedly discussed seeking legislation to give Parliament the power to override a potentially unfavorable ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court, if a law granting Mr. Netanyahu immunity were challenged. Again and again, Mr. Netanyahu sought to portray himself as a victim, in part as a way to keep his conservative political base united behind him. He petitioned unsuccessfully to bar evidence in the corruption cases from being published before the do-over election on Sept. 17. Failing that, he called damaging reports about that evidence a “terror attack against democracy.” Finally, Mr. Netanyahu extracted repeated promises from members of Likud and of its allied right-wing and religious parties to stick by him and insist on entering a new government only if he remained prime minister. It was vital to Mr. Netanyahu to stay on as prime minister, rather than agree to share power with Mr. Gantz taking the top job first, because if he held any post lower than prime minister, he would have to resign immediately if indicted.  Current Israeli law allows a prime minister to remain in office until a final court verdict, after appeals have been exhausted — a process that could take years. That solidarity posed an insurmountable obstacle for Mr. Gantz and Blue and White, which finished narrowly ahead of Likud in the September ballot, but far short of a majority. On Wednesday, Mr. Gantz acknowledged that he had been unable to form a governing coalition. The three cases against Mr. Netanyahu all involve trading official favors. In the most serious, in which he was charged with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust, Mr. Netanyahu was accused of providing regulatory benefits worth hundreds of millions of dollars as a bribe to the parent company of Walla, a leading Israeli news website, for favorable coverage of the prime minister and his family, and rough treatment of his adversaries. Bribery is considered the gravest corruption charge in Israel.  In the two other cases, Mr. Netanyahu was charged with fraud and breach of trust. In one, Mr. Mandelblit said the Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, an expatriate Israeli, along with the Australian billionaire James Packer, had sent hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts to the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, including what he called a “veritable supply chain” of cigars and Champagne. In return, Mr. Mandelblit said, Mr. Netanyahu had taken actions benefiting Mr. Milchan on a visa application, a tax exemption and a business merger. In the other, Mr. Netanyahu was accused of discussing, though not consummating, another trade for favorable coverage. Prosecutors said that in calls with the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, one of Israel’s biggest newspapers, Mr. Netanyahu offered to press a competing newspaper, Israel Hayom, to curtail its free circulation, which was undercutting Yediot financially.  Israel Hayom is owned by Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire casino owner who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Netanyahu’s. Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyers sought to avert indictment at a four-day hearing in October. But Mr. Mandelblit said they had succeeded only in modifying the allegations against the prime minister, not refuting them. Several other people were indicted in connection with the cases against Mr. Netanyahu, including the Yediot Ahronot publisher, Arnon Mozes, and Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Bezeq, the parent company of Walla News.']","The first prosecution of a sitting Israeli premier deepens the political paralysis in a country that has had two inconclusive elections this year, and may be headed to a third vote."
Greece Announces Steps to Shut Down Notorious Refugee Camps,2019-11-20,By Niki Kitsantonis,"['ATHENS — The Greek government said on Wednesday that it would replace intensely overcrowded migrant camps on the Aegean Islands with new centers that would be more restrictive of the migrants’ movements. The step comes amid a continuing influx of new arrivals from Turkey. It is an effort by the new conservative government to tighten its control over migrant flows while also addressing conditions at the camps, including Moria on Lesbos and Vathi on Samos. These conditions have become symbols of Greece’s, and Europe’s, inability to manage migration in an effective and humane manner.  But it was not clear that the new centers would do little more than redistribute a humanitarian crisis that has defied solution since the peak of the migration crisis in 2015 and 2016. At that time, more than a million asylum seekers fleeing economic hardship or wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan arrived in Europe. This year, after several years of having slowed, the numbers of asylum seekers making the short but often treacherous journey from Turkey across the Aegean Sea to Greece has ticked up once again. The government presented the new centers as a more humane alternative to the grossly crowded camps that have been widely condemned by international organizations. But they were also intended to send a “clear message,” said a government spokesmen, Stelios Petsas, that migrants who paid human traffickers to reach Europe would remain bottled up in Greece.  “They need to understand, as the prime minister has repeatedly emphasized, that if they give their money to a trafficker to bring them to Greece, they will lose it,” he said. The camps, on five Aegean Islands, together hold some 34,000 people, many of them living in squalor. Over recent weeks, and with the cold winter months looming, migrants have protested by setting fires and rioting. “There is a desperate lack of medical care and sanitation in the vastly overcrowded camps I have visited,” said Dunja Mijatovic, Europe’s top human rights official, last month, warning of impending “catastrophe.”  She said the facilities on Lesbos and Samos had turned life into a “struggle for survival.” Some families had chipped away at rocks to create makeshift shelters on steep hillsides.  Greece’s leaders argue that the blame for the conditions rests also with Europe. At the summit of European Union leaders in Brussels last month, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called on the bloc to come up with a “Plan B” to deal with the possibility of a new refugee crisis, saying Greece could not handle the problem alone. He urged more solidarity from member states that have refused to share the burden of taking in refugees, which has fallen hardest on countries on Europe’s Mediterranean border, like Greece and Italy.  Even Europe’s more liberal leaders, wary of a rising nationalism in their own countries fueled by anti-migrant talking points, have continued to crack down and have done little to lighten the load.  The Greek government’s new plan foresees replacing three big camps on Lesbos, Samos and Chios with smaller ones, while refurbishing camps on Leros and Kos.  The aim is to ease pressure on the islands where camps are horribly overcrowded; to increase control over the camps; and to improve vetting of migrants to determine who gets returned to their home countries, and who goes to the mainland. The plan foresees the transfer of 20,000 asylum seekers from the island camps to less crowded facilities on the mainland by early 2020. Unaccompanied children, pregnant women and older people would be the first group moved. In recent weeks, officials have moved hundreds of people off the islands to the mainland but those transfers have not kept up with the clip of arrivals from neighboring Turkey. In an interview with Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper this week, Mr. Mitsotakis, the prime minister, accused Turkey of reneging on an agreement with the European Union to crack down on human smuggling across the Aegean, signed in March 2016, when thousands of migrants were landing on the islands daily.  The Turkish Coast Guard’s failure to work with its Greek counterpart was “unacceptable,” he said. Mr. Mitsotakis’ government is planning to hire 800 new border guards for the islands and another 400 for Greece’s land border with Turkey to tighten inspections.  The government will also begin recruiting 500 new workers to speed up the slow-moving asylum process to determine which migrants deserve refugee status and to more efficiently move them off the islands.  Local authorities on the islands were skeptical that the old centers would indeed close.  “It’s not clear to me,” said Kostas Mountzouris, the regional governor for the northern Aegean Islands, including Lesbos said on Greek television. “If the plan is for the old and new centers to operate simultaneously, then we oppose that,” he said. Many locals, both on the islands and the mainland areas where the migrants have relocated, were fed up.  Last month, angry locals protested and blocked a busload of migrants arriving at Vrasna, in northern Greece. The migrants were relocated again.  Earlier this month a nationalist group protested the growing presence of Muslim migrants by cooking pork at a barbecue and drinking alcohol next to a refugee camp in Diavata, also in northern Greece.']","The government’s plan to redistribute asylum seekers was presented as a more humane alternative, but it was also clearly intended to deter new arrivals.

Iran’s ‘Iron Fist’: Rights Group Says More Than 100 Protesters Are Dead,2019-11-19,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Protests against the Iranian government erupted for a fifth day across the country on Tuesday, as the authorities scrambled to crush the unrest and reports emerged of mounting injuries and deaths. The rights group Amnesty International said that as many as 106 protesters in 21 cities had been killed over the course of the protests, in what would be a dramatic increase, if confirmed, from the 12 reported killed by semiofficial Iranian news agencies. Hundreds of people have been injured over the last week and more than a thousand arrested, according to official Iranian news agencies. Iran’s security forces said protesters had killed two police officers and at least five members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the paramilitary force known as the Basij.  The protests started last Friday in response to a sudden increase in gasoline prices, which ignited widespread anger amid an economic crisis that Iran’s president has called the worst in 40 years. The country is reeling from economic sanctions reimposed by the Trump administration after it pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran. The authorities moved swiftly to quash the protests, but they soon evolved into a broader, sometimes violent, movement against the government, flaring in cities around the country.  “There is no doubt these protests are serious, in terms of their scale and scope,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. “The regime brought down the iron fist much faster. This, to me, indicates they want to nip it in the bud.” As part of its crackdown, the government imposed a near-complete shutdown of the internet on Sunday, in an effort to limit protesters’ ability to organize and get out information, such as videos shared on social media and with news organizations outside Iran. But the unrest has endured, and some Iranians have managed to circumvent the internet shutdown and send out video. Without providing specifics, Amnesty International said that its death toll  was based on “credible reports” and that it had reviewed video and heard from witnesses in Iran. The video shows security forces violently dispersing protesters with firearms, tear gas and water cannons, according to the rights group. In various cities, protesters have also attacked, ransacked and set fire to dozens of government buildings, including religious schools and municipal offices. Demonstrators have also targeted state-run banks, calling them a symbol of their economic grievances and of corruption in the system. On Tuesday, many cities remained restive, with schools and university classes suspended and National League soccer matches canceled. Parliament’s national security committee canceled an emergency meeting Tuesday with heads of the intelligence and security agencies; it said the security chiefs were occupied restoring order. Iran’s military and intelligence agencies have warned that those participating in the unrest will be severely punished. Kayhan, a hard-line newspaper that is considered a mouthpiece of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, wrote on Monday that “thugs” rioting in the streets should be executed by hanging. Although the reports of dead protesters and mass arrests have provoked an international outcry, including in the United States, Europe and the United Nations, Iranian officials have so far resisted calls for a tempered response. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Tuesday warned countries against supporting the protesters in Iran, and other officials have dismissed the unrest as a plot orchestrated by opposition groups and foreign countries trying to destabilize Iran. Even if Iranian officials may be privately acknowledging that the abrupt increase in fuel prices was foolish, they are unlikely to reverse the decision, some political analysts said.  Ayatollah Khamenei himself decreed that the price increase was necessary and appropriate, essentially squelching any further discussion among his subordinates. And a retreat might be seen as a capitulation that would embolden the protesters. “A larger issue here is a structural problem for Khamenei as well as the others — they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge there can be any type of legitimate protest,” said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, an Iran expert who is the director of the School of Public and International Affairs at Virginia Tech.  “They cannot quite acknowledge they have made mistakes,” he said. “The violence is a wonderful indication that they’re afraid. They’re hoping a strong show of force will force this decision down peoples’ throats.” Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.  ']",
Israel Intercepts Four Rockets Launched From Syria,2019-11-19,By Isabel Kershner,"['Four rockets were launched from Syria toward the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights at dawn on Tuesday, setting off air-raid sirens but causing no harm, according to the Israeli military. The military said that the incoming fire was intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system and that it appeared no rockets had fallen on the Israeli-controlled side of the line. It was not immediately clear if the rocket fire from Syria was meant as a surprise attack or came in response to Israeli activity across its northern frontier. Around the same time as the rocket launches, Sana, the official Syrian news agency, reported that explosions were heard in the vicinity of the Damascus airport.  An Israeli military spokeswoman had no comment on the report from Syria. After decades of quiet, there have been occasional exchanges of fire across the old Israeli-Syrian armistice line as Israel has worked, mostly clandestinely, to curb Iran’s growing influence in Syria, largely under cover of the chaos of Syria’s civil war. Abandoning years of ambiguity over Israeli involvement in specific attacks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged early this year that Israeli forces had attacked Iranian weapons warehouses at Damascus International Airport.   Israel’s shadow war against Iran became even more public this summer when it carried out a series of strikes in the region, including one that killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria who Israel said were preparing to dispatch armed drones to attack it.  The latest tensions in the north came days after a flare-up across Israel’s border with Gaza to the south. Palestinian militants from Islamic Jihad fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, and Israeli warplanes struck targets in Gaza, in a two-day clash set off by Israel’s killing of a senior Islamic Jihad commander there in a surprise airstrike.  The Syrian authorities and Islamic Jihad also blamed Israel for another, almost simultaneous, missile attack on the Damascus home of Akram al-Ajouri, describing him as a member of the group’s political bureau in Syria. Mr. al-Ajouri survived the attack, but his son and another person were reported killed in the strike. Maintaining its more customary silence in an effort to avoid retaliation, Israel neither claimed nor denied responsibility for that attack.

Two Western Hostages Are Freed in Afghanistan in Deal With Taliban,2019-11-19,By David Zucchino and Adam Goldman,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban on Tuesday freed two Westerners they had held for more than three years in exchange for the release of three senior insurgent leaders, officials said, in a deal that officials hoped could pave the way for Afghan peace talks with the Taliban.  The Westerners were released to American forces by the Taliban, and included an American, Kevin C. King, 63, and an Australian, Timothy J. Weeks, 50, teachers at the American University in Kabul who were abducted in 2016. The key figure being returned to the Taliban is Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s military operations leader and a leading fund-raiser and propagandist before he was captured in 2014.  The exchange was brokered, in part, by the American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, who had earlier negotiated a tentative agreement with the Taliban that would have included terms of an American troop withdrawal. But those talks were abruptly aborted by President Trump in September.  Now, the prisoner exchange could be a step toward restarting talks between the United States and the Taliban, who have said they will stand by the terms negotiated with Mr. Khalilzad.  In announcing that he was willing to free the senior Taliban figures, President Ashraf Ghani said last week that the exchange was intended to “facilitate direct peace negotiations” between the Afghan government and the Taliban. He is also betting that the exchange could nudge the Taliban toward agreeing to at least a partial cease-fire, which Mr. Ghani has set as a precondition to any talks. The Taliban have refused to negotiate with Mr. Ghani’s government until the United States reaches a troop withdrawal deal with the insurgency. Mr. Ghani, who called the swap a “tough but important” decision, has emphasized that the release of the Western hostages was required as a show of good faith by the Taliban in advance of any peace negotiations. A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two Westerners were released to American Special Operations forces in eastern Afghanistan early Tuesday afternoon and appeared to be in fair health. They were  taken to Bagram Air Base in northern Afghanistan.  The three Taliban prisoners were flown to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban have a political office,  as part of a highly choreographed exchange, officials said. After the confirmation that the Western hostages had been freed, Taliban officials said that they had custody of the three men in Doha. Also to be included in the exchange were 10 members of the Afghan security forces being held by the Taliban, Afghan and American officials said. Later on Tuesday, a Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that they had been released. That was not immediately confirmed by Afghan officials.  “All these steps are a positive development for trust building, which can help the peace process,” the spokesman said.  The White House and State Department also alluded to the peace talks in statements that welcomed the Western prisoners’ release. “We see these developments as hopeful signs,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, that the Afghan war “may soon conclude through a political settlement.” In addition to Mr. Haqqani, the Afghan government released Hafiz Abdul Rashid, a senior Taliban commander who had equipped suicide bombers, chosen their targets and moved them from safe houses in Pakistan into Afghanistan. Mr. Rashid, a brother of a member of the Taliban negotiating team in Doha, was captured along with Mr. Haqqani in 2014. The third Taliban member in the exchange was Hajji Mali Khan, a senior commander and an uncle of the deputy leader of the Taliban. The three men are members of the Haqqani network, a brutal wing of the Taliban based in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. The group has been responsible for suicide bombings against Afghan civilians, as well as attacks on Afghan and American forces.  Anas Haqqani’s release was important to the militants, in part, because his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, founded the Haqqani network, where Anas Haqqani was considered a rising star. Recovering American hostages held overseas has been a priority for Mr. Trump, and his national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, was previously the State Department’s top official for managing hostage cases.  Mr. King was the last known American to be held by the Taliban. Another American who disappeared in Afghanistan, Paul E. Overby Jr., is believed to be dead. Mr. Overby disappeared in Khost Province in May 2014 while trying to interview the leader of the Haqqani network. On Tuesday, the family of Mr. King released a statement thanking Trump administration officials and other groups for working to free him.  “This has been a long and painful ordeal for our entire family,”  said Mr. King’s sister, Stephanie Miller. American officials said the Afghan government and the United States had delayed the swap after two attacks within 24 hours of Mr. Ghani’s initial announcement of the deal on Nov. 12. That day, an American convoy was struck by a suicide car bomb in Logar Province in eastern Afghanistan; the American military command said there were no American casualties. On Nov. 13, a suicide car bomb attack in Kabul killed 12 civilians, including three children walking to school. Mr. Khalilzad told Taliban leaders they needed to show good faith by ceasing such attacks, the officials said. When the Taliban blamed local militants, Mr. Khalilzad told them to establish command and control or put him in touch with someone who could, the American officials said. In surrendering three men responsible for killing Afghan civilians and troops, Mr. Ghani risked playing his strongest card against the Taliban with no guarantee that the exchange would lead to his ultimate goal of direct peace talks. He has already faced criticism from some in the Afghan public, and accusations of being strong-armed by the United States into securing the release of two Westerners ahead of other Afghan priorities. The inclusion of the 10 Afghan security force members in the deal could mitigate some of that criticism. The deal also comes at a pivotal political moment, with Mr. Ghani embroiled in a divisive presidential election marred by vote-counting delays and charges of ballot-stuffing and voting fraud.    Still, the militants did not soften their position against negotiating with the Afghan government after Mr. Ghani arranged previous releases of imprisoned Taliban members to mark religious observances. And more broadly, the insurgents have given up very little over 10 months of negotiations with Mr. Khalilzad.  In fact, the peace process began with a major concession by the Trump administration: It agreed to a Taliban demand that Mr. Ghani’s government be excluded from the negotiations, deeply unsettling the Afghan government. That decision elevated the Taliban to an equal negotiating partner without requiring the militants to give up anything significant in return. More recently, the United States has unilaterally reduced its troop numbers in Afghanistan by 2,000, potentially diminishing its leverage in any future negotiations with the Taliban. The father of two schoolchildren killed in the Nov. 13 car bombing criticized Mr. Ghani and the United States for the swap. “The Taliban kill people, and the Americans want to release them?” Abdul Saboor, 45, said in an interview at his home in Kabul on Sunday. Mr. Saboor was wounded and his daughter, Zainab, 10, and son, Hadis, 7, were killed in the bombing. In freeing two Westerners and 10 Afghan security force members, the Taliban are surrendering captives who don’t hold the same strategic or security value as the three Taliban figures.  Just last month, Mr. Ghani’s spokesman said that releasing Mr. Haqqani was a “red line” that would not be crossed without the approval of the Afghan people. But last week, the spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said the decision could create “a path for an honorable peace and ending the war.” David Zucchino reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Adam Goldman from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi from Kabul.']","The two Western teachers held by the Taliban are safe with American forces, officials say, and three Taliban figures are freed.

"After Disastrous Epstein Interview, Prince Andrew Steps Down From Public Duties",2019-11-20,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prince Andrew announced on Wednesday that he would step back from public life, seeking to contain a firestorm over his ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein that threatened to scorch the entire British royal family. The prince’s extraordinary statement capped a tumultuous four days since his televised interview about Mr. Epstein, which brought a storm of negative coverage, prompted companies with ties to the prince’s charities to distance themselves from him, and rekindled calls for him to testify to the F.B.I. about his tangled history with Mr. Epstein, who was accused of sex trafficking. “It has become clear to me over the past few days that my association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support,” Prince Andrew said in a statement issued by Buckingham Palace. “Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I can step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission,” said the prince, who is also known as the Duke of York and is the second son of Queen Elizabeth II. The duke, 59, had hoped that the interview, broadcast Saturday by the BBC, would put to rest lingering questions about his ties to Mr. Epstein, as well as accusations that he had sex with a teenage  girl who had been supplied to him by his friend. Instead, after the duke submitted to 50 minutes of polite but relentless grilling by the BBC journalist Emily Maitlis, his unsavory association with Mr. Epstein — fodder for tabloid newspapers and society magazines — had mutated into a full-blown scandal, one that eclipsed  the British general election on front pages. Viewers expressed shock and anger at Prince Andrew’s lack of sympathy for Mr. Epstein’s victims, as well as his unpersuasive denials of sexual misconduct, which included peculiar assertions, such as that he has been medically unable to perspire since his combat tour in the Falklands War.  Experts on the royal family have described the interview as the biggest public relations debacle for the British royal family since the turbulent aftermath of the death of Princess Diana in a car crash in 1997. People with ties to Buckingham Palace said they could not recall a senior member of the royal family having been suspended so abruptly and publicly from his or her duties. Some praised the decision, saying it would take the prince out of the spotlight and buy time for the palace to try to rehabilitate his image. In his three-paragraph statement, Prince Andrew attempted to undo some of the damage himself. He expressed regret for “my ill-judged association” with Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August. “His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for the victims,” the prince said, “and I deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.” Prince Andrew said he would be ready to help “any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigation, if required.” During the BBC interview, the prince said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testifying under oath about his ties to Mr. Epstein. On Monday, a woman who has accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing her as a child called on the prince to speak to the American authorities.  “Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,” said the woman, who calls herself Jane Doe 15, at a news conference in New York. In August, another woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, accused the prince of having sex with her three times when she was 17 years old and had been offered to him by Mr. Epstein. Under insistent questioning by Ms. Maitlis, Prince Andrew insisted he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms. Giuffre. Prince Andrew’s public duties have included stewardship of Pitch@Palace, a five-year-old effort to “accelerate the work of entrepreneurs” by helping them connect with potential advisers and investors. Several companies have already moved to distance their brands from Pitch@Palace. Those companies included Cisco Systems; Aon, a British insurer; and KPMG, a consulting firm. Aon asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website because it was not a partner of the organization and never had been. Even before the duke agreed to speak, his decision to go before the cameras had opened divisions inside Buckingham Palace. The Sunday Times reported that the prince’s public relations adviser, Jason Stein, resigned two weeks ago because he believed that the interview “could backfire.” As the furor following the interview built, Prince Andrew canceled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, The Sun newspaper reported. British papers were full of analysis of his future role in the family, particularly after the death of the queen, who is 93. People close to the palace said she has traditionally favored Prince Andrew and forgiven his indiscretions.  Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is said to be frustrated with his brother’s behavior, viewing him as a liability. Once he ascends to the throne, people who follow the royal family expect him to push for a more “streamlined” structure, in which fewer family members would have a conspicuous public role.  The British public has also proved less forgiving. While viewers found many things about the interview offensive, many reacted most viscerally to Prince Andrew’s reply when he was asked whether he regretted his relationship with Mr. Epstein, which continued after the financier had served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,” he said. “Unbecoming?” the BBC interviewer, Ms. Maitlis, replied with a tone of incredulity. “He was a sex offender.” The duke quickly backtracked, saying: “Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite. I mean, in the sense that he was a sex offender.” Equally damaging was his explanation about why he stayed with Mr. Epstein at his Manhattan mansion in 2010, after his host was released from prison. It was “convenient,” the prince said, though he insisted that he had made the visit solely to break off their relationship. The questions about Prince Andrew’s association with Mr. Epstein have simmered for years. But they exploded back into view last summer, after Mr. Epstein’s arrest on sex trafficking charges and the publication by The Daily Mail of a photograph of the prince walking with his friend in Central Park. “That’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family,” he said in the interview. “We try and uphold the highest standards and practices, and I let the side down, as simple as that.” Members of the royal family have often lost their way when they have talked about their personal problems on television. Prince Charles confessed to adultery in a 1994 documentary,  and Diana told an interviewer a year later that “there were three of us in this marriage,” referring to Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his second wife. Until the latest tempest over Prince Andrew, the royal family was most distracted by the trials of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan. The couple opened up in a TV interview,  discussing her struggles with being a royal and new mother, and his tensions with his brother, Prince William. The brothers, Prince Harry said, were on “different paths at the moment.”']","He also said that he was willing to help law enforcement agencies in their investigations, and that he “unequivocally” regrets the “ill-judged association.”"
"Speed Bump or Tortuous Path? At Debate, Johnson and Corbyn Maneuver on Brexit",2019-11-20,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — In Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s telling on Tuesday night, Brexit was simple, a speed bump on the road to British prosperity. But in the eyes of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, it was anything but, opening the door to a decade of tortuous trade talks and a sell-off of Britain’s cherished public services. Those clashing messages, delivered to occasional groans from a studio audience Tuesday night, formed the core of the first debate before Britain’s general election next month, one that could determine whether Britain leaves the European Union or stays. The argument befit an election consumed less by the merits of Brexit than by how painlessly Britain can move beyond it. Mr. Johnson hammered again and again at the need to “get Brexit done,” casting it as the first step to solving everything from climate change to an erosion of trust in British democracy. Mr. Corbyn, on the other hand, refused to say even whether he wanted Britain to quit the European Union — arguing instead that the least disruptive way forward was returning the choice to Britons in a second referendum. In a campaign that has seemed stuck in neutral, with Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party holding a steady lead and Britons irritated by both main candidates, some analysts said that simply holding his own gave Mr. Corbyn a chance to turn the tide. But with Labour lawmakers antsy that their party is running out of time to close a double-digit polling deficit, it was not clear whether it would be enough. Mr. Johnson is banking on Britons being so weary of a logjam in Parliament over Brexit that they overlook Mr. Corbyn’s criticisms and give Mr. Johnson the majority to push through his exit agreement. That deal made only halting progress in Parliament last month. “Whether you voted for Leave or Remain, people want to get Brexit done, and to unleash the potential of this entire country,” Mr. Johnson said. “We have a deal that is oven-ready.” Though the audience grew audibly annoyed with Mr. Johnson’s recurrent pleas to “get Brexit done,” the message makes up a big part of his appeal in a country that has watched lawmakers argue over the issue for three years, to little effect. Likewise, Mr. Johnson tugged incessantly at one of Mr. Corbyn’s biggest vulnerabilities: his refusal to say whether he would campaign for Leave or Remain in a second referendum. At a moment when nearly all Britons seem to have made up their minds on Brexit, Mr. Corbyn’s silence has generated mistrust among anti-Brexit voters, even if Labour has clearly articulated its preference for a second public vote. Mr. Corbyn, who is trying to hold together a coalition that includes both Leavers and Remainers, grew most passionate discussing Britain’s National Health Service. Brandishing documents that he said described secret government meetings with American trade negotiators, Mr. Corbyn accused Mr. Johnson of wanting to “sell our National Health Service to the United States” during discussions over a post-Brexit free trade agreement. And he briefly quieted a restive audience by telling the story of a friend who he said had died the day before of breast cancer after waiting eight hours for help. “The N.H.S. is a wonderful and brilliant institution, but it is suffering under the most incredible pressure,” Mr. Corbyn said, citing thousands of nursing vacancies and long waits in emergency departments. Labour trails by an average of roughly a dozen percentage points in polls, with Mr. Corbyn garnering the worst popularity ratings of a major party leader heading into a British election since the data was first tracked 40 years ago. Hopes that Labour could repeat its dramatic comeback in the 2017 general election — perhaps with the rollout of its policy proposals this week — are fading as the party has failed to make up ground.  And the Liberal Democrats — a centrist party that wants to revoke Brexit altogether and could hurt the Conservatives in some seats — are struggling, too. Tuesday night’s televised debate, still a relatively new element in British elections, featured a few stinging one-liners. “A money forest, he’s got,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Corbyn’s big spending plans. But Mr. Corbyn was also ready when Mr. Johnson warned of a “chaotic coalition” between Labour and the pro-independence Scottish National Party, saying that Mr. Johnson had presided over “nine years of chaotic coalitions already.” There were laughs from the audience, too, when Mr. Johnson, not known for being scrupulous with his facts, answered a question about personal integrity by saying that the truth mattered. Near the end of the debate, the conversation landed on a topic that in recent days has overshadowed the election altogether: Prince Andrew’s disastrous interview about his friendship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Corbyn said that the monarchy “needs a bit of improvement.” But Mr. Johnson, who has already antagonized Queen Elizabeth II during his short time in office, said it needed no such thing. “The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach,” he said.']","Those clashing messages formed the core of the first debate before Britain’s general election, one that could determine whether it leaves the European Union."
1969: Queen’s Horses Sold for Slaughter,2019-11-19,By The International Herald Tribune,"['LONDON, Nov. 18 (AP) — Britain’s most famous ceremonial horses — those majestic steeds that carry the queen’s splendidly uniformed bodyguards — may be winding up as steaks in Continental restaurants.  A disclosure today that the Household Cavalry is selling its old horses to slaughterhouses aroused the fury of British animal lovers. The horses, ridden by troops and gold-trimmed trumpeters in plumed helmets, are feature attractions in the Changing of the Guard, coronations and all state processions.  A Ministry of Defense spokesman confirmed reports that some over-age Household Cavalry horses were being sold for slaughter. Few Britons would ever knowingly eat horsemeat, but it is a common dish on the Continent and that is where the carcasses are believed to go.  Emergency Meeting  Top officials at the Ministry of Defense called an emergency meeting this morning to deal with the report, which began with a front-page headline in the Daily Mirror saying, “Queen’s Horses to Be Sold for Meat.”  Buckingham Palace kept aloof from the fray. A spokesman for Queen Elizabeth II said only: “It has nothing to do with us — it is an army matter.”  The Mirror said about 60 horses a year were retired from the Household Cavalry and from the Royal Horse Artillery.  In recent months, the Mirror said, about 15 of these were sold to riding clubs and the rest were killed in slaughterhouses.  The Defense Ministry spokesman said, “The horses have been conditioned all their lives to parades and the noise of London. They would not be at all happy to retire into the quiet of the countryside and we think this is the most humane end for them.”  — The International Herald Tribune, November 19, 1969']",News that horses used in British state ceremonies were being sold to slaughterhouses after they retired sparked fury from animal lovers.
Are West Bank Settlements Illegal? Who Decides?,2019-11-19,By Isabel Kershner,"['The Trump administration’s declaration Monday that Israeli settlements on the West Bank are “not inconsistent with international law” reversed American policy on the settlements and contradicted the view of most countries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel applauded the announcement as a “policy that rights a historical wrong,” while Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said it was an attempt by the Trump administration “to replace international law with the ‘law of the jungle.’” Who is right? What does international law say? What difference does the United States announcement make? Here’s a brief guide. The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council and the International Court of Justice have all said that Israeli settlements on the West Bank violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and has occupied the territory ever since. The Fourth Geneva Convention, ratified by 192 nations in the aftermath of World War II, says that an occupying power “shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” The statute that established the International Criminal Court in 1998 classifies such transfers as war crimes, as well as any destruction or appropriation of property not justified by military necessity. Israel argues that a Jewish presence has existed on the West Bank for thousands of years and was recognized by the League of Nations in 1922. Jordan’s rule over the territory, from 1948 to 1967, was never recognized by most of the world, so Israel also argues there was no legal sovereign power in the area and therefore the prohibition on transferring people from one state to the occupied territory of another does not apply.  The International Court of Justice rejected that argument in an advisory opinion in 2004, ruling that the settlements violated international law. The Israeli Supreme Court and the government do consider settlement construction on privately owned Palestinian land to be illegal. Under the Oslo Accords, signed by Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, both sides agreed that the status of Israeli settlements would be resolved by negotiation. However, negotiations have stalled and there have been no active peace talks since 2014. Israel has built about 130 formal settlements in the West Bank since 1967. A similar number of smaller, informal settlement outposts have gone up since the 1990s, without government authorization but usually with some government support. More than 400,000 Israeli settlers now live in the West Bank alongside more than 2.6 million Palestinians. Some of the settlements are home to religious Zionists who believe that the West Bank, which Israel refers to by its biblical names of Judea and Samaria, is their biblical birthright. Many secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews also moved there largely for cheaper housing. Some settlements were strategically located in line with Israel’s security interests. Other, more isolated communities were established for ideological reasons, including an effort to prevent a contiguous Palestinian state.  Israel also captured East Jerusalem in 1967, and annexed it. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and much of the world still considers it occupied territory. Most of the world views the expansion of Israeli settlements as an impediment to a peace agreement. While most blueprints for a peace agreement envisage a land swap — Israel retains the main settlement blocs, where a majority of the settlers live, and hands over other territory to the Palestinians — the more remote and populated the settlements, the harder that becomes. Mr. Netanyahu, who is currently fighting to remain prime minister after two inconclusive elections, has promised to annex the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley, constituting up to a third of the West Bank.  In June, the American ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, said that Israel had a right to retain at least some of the West Bank. The Trump administration’s declaration may be seen by supporters of the settlement enterprise as giving a green light to Israeli annexation plans. But Israeli experts cautioned that might not be the case.  “It’s one thing saying the settlements are not in violation of international law and another to say whether they are good for peace or not,” said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Trump administration neither rejected nor endorsed Mr. Netanyahu’s annexation proposal, he said, and it remains “an open question” how it would react if Israel unilaterally annexed West Bank territory.  He and others said that while the policy change could affect the public perception of the settlements, the legal question would have little bearing on a comprehensive peace deal, which is ultimately a political act.  “The settlements are an agreed upon issue for negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians,” said Alan Baker, a former legal adviser to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. “It’s an issue that has yet to be negotiated.” But in the absence of negotiations, the American policy could be used to justify even more settlement construction.']","The United States declared that Israeli settlements on the West Bank are “not inconsistent with” international law, despite decisions by world bodies like the International Court of Justice."
‘I Am Breaking Inside’: Balkan Leader Fears Conflict After E.U. Snub,2019-11-19,By Marc Santora,"['SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Only two months ago, the leader of the small Balkan nation of North Macedonia was riding high, feted by world leaders, praised by the head of United Nations for offering a rare bright spot in an otherwise troubled global landscape and on the shortlist for a Nobel Peace Prize. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had staked his political career and his country’s future on resolving a three-decade-old dispute with neighboring Greece over his nation’s name. And through often tortuous diplomacy and against great odds, he had succeeded. But as he sat outside his office in the capital city, Skopje, that all seemed far away. “I am breaking inside,” he said. The name change was expected to clear the way for talks on North Macedonia joining the European Union, but last month, France vetoed those discussions, arguing that the process of enlarging the bloc needs to be rethought. That threw the government here into turmoil, and more ominously, it is shaking up the status quo in a region where an uneasy peace has existed since the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the wars that followed. “That destroyed me personally, psychologically,” Mr. Zaev, who is stepping down as a consequence of the decision, said during a recent interview. And he was concerned not just about himself and his country, but for the stability of the entire western Balkans. “Nationalism and radicalism can rise again,” he said. “There is a risk to open conflicts inside of the countries again. Also to open conflicts between countries again.” Since the end of the Balkan wars in 2001, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, integrating the former combatants into the European Union has been a central part of fulfilling the longstanding vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. But it has been an uneven path. Slovenia and Croatia are already in the union. Montenegro and Serbia are working on reforms required before membership. Albania and North Macedonia are just trying to start along the long path to accession.  The other two countries in the region — Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina — are not that far along, verging on failed states. The goal of the enlargement process, its supporters say, is to provide the guideposts for better governance. “We are led by the lights given to us by Europe,” Mr. Zaev said. “Now they turned out the lights and we are in the dark. Who knows where we go from here.” European Union expansion into eastern Europe ties former Communist countries to the West, reducing Russian influence, but there are already signs that the undermining of North Macedonia is causing leaders in the region to reconsider their own positions. President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia signed a free-trade agreement with a Russia-led economic bloc despite warnings from Brussels that the deal could jeopardize its membership bid. “We need to take care of ourselves,” he told the Financial Times. “That’s the only way. That’s the only approach.” Western diplomats expressed concern after Serbia conducted joint military exercises with Russia that featured the Russian S-400 and Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missile systems. “We are talking about fantastic systems,” Mr. Vucic said after attending a computer-simulated drill near Belgrade. “If we had S-400, no one would dare overfly Serbia.” He announced plans to buy the weapons, telling state television that he won’t allow Serbia to “be as weak as it was in the 1990s.” Matthew Palmer, an American envoy for the Balkans, warned that Serbia could risk sanctions over the arms deals with Russia, with punishments ranging from visa bans to the denial of export licenses. The competition with Russia has not stopped President Emmanuel Macron of France from delaying European Union expansion. His position no doubt has much to do with domestic politics, and his desire to keep anti-immigrant nationalists on the far right at bay.  But there is also recognition that some of the eastern European nations that are the bloc’s more recent members have been plagued by corruption, and have undermined competitive elections and independent media and judiciaries. Even so, North Macedonia’s boosters are pressing Mr. Macron to reconsider. American diplomats, in particular, view the resolution of dispute between North Macedonia and Greece as a signature triumph of diplomacy. At the Warsaw Security Forum this fall, Daniel Fried, a former United States ambassador to Poland and a member of the Atlantic Council, said that the name deal was “the best thing in the region in many years.” “That is a big deal,” he said. “The Greeks stared down their own nationalist constituency and so did the Macedonia government.” Speaking just days before Mr. Macron’s “non” on moving forward, Mr. Fried said that accession talks were now a “moral imperative.” “The E.U. accession process provides a certain amount of leverage,” he explained. “I want to use that leverage. To not use it, to demonstrate that it was all some kind of moving of the goal posts, would be devastating.” Though American and European diplomats are now scrambling to contain the fallout, it will prove difficult. Bratislav Grubacic, the publisher of VIP news services in Belgrade, said that great damage had already been done. It was no coincidence, he said, that Mr. Vucic will go to Moscow on Dec. 4 to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin. “Russians used to say to Serbia, ‘You decide Kosovo, in whatever way you want, and we will support it,’ ” he said. “But it is clear now that Russia has other ideas. It seems these Russian arms are part of this bigger game.” Even before the decision by France, there was growing concern about Russia taking a more aggressive posture in the region. Those worries were heightened after an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016 that Western intelligence officials say was directed by Russia to deter the country from joining NATO. During an interview this summer, Srdjan Darmanovic, the foreign minister of Montenegro, said that stopping the expansion of NATO was not Russia’s only goal. “I’ve often said that NATO is not Russia’s primary target, but the E.U., as a softer entity,” he said. Unable to rely on the European Union, Mr. Vucic and other Balkan leaders have recently talked about building greater regional cooperation. Mr. Grubacic was dismissive of the idea. “Drug smuggling, criminals and corruption” all are endemic, he said. “If you make regional cooperation agreements, it will be a regional cooperation of gangsters.” Albert Musliu, the head of the Association of Democratic Initiatives in Macedonia, said he cannot recall a moment this fraught since the end of the war. “In the 20th century, we have gone through a lot of hell,” he said. “But it was a hell with a vision.” Even when that vision was wrong and misguided, leaders could tell the people they were taking them somewhere. For the past two decades, that vision has been joining NATO and the European Union. “Now we are without a vision,” Mr. Musliu said. “And when there is no vision, other options start to appear.” And they can be dangerous.  Mr. Musliu worries that outside actors could easily stir up divisions in North Macedonia, where roughly a quarter of the people are ethnic Albanians. Prime Minister Zaev expressed similar concerns, saying it was “dangerous for everybody.” The regions history proves the point, he said — “Recent history, not centuries ago.” Following the postponement of accession talks, he announced that his government would step down in January, to be replaced by a technocratic government until elections in April. When asked why he decided to take such a dramatic step, he said he had no choice. “If we don’t call for elections, nationalism will rise,” he said.  “I am terrified.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.']",The abrupt decision by France to postpone any discussion of North Macedonia joining the European Union is reverberating in an already unsettled region.
A Bullet to the Eye Is the Price of Protesting in Chile,2019-11-19,By Brent McDonald,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — Brandon González, 19, marched with a group of protesters down the main artery of this Andean capital on Oct. 28 when riot police barricading the way to the presidential palace opened fire with tear gas and hardened rubber bullets.  Mr. González, who had come from his hospital job equipped with bandages and gauze to treat injured protesters, picked up a stone and hurled it at a police vehicle pumping tear gas into the crowd. Seconds later, he saw an officer about 25 feet away aim a rifle at his face. “I felt an impact in my eye, and it all went black. I held up my hands so they would stop shooting and then laid on the ground, and they shot me three more times,” said Mr. González, who works as a hospital assistant. “I thought, they are going to kill me.” At least 285 people in Chile have suffered severe eye trauma, mostly from hardened rubber bullets and tear gas canisters fired by Chilean security forces at protesters during the month of unrest. According to the Chilean Ophthalmological Society, that count is expected to rise.  The image of a bandaged eye is now so common it has become a rallying symbol for the protesters in Chile. Even so, the likelihood of such life-altering injury has not deterred demonstrators.  The country’s president, Sebastián Piñera, has struggled to quell nationwide unrest over low wages and a high cost of living, despite conceding to demands for a higher minimum wage and higher basic pension. After protesters upset over a subway fare hike burned Santiago metro stations, President Piñera declared the country “at war against a dangerous enemy” and ordered a militarized police force to patrol the streets.  Since then, the police have been blamed for at least six deaths, more than 6,300 arrests, and 2,400 hospitalizations of protesters. Public prosecutors in Chile are now investigating hundreds of cases of alleged abuses by the police, including torture and sexual violence. The damage to infrastructure and businesses is in the billions of dollars. The Chilean government’s announcement last week that it would hold a referendum in April to replace the Pinochet-era constitution — one of the key demands of protesters — has also not put an end to the unrest.  President Piñera has stood by the police clampdown, claiming that the use of force has been justified in order to maintain order. According to the Chilean police, nearly 1,000 officers have been hospitalized with injuries sustained during protests.  Mario Rozas, the director general of the Chilean police, announced late Tuesday that Chile would suspend the use of nonlethal pellets for crowd control and allow police to fire them only in circumstances of “extreme danger,” the same standard used for live rounds.  The change came a week after a New York Times video documentary revealed that the Chilean police had blinded protesters with rubber pellets, and a few days after a university study found that the pellets contained dangerous amounts of metal.  The number of serious eye injuries at the hands of the police has outraged human rights groups and alarmed medical professionals. On Nov. 8, a 21-year-old college student named Gustavo Gatica was shot by pellets in both eyes and rendered totally blind. For at least 12 victims, the damage to the cornea, iris and optic nerve has been so severe that doctors have had to remove the eye completely. “A tiny ball this size that hits with such force that the eyeball just opens up like a flower,” Dr. Carmen Torres said. “Such damage is very difficult to repair at all.” Dr. Torres is one of a handful of ophthalmologists at Salvador Hospital’s special Eye Trauma Unit, located within tear-gas wafting range of Plaza Italia, the epicenter of the protests. Since mid-October, she and a team of doctors have received more than 211 patients with severe eye injuries resulting from nonlethal rounds. Over a third of patients have arrived with rubber, metal or ceramic fragments still lodged inside their eyes.  “If the pellet passes even near the optic nerve, it damages the ability to transmit information. And if it passes through the center of the eye, it destroys it, explodes it,” Dr. Torres said. “That’s why we are advocating to stop using these projectiles.” What police call a “rubber pellet” is really only partly rubber. A few days ago, at the behest of the Eye Trauma Unit, researchers at the University of Chile conducted an analysis and found that 80 percent of the pellet is composed of denser materials, including lead, that increases the projectile’s velocity and makes it as hard as a skateboard wheel. On a day in late October, the waiting room was crowded with protesters with bandages over one eye. An 18-year-old automotive mechanics student lay on a stretcher worried whether the pellet inside her closed and swollen left eye would leave her blind. A 46-year-old ironworker who was protesting the low minimum wage waited for an implant in his now empty right eye socket. A mother wiped a trickle of blood seeping from her son’s new prosthetic eye as he described the moment a police officer shot him. The officer lifted the rifle up, said her son, Jesús Emerson Llancan. “He shot me, and then he lowered it again. I spun around from the impact and he shot me again in the back here. But by the second hit, I was in shock. I was bleeding so much from my eye.” Half a dozen protesters described a similar moment of coming face to face with an officer who aimed for their heads. There’s no visual evidence to back up each of their claims other than the precise location of their wounds. But videos shared over social media have shown Chilean officers pointing weapons directly at people who appear to pose no physical threat. Other videos appear to show officers shooting indiscriminately into crowds of protesters. “It’s a human rights catastrophe,” said Dr. Enrique Morales, President of the Human Rights Department for the Medical College of Chile, who has been tracking eye trauma from the protests. “If you compare the figures we see of eye injuries in France or in Kashmir or in Palestine, those numbers are much lower,” Dr. Morales said, referring to wounded demonstrators in those places.  The United Nations protocol for use of what it calls “less-lethal weapons” states that rounds should be shot at the lower body, away from the head and vital organs. Chilean police protocols on use of force are comparatively vague. Gonzalo Blumel, Chile’s newly appointed Interior Minister in charge of public security, has denied allegations of human rights abuse by security forces. “Since the first moment, the government has acted with total commitment, not just on the strict compliance of the protocols on the police and army actions. But also with total and absolute protection of fundamental human rights,” he said. It is unclear whether the policy change will have any measurable impact on the violence. Last week, President Piñera acknowledged there have been some abuses, and said they would be investigated. “I think there have been excesses, abuses, noncompliance with the protocols, noncompliance with the rules of use of force, bad judgment or crimes,” Mr. Piñera said. When Mr. González, the hospital assistant was shot, he said that an officer loaded him into a police van and withheld medical attention until hours later, when they deposited him at a public hospital.  “They were taunting me, saying that I will lose my sight, that I’ll have one less eye,” Mr. González said. On Wednesday, Dr. Torres operated on Mr. González, and extracted from his left eye the same black rubber-metal ball she’s seen in other patients. Her prognosis was grim: he will keep his eye, but because of damage to his retinal and optic nerves, he will lose all but five percent of his vision. ']",A bandaged eye is now so common among people protesting inequality in Chile that it has become a rallying symbol.
Afghanistan’s Curse: A Bomb From 2 Wars Ago Crushes a Family Today,2019-11-21,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fatima Faizi,"['DAHANA-E-AHANGARAN, Afghanistan — The three boys were buried on the southern face of the mountain in May. The side-by-side graves of the brothers Amir Khan and Liaqat are marked with a green flag. Mujtaba’s grave is covered in a rocky mound and light from the morning sun. It was a Soviet bomb, dropped from an aircraft decades before in 1986, that killed them this spring in Bamiyan Province. The crudely welded silver cylinder, just bigger than a soda can, was one of many others ejected from a cluster bomb as it fell through the sky before resting in a shaded rocky ravine for 33 years.  Accounts of children finding old bombs and accidentally setting them off have become a central part of Afghanistan’s story, horrifying in how frequently it is repeated. The deaths of the boys in Bamiyan, a relative haven from the fighting all around the country, are a particularly cruel example of the hidden dangers in Afghanistan.  War after war, piling on each other for decades, has left Afghanistan covered in more than 1,000 square miles of mines, unexploded munitions, roadside bombs and shuttered firing ranges, according to Afghan government data. Many hazards have been marked, cordoned off, cleared or avoided.  But many also remain undiscovered. In 2018 alone, around 118 civilians were wounded or killed each month from buried explosives in Afghanistan, according to Afghan government data, a threefold increase since 2013.  Each one, the result of an often-forgotten battle or error, has the power to permanently devastate families and their communities. That was the case on the mountain that looms over the boys’ village: Dahana-e-Ahangaran, a small collection of compounds forming a peninsula of green trees and potato fields along a single dirt road into the surrounding hills. Before May 17, when the bomb exploded, the sandstone mountain was a playground, a place for families to hike or gather, a grazing stop for livestock. Now it is a crime scene, feared and avoided, a shrine of grief. Ultimately, it will be logged as a data point in a galaxy of charts and graphs attempting to describe the destruction inflicted on this country over generations.  For Mohammad Bakhsh, Amir Khan and Liaqat’s father, the mountain has been a lifelong landmark in his back yard. He is 45 now, and was just 6 when the outcropping briefly turned into a battleground. Back then, it was an outpost for the American-supported insurgents who were fighting Soviet invaders. The mountain’s elevation, boulders and view of the surrounding valleys made for ample protection against the military convoys navigating the single road below. Mr. Bakhsh says he does not recall much of the fighting other than that the insurgents had the high ground and the Soviets did not. He does not remember the plane that dropped the bomb that would one day kill his sons and their friend. And he does not remember the day the Soviets killed his father, who was among those fighting the Russians in a nearby village. In the years after, the Soviets left the country, there was a civil war, the Taliban took power, and then the American-led invasion began in 2001.  Dahana-e-Ahangaran has remained almost entirely sheltered from the violence since then: 18 years of relative peace, carrot picking and potato farming.  For Mr. Bakhsh’s sons, and for much of the rest of their community, the mountain was a place both to escape and to forage for refuse that could be sold at the bazaar. Shopkeepers bought scrap metal from its slopes and the ferula plants that grew out of the sand and could be ground up for medicinal use. “I didn’t force them to work, I wanted them to have a better future,” Mr. Bakhsh said of his sons. Liaqat was 14, Amir Khan was 12. On May 17, Mr. Bakhsh, a taxi driver in winter and a potato farmer in summer, started the day by having the boys help push-start their beaten blue station wagon, shoving it down the village’s road until the engine finally caught. It was a daily part of their routine when Mr. Bakhsh was not in the fields. The two boys had already made plans that morning. Alongside Mujtaba, 13, and other boys from their school, Amir Khan and Liaqat — bags in hand for anything they could find and sell — announced they were both “going to the mountain.” Around 11 a.m., an hour or so after Mr. Bakhsh dropped his sons off on the main road that skirts the foot of the mountain, he heard an explosion. Everyone heard it, he said, but he thought little else about the blast until he got home that night.  His four other children were inside their small, mud-walled compound, ready to break their daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan. But Amir Khan and Liaqat were not back from the mountain yet. Mr. Bakhsh, his heart sinking, gathered a dozen people to search through the night. They found the bodies the next morning. United Nations deminers began excavating the area in October, steadily piling up a small set-piece of the Afghan-Soviet war: A Russian parachute flare, steel ammunition tins. Shell casings from Kalashnikovs and heavy machine guns.  The deminers also found one unexploded artillery shell and two Soviet-era bombs like the one that killed the boys. The munitions were destroyed. On the mine-clearing team’s hand-sketched map, the symbol that depicts the site of the explosion looks like a red rising sun. It is simply labeled “accident point.” There is no mention of the boys’ injuries, or the fact that the only way to identify them after the blast was by what clothes they were wearing. Zahra Hassani, a 26-year-old deminer from Bamiyan, said it was the first time she had responded to such an accident. “Clearing this area makes me nervous,” she said, referring to where the bomb exploded. “But this is about kids’ lives.” The bomb that killed the three boys is an AO-1SCh, the Russian designation roughly translating as cast-iron fragmenting munition. The small, poorly welded can — one of 150 or so ejected from a larger canister as it was dropped — contains about 40 grams of high explosives within its cartoonish-looking frame. Soviet cluster munitions are not the only ones littering Afghanistan. Between 2001 and 2002, the United States dropped roughly 1,228 cluster munitions of its own in the country, killing at least 60 civilians. More conventional ordnance dropped by American, NATO and Afghan forces in the years since has added to the threat. And there is more: the pernicious improvised bombs the Taliban hide to attack convoys and patrols. They are one of the leading causes of civilian casualties in recent years.  Nobody knows exactly what set off the bomb that killed the boys. Some in the village said the boys were throwing rocks at it, others said they were trying to pick it up and sell its parts for scrap, even though they had been taught about the dangers of unexploded ordnance and mines in school.  Samiullah, 14, one of the boys who accompanied the three up the mountain, spent the morning with them before returning. They were not finding enough metal to fill their bags, so he wanted to return home. “I told them take my bread in case you’re hungry later, and I left,” Samiullah said. He will not go near the mountain now. The three boys were buried on the mountain because Dahana-e-Ahangaran’s cemetery was full. In the days afterward, Mr. Bakhsh donated his sons’ clothes to the roughly 30 families in the village. He kept two hooded sweatshirts that his younger children now wear.  Every Friday, at 7 a.m., the family piles into the blue station wagon to drive to the foot of the mountain and take the 10-minute hike up to the grave-studded plateau.  Now, without his oldest boys, Mr. Bakhsh has no one at home to help push-start the car. So on a recent Friday, with a cold frost on his fields, Mr. Bakhsh patiently waited until his neighbors appeared, placed their hands on the bumper and pushed.  John Ismay contributed reporting from Washington.']","This time, it was a Soviet cluster bomb, killing 3 boys on a now-peaceful mountain. War after war has left Afghanistan littered with thousands of deadly next times."
The Jungle Prince of Delhi,2019-11-22,,"['For 40 years, journalists chronicled the eccentric royal family of Oudh, deposed aristocrats who lived in a ruined palace in the Indian capital. It was a tragic, astonishing story. But was it true? By Ellen Barry NEW DELHI — On a spring afternoon in 2016, when I was working in India, I received a telephone message from a recluse who lived in a forest in the middle of Delhi. The message was passed on by our office manager through Gchat, and it thrilled me so much that I preserved it. Office manager: Ellen have you been trying to get in touch with the royal family of Oudh? Ellen: this has to be the best telephone message ever Office manager: It was quite strange! The secretary left precise instructions for when you should call her — tomorrow between 11 am and 12 noon Ellen: oh my god I knew about the royal family of Oudh, of course. They were one of the city’s great mysteries. Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shiite Muslim royal line. There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.  An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one. Every few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls. I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence. This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered. A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling. The day after I got the message, I dialed the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5:30 in the afternoon, as instructed. The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages — everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species.” We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light. Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.  These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story! The person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next. Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts. “I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone. He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. [Update: Mystery of the royal family of Oudh unravels a bit more.] Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings; one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter. I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance. The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat.  Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.  Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation — democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism — is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours. My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognized quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh. “I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.” When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back. It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about? The story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh. Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her. She settled in the V.I.P. waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.” The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years. “Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission. “They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.” The begum’s behavior was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom. “The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time. Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shiite population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused. “It was such a romantic image,” Mr. Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.” Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees so that they could set up a household in Lucknow. “In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.” In the months that followed, Mr. Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilizing; once, Mr. Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached. “Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.” Around this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station,” a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice.” People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.” Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions — she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning,” United Press International reported — and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all. In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again. My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions — exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality. So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away. And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station. When our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I traveled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighborhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived. There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway? His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalized, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat. Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.” One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely. I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not; and a tarpaulin and a recording of “Fiddler on the Roof,” which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s. Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek — his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper — and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said. He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “O.K., you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.” We had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins — anything, really — and he was twisting away from me. “You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.” In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to commit suicide. “So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said. I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders. Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC. I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labeled “Prince Cyrus.” I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another. And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them. It was the guards at the military facility next door — they called him “rajah,” or king — who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, he was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream. Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin. I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into hemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of hemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital. “Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.” Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.” His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor. I climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions. It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious — O.K., obsessively curious — about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.  When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as though a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail. Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s division. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did — what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves? This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers. I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognize their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.  Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along — as he had strung me along — and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand. Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors.” Two paragraphs had been marked. “Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.” Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother.” The other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative. “I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalog of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man. “For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid,” and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire. Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Company had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina. Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies.” He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans. The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company.” The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah. “The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.” The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious: The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall. I returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city. This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt. Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims. When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shiites. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum — so convinced that she was their returning queen — that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect. “It wasn’t just me — the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.” But the older men who presided over the neighborhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian Army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials. “She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Mr. Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.” The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognized Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Mr. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed. “To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.” His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.” Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighborhood gossip unbottled after 40 years. I returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky rowhouses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan. I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pajamas. He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose. He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful. Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts. They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret. Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife. Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, (whom she despised) and her husband (whom she adored). The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer; in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once. She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act.” “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realized it was all built on sand.” Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani. “I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.” I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death — he called him Mickey — and that no one knew exactly where he was buried. “I should have saved him,” he said. Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani Air Force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas. I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.” Two of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom. The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking. She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time. “Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered. “Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.” “She was lying,” Khalida said. I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated. “Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.” “Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.” Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker. It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasized to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers. On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition. On June 3, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumors of violence if they stayed. Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave. But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father — a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses — was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.  He soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry; over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.  “We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.” Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behavior became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him. This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier.  She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that — the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients. “It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.” Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.” When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewelry, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here. Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me. “We had to start all over again,” he said.  In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behavior, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasized to become an epic one. They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina; Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere. The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret. Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past; it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind. There is no nice way to put this. I am unraveling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark. I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone. I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable. “He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook. My colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realized that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally. He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death. He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?” As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Mr. Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?” I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Mr. Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realized.  “If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.']",
"Evo Morales Raises a Fist, but Knows His Presidency is Over",2019-11-23,By Elisabeth Malkin and Elda Cantú,"['MEXICO CITY — Evo Morales, the ousted president of Bolivia, now lives in exile on a military base in Mexico City, where he says he spends much of the day taking calls from Bolivians pleading for his help. More than 3,000 miles from his country, where politicians are threatening to have him arrested if he returns, Mr. Morales is still trying to carry on as the president who delivers for his constituents — in his eyes, the savior of Bolivia.  And yet, Mr. Morales seemed to acknowledge during an interview that his time in power — and his worldwide renown as Bolivia’s first Indigenous president — had come to an end.  After almost 14 years in power, he left the country with what he said was little more than the clothes on his back. He had run for a fourth term, and declared himself the winner, but the election result was in dispute.  With protesters blocking the streets, and his police and military turning against him, he was spirited out of the country by a Mexican military plane and arrived in Mexico City on Nov. 12. It all happened so fast that he left behind his Bolivian passport, he said. “I am already Mexican. Look,” he joked, brandishing his new Mexican immigration permit at the start of an interview at the offices of The New York Times in Mexico City on Friday.  He was driven to the interview in a sport utility vehicle and hustled from the street into the building by Mexico’s equivalent of the secret service.  In a photo session, he raised a fist in the defiant gesture of a revolutionary leader. He said that he is still the president of his country, at least until Jan. 22, when his term officially ends, and should be allowed to return to Bolivia to finish out the last two months of his presidency.  “Here, what can we do?” he asked, regret in his voice. “We have to defend, not just defend Evo, defend the social programs.” He is convinced that there is a resounding call for him to return to Bolivia, and that the country cannot progress without him. His party, which has a majority in congress, has proposed granting him and his inner circle immunity from prosecution, according to a local news report. But events in Bolivia’s administrative capital, La Paz, have rushed forward since he left. Amid continuing protests by his supporters and violent crackdowns by security forces, his own party and the opposition are working on passing legislation that would pave the way for new elections, The Associated Press reported.  He shrugged off statements from some in his own party that they will run new candidates in new elections, declaring that it’s only “some compañeros who I think are not listening to the people’s clamorous demand.” He promised to support his party’s candidate for president, calling it an obligation. And he added that now that he is “freed from being president,” he will have more time to campaign for his party’s candidates.  In a tone far more subdued than in some other recent public appearances, he spoke nostalgically about his country. He said that he missed the coca leaf — a stimulant that many Bolivians chew: He is the longtime leader of the union of coca growers. He joked that Mexican food was a little too spicy, and that he had to learn to eat tortillas instead of quinoa. The Mexican government offered Mr. Morales asylum and welcomed him as it would a dignitary: He was greeted by the foreign minister when he landed in Mexico City and named a distinguished guest by the city’s mayor.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador assigned military officers who belonged to the disbanded presidential guard to protect him. The government settled him into a military facility that he has been told not to identify for security reasons.  He admitted that he now feels caged, beginning his days with a jog in the base’s gym at 6 a.m. He lives there with a small entourage that accompanied him into exile, including his vice president, Alvaro García Linera, and his health minister, Dr. Gabriela Montaño. His two children, he said, were expected to arrive in Argentina on Saturday, and were not planning to come to Mexico.  He spends his days giving interviews to the media, he said, his voice trailing off.  He spoke with longing for the days when he traveled through Bolivia with the power to oversee the building of public projects for Bolivia’s Indigenous communities, the poorest people in one of the poorest countries in South America. “I miss that,” he said. “Delivering public works, approving new works, knowing Bolivia better, its needs. That is the job. For me you do not govern just in the palace, you govern in every part of the country.” But he had no regrets, he said — not about his decision to run for a fourth term, or the presidential election in October that set off rioting after he declared that he had won.  He said that he resigned the presidency three weeks later to save the lives of his supporters whose houses had been burned down by opponents.  He decided to leave for Mexico he said, to save lives, perhaps even his own. He said that a member of his security team had showed him an anonymous text message claiming that there was a $50,000 bounty on his head to arrest or even kill him.  It was not the step that a revolutionary would take, he acknowledged, quoting Fidel Castro’s slogan “Fatherland or Death.” He said that he resisted at first, but his ministers persuaded him to leave.  The Mexican government sent a plane but for hours it was unable to land, as the Bolivian military placed bureaucratic obstacles in its way. Finally, a full day after he resigned, the plane took off.  “When we were in the airplane, I said, ‘our lives are safe,’” he recalled.  While he was on his way out, he said he heard that the United States government had spoken to his foreign minister and offered to send its own plane to take him out of the country. He said that he had joked, “Maybe they will take me to Guantánamo.” Washington and his political opponents were determined to keep him out of Bolivia, he said. “I am not desperate to be president, but they should give me my political rights, so that I can go back,” he said. “Why are they so afraid of Evo?”   ']",
"Four Years After ‘Sunny Ways,’ a Muted Restart for Justin Trudeau",2019-11-22,By Ian Austen,"['Prime Minister Trudeau faced anger from parts of Western Canada as he began his second term in office with a low-key ceremony. By Ian Austen Because it’s 2019, the swearing in of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s new cabinet this week was a dramatically different affair than his first such ceremony four years ago. His speech in front of Rideau Hall, where Governor-General Julie Payette presided over the actual ceremony on Wednesday, was brief. There were no rhetorical flights like his earlier declaration of “sunny ways” that would likely become catchphrases.  In 2015, two giant television screens on the grounds of the governor general’s mansion revealed the new ministers as they were sworn in to a large and enthusiastic crowd. Back then particularly loud cheers rose from Indigenous people among them when Jody Wilson-Raybould was called up to to become justice minister. Her name, of course, was not uttered by anyone this time around. This week, those screens were absent, which was just as well. By my count, the crowd, excluding journalists and officials, never exceeded a dozen people. Until a member of Mr. Trudeau’s staff intervened, the handful of spectators were kept at a distance by security guards from which they had little hope of hearing the prime minister’s remarks, let alone aspiring to posing for a selfie with him.  Mansoora Tahir told me she was in the crowd for the much bigger show in 2015 and thought it was important to turn up again, adding that she was “destined for a Trudeau selfie.” She was accompanied by her daughter, Nimra Ahmed, who works as a mechanical engineer at the oil sands north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. “Last time it was a big shift after the Conservatives being in power for years,” Ms. Ahmed said. “This time they didn’t win a majority so it’s more toned down.” In the end, Ms. Tahir was not blessed by fate. Very much unlike in 2015, Mr. Trudeau didn’t pose for a single selfie. Ms. Ahmed said that she cast her vote for the Liberals, putting her in Alberta’s political minority. Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal party was shut out there and also in neighboring Saskatchewan. A week earlier I’d been in Alberta to write an article about the province’s feverish political temperature. [Read: Trudeau Won the Election, but Hasn’t Won Over Western Canada] At times, it was almost impossible to escape political talk. One night I had dinner at the Longview Steakhouse just north of the Alberta town of the same name. As the locals promised, the meal matched the extraordinary mountain view.  As I was about to leave, two couples sat down at an adjacent table. Their dinner conversation immediately turned to an arcane discussion of how the federal government redistributes revenue between the provinces and whether Alberta should pull out of the Canada Pension Plan — both ideas raised by Premier Jason Kenney as a way to pull back from the rest of the country. While talk of Western separation, or Wexit, came up several times during my trip, it doesn’t appear to be a serious threat at this point, even if few people are going as far as Naheed Nenshi, Calgary’s mayor, who called it “idiotic” this week.  The West’s anger and alienation came up a few times during Mr. Trudeau’s news conference this week. His new cabinet saw Chrystia Freeland, who was born and raised in Alberta but who now lives in Toronto, elevated to the honorary position of deputy prime minister. She was also moved from foreign affairs to being the federal government’s point person on relations with the provinces. Her new job may make dealing with President Trump seem easy by comparison. Jim Carr, a Liberal member of Parliament from Manitoba who is currently being treated for a form of blood cancer, will act as the prime minister’s special adviser on issues affecting the prairies. And, as he did on election night, Mr. Trudeau tried to assure Alberta and Saskatchewan that even if they don’t have someone in the cabinet, they won’t be ignored. “We are responding to the caucus we were given, we very much would have liked to have had ministers from the west elected,” Mr. Trudeau said in the chilly, if light breeze. “We’re going to work very hard for every region of the country.” Based on my experience, Albertans will certainly be watching. A combination of the weak Canadian dollar and United States border inspections during which, according to the head of an American chamber of commerce, Canadians ”are being treated like criminals,” is crimping the economies of some American border towns.  The activist Almaas Elman had returned to her native Somalia from Canada to help promote social justice and women’s rights and to rehabilitate children affected by Somalia’s decades-long war. This week, in an apparent targeted attack, she was shot dead in Mogadishu. Hayley Wickenheiser, who is widely seen as the greatest female hockey player in history, isn’t slacking off in retirement, Curtis Rush reports. She’s studying at the University of Calgary to become an emergency room doctor, while also working as the assistant director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Now the 41-year-old has been named to the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Canadian musician Neil Young has long made his home in the United States. But his fondness for marijuana may derail his aspiration to acquire American citizenship so that he can vote in next year’s presidential election.  Some Canadian women are at the forefront of a movement to end the domination of real estate development by men. “Canada is now a rising tennis power,” writes Christopher Clarey, The Times’s resident expert on the sport, and the country is again demonstrating that at the Davis Cup. Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla of pickup trucks this week. The presentation didn’t go as planned. While reporting from the Tour de France, I was always impressed by the ability of Raymond Poulidor to draw a crowd decades after his retirement from cycling. I was even more impressed by the attention he gave to all of his well wishers. With some sadness, I’ve now written his obituary.

Would-Be Chinese Defector Details Covert Campaigns in Hong Kong and Taiwan,2019-11-23,By Steven Lee Myers and Damien Cave,"['BEIJING — A man claiming to be a disillusioned Chinese intelligence operative has told the Australian authorities that China’s military intelligence agencies were directly intervening in politics in Hong Kong and Taiwan, buying media coverage, infiltrating universities, funneling donations to favored candidates and creating thousands of social media accounts to attack Taiwan’s governing party. So far, some Western diplomatic officials believe the claims by an asylum seeker named Wang Liqiang to be reliable at least in part, according to two people briefed on the matter. While some of his details appeared speculative and impossible to verify, the officials were taking his claims seriously, the people said.  If verified, his account would be one of the most detailed ever made public of China’s covert measures to manipulate politics and public opinion in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Mr. Wang’s account, a 17-page plea for political asylum in Australia, reads in parts like an espionage thriller. He detailed code names of covert operations, shadowy business ventures and ultimately his dawning disenchantment with what he described as China’s efforts to stifle democracy and human rights around the world. “I do not want to see Taiwan becoming a second Hong Kong,” he wrote. “And I would not become an accomplice in the conspiracy of turning an originally democratic and free land into autocratic land.” The office of Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed receiving Mr. Wang’s statement, which was first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. An English translation was provided to The New York Times by a person familiar with his request for asylum. The people familiar with Mr. Wang’s statement requested anonymity because his allegations are still being investigated. On Sunday, the Chinese government answered Mr. Wang’s allegations by saying he was a convicted swindler who had been sentenced to more than a year in prison in a 2016 fraud case and was wanted by the Shanghai police in a case from earlier this year.   Mr. Wang’s statement to the Australian authorities surfaced as protests continue to convulse Hong Kong, driven in large part by concerns over the steady encroachment of Communist Party rule despite Beijing’s pledge to respect the former British colony’s economic and political autonomy.  In his account, Mr. Wang said he was involved with the apprehension by Chinese agents in 2015 of five booksellers in Hong Kong, an incident often cited by demonstrators. He said he received orders “to pay close attention” to one of them, Lee Bo, for his involvement in publishing a gossipy book called “Xi Jinping and His Six Women” that purported to delve into the personal life of China’s top leader. The statement also emerged only weeks before Taiwan’s presidential election in January. The campaign has already been shaken by allegations of Chinese interference. The governing party has accused China of supporting the opposition party, the Kuomintang.  “I have to repeat that China is factually interfering in Taiwan’s election, and it happens every day,” Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, said on Tuesday as she officially launched a re-election campaign. Beijing has made no secret of its opposition to Ms. Tsai and her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has sought to bolster Taiwan’s political and economic independence. Her challenger is Han Kuo-yu, a populist who was last year elected mayor of Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan, and who has promised to improve relations with the mainland. According to his account, Mr. Wang himself helped funnel campaign donations of roughly $2.8 million to Mr. Han in the 2018 elections. “Now that the 2020 presidential election is approaching, China will be putting much more efforts into it,” he wrote. Chao Chien-min, one of Mr. Han’s policy advisers, strongly disputed the accusations.  “How could Han Kuo-yu dare to casually accept 20 million renminbi in unknown money?” he said. “Does he still want to survive in Taiwan’s political arena? I believe that is impossible.”  Mr. Wang’s allegations seem certain to reverberate widely in Taiwan, in Hong Kong and on the mainland. Although China’s intelligence operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong have long been presumed to be robust, the statement provided an extraordinary amount of detail.  “We had an inkling this was happening, but we have never had evidence or an insider’s account,” Adam Ni, a researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney who has been recently working in Taiwan, said in a telephone interview. With the elections in Taiwan, for example, Mr. Wang described how the separate branches of China’s military divided up their labors.  Mr. Wang said intelligence efforts included creating more than 20 media and internet companies to launch “targeted attacks,” and spending roughly $200 million over an unspecified period to invest in television stations in Taiwan. His statement did not explain how such a large sum of money failed to be noticed or raise alarms. The disclosures could also further sour relations between China and Australia, which recently passed a law seeking to rein in foreign interference after several wealthy Chinese businessmen tied to Beijing were accused of trying to manipulate Australian politics.  One of those businessmen, Huang Xiangmo, was a successful developer who had his Australian residency canceled in February. According to Mr. Wang’s statement, Mr. Huang led a group of Australian state and local lawmakers to visit Hong Kong, where they met with Mr. Wang’s boss, a man named Xiang Xin. Mr. Huang, who has previously rejected the claim that he has tried to interfere in Australian politics on behalf of Beijing, could not be reached for comment.  These kinds of connections between Australian lawmakers, Chinese wealth and officials whose Communist Party ties are masked by big business have put much of Australia on edge. Earlier this week, the former head of Australia’s main foreign intelligence agency described China’s espionage efforts as “insidious.” Mr. Wang described himself as the son of a public servant, but little else is known about him, including his age and hometown. He could not be reached for comment. One clue from his statement is that he studied to be a painter, winning awards in Anhui Province in eastern China.  Seeking a job, he ended up at an investment firm called China Innovation Investment Limited, run by Mr. Xiang. Mr. Wang wrote that the company was in fact a front for an arm of China’s Ministry of National Defense to conduct a range of political and economic espionage. Mr. Xiang, 54, is an owner or top director at more than a dozen Hong Kong companies. Some of the companies are co-owned by his wife, Gong Qing, whose biography includes positions at two government-tied institutions. One of those was the China National Science and Technology Information Center, a military intelligence organization within the People’s Liberation Army.  Asked to comment, Mr. Xiang denied any knowledge of Mr. Wang. “I never knew Wang,” he wrote in an email. China Innovation Investments is registered in the Cayman Islands and publicly traded in Hong Kong. The company focuses on both private and public investments related to the “integration of military and civil sectors,” according to company documents. Mr. Xiang is the chairman and Ms. Gong is listed as an alternative director. The operations in Hong Kong Mr. Wang described occurred before the protests erupted. He said he became disillusioned when he was tasked to travel to Taiwan in May to take part in operations related to the coming election. He received a false identity with a South Korean passport and a predated French visa, which was mailed to him from the National University of Defense Technology in Hunan Province. His wife, also a painter, moved to Australia to study in 2012, he wrote. After visiting her and their child in December 2018, he decided to defect and seek asylum.  It is far from clear that he will receive it.  In 2005, Chen Yonglin, a Chinese consular official, sought asylum, promising to divulge details of China’s spy network. The Australian government initially rejected his request, prompting a parliamentary inquiry. It found that he was told the denial was “for reasons of foreign affairs.” Mr. Chen’s application was later approved.  Mr. Wang suggested he understood that Australia might again need to be persuaded before standing up for a single defector. He condemned China’s autocratic ways, expressing his “resolute opposition to the actions imposed by the Communist Party of China that trample on democracy, human rights and freedom.”  “If I return to the place under their control,” he added, “I will surely be killed for disclosing the secrets because I know too much.”  Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Damien Cave from Sydney.

Prince Andrew’s Friendship With Epstein Joins a List of Royal Scandals,2019-11-21,By Megan Specia and Alan Yuhas,"['LONDON —\xa0The British monarchy has survived public crises before — religious schisms, revolutions, murderous kings — but this week the royal family scrambled to confront a relatively new opponent: the embarrassing televised interview.  The Duke of York, better known as Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, struggled to defend himself during a 50-minute interview with the BBC as he talked about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier accused of sex trafficking. His interview, widely criticized in the British press as disastrous after it was broadcast last weekend, catapulted a long-simmering controversy into a full-blown scandal for the royal family, among the worst in its modern history. Reacting to the backlash, the prince announced on Wednesday that he was indefinitely stepping away from public life, with permission from the queen. But over the past century, a number of scandals have rattled the British royal family.  The prince’s relationship with Mr. Epstein, whom he met in 1999, has been under scrutiny for years. In the BBC interview, the prince said he had attended dinner parties in which Mr. Epstein hosted “cosmopolitan” figures from politics, academia and business, and the men visited each other’s homes several times.  But Prince Andrew said he had seen “no indication” of wrongdoing by Mr. Epstein at the time. In 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution, and served 13 months in a Florida county jail under a widely criticized plea deal. After his release in 2010, Prince Andrew stayed at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion and was widely criticized for continuing the relationship.  This summer, after the financier was arrested on federal charges and details of allegations against him began to emerge, attention again turned to Prince Andrew’s friendship. In August, Mr. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail. One of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said that Mr. Epstein had trafficked her to Prince Andrew, and that the prince had sex with her three times, an accusation that he denies. As pressure mounted, the prince agreed to the BBC interview. But the response to the broadcast was immediate and vocal, especially around what appeared to be the prince’s lack of sympathy for Mr. Epstein’s victims. Businesses and organizations associated with the prince quickly distanced themselves from him. Prince Andrew was not the first royal of his generation to find himself under fire after a televised interview. His older brother, Prince Charles, in an effort to win back popularity after separating from his first wife, Diana, agreed to appear in a 1994 documentary. But when the prince confessed to adultery, he immediately lost the good will he had been desperately trying to rebuild.  Their father, Prince Philip, said at the time that he did not understand why his son would air his troubles in public, but the interview had been approved in advance by Queen Elizabeth.  A year later, Princess Diana said in an interview that “there were three of us in this marriage,” referring to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his second wife. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after years of separation.  The next year, after Diana died in a car accident in Paris while being followed by the paparazzi, the royal family came under fire for appearing to be “indifferent to the country’s sorrow.” Two decades before Prince Charles’s divorce, the divorce of his aunt, Princess Margaret, from the Earl of Snowdon scandalized the royal family.  For decades, Margaret had found herself at the center of scrutiny from within the royal family and from the public, mostly centered on her love life, at times drawing sympathy and at others attracting admonishment.  Her fun-loving nature and glamorous lifestyle — with parties, extravagant clothes and celebrity friends — became a staple of the British press. But her romance in the 1950s with Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a divorced royal aide, was a tipping point. Her sister, Queen Elizabeth, was head of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. And with memories of the uproar surrounding the abdication of King Edward VIII to marry a twice-divorced American still fresh, there was intense pressure on Princess Margaret to end the affair. The princess chose not to step away from royal life and marry him.  Nearly a decade later, she fell for a photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, who became the Earl of Snowdon after they married. But their tumultuous relationship ended in divorce in 1976.  Princess Margaret’s love life became a major plot point in the Netflix period series “The Crown,” which explores the inner world of the royal family.  Queen Elizabeth’s 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has found himself in hot water over offhand comments to the press. Unlike his wife, who maintains a measured public persona, he can be blunt and prone to gaffes.  Some of his comments have been offensive or outright racist. “If you stay here much longer, you’ll all be slitty-eyed,” he told British students in China during a 1986 visit. “It looks as if it was put in by an Indian,” he said in 1999, pointing to an old-fashioned fuse box in a factory in Scotland. “Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed,” he said during the 1981 recession.  Early this year, he gave up his driver’s license after a collision on a rural road north of London raised questions about his abilities behind the wheel. Two days after the crash, he was photographed driving without his seatbelt fastened and was reprimanded by a police officer.  In the 1920s, Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth’s uncle, was so well known for his indulgences that he was the subject of a song: “I danced with a man who danced with a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales.”  But it was a relationship with one particular woman that ultimately shook the royal family.  In 1930, he met Wallis Simpson, a married woman from Baltimore who traveled in the same high-society circles. After the death of his father, King George V, Edward pursued her despite the opposition of his mother, Queen Mary, and the prime minister at the time, Stanley Baldwin.  When the prince succeeded his father to the throne in 1936, a standoff ensued. Mrs. Simpson sought a divorce from her husband, and the British government advised the new king against marrying her.  The government tried to keep the story out of the British press, but American newspapers broke the news. Within months, King Edward abdicated the throne, saying that it was “impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility” and to remain in power “without the help and support of the woman I love.”  The couple were dogged for years by accusations of being Nazi sympathizers. She denied supporting Hitler, but in 1935 Edward urged members of the British Legion to visit Germany, and in 1937 the couple met Hitler in Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps, embarrassing Edward’s brother, King George VI.  Footage taken in the early 1930s showed Edward raising his hand in the style of a Nazi salute, alongside his mother and niece, the future Queen Elizabeth, who was then 6 or 7, in an apparent pantomime. Megan Specia reported from London, and Alan Yuhas from New York.']",A highly scorned televised interview by the prince was only the latest upheaval to befall Britain’s royal family over the past century.
"Viking Treasure Could Have Made Them a Fortune. Instead, They Stole It.",2019-11-22,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — More than 1,000 years ago, a Viking hoard of gold jewelry, coins and silver bars was buried for safekeeping. The trove stayed hidden until 2015, when two men dug up the treasure in a field in Eye, near the town of Leominster, in western England. On Friday, the men — George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, both from Wales  — were handed lengthy prison terms.  The men, who used metal detectors to unearth the coins, were punished for failing to follow Britain’s rules on reporting discoveries of treasure. Instead, they hid some of the items, estimated to be worth millions of pounds, and sold others to dealers. The pair were sentenced at Worcester Crown Court on Friday on charges of theft, conspiracy to conceal criminal property and conspiracy to convert criminal property. Mr. Powell received a total term of 10 years, and Mr. Davies was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years. Two other men, Simon Wicks and Paul Wells, were also convicted on Thursday on a charge of concealment for their involvement in the case.  Mr. Powell and Mr. Davies were not punished for discovering the historically significant trove. In fact, rewards are often given to people who find treasure in Britain.  The judge told Mr. Powell and Mr. Davies that the “irony in the case” was that if they had followed the correct procedure, they might have been in line to receive up to half the value between them, the BBC reported. “But you wanted more,” the judge told them. According to the Treasure Act in Britain, anyone who believes they have found a metal object more than 300 years old is required to report it to the authorities within two weeks. A judgment is then made on whether the discovery meets the definition of “treasure.” Later, a valuation would be given, rewards may be offered and museums have the chance to claim the objects.  Instead of following the rules, Mr. Powell and Mr. Davies kept quiet and soon began selling the valuable coins to private collectors.  The hoard, a mix of ninth- and 10th-century objects, included Anglo-Saxon coins, a gold ring and gold band, silver bars, and a crystal rock pendant, according to a police statement. Photographs of the artifacts in a freshly dug hole were found deleted on Mr. Davies’s phone by the authorities. Despite a yearslong investigation, only 30 of the 300 coins the men are thought to have found have been recovered, in addition to some pieces of jewelry and a silver ingot. The rest of the treasures are missing, presumed hidden or sold, according to West Mercia Police, the force that covers much of western England. Because so much of the hoard has not been recovered, it has been difficult to estimate the true value. One collector who bought 16 of the coins estimated the trove as worth more than 3 million pounds, or about $3.8 million. Experts said the objects would have offered a unique window on a crucial moment of British history. Among the ancient coins that have been recovered are some rare “Two Emperor” examples that show a previously unknown alliance between the rulers of Mercia and Wessex, two early kingdoms. “This is a really important moment in history,” said Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coins and Viking collections at the British Museum. “The coins have given us a changed understanding of history.”  In an interview on Friday, Mr. Williams lamented the fact that the rest of the coins had not yet been found.  “It is entirely possible that there are other rarities in the missing part of the hoard,” he said.  “If we do not recover the missing items,” Mr. Williams added, “these men have not just stolen the objects, but they are stealing our history too.” ']","Two British men who uncovered a 1,100-year-old trove were sentenced to years in prison for failing to report the find and selling the items piecemeal to dealers."
Pakistan Blames India for Its Air Pollution. Its Citizens Disagree.,2019-11-22,By Maria Abi-Habib and Salman Masood,"['A new front in the decades-long rivalry between India and Pakistan has emerged: which country is more responsible for the choking air pollution that straddles their shared, hostile border. As residents of Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, complained of shortness of breath, stinging eyes and nausea from thick, acrid smog that they compare to living in the smoke of a camp fire, the country’s minister of state for climate change smelled a conspiracy.  “Misinformation is being spread about Lahore air quality,” the minister, Zartaj Gul Wazir wrote on Twitter, before going on to blame India for the majority of the air pollution afflicting Pakistan. “It is nowhere as bad as being asserted by vested elements.”  The term “vested elements” is code for Pakistan’s enemies, India chief among them. On many winter days, Lahore competes with India’s capital, Delhi, for the unflattering distinction of the world’s most polluted city. But while Delhi has slowly woken up to the danger of its hazardous air quality and put in place some — although not enough — government action to tackle it, Lahore has been much slower to respond, let alone recognize the problem. On Friday, Amnesty International issued an “urgent action” for Lahore, its first ever appeal for the population of an entire city. The rights group rebuked the Pakistani government for denying Lahore’s 11 million residents the ability to live in a healthy environment.  “The government’s inadequate response to the smog in Lahore raises significant human rights concerns,” said Rimmel Mohydin, a South Asia analyst at Amnesty International, in a statement. “The hazardous air is putting everyone’s right to health at risk.”  The Pakistani government must “stop downplaying the crisis and take urgent action to protect people’s health and lives,” the statement said. The Pakistani government does not publish hourly updates on air pollution levels, and it has lowered its standards for what constitutes dangerous levels of air pollution, often citing as healthy levels that are considered dangerous internationally. On Friday morning, Lahore’s air quality index level peaked at 385; any reading above 50 is considered to be unhealthy. In her Twitter messages late last month, Ms. Wazir, the country’s minister of state for climate change, appealed to Pakistanis to “only use our data for information.” She added, “Lahore is not at all ranked the most polluted city in the world.” But many of Lahore’s residents have little faith in the government’s numbers. And when Ms. Wazir in the same breath downplayed Pakistan’s air pollution and then blamed it on India, their suspicion and anger only deepened. “The environment minister’s statements are immature and defensive,” said Sarah N. Ahmad, a Lahore-based urban policy consultant. “Smog is not a political issue. It is a climate and policy issue. To politicize people’s health and well-being is very immature.”  Like many in Pakistan’s government, Ms. Wazir has blamed crop burning by north Indian farmers for sending toxic smog rolling across the border into Pakistan.  But Pakistani farmers also burn their crops, and Lahore is dotted with factories that emit dirty fumes while vehicular diesel fuel sends air pollution levels skyrocketing like clockwork every autumn and winter. Every year, as the weather cools, dangerous air particles known as PM 2.5 that are absorbed in the bloodstream and lung tissue sit thick in the atmosphere, the cold weighing them down to trap them above cities like Lahore. This is when Lahore’s dreaded “fifth season” kicks in.  The World Health Organization has said Pakistan’s air pollution likely causes 22,000 premature adult deaths every year. Lahore’s residents say that in the absence of government action, the air pollution is getting worse.  This year, for the first time, the government shut schools in Pakistan’s Punjab Province because of the thick smog encircling many of the province’s cities, including Lahore. So far this month, the government has closed schools three times. Three teenage students were so incensed by the lack of action, they filed a lawsuit against the government this month, accusing officials of “underreporting the severity of the situation.” “I feel this is the worst year — so far,” said Aatekah Mir-Khan, a resident of Lahore, adding that she no longer allows her son to play outdoors. “The next year might even be worse, and that’s the more disturbing thought.”  She added: “At the end of the day, when you take your clothes off, they smell of soot and smoke. Your eyes and the inside of your throat burn. You have perennial headaches and nausea. The government needs to take responsibility.”']","Pakistan’s minister for climate change blames India for toxic smog.

"Afghan Vote Crawls Toward Crisis, With No Results After 2 Months",2019-11-22,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Nearly two months after Afghans braved hundreds of Taliban attacks to cast ballots in a vote for president, the results have been repeatedly delayed, and protests have blocked election officials from auditing and recounting problematic votes in several provinces. No clear date has been set to release results, and opposition candidates have threatened to reject any figures announced by an election body that they say has made questionable decisions that favor the incumbent, Ashraf Ghani. With no solution in sight, the dispute threatens to erupt into a full-blown political crisis, straining the tenuous bonds holding together a country riven by ethnic fault-lines. It has also deepened doubts about a democracy that has been propped up at the cost of tens of thousands of Afghan lives and billions of dollars in international aid. The fragility of the system is being exposed again at a time when the stakes are particularly high: The war with the Taliban is intensifying, and the Trump administration appears determined, 18 years after the United States invaded Afghanistan, to significantly reduce the number of troops at all costs. The leading presidential candidates — Mr. Ghani and his chief rival, Abdullah Abdullah — are coalition partners in a messy government brokered by the United States when the previous elections in 2014 ended in a tense stalemate. Western diplomats in Kabul have repeatedly made it clear that the international community, particularly the United States, has no patience for brokering a similar deal this time. The confusion over who should be in charge in Kabul is the latest in a long series of conflicts and standoffs that have sorely tested the ability of competing Afghan leaders to hold and honor fair elections, and to cooperate well enough to govern. The uncertainty also significantly complicates any attempt to resume stalled American talks with the Taliban to reach a political settlement to the war, and it could prompt President Trump to reduce or pull out troops without such an agreement on the future of the country. After Mr. Trump in September snubbed a near-done deal, which United States diplomats had reached following a year of intense negotiations with the Taliban, the diplomats are trying small steps to keep the process alive. Last week they arranged a prisoner swap that exchanged three senior Taliban leaders in return for two Western professors — an American and an Australian — and 10 Afghan soldiers. It was unclear what, exactly, the Afghan government got out of the deal for releasing Anas Haqqani, a brother of the Taliban’s ruthless deputy and one of its most prized prisoners. Improving relations with Washington, which had soured over Mr. Ghani’s resistance to the United States deal with the Taliban, appeared to be part of the package. On Thursday, the Afghan government said that Mr. Trump had spoken to Mr. Ghani over the phone and extended an invitation to him to visit the White House. An early version of the statement by the presidential palace emphasized that the call was “25 minutes” long and that Mr. Trump had thanked Mr. Ghani for helping secure the Western hostages’ freedom. The timing of the invitation, while Mr. Ghani is stuck in the dispute over election results, will not go down well with opposition candidates, as Mr. Ghani’s team portrays it as proof that he still has the support of the United States. To prevent a repeat of successive fraudulent elections, Afghanistan introduced expensive new measures ahead of September’s presidential vote, including the capturing of fingerprints and photos of each voter at the time of polling. Mr. Ghani boasted that the technology would make it possible for results to be announced right away. Officials and diplomats in Kabul say that the fraud-mitigation measures significantly reduced the scope of ballot stuffing, but that expectations that technology could suddenly root out what has been an entrenched culture of winning by any means were unrealistic.  Little changed in the behavior of candidates, who often seemed less focused on campaigning and more on rigging and influencing the electoral process or maneuvering for a slice of power. While disputes in previous elections were over millions of stuffed ballots, the turnout this time was below two million, and the current, intense fight centers on about 300,000 votes that could decide whether Mr. Ghani or Mr. Abdullah won a majority in the first round or whether the election must go to a runoff. While much of the vote is divided between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah, nearly a dozen other candidates drew close to 200,000 of the votes in September, making it harder for either of the top contenders to reach 50 percent. With both candidates having claimed a lead, many observers say a runoff remains the likely outcome. Mr. Abdullah’s allies say they have lost faith in the election commission for relaxing its validity criteria after the voting, allowing ballots that should have been discarded to be either included in the tally or sent for auditing and a recount. Those include about 100,000 votes that the biometric data showed were cast before or after Election Day — some with a time difference of months. “When the rules and procedures are changed, the formula falls apart,” said Noor Rahman Akhlaqi, a member of Mr. Abdullah’s team. “There is an environment of complete mistrust now.” Election officials say the date discrepancies were probably caused by technical workers entering incorrect times and dates into the thousands of devices used to collect voter fingerprints and pictures before they cast their ballot. Voters should not be disenfranchised for mistakes made by others, the officials said. Mr. Akhalqi said the results of the current audit and recount, which Mr. Abdullah’s faction has boycotted, would be in no way acceptable. Hawa Alam Nuristani, the chairwoman of the Afghan election commission, said protesters were blocking her employees from entering their offices in about half a dozen mostly northern provinces to complete the audit and recount. “I don’t know the exact number of protesters now, but at one point there were about 2,000 people outside the election office, and they are not letting us enter our offices,” said Almas Awrangzoi, the election chief in northern Jawzjan Province. “They have large pots of rice cooking — they have rice during the day and during the night, and they are just there.” Mr. Ghani’s camp accuses Mr. Abdullah’s team of trying to create a crisis to drag the elections into a second round because they do not have the numbers to win the first. They say Mr. Abdullah has been latching onto anything to discredit the process, including making a false claim that security forces had opened fire and killed one of his observers during protests to block the audit. “When you follow the pattern of behavior of each candidate, until three weeks before the elections they didn’t even want an election,” said Dauod Sultanzoy, a senior member of Mr. Ghani’s campaign. “After the election, they knew they would not win. They cried wolf.” David Zucchino and Fahim Abed contributed reporting from Kabul, and Najim Rahim from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan.']","A dispute over a decisive slice of votes in the country’s presidential election is again exposing the fragility of Afghan democracy, as President Trump pushes for a drawdown of troops.

"Israelis Call Netanyahu Indictment an ‘Earthquake,’ but Agree on Little Else",2019-11-22,By David M. Halbfinger,"['LOD, Israel — Watching Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attack the prosecutors who had just indicted him, watching him beg for compassion for his family’s suffering through years of corruption investigations, Tzion Hagag said he began to question whether the rule of law was really all that worth preserving if it could be so unfair to such a great man. “We have the best prime minister in the world,” he said. “This democracy, what you call democratic — it’s killing our country. So let there be no democracy.” His wife, Tami Hagag, 38, who said she was every bit as right-wing as her husband, had already been giving him a scornful look. But this was too much. “So what, you want a dictatorship?” Ms. Hagag, 38, a pastry chef, interjected. “Enough is enough. He has to go, to free the government for someone else.” As Israel woke up to a new reality on Friday — its longtime premier now officially a defendant awaiting trial on criminal charges — interviews with voters from across the political spectrum kept landing on the same themes: Sadness. Worry. Disorientation. One word kept coming up: “Earthquake.” Mr. Netanyahu is determined to remain in power, but even some rock-solid Netanyahu voters who expressed doubts about the criminal charges said that it was untenable for him to try to continue in office while he defends himself in court. If that view is widely held, it signals a seismic shift in Israeli public opinion. Many younger Israelis cannot even remember life before the Netanyahu era. Many of his admirers, like Mr. Hagag, a 46-year-old taxi driver, do not want to imagine it ever coming to an end. “The more people attack him, the closer to him I feel,” he said while shopping with his wife at an outdoor market in downtown Lod’s Commando Square. Many others, however, are fed up with Mr. Netanyahu, and they welcomed his indictment like an answered prayer, whether out of outrage at the bribes he is accused of taking or out of anger at how he has sought to extend his tenure by inciting Jews against Arabs, right against left. Lod, the first railway hub of 19th-century Palestine, remains a crossroads of modern-day Israel: The Friday morning market is a melting pot of Jewish and Muslim women in head coverings, old Ethiopians in traditional garb, younger ones in jeans, ultra-Orthodox and Mizrahi men shouting barely decipherable sales pitches, all of them easily mixing in the packed passageways, forgiving the occasional bump. “Look around here: All the sectors of Israel are here,” said Marach Diab, 22, an Arab security guard, waving her metal-detecting wand toward the stalls stocked with winter socks and cheap electronics. “We all get along very well, but for politicians like him.”  Ms. Diab said she hoped that a new prime minister would address things she said Mr. Netanyahu had ignored, like skyrocketing costs of living that were making it impossible for young people like herself to get started in life. Mr. Netanyahu’s time was up, she said. “This man can no longer rule us. He’s like any citizen. He’s not God. He’s a man like everybody else.” The indictment does not legally require Mr. Netanyahu to step down, but it can weaken him at a delicate time in Israeli politics. After inconclusive elections in April and September, neither he nor his opponents have been able to form a governing coalition, which could force a third election.  Within official Israel on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu’s bid to stay in office while awaiting trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust stirred a churn of differing responses. The centrist Blue and White party, led by Mr. Netanyahu’s chief rival, Benny Gantz, called on the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, to instruct Mr. Netanyahu to resign, citing a legal precedent requiring an ordinary minister to step down if indicted.  Mr. Mandelblit, who announced the indictment Thursday night, said that he would issue an opinion next week on whether the indictment rendered Mr. Netanyahu ineligible to form a new government. A poll on Friday by an Israeli television station found that 56 percent of voters believed that Mr. Netanyahu cannot continue in his post. But a long, if incomplete, list of leading members of Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party expressed their support, as did members of allied right-wing parties. The transportation minister, Bezalel Smotrich, took up Mr. Netanyahu’s rallying cry against the law-enforcement system. He urged Israelis to “take to the streets” to protest the prime minister’s indictment or risk the onset of a “destructive, violent and dangerous legal dictatorship.” But another Netanyahu ally, the former justice minister Ayelet Shaked, spoke up for Mr. Mandelblit, calling him “an honest person” who acted on the evidence and with strictly professional motives. In a precautionary move, Israeli news media reported, security officials had beefed up protections for Mr. Mandelblit and two other top prosecutors overseeing the Netanyahu cases. In a speech Thursday night, Mr. Netanyahu called upon Israelis to trust him over the prosecutors. But while many self-described right-wing voters were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least to a degree, few were ready to go quite as far as Mr. Netanyahu seemed to be asking. “It’s a moment of truth for the people and for the legal establishment,” said Yaacov Tzvi, 85, reading the sports pages on the sunny side of a bench in Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. (“I was trying to ignore the front page,” he said.) “I have sympathy for him,” Mr. Tzvi said. “He’s contributed so much for Israel, he’s worked hard. But nobody should break the law. Nobody.” Meni Tveria, 36, said he could not take the prosecution seriously, given that in the worst charge, bribery, Mr. Netanyahu was accused of receiving not cash, but favorable press. “Seriously?” he said, scoffing. Mr. Tveria cited reports about witnesses being threatened, worried that there was no one in any party who was ready to fill the prime minister’s shoes, and he expressed sympathy for what Mr. Netanyahu called attacks on his wife — who has had her own legal troubles — and son. “Leave his family alone.” Mr. Tveria said. Yet in spite of such reservations, “this is the end of his road” he said of the prime minister. “He can’t run the country and run off to court once a week.” Shlomi Ermias, 22, working an electric clipper at his barbershop facing the Lod market, said he favored the right wing, but that Mr. Netanyahu was neglecting the needs of Ethiopian-Israelis like himself. “He’s looking after his own interests more than the country’s,” Mr. Ermias said. “There are a lot of things he didn’t move forward on. He always knows how to talk. He doesn’t do.” In Tzur Hadassah, a wooded suburb in the hills south of Jerusalem, Yael Shachar, 43, said she was frightened by Mr. Netanyahu’s response to the charges. Ms. Shachar, a high school teacher who has voted for him before, but supported Blue and White this year, said she feared that many Israelis might be swayed by Mr. Netanyahu’s assault on the justice system. “When I teach my students, I see that the importance of the law, equality in the eyes of the law and the justice system are things we can’t play around with,” she said. “And when a prime minister uses democratic language to break up democracy, this is truly dangerous.” Rather than out of control, as Mr. Netanyahu suggested, Israel’s justice system is “brave and honest,” and exceptional in the world, she said. “If I don’t trust the justice system,” Ms. Shachar added, “then what can I trust?” Another teacher, Shimon Malul, 53, of Bat Yam, just outside Tel Aviv, said he has always been a right-winger, but lamented that “the citizens always receive the leaders they deserve.”  “Today, the people are self-absorbed, and so is its leadership,” he added. Recalling the wrenching transitions after Ariel Sharon’s incapacitation and Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination, he said Israel would be able to find itself a good prime minister even now, hard as it might seem. “Leaders come and go,” he said.

Extinction Rebellion Co-Founder Apologizes for Holocaust Remarks,2019-11-21,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A founder of the climate activism group Extinction Rebellion apologized on Thursday for the “crass words” he used to describe the Holocaust as “an almost normal event” and just another ugly episode in human history.  The founder, Roger Hallam, said in an interview with the German weekly Die Zeit that among various genocides that had occurred in previous centuries, the Holocaust, in which the Nazis killed millions of Jews during World War II, was not that unusual.  “The fact is that in our history, millions of people have been regularly killed under dire circumstances,” Mr. Hallam, who is British, said in excerpts published online on Wednesday. “To be honest, you could say: This is an almost normal event.”  Mr. Hallam’s remarks were made ahead of the German publication of his book, “Common Sense for the 21st Century.” In the book, which was published in Britain in September, he draws parallels between the Holocaust and the threats posed by the climate crisis. He warns against the potential “slow and agonizing suffering and death of billions of people” from global warming, and argued that with current estimates, the number of victims would be “12 times worse than the horror of Nazism and Fascism in the 20th century.” After Mr. Hallam’s comments, his German publisher announced that it had immediately halted the book’s delivery in Germany.  As the backlash grew against Mr. Hallam on Thursday, ahead of the publication of the full interview, politicians, Holocaust memorial groups and other environmental activists unequivocally denounced his statements.  Luisa Neubauer, a German climate activist with the group Fridays for Future, told the German newspaper Bild that such words were “insane.” She said in a phone interview on Thursday, “No matter who says those words, it is doing harm to our democracy, to our understanding of the past and the incredible crimes that have been committed.” Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, wrote on Twitter using the hashtag #ExtinctionRebellion, “The Holocaust is more than millions of dead and horrific torture methods.” He added, “We must always be aware of that so we can be certain: never again!” Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Bild it was not enough that Extinction Rebellion had distanced itself from Mr. Hallam. The movement must make it clear “whether it wants to tolerate such views in its ranks,” he said. “As keen as they criticize climate change deniers,” he said, “they should also do it with Holocaust relativizers.” Mr. Hallam’s remarks come at a time when some in the climate change movement have turned to disruptive tactics to drive home their message. Extinction Rebellion protesters, in particular, have employed methods such as delaying commuter trains on the London Underground, blocking roads and bridges around the British Parliament, staging a “funeral march” during London Fashion Week and lying in pools of fake blood outside the New York Stock Exchange. The group, which was founded in 2018, has also staged demonstrations in Australia, France and Germany.  Affiliates sought to distance themselves from Mr. Hallam’s comments, with a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion Germany saying that he was in favor of excluding Mr. Hallam from the movement. The German branch wrote on Twitter that Mr. Hallam was “no longer welcome in XR Germany.” Extinction Rebellion UK “unreservedly” denounced Mr. Hallam’s remarks, saying in a statement that although it favored “restorative measures,” in some cases, “exclusion is necessary.”  Mr. Hallam, a former organic farmer in Wales who pursued a Ph.D. in civil disobedience at King’s College London before pausing his studies, is recognized as a driving force behind Extinction Rebellion. But he is also seen by some in the group as a liability who may say something extreme when talking to the news media. XR Jews, an arm of Extinction Rebellion, said in a statement, “The words that we use are important.”  It added: “No one should talk about a people’s traumatic history in a throwaway manner, even if the point is to raise awareness about a deadly serious issue. In doing so, they may embolden those who already threaten that community.” Extinction Rebellion’s actions have provoked debate about the most effective way of bolstering support for protecting the environment. Mr. Hallam has pushed the group to replicate the disruption methods used by the civil rights movement in the United States and the “Yellow Vest” activists in France. Other climate activists, like Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who galvanized a global youth movement to call for urgent action on the crisis, have employed different methods. In September, she scolded American lawmakers in Congress, demanding that they read the latest science on the threats posed by climate change. She also told officials at the United Nations, her voice brimming with rage, “The eyes of all future generations are upon you.” After excerpts from the interview were published, Mr. Hallam acknowledged “cultural insensitivity” in a statement published on Facebook on Thursday and said that his comments had been taken out of context.  “I am sorry for the crass words that I used,” he said, adding that his intention had been “the exact opposite of ‘downplaying the Holocaust.’” “I realize that in the interview I got sidetracked into an unnecessary debate about where the Holocaust sits in terms of horrific genocides.” Nevertheless, some Extinction Rebellion activists feared that the group’s message could be drowned out by Mr. Hallam’s initial comments. But Ms. Neubauer said: “The climate justice movement is so much stronger than the words of a single person. Yet the incident must make us more aware and sensible of our language and the visibility of key figures.” Alex Marshall contributed reporting from London, and Christopher Schuetze from Berlin.']","In an interview in Germany, Roger Hallam said of the massacre of millions of Jews during World War II, “This is an almost normal event.”"
The Love-Hate Relationship Between Humans and Magpies,2019-11-22,By Isabella Kwai,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Isabella Kwai, a reporter with the Australia bureau. I thought it might be safe for me and my vulnerable head to go outside. But I wasn’t sure. Swooping season for the Australian magpie might not be over yet.  The birds, which seek refuge in the well-watered parks and scattered trees of city suburbs around the country, are an Australian favorite. For a few months each year, beginning around August, male magpies will aggressively swoop perceived threats near nesting areas during the breeding season. I’m sorry, but that means you (and me). The large, black-and-white birds have instilled fear in cyclists and passers-by, who have faced off with them and been left worse for wear.  One Queensland cyclist said he was stalked on his morning commute for months by the same magpie, before it forced him off his bike this month, shattering his wrist. Another man died in September after he crashed into a fence to avoid a particularly aggressive bird. In Sydney, a local council shot dead another magpie, fearing more injuries, after residents said it had terrorized the community for three years. Despite this, the birds are beloved by Australians, and have even topped bird of the year polls. “The most dangerous bird in Australia is also the most popular,” said Professor Darryl Jones, an urban ecologist at Griffith University who studies birds. “It’s a very strange relationship.” Maybe it’s about the magpie you know versus the one that attacks a stranger. Only about 10 percent of magpies engage in aggressive swooping, and the birds are highly social — intelligent enough to recognize human faces. It means you might be a frequent target. But it also means they often return, again and again, to the balconies and gardens of people who feed them, sometimes with their chicks in tow. Typically, the swooping season for the magpie concludes in October. But this year, reports of swoops are still rolling in even now. Websites like Magpie Alert track accounts of (unverified, crowdsourced) magpie attacks in an attempt to protect the public. So far this year: 4,015 attacks, 561 injuries. And the comments?  “This bird is psycho,” one victim wrote. “Got me again on the side of the head and bled.” “He came at me twice,” added another. “I think my terrified screaming kept him from actually making contact.” The drying climate, which has already pushed magpies and other birds into the cities by making it difficult to find food, may be partially responsible. Magpies struggling with hunger might delay mating.  “It stretches out the breeding season much longer than it should,” said Professor Jones. So how do we avoid getting swooped? Should I walk around with a bucket on my head or cable ties on my helmet, like some locals recommend? “Just avoid that area,” Professor Jones said. “Do not go near the nest.” Do you have an encounter with Australian birds you’d like to share?

One of World’s First Printed Christmas Cards Goes on Display,2019-11-21,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — For many, Christmas would not be the same without a house brimming with cards from their nearest and dearest, stamped and sent by mail or hand-delivered in the heart of the season. For others, the printed card is an artifact of a bygone era. Putting pen to paper — and mailing it — is too much of a hassle. But in an era of e-cards, emojis and GIFs, a London museum has put on display what the Smithsonian and the Victoria and Albert Museum call the world’s oldest printed Christmas card. Dating to 1843, it serves as a reminder of the enduring power of a holiday tradition. The card was one of 1,000 commissioned by a British civil servant, Henry Cole, and illustrated by the artist John Callcott Horsley, the Charles Dickens Museum in central London said. “A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you,” the greeting reads. The illustration depicts a scene likely to be reproduced around many dining tables this year: generations of a family sitting together as they tuck into a meal with wine glasses in hand. The sender’s language, perhaps more affectionate than is traditional today, offers little clues about the card’s age. Addressed to “My very dear father and mother,” the card is signed, “from their loving son, Joe.” In the 176 years since they were produced, only 21 of the originals are known to have survived. The card is on loan to the Dickens museum from a book dealer in San Francisco. More than a century after its inception, the Christmas card is still firmly embedded in the holiday. Research from the Greeting Card Association found that 1.6 billion Christmas cards were bought in the United States last year.  For the past decade, consumers have spent an average of $28 a year on holiday greeting cards and postage, according to the National Retail Federation of America.  Greeting cards are also bucking the overall trend of declining volumes of mail — the quantity of first-class mail delivered through the United States Postal Service is a little more than half what it was 20 years ago.  “There was somewhat of a decline when it came to greeting cards since the mid-1990s, but that decline has stopped in the last five years,” Peter Doherty, the executive director of the Greeting Card Association, said in an interview on Wednesday.  The increase in cards sales can be attributed, in part, to millennials, Mr. Doherty added.  “Younger customers who have grown up mostly receiving messages in digital formats are, in a sense, rebelling a little bit by buying greeting cards,” he said.  In addition, online services that create and mail customized cards are increasingly popular with younger generations that want personalized, luxury greeting cards to communicate with their friends and family, according to research from the Postal Service.  In the 19th century, Mr. Cole seized on technological advances and employed a little commercial nous to sell his 1,000 Christmas greetings for one shilling each — an old currency division worth about $4 in today’s money, according to estimates from Britain’s National Archives. But the cards were considered a flop, and it took five years for the next Christmas card to be designed. “They didn’t sell well,” said Simon Eliot, professor emeritus at the Institute of English Studies at the University of London and the guest curator of the exhibition at the Charles Dickens Museum.  “It must have cost Cole a great deal to have them hand-painted by a recognized craftsman, so I suspect that the realized profits, if any, were negligible,” Professor Eliot added.  But by 1877, the museum said, the idea had caught on, and more than 4.5 million Christmas cards were posted in Britain that year. In 2001, an anonymous buyer paid nearly $30,000 at auction for one of the few remaining original Christmas cards, which were produced the same year as the publication of Charles Dickens’s “A Christmas Carol.” The card industry has also been squeezed by another phenomenon: an increasing concern for the environment. “Sending billions of bits of cardboard around the world uses so much fuel,” said Alex Furness, the co-founder of DontSendMeACard.com, a platform that allows users to send e-cards and donate what they would have spent on postage to a charity of their choosing in Australia, Britain, Ireland or the United States.  “Christmas is certainly the main event for us, and people still want to mark the end of the year,” Mr. Furness said. “But with an e-card, they get to completely reduce their carbon footprint.”  Other Christmas traditions have also come under the microscope, including what songs should be removed from holiday playlists and when to put up festive displays. This month, a couple in Texas ran into trouble for erecting inflatable snowmen in their front yard in San Antonio.  Nick Simonis Jr. and his family were told by their homeowners’ association: too soon.']","The card, dating from 1843, is a symbol of an enduring holiday tradition in an era of e-cards and GIFs.

"100 Protest Leaders Arrested, Iran Says, as U.S. Penalizes a Top Official",2019-11-23,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran’s judiciary said Friday that about 100 people accused of having led violent antigovernment protests over fuel price increases had been arrested nationwide, and a top cleric said they deserved the “maximum penalty.” The declaration by the cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, leader of Friday Prayers, suggested the authorities intended to make examples of the suspects to help crush any remnants of the deadly protests, which upended life in dozens of Iranian cities and towns.  While Mr. Khatami did not specify if he meant that the suspects should receive the death penalty, the Kayhan newspaper, mouthpiece of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said they should be hanged. “This is not a system that will be shaken by these stupid evils,” Mr. Khatami said, according to a translation by Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency. In scrambling to respond to the protests, Iranian officials disconnected almost the entire country from the internet, effectively censoring the true extent of casualties and destruction. The shutdown also blocked Iranians from using social media messaging apps, crippling a popular way to share information.  The Trump administration, which welcomed the protests, said Friday that it had penalized Iran’s minister of information and telecommunications technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, for what it called his responsibility for the internet shutdown. “While Iranian regime leaders maintain access to the internet and social media accounts for themselves and their cronies, they deprive their people of these basic tools of expression and communication,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. The United States, he said, “stands with the people of Iran in their struggle against an oppressive regime that silences them while arresting and murdering protesters.”  The sanction means the United States could impound any assets in its jurisdiction that Mr. Azari Jahromi owns.  Mr. Azari Jahromi, a frequent Twitter user, reacted as though the sanction were a badge of honor. “I’m not the only member of club of sanctioned persons (Based on Trump’s fairytales),” he wrote in a post.   Mr. Azari Jahromi has said in the past week that the Supreme National Security Council had ordered him to shut down the internet and that he could fully restore it only when the council allowed. As of Friday, internet access had been restored to less than 20 percent of its normal level, according to NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet usage and cybersecurity. The limited access was for government agencies, universities, security forces and some commercial businesses, but ordinary Iranians still appeared to be disconnected. Amnesty International said the death toll had climbed to at least 115, but a confirmed tally was impossible to ascertain given limited access to the country. Iranian officials have denounced Amnesty’s figure as speculative but have not specified how many people were killed or injured. An anecdotal picture of widespread destruction and harsh crackdown has emerged from videos and postings that Iranians managed to share despite the internet restriction. Official accounts have also shown remnants of ransacked stores and burned banks but have said the mayhem was contained within a few days, and have denounced what they called American-backed attempts to stoke more unrest. “Based on information we have received, the Americans have gone mad that the riots were over within 48 hours and are disappointed that there is no more disorder in Iran,” Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps., said on Friday in remarks quoted by Iranian media.

More Than 140 Nazca Lines Are Discovered in Peruvian Desert,2019-11-21,By Iliana Magra,"['A huge carving of a monkey with its tail twirled in a spiral; vast, geometric images of a condor and a hummingbird; an immense spider — the 2,000-year-old Nazca Lines in Peru have awed and mystified modern viewers since they were first seen from the air last century. Now, 143 more images have been discovered, etched into a coastal desert plain about 250 miles southeast of Lima, the Peruvian capital. The Japanese researchers who found them combined on-the-ground work with the most modern of tools: satellite photography, three-dimensional imaging and, in one case, artificial intelligence. The newly discovered carvings, or geoglyphs, depict human forms and a broad variety of animals, including camelids, a group of mammals that includes llamas and alpacas; cats; fish; and snakes, according to the research group from Yamagata University.  The shapes, some of which are believed to date from at least 100 B.C., were mainly identified in the western side of the area through fieldwork — picking through pottery remnants, stones and soil — and by analyzing high-resolution imagery, the university said in a statement last week. The largest are more than 300 feet long. But one geoglyph was revealed as a result of a collaboration between the university research team and Watson, IBM’s artificial intelligence system. When the university and IBM Japan analyzed data with software called Watson Machine Learning Community Edition, they identified various candidates for “biomorphic” shapes. The university said the researchers then chose one of them and, after conducting work on the ground in 2019, discovered a previously unknown, 16-foot figure of a human standing on two feet.  The Nazca Lines cover an area of about 173 square miles and are thought to have been scratched into the earth from 500 B.C. to A.D. 500. The shapes are best seen from the air, and many are impossible to discern from the ground. UNESCO has designated the Nazca Lines a World Heritage site that bears witness to “the culture and magical-religious tradition and beliefs,” artistic and technical skills, and land use techniques of societies in pre-Columbian South America.  Masato Sakai, a professor of cultural anthropology and Andean archaeology who led the research team, said in a video about the discovery that the enigmatic drawings must become more visible to ensure their survival. “The most important point is not the discovery itself,” Professor Sakai said, adding that the lines were “facing a crisis of destruction.” “They should be cleaned up,” he said. “If they become clearly visible, they will be protected as important cultural heritages.” In 2014, Greenpeace activists left marks on the protected site after they entered the area to place a sign promoting renewable energy. And nearly two years ago, a truck driver was arrested after he intentionally drove his tractor-railer off the Pan-American Highway, which runs through the archaeological site, and damaged three straight-line geoglyphs, Peru’s culture minister said at the time.  All of the Nazca works were created by removing the darker top layer of earth to reveal the white sand beneath.  The new findings are categorized into two types that differ in scale and purpose.  The representational group, depicting animals and anthropomorphic figures, includes figures that usually span less than 165 feet, according to the university. The other, more abstract and geometric group, includes much larger shapes. The longest one stretches more than 330 feet. Part of the fascination with the Nazca Lines derives from the mystery of their function.  In his 1968 best seller, “Chariots of the Gods?,” Erich von Däniken, a Swiss author, suggested that they might have served as landing strips for aliens.  But archaeologists say they believe some of the etchings played a role in astronomical rituals. The Yamagata University team said that geometric shapes signified places where people held ceremonies that involved the breaking of ceramics, while the smaller, representational figures, which were found close to paths or slopes, are believed to have been travel markers, “designed to be looked at.” The researchers plan to use another IBM system, called PAIRS, to organize data collected from the ground over the past 10 years and conduct more groundwork to create a map of the geoglyphs.  And they hope to solve the mysteries that remain about the ancient, sprawling figures and shapes.  “By gaining a detailed understanding on where the figures are located and when they were used,” the university said, “researchers aim to attain a closer look into the worldview of the people who made and used these geoglyphs.” Makiko Inoue and Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.']","A team of Japanese researchers combined on-the-ground archaeology with modern technology, including artificial intelligence, to identify the 2,000-year-old images."
Rodrigo Duterte Calls for Ban on Public Vaping in the Philippines,2019-11-21,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has ordered a sweeping ban on vaping in public, threatening to use the police and military to enforce what observers in the country have called a draconian order. When Mr. Duterte, a former smoker, announced the ban in a speech on Tuesday, his statement caught many Filipinos by surprise but was largely ignored. But he reiterated the order on Wednesday in a long and at times rambling speech before the Department of National Defense, saying that vaping was “toxic” and could now be done only in private. Mr. Duterte ordered the police to arrest anyone caught vaping in public in the Philippines, a largely Catholic nation in Southeast Asia that has some of the region’s toughest smoking laws. Mr. Duterte said that many Filipinos, particularly young ones, used vaping devices without realizing the dangers they posed. This month, the Philippine Health Department reported the first case of vaping-related lung injury in the country. A 16-year-old girl was said to have been vaping for half a year before being hospitalized in October; she has since been released. In the United States, cases of vaping-related illnesses have surged in recent months, with at least 44 deaths reported. The Trump administration recently pulled back from a vow to ban many flavored e-cigarette products, saying that businesses would suffer. Mr. Duterte, who recently revealed that he has a neuromuscular disease, said he understood “youthful negligence” even as he said the state was empowered to protect its people.  “The safest way to do it is in your house,” he said. “But if you are not that stupid, when you do that, you contaminate your children in the family.” Mr. Duterte has been known to issue contentious policies. A popular anecdote from his time as mayor of the southern city of Davao holds that he once forced a foreign tourist to eat a cigarette for smoking in public. Mr. Duterte often claims that in Davao, “nobody, but nobody” can be seen smoking on the streets. “As you know, nicotine is an addictive devil,” he said on Wednesday. “And if you have to have a fix, well, you have to find some latrine there anywhere, but not in the madding crowd.” He said that he had yet to write a formal executive order for the directive, but that there was an existing law against distributing toxic materials in public places. A spokesman for the National Police, Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac, said the police would follow Mr. Duterte’s order, and added that a 2017 executive order gave them legal backing for the “establishment of smoke-free environments in public and enclosed places.” Senator Pia Cayetano, who leads the Senate’s powerful Ways and Means Committee, which determines the country’s tax policies, said that while e-cigarettes were associated with some health risks, advocates say that the devices are effective in helping tobacco smokers quit. The question is whether to ban vaping outright or to strictly regulate it, and Ms. Cayetano said she favored regulation. However, she said that public health was paramount and should “take precedence over any business or commercial interest.” In June, the country’s Health Department introduced strict controls on the retail sale of nicotine shots, the liquid that fills e-cigarettes. But vaping industry representatives have sought to stop the regulation in court. Emer Rojas, the president of an antismoking lobby, the New Vois Association of the Philippines, said that Mr. Duterte’s public statements about vaping could be intended to show the seriousness of his order. But Mr. Rojas said that deaths linked to vaping had been on the rise around the world, while deaths associated with regular cigarettes were recorded only after years of abuse. “E-cigarettes may be more deadly since people get sick and die in just a few years of vaping,” said Mr. Rojas, a survivor of laryngeal cancer who said he had smoked for 25 years.']",The Philippine president called on the police and military to help in enforcing the ban.
The World Burns All Year. Are There Enough Planes to Douse the Flames?,2019-11-22,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Sharing the giant air tankers that fight fires 5,000 gallons of water at a time used to be simpler. California’s wildfires faded before Australia’s bush fires surged, leaving time to prepare, move and deploy planes from one continent to another.  But climate change is subverting the system.  Fire seasons are running longer, stronger, hotter. The major fires now blanketing Sydney in smoke started early, within days of the last California blazes.  And the strain is global. Countries that used to manage without extra help, like Chile, Bolivia and Cyprus, have started competing for plane and helicopter contracts as their own fires intensify. That is stretching capacity for the companies that provide most of the globe’s largest firefighting aircraft, and increasing anxiety for fire officials worldwide.  “We’re all feeling it,” said Richard Alder, general manager of Australia’s National Aerial Firefighting Center. “As fire seasons ramp up and get longer — and they definitely seem to be doing that, the science tells us that — it places more demand on aircraft to support the firefighting. And it’s only one part of the equation.” The age of fire is upon us, scientists say, and the public and private system built to contain it is being pushed to its limits. While firefighting is still primarily done on the ground, governments and frightened residents are increasingly demanding costly assistance from the air.  The European Union created a reserve fund this year for firefighting aircraft, with contracts allowing for deployments across national borders. Bolivia leased the world’s only Boeing 747 water bomber to fight fires in the Amazon in August, after the plane had been used in Israel in 2016, Chile in 2017 and California in 2018.  Meanwhile in Asia, South Korea is reaching out to companies like 10 Tanker Air Carrier in New Mexico, while Indonesia borrowed an air tanker from Australia a few years ago that came from Coulson Aviation in Canada, which is now doubling the size of its contract fleet, while developing new technologies for mapping and fighting fires at night. What these companies and fire officials say they are planning for is a world ablaze year-round.  “It’s coming from all over,” said John E. Gould, president of 10 Tanker Air Carrier, who started his career fighting fires in Alaska in the 1970s. “Fires are affecting climates and places they never used to affect.” That has forced firefighting “to be a global effort, not a state or national effort,” said Stuart Ellis, the chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, which manages fire planning for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. “It’s not just a firefighting issue,” he added. “We need to be more critical of our planning decisions. We need to examine building in bush-fire-prone areas. People love living in the bush, but as the bush is becoming more vulnerable, is that viable?” In Australia, the conservative government has yet to confront such difficult questions as it rejects a discussion of climate change and its impact. But the country is fast becoming a fiery test case for the pressures that are building worldwide. Australia is more vulnerable than most: It is arid and expansive, with large cities sprawling toward wilderness. Climate change is already delivering a sharp shift in precipitation, spurring a lengthy drought. Dry areas are now drier and larger, with forests that used to be reliably moist becoming tinderboxes waiting for a spark. This week, more than 1,000 firefighters have been battling more than 120 blazes in four states as dangerous fire conditions and record temperatures persist. In some areas, no significant rainfall is expected until January.  “We’re starting to see unprecedented conditions,” said Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist at the Australian National University. “We had bush fires starting as early as winter — and by the time spring came around, we had fires in subtropical rainforest.” Fire officials and scientists say they are being forced to imagine, for the first time, overlapping and intensifying demands.  “Something is clearly changing,” said Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center. “And the climate is driving all of that.” The fires of this new era cannot always be tamed. Neither aircraft nor ground crews can do much for the blazes that spread quickly with powerful winds. The Tubbs Fire that destroyed parts of Santa Rosa, Calif., in 2017 jumped an eight-lane freeway. The winds supercharging the Camp Fire that burned through the town of Paradise, Calif., last year pushed water bombers too high into the air to drop their payload.  Nonetheless, aircraft use, and fire management costs, are soaring.  Chile, which expanded its contracts with Coulson this year, spent more than three times as much on firefighting from 2014 to 2018 as it did during the previous five-year period. The United States Forest Service spent more than $1 billion on fire suppression in 13 of the 18 years between 2000 and 2017.  Costs surpassed $2 billion for the first time in 2017 and 2018, when California’s fire seasons were especially severe.  In Australia, too, firefighting expenses are rising. And because the responsibility largely resides with individual states, fire officials are increasingly worried whether the system can handle what’s on the way. Firefighters are already hard to deploy across state lines: Of Australia’s 300,000 fire and emergency service personnel, roughly 85 percent are volunteers who tend to stay where they live. Large airplanes and helicopters that dump water or other firefighting materials are thus increasingly seen as the most vital weapons for what officials call “surge capacity” — the ability to add resources as fires defy control. Two years ago, the National Aerial Firefighting Center — which coordinates air support for all of Australia’s states and territories — sent a proposal to Parliament asking for a more than 70 percent increase in its annual federal funding, to 26 million Australian dollars ($17.7 million). But the request was ignored. And state governments are now bearing the burden. There will be seven large air tankers in Australia this fire season; a DC-10 owned by 10 Tanker touched down in New South Wales last weekend, ahead of the usual Dec. 1 start date, after fighting the recent fires in California.  The state also recently bought a 737 Fireliner — along with two lead planes — from Coulson Aviation for 26.3 million Australian dollars ($17.9 million). It can carry 4,000 gallons of liquid along with 72 passengers. Other states — and countries — have signaled they may follow.  But buying or leasing a water tanker is not as easy as ordering hoses, or even sharing a few hundred firefighters, as the United States and Australia do now as well. The planes being modified are typically decades old. It can take years to turn them into firefighting weapons, and officials are anxious about whether the market will meet their needs.  All 18 of the large air tankers that the United States Forest Service plans to use through 2022 will come from private contractors, according to the agency’s aviation strategy. The more that fires surge into fall for California, the worse it may be for Australia and the rest of the world when it’s time to share. “I suspect we’re all becoming more nervous,” said Mr. Alder, who has been fighting fires in Australia for decades. “We’re keeping a watchful eye on it.” Reporting was contributed by Livia Albeck-Ripka from Melbourne, Australia, Isabella Kwai and Jamie Tarabay from Sydney, and Thomas Fuller from Los Angeles.

"What’s Next for Netanyahu, and Israel?",2019-11-21,By Isabel Kershner,"['The corruption charges brought against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday not only threaten his political future, they also present the country with an unprecedented legal quandary. Mr. Netanyahu, the country’s longest serving prime minister, also holds the dubious distinction of being the first to be indicted while in office. He has denied the allegations against him. Israel was already struggling to choose a leader who could form a new government after two inconclusive elections this year. Mr. Netanyahu’s indictment adds further uncertainty to a chaotic political landscape.  Here are some ways it could play out: Israel does not have a constitution. Its primary governing principles are enshrined in what are known as the Basic Laws, one of which addresses a prime minister facing trial.  Under that law, Mr. Netanyahu can remain under indictment and even stand trial while in office. Lawmakers could vote to oust him only after all appeals are exhausted, a process that could take years. But watchdog bodies are planning nonetheless to challenge Mr. Netanyahu’s continued tenure in court. The provision dealing with a prime minister facing trial has never been interpreted by the Supreme Court so there is no precedent, argued Suzie Navot, a professor of constitutional law at the Striks School of Law near Tel Aviv.  “Without interpretation it’s meaningless,” she said.  Ms. Navot noted, for example, that the Basic Law does not differentiate between a prime minister charged with a lesser crime like failing to pay taxes, or a major one like accepting bribes. Bribery, the most serious of the charges against Mr. Netanyahu, carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.  In two cases in the 1990s, the Supreme Court ruled that an ordinary government minister or deputy minister must be fired immediately upon being charged. But these ministers can easily be replaced. If a prime minister resigns, the entire government falls, adding to the significance of any decision by the court.  Those earlier rulings stemmed from petitions filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a nongovernmental group. The group argues that the same standard should apply to a prime minister and is preparing to go back to court. “A prime minister under indictment is unfit to serve,” said Tomer Naor, the group’s chief legal officer. “For a prime minister, but not a health minister, to be able to continue in office is completely absurd.” But such a finding by the court would be likely to draw fire. Right-wing politicians are already seeking to curb the Supreme Court’s powers, so a ruling that ousts Mr. Netanyahu would be viewed by some as overreaching. Ayelet Shaked, a right-wing legislator and former justice minister, recently warned the Supreme Court justices against involvement in the political process, describing any attempt to do so as “tantamount to a coup.” Gad Barzilai, a professor of law at the University of Haifa, said it was “doubtful” that the court had the authority to force a quick resignation. Like any lawmaker, Mr. Netanyahu could ask for parliamentary immunity from prosecution, but whether he has a practical path to securing it soon is unclear. Immunity can be granted by a parliamentary committee and then a vote by the full Parliament. Ordinarily, a lawmaker would have 30 days after being charged to put in a request. But after two inconclusive elections and months of political paralysis in Israel, the committee is not functioning — and may not resume work for months, until another election is held and a government is formed.  Rebel members of Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party could demand a primary election to choose a new leader. If Mr. Netanyahu, who has denied all wrongdoing, survives as party leader, he could still run in a national ballot for another term.  If he were to lose a primary election, he would no longer be Likud’s candidate for another term as prime minister.  Since neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his main challenger, Benny Gantz, was able to form a government after the last election, the task has been given to Parliament, which has three weeks to try to choose a prime minister who has the backing of a majority of its members. If Parliament fails, Israel will hold another election.  If Mr. Netanyahu wins that election, despite the charges, President Reuven Rivlin would have to decide if it were appropriate to task him with forming a government. In many respects, the law is not clear. Mordechai Kremnitzer, a former dean of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center, said a large segment of the public believes that a prime minister continuing to serve while charged with serious crimes is “an intolerable combination.”  “Everyone feels there is something askew here,” Mr. Kremnitzer said, adding that a prime minister cannot “go to court from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. and from 4 p.m. run the country.”']","The corruption case against Benjamin Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister indicted while in office, has raised unprecedented legal questions for both him and the country."
Merkel and Macron Publicly Clash Over NATO,2019-11-23,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was uncharacteristically furious. At a dinner to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, she huddled with President Emmanuel Macron of France, who had just given an interview in which he cited the “brain death” of NATO and wondered whether its commitment to collective defense still held. Mr. Macron had also been the sole leader to veto the start of lengthy membership talks for North Macedonia to join the European Union, despite Skopje’s having done everything Brussels had asked of it, including changing the country’s name. “I understand your desire for disruptive politics,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I’m tired of picking up the pieces. Over and over, I have to glue together the cups you have broken so that we can then sit down and have a cup of tea together.” Mr. Macron defended himself, saying that he could not simply go to a NATO meeting in London in early December and pretend that the United States and Turkey had behaved in the collective interest in Syria.  “I cannot sit there and act like nothing has happened,” he said. The conversation underscores the serious strains in the Franco-German relationship and the tensions surrounding the abbreviated NATO meeting on the outskirts of London, which was carefully downgraded from a summit to a gathering of leaders to celebrate the alliance’s 70th anniversary. “I haven’t seen Franco-German relations at such a low point in a very long time,” said Claudia Major, a security analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “I’ve rarely seen such bitterness and misunderstanding.” Mr. Macron, as an ambitious French president with nearly royal powers, is increasingly impatient with Ms. Merkel’s slow pragmatism and Germany’s federalism and coalition government, Ms. Major said.  His wish, “in his impatient and almost nervous style,” to lead and disrupt “clashes with the German system, which is very slow with Merkel in her last term and a coalition just trying to survive,” she said. Mr. Macron is eager to put forward longer-term strategic proposals, but is increasingly impatient with a more stagnant Germany and a divided coalition in that country, where the left-leaning Social Democrats block his European military and security proposals and the conservative Christian Democrats block his proposals for more economic integration, higher spending and eurozone reform. Mr. Macron misread Ms. Merkel, thinking that in her last term she would want to create a historical legacy for the European project, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl did by accepting the euro, and the French leader feels almost betrayed by her caution, a senior French official said.  But that is to misunderstand Ms. Merkel, who “does not have big visions and is as pragmatic as you can get, and she is not going to change after 10 years,” Ms. Major said. Then there is NATO, which Germany relies on for deterrence along with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, whose leaders have been sharply critical of Mr. Macron’s musings about the alliance’s weaknesses. Ms. Merkel refused to publicly accept Mr. Macron’s “brain death” criticism, calling his words “drastic.”  While many agree privately with Mr. Macron that President Trump’s unpredictability and moodiness have hurt NATO, made worse by his special dealings with an increasingly authoritarian and Moscow-leaning Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, they believe it was wrong to state those doubts publicly. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called Mr. Macron irresponsible, describing his comments questioning NATO’s commitment to collective defense, known as Article Five, as dangerous. Mr. Morawiecki told his Parliament that any moves to question the guarantee included in the NATO treaty were a threat to the future of the European Union and the military alliance. As François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, put it, Mr. Macron was “talking like a think tanker” instead of as the leader of a key NATO ally and nuclear power. But there are divisions in NATO, he said, and “at least Macron is trying to address the problem at hand.’’ NATO officials are struggling to agree on a joint statement, something less than a formal communiqué, celebrating the anniversary and recommitting NATO members to more military spending.  French officials are pressing for a reference to the need for a new strategic review of NATO’s mission, to replace the last one, which was completed in 2010 and is severely outdated, while most countries prefer to wait to see whether Mr. Trump is re-elected before broaching such a fundamental discussion of NATO’s purpose. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, trying to prevent a clash in London like the one that marred a tempestuous NATO summit meeting in Brussels nearly two years ago, has proposed an “expert group” to strengthen NATO’s political thinking.  The idea would be to put the group under the consensual direction of NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who works hard to maintain good relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Stoltenberg is also traveling to Paris next week to meet Mr. Macron, presumably to discuss the French president’s interview comments calling into question the continuing validity of Article Five.  To question it aloud is to undermine it, something Mr. Trump was criticized heavily for doing early in his presidency, when he initially hesitated to endorse the provision and then mused over whether America would fight for Montenegro, a NATO member. All of that has brought some glee to Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, who praised Mr. Macron’s remarks and his veto of accession talks to the European Union of North Macedonia and Albania, something Moscow has been working for years to forestall.  Moscow has also worked to undermine NATO and keep it from enlarging to the Balkans, Georgia and Ukraine. “In the light of President Macron’s statement,” Mr. Chizhov told The Financial Times, NATO “has a lot to discuss in close format” in London next month. He added: “We all know what President Trump had to say about NATO at different stages of his presidency.” There are also concerns among allies that Mr. Macron is considering a speech about creating a nuclear deterrence based on Europe, so as not to rely on the Americans. That idea will further infuriate Berlin and the Central Europeans, in part because no one believes that France’s nuclear deterrent is capable of covering the Continent, and the British nuclear deterrent is almost entirely dependent on American nuclear missiles. Mr. Macron loves being disruptive and asking questions that others do not ask, at least in public. But if he does that on the question of nuclear deterrence, Ms. Major said, “it will be champagne on ice in Moscow.”']","With relations at a new low, Chancellor Angela Merkel berated President Emmanuel Macron over his comments about the alliance’s ‘‘brain death.” "
"At Odds With Labour, Britain’s Jews Are Feeling Politically Homeless",2019-11-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — At a synagogue west of London, a rabbi made an astonishing plea: Vote against the Labour Party in the coming general election, he urged his congregants, because its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, poses “a danger to Jewish life as we know it.” On the second day of Rosh Hashana in north London, another rabbi warned of the opposite: that browbeating Jews into opposing Labour because of anti-Semitism “can only stoke people’s fears.” And on the eve of a recent Shabbat at Alyth, another north London congregation, a rabbi closed his sermon by marveling at how Jews, once just a small constituency, had suddenly become “a talking point” in this race. As Britain prepares for its most seismic election in decades, one that will decide its relationship to Europe and place in the world, few voters face such an anguished choice as the country’s 300,000 Jews. With anti-Semitism surging in Europe and the United States, the debate over how to vote in Britain’s election has already rattled rabbinical conventions, strained friendships and started a war of letters in the left-wing press, as many Jews wrestle with nerve-racking options. Jews overwhelmingly opposed Brexit, the main plank of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s campaign, dreading an emboldened far right and the splintering of a European project at the root of post-World War II peace. But they also flinch at handing power to Mr. Corbyn, seen by many as the only person who can stop Brexit, pained as they are by an avalanche of anti-Semitism accusations against the party. “I feel quite torn,” said Keith Kahn-Harris, a sociologist and writer who attends Alyth. “The issue in the Jewish community at the moment is anti-Semitism is something you can’t hold your nose for, the one thing you can’t overlook, which I understand. But for me, there are multiple things I can’t overlook, and it’s very difficult to know how to balance them.” The quandary has consequences far beyond the .5 percent of Britons who are Jewish. Labour’s hopes of unseating Mr. Johnson hang on its appeal as the gentler and more upstanding of Britain’s main parties, a case that Mr. Corbyn made to great effect in the 2017 election and that should have been bolstered by Mr. Johnson’s hardball tactics as prime minister. But the anti-Semitism scandal is “gravely damaging Labour’s reputation as the nice party,” said Glen O’Hara, a historian at Oxford Brookes University. And it has frustrated voters already dubious of Mr. Corbyn’s anti-Brexit bona fides. Rabbis used to joke that when young Jews became a bar or bat mitzvah, tradition held that they be given lifelong membership in the Labour Party. But no longer. Many Jews now feel sharply at odds with Labour, and politically homeless in Britain. A number of Labour lawmakers have quit the party over the issue since February. The Jewish Labour Movement, a 100-year-old socialist group, decided not to campaign nationally for Labour for the first time in its history. And the Jewish Chronicle, Britain’s most influential Jewish newspaper, ran a front-page editorial beseeching non-Jews to heed the paper’s fears of a Corbyn government. The dread felt by British Jews reflects wider alarm over a rise in anti-Semitism on the hard left and the hard right in Europe and the United States. Britain’s Conservative Party, pulling a page from Republicans in the United States, has tried to capitalize, courting Jews angered by the anti-Semitism scandal within Labour. But some British Jews are wary of seeing the cause weaponized in the heat of an election. Distrustful of Mr. Johnson’s own record of racist and Islamophobic remarks, and fearful of far-right violence against Jews in the United States, they are trying to persuade people to consider how a Johnson government could hurt not only Jews but other vulnerable groups.  “Undeniably, the vast majority of British Jews recognize there’s a problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, and it’s been really painful,” said Tommer Spence, who recently helped start a group called Jews Against Boris. “We strongly feel that the response to that is not to turn to a leader who is willing to engage in far-right rhetoric, appeal to nationalist instincts and throw other minorities under the bus, because it could be us next. None of us are safe while he’s doing that.” Labour said in a statement that it was “taking robust action to root out anti-Semitism” in the party. “Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, hatred and bigotry,” a party spokeswoman said.  But British Jews, some of whom were already drifting rightward in recent decades, have accelerated their retreat from Labour since Mr. Corbyn  became leader in 2015. An ardent anticapitalist and anti-imperialist, Mr. Corbyn once defended a mural featuring grotesque caricatures of hooknosed Jewish bankers. He accused longtime Britons who were Zionists of failing to “understand English irony.” And several whistle-blowers have accused Corbyn allies of interfering in the party’s anti-Semitism complaints process. Labour is now under investigation by Britain’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission. In recent weeks, one Labour candidate quit after being accused of calling a Jewish colleague “Shylock,” a reference to the moneylender in Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice,” and another left the race after revelations that she compared Israel to “an abused child who grows up to become an abusive adult.” Scholars say certain strains of anticapitalism have historically risked casting Jews as a class of rich conspirators oppressing working people. Some of Mr. Corbyn’s supporters also stridently oppose Israel, occasionally resorting to anti-Semitic tropes to make their points. Some Jews are imploring friends and relatives to vote Labour to stop Brexit, whatever their qualms. They point to the Conservatives’ own record on anti-Semitism: This week one parliamentary candidate was suspended after he was found to have said parts of Holocaust history were “fabricated,” and another was suspended for saying British Jews returned from Israel “brainwashed” and “extremists.” But many others chafe at Labour’s attempts to deflect criticism, and say arguing that the stakes are too high to send the party a message on anti-Semitism belittles a core moral obligation.  The issue is particularly vexing for younger voters, who make up Mr. Corbyn’s core vote. “There really is no good option for us as young Jewish people,” said Hannah Rose, a student who worked for one of the lawmakers who quit Labour. “It shouldn’t be up to marginalized groups to have to stand up again and again to try to convince people they’re telling the truth. Where’s the solidarity? Does it apply to Jewish people? Where’s our comradeship?” The exodus of Labour lawmakers this year has extinguished some Jews’ hope that the party could change. But with political allegiances shifting on all sides, Labour stands a chance of cobbling together a minority government, a prospect that strikes fear in Jews worried about Corbyn allies downplaying, for instance, anti-Jewish hate crimes. “The Jewish community is a tiny part of the country that’s always suffered from prejudice, and it has relied for a long time on relations with the central government,” said Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who is representing a complainant in the equalities watchdog’s investigation into Labour. “And there will be a government instead which the mainstream Jewish community has effectively severed ties with, and that’s extremely worrying.” Online and over Shabbat dinners, arguments about the election have grown bitter. Those grudgingly planning to vote for Labour have been called traitors to the community and self-hating Jews. Anti-Corbyn die-hards, on the other hand, have been branded the handmaidens of a hard Brexit. The conundrum facing British Jews owes in large part to the country’s winner-take-all voting system, which renders many votes for smaller parties useless. In a heavily Jewish north London seat, though, the Liberal Democrats, a centrist anti-Brexit party, have stormed into the lead in some polls by running Luciana Berger, a Jewish, ex-Labour lawmaker who has faced a raft of anti-Semitic abuse. The election has even thrown rabbinical conventions into turmoil. Rabbi Jonathan Romain, for one, took the extraordinary step recently of telling his congregants to vote for whichever party would keep Labour out of power, shattering a long-held tradition in British synagogues that rabbis stay strictly out of party politics. “I felt we were in a new situation, and a new political reality superseded normal considerations,” he said in an interview. “It wasn’t time to tut-tut from the sidelines.” But other rabbis disagree, making the case  that being Jewish is more about showing solidarity with all marginalized people than protecting Jews. “If we turn away from these values, turn inward, we will betray our purpose and our destiny,” Howard Cooper, a rabbi in north London, said in his Rosh Hashana sermon. In the back of some Jews’ minds is another dread: that if Labour loses the election, strengthening the right’s grip on power and ushering in a hard Brexit, an aggrieved pro-Corbyn left will unjustly turn on Jews for raising a ruckus over anti-Semitism. “It’s one of my biggest worries,” said Emily Hilton, another founder of Jews Against Boris. “That Labour will lose and everyone will blame the Jews.”']","Once Labourites practically by birth, they are feeling an anti-Semitic chill, leaving many stuck with a choice among lesser evils in the election."
"Who Needs Canvas? In Dakar, Street Artists Express Their Visions on Sides of Homes",2019-11-23,By Anemona Hartocollis,"['DAKAR, Senegal — On one wall, the painting of a marabout, a Muslim holy man, peers out from behind a line hung with laundry. Nearby, a poster of an African woman in a bustle has been pasted to a house. Still further along, women socialize in front of a wall covered in an intricate black-and-white abstract pattern. These are the painted houses of the Médina, a poor and working-class neighborhood near downtown Dakar. The neighborhood has welcomed street artists from all over the world to practice their craft in what the founder of the project calls the open sky museum. Dozens of wall paintings dot the neighborhood, bringing color to usually drab cement walls, and adding to the flourishing international art scene in Dakar. Artists from not just Senegal but Burkina Faso, Algeria, Morocco, Congo, France and Italy have come to paint on these walls. They in turn have brought art lovers and tourists into a neighborhood where they otherwise might not go, to mingle with people they otherwise might not meet. The wall art of the Médina “can bring together people who normally don’t even see each other,” said Mauro Petroni, a ceramist who has lived in Dakar for many years. Street art seems to come naturally to Senegal, where many small shops are adorned with images of what they sell. Paintings of scissors signify tailors; heads with fancy hairstyles advertise barbers; images of cows and bowls of milk herald the ubiquitous sweet milk shops; a drawing of a sheep broadcasts the presence of a vendor serving grilled meat. Shop art is commissioned by the shop owners, and sometimes painted by them too. But to paint on a house in the Médina neighborhood, it helps to go through Mamadou Boye Diallo, known as Modboye. Mr. Diallo, 31, was born and raised in the Médina, the son of an elevator operator. He dropped out of school at 15 to become a break dancer and rollerblader. He got to know the art scene by working as a messenger, delivering fliers on roller blades for art galleries. In 2010, he created Yataal Art, a nonprofit arts collective, and painted the first wall in the Médina with friends. The beauty of it is that “you don’t have to take a nice shower and wear perfume” to see the art, Mr. Diallo said. Among street artists seeking a wall to paint on, Mr. Diallo became the man to see. “You have to pass by him in order to work in the Médina,” one of the street artists, Doline Legrand Diop, said. “He functions a bit like a curator.” Ms. Legrand Diop lived in Dakar for many years and has two children by a Senegalese man, though she now lives in France. Her pictures of black people dressed as aristocrats, her #remakehistory project, can be seen on the walls of the Médina. In the beginning, it was not always easy to convince homeowners to let people paint on their walls. “They wanted money,” Mr. Diallo said. But as the project caught on, they wanted to keep up with their neighbors. “It’s for the community,” said Tonton Kaba, a retired chauffeur, who has a Legrand Diop collage on his house. Abdoulaye Camara, known as Père Djim, allowed an artist to paint the word “suba,” Wolof for tomorrow, on his house. He makes furniture of wood and animal horns on the street in the Médina, home to many artisans, so he could relate. Still, what residents expect and what artists deliver are not always the same thing. Giacomo Bufarini, an Italian artist who goes by the art name Run, painted the wall of a house with a giant silhouette of the woman who lived there. He incorporated a window into her head, like a window into her mind. Rather than being impressed by the concept, she complained that he had left the peeling paint on the window frame. “I told her I’m not like a decorator,” Mr. Bufarini recalled, sounding both peeved and guilty. Another artist, Ernesto Novo, had to tiptoe around a large bull while he painted a row of African statuettes onto a wall last March. The animal is still there (as is the art). The spirit of the open sky gallery is improvisational, just like the lives of many of the artists. Traveling through West Africa from France, an artist called the Wa, who would not give his real name, wound up in Senegal by accident, after his visa expired in Mauritania, and he and his friends drove to Senegal “for a beer.” Mr. Bufarini recalled that after finishing his painting, he, Mr. Diallo and friends celebrated by going for a fish barbecue on the beach. Having no barbecue, they cooked on refrigerator racks scavenged from the trash, after burning off the plastic coating. The painted-houses project has gotten so big that this year, Delphine Buysse, a Belgian curator, has arranged for artists in residence to live at a luxury hotel in Dakar, the Pullman, for a week, while painting in the Médina. One of the most recent wall paintings was a collaboration between Kouka Ntadi, a Congolese-French artist, and Barkinado Bocoum, a Senegalese artist. Mr. Ntadi painted abstract portraits in black-and-white, and Mr. Bocoum added folksier portraits in bright colors. Mr. Ntadi loved sharing the neighborhood with the commercial artists of the barbershops and the milk stores. “I would say there is not really a border between the two in Africa,” he said. “It’s not like in France or the U.S. where there is a snobbism about art, and you can’t be in marketing. So for sure, we can still be an artist and make a design for a bottle of milk or a side of beef.”']",
New Zealand Man Convicted of Murder in Grace Millane’s Death,2019-11-22,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — A New Zealand man was found guilty of murder on Friday in the killing of Grace Millane, a British backpacker whose death last year rattled the nation and prompted soul searching in a country where such cases are rare. Prosecutors told the court that the two had met on the Tinder dating app and that the man, a 27-year-old, strangled Ms. Millane, 22, in a hotel room in Auckland in December 2018. They said he hid her body in a suitcase before burying her remains in a forest on the outskirts of the city.  In his testimony, the suspect, whose name could not be released by law, claimed that Ms. Millane had died accidentally during “rough sex,” but the court rejected that explanation, according to The New Zealand Herald.  The prosecution, laying out a very different narrative, described him as exhibiting a pattern of violence against women and a “morbid sexual interest.” The harrowing details of Ms. Millane’s killing shocked New Zealand, a country seen as socially progressive and relatively safe. It also prompted a re-examination of violence against women in the nation.  “This has been a particularly difficult trial,” Simon Moore, the judge who presided over the trial, said before announcing the jury’s unanimous decision to convict the defendant.  He is set to be sentenced on Feb. 21, and under New Zealand law faces a mandatory life sentence with a non-parole period of at least 10 years.  Ms. Millane’s father, David, and mother, Gillian, delivered an emotional statement outside the Auckland courtroom after the verdict was announced. He described their daughter as “our sunshine.” “The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace,” he said through tears, in footage carried on the state broadcaster TVNZ. “It will not reduce the pain and suffering that we had to endure over the past year.” He thanked the people of New Zealand for their support and said that he and his wife, who were in Auckland for the three-week trial, would return to England and “try pick up the pieces of ours lives.”  Ms. Millane, who had arrived in New Zealand days before her death, was taking a yearlong break to travel around the world after graduating from university. Her family became worried when she suddenly stopped contacting them on her 22nd birthday in 2018, prompting a frantic hunt that found her body in a forest in Auckland.  After the discovery, thousands gathered for vigils across New Zealand in an outpouring of support for the family, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern delivered a personal apology.  During a December news conference, Ms. Ardern described an “overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this happened in our country, a place that prides itself on our hospitality.”  “On behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologize to Grace’s family,” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “Your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn’t, and I am sorry for that.” Ms. Millane’s family has started a charity initiative called Love Grace x, which is collecting handbags filled with everyday essentials for women in need, to honor her memory. They have also raised funds for White Ribbon U.K., an organization that campaigns to end violence against women. Through its charity’s social media accounts, the family offered a simple message after the conviction: “Today justice has been served.”  The message continued, “Life will never be the same without you by our sides Gracie.”']",The British backpacker’s killing in 2018 led to soul searching in a nation that is seen as relatively safe.
Labour Party Manifesto: Corbyn Plan Offers ‘Radical Answers’ for the U.K.,2019-11-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — In a bid to re-energize his election campaign, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, unveiled the party’s most left-wing agenda in a generation on Thursday, vowing to tax the wealthy to renationalize large parts of the country’s utilities and railways, reduce carbon emissions, and pay for better health care and schools.  For all the focus on Brexit in the lead-up to the election next month, the release of Labour’s manifesto was a reminder of the yawning ideological gap between Britain’s two main parties. Heeding calls from Labour activists to embrace a more radical plan than it did in the 2017 race, Mr. Corbyn significantly increased Labour’s taxing, borrowing and spending goals. Analysts said he was bargaining that anger at a decade of austerity, stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and the rising toll of climate change would motivate voters to kick out the Conservatives after nine years in government. While publicizing the plan in Birmingham, Mr. Corbyn said he welcomed the ire of Britain’s political establishment. “I accept the opposition of the billionaires, because we will make those at the top pay their fair share of tax to help fund world class public services for you — that’s real change,” Mr. Corbyn said. He called his proposal “the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades.” But while some of Mr. Corbyn’s policies have proved popular with voters, he himself has not, a liability that analysts believe will be difficult for Labour to overcome next month. And even if the party erases its steep polling deficit and fares well in the vote, Labour is likely to need the help of smaller, more moderate opposition parties in order to take power, potentially hemming in some of its plans. Still, Mr. Corbyn said on Thursday that “radical answers” were needed to deal with Britain’s problems, vowing to undo decades of privatization ushered in by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The party proposed nationalizing the railways, water companies, the Royal Mail, energy providers and broadband services. It intends to raise taxes by 83 billion pounds a year, or $107 billion, with the increases aimed at big businesses and high earners. And it wants to put Britain “on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s,” the manifesto says. The Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has also made public spending increases a centerpiece of his campaign, putting him at odds with his own party’s long history of fiscal restraint. But in other ways, Mr. Johnson’s government has turned rightward even as Labour veers to the left, pledging new police powers and reaching a “hard” Brexit deal with Brussels that envisions the country cutting ties with the European market in order to strike new trade deals around the world. Conservative leaders described Labour’s plan as a “reckless spending spree” and said Mr. Corbyn had no plan for Brexit. Mr. Corbyn, for his part, repeated what has become the go-to attack line of his campaign: that in Mr. Johnson’s zeal to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States, American companies will take over Britain’s National Health Service, an accusation Mr. Johnson has denied. “We will never let Donald Trump get his hands on our N.H.S.,” Mr. Corbyn said on Thursday. Labour intends to renegotiate a Brexit deal with Brussels upon taking office, one that keeps Britain closely tied to Europe, and then hold a second referendum, with voters getting a choice between that deal and staying in the European Union. But Mr. Corbyn has not bowed to considerable pressure from all sides to declare what side he would take in that referendum. While the Conservatives are campaigning on a tough law-and-order platform, Mr. Corbyn took the opposite tack on Thursday, pledging to close two immigration removal centers. And he vowed to reckon more seriously than any previous British government has with the toll of colonialism, saying the party would “conduct an audit of the impact of Britain’s colonial legacy to understand our contribution to the dynamics of violence and insecurity across regions previously under British colonial rule.”']",The opposition leader proposed a $100 billion tax increase on the wealthy to pay for a sweeping nationalization program and hikes in spending for education and health care. 
Record Turnout in Hong Kong Vote After Months of Protests and Rising Violence,2019-11-23,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Keith Bradsher","['HONG KONG — After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, voters on Sunday had a chance to voice their opinion on the city’s future — and they turned out in droves, shattering the city’s records for turnout. The election on Sunday was for district council members, one of the lowest rungs of Hong Kong’s elected offices. District councils mainly deal with noise complaints, bus stop locations and neighborhood beautification projects. Elections for them are usually quiet affairs focused on community issues.  But in the midst of the increasingly violent protests that have divided the city, the race took on outsize significance. The vote was the first test of whether the protests could transform public anger that has led millions to take to the streets into actual votes, or whether the populace had grown weary of acts of civil disobedience that have snarled transportation and forced the closing of schools and businesses. The results are expected hours after the polls closed at around 10:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The election drew record-setting throngs of voters to polling places on Sunday. Through it all, the city was calm, as democracy advocates appeared to focus on participating in one of the few elections that Beijing allows in the territory under its sovereignty.  “Politically speaking, the battle of the district councils as a whole is a crucial battle in taking control,” said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy legislator who is also running for district council.  Here’s a look at the race and what is at stake:  More than 69 percent of voters had hit the polls with around an hour left to go before the election closed. Those numbers surpassed the 47 percent turnout in the entire election four years ago. Back then, it had already set a record, lifted by an awakening of political interest that accompanied the Umbrella Movement a year earlier. Before voting began on Sunday morning, the government had strongly denied a persistent rumor on social media that the polls might close after the first several hours, instead of being open for the scheduled 15 hours.  That rumor gave both sides in the election an incentive to urge their voters to show up early. Four times as many people voted in the first hour of polling as did in the 2015 district council elections.  “I haven’t been voting for a while — this time is very important,” Ada Chan, a 30-year-old office worker, said as she left a polling place after casting her ballot early. Lines quickly became so long on Sunday morning that Patrick Nip, the territory’s secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, appealed to the public to have more confidence that the polls would stay open.  “The voting time is very abundant, so you don’t have to concentrate on voting at the same time,” he said. By late afternoon, lines had disappeared at some locations. The voters had dwindled to a trickle at the Yau Ma Tei Community Center polling station, nestled between the city’s famous street market for jade and the graceful banyan trees of an ancient temple. A call to expand Hong Kong’s limited democracy is one of the demands of the protest movement, which began in June over a now-withdrawn proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.  Protesters have called for direct elections for the entire legislature, where currently only 40 of the 70 seats are selected by popular vote. They have also called for the chief executive, who is selected by a largely pro-Beijing election committee, to instead be chosen by voters.  The district councils have no lawmaking power. They control small amounts of public funds for simple infrastructure, like rain shelters. They lodge concerns with government departments over noise, traffic, sanitation and other issues. (Of the 479 district council seats, 452 are directly elected.) The district council members do have a modest role in choosing the chief executive, Hong Kong’s highest official. Whichever side wins a majority of the seats controls 117 votes in the 1,200-member chief executive election committee. That election committee is dominated by pro-establishment corporate interests, and the chief executives they have selected have always been loyal to Beijing. But a win would give the overall pro-democracy camp control of an additional 10 percent of the votes, and put it close to the 150 votes necessary to nominate a candidate. The brochures of district council candidates typically show neighborhood concerns they pledge to fix: trash-filled alleys, air-conditioners dripping on sidewalks and streets lined with illegally parked cars. This year, several pro-democracy candidates have included protest slogans on their materials. Law Cheuk-yung, 22, said he was inspired to run for district council because of recent social movements. He said he would demand answers from the police after residents complained of possible testing of tear gas in his district, Tuen Mun.  “I want to imagine local government being more responsive,” he said. “At the moment the district council is just a rubber stamp. They do whatever the government wants.”  For such candidates, it is more about playing to the sentiment of the protests rather than taking action. They would not have much of a role in addressing protesters’ demands, which include an investigation into the police’s use of force, offering amnesty to those arrested in the protests and expanding direct elections. “They are all trying to capitalize on public anger,” said Suzanne Pepper, a scholar of Chinese politics who lives in Hong Kong. Establishment parties have long had an advantage in these races, in part because they are much better funded, with backing from businesses. Currently the pro-Beijing camp holds 327 district council seats versus 124 for the pro-democracy group.  Rising interest in the election has meant that pro-democracy candidates are participating in every race, unlike previous years, when some establishment district council members ran unopposed. And after worries about disqualifications, only one of the camp’s candidates, the prominent activist Joshua Wong, was barred from running this year for political reasons. An election officer ruled that Mr. Wong could not uphold Hong Kong law because his political organization viewed independence from China as a possible goal for the city. A string of violent attacks on election candidates has hung over the race. Twelve opposition figures, including prominent politicians and activists as well as first-time candidates, have been ambushed and bloodied by gangs of masked men or attacked while canvassing for votes. “We can see Hong Kong isn’t as free and as civilized as we’d previously imagined,” said Jannelle Leung, a 25-year-old accountant who was struck in the back of her head with a hard object in early October the day she announced she was officially running. She also said she received sexually harassing phone calls before the attack.  Jocelyn Chau, a first-time candidate like Ms. Leung who received similar lurid calls before being punched by a man while canvassing last month in the pro-Beijing neighborhood of North Point, criticized the government for not condemning the attacks on pro-democracy figures. “Not even superficial gestures,” said Ms. Chau, 23. The polarizing pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was injured in a knife attack this month and his offices were vandalized. He called the attack “a dark day for the district council election,” adding that the “orderly election had been completely obliterated.” The attacks on candidates and vandalism had stirred worries that the election might be postponed. Some pro-democracy figures had said that a delay could harm their strength at the polls. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said the government would do its best to ensure the election would go on as scheduled. The government posted riot police officers near polling places across the city, though outside the zones marked with yellow tape where only voters could go.  The city had been convulsed by two weeks of intense protest, including on several campuses. At Chinese University of Hong Kong, protesters clashed with the police and occupied the college for five days. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, more than 1,000 people at one point were trapped by a police siege. Patrick Nip, the secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, warned Monday that further unrest would reduce the chances of the election’s being held as scheduled. He called for an end to violence “and all kinds of duress.”  In the past few days, protests have ebbed drastically, however, as the city prepared to take its conflicts to the polls.

Picassos in the Garage? Artist’s Handyman Is Convicted of Hiding Stolen Works,2019-11-23,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — One September day in 2010, a man who said he was the former electrician of Pablo Picasso entered the Paris office of the Picasso estate, wheeling a suitcase filled with 271 of the Spaniard’s artworks. The electrician, Pierre Le Guennec, had traveled from his home in southern France with his wife, Danielle. He said he wanted to authenticate 180 watercolor paintings, lithographs and Cubist collages, as well as two notebooks with 91 drawings.  The treasure trove had been in their garage for almost 40 years, Mr. Le Guennec said, gifts from Picasso decades earlier. Thus began a nearly 10-year saga in which a lawsuit claimed that the artworks were “stolen goods”; the police began an investigation; the courts heard contradictory testimony; and multiple appeals and hearings took the defendants and Picasso’s heirs all the way to France’s top appeals court.  It culminated this past week in a decision by a top French court confirming the convictions of Mr. Le Guennec and his wife for receiving and concealing stolen artwork by Picasso.  It was the third time they were found guilty, but Mr. and Ms. Le Guennec, 80 and 76, are not going to jail. The court handed the couple two-year suspended jail sentences.  They were not present for the final verdict. Mr. Le Guennec said in a telephone interview on Saturday that the couple had learned of the ruling through neighbors and a newspaper article. The couple have always denied stealing the artwork. Mr. Le Guennec had been employed as an electrician and handyman in various homes of the artist in southern France in the early 1970s, fixing an oven and setting up an alarm system in at least one property, among other duties.  Ms. Le Guennec told The New York Times in 2010 that “my husband was getting ready to leave” one day when Picasso gave him “a box.” The artist, she added, “never explained anything.”  Among the artworks are nine rare Cubist collages, a painting from Picasso’s iconic Blue period, watercolors, lithographs and dozens of drawings in notebooks. They are estimated to be worth several dozens of millions of dollars, although no precise valuation has been done, according to Jean-Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for Picasso’s son. They are now housed at the Banque de France.  Mr. Le Guennec said that he went to the Paris office  in 2010 because he had recently learned that he had cancer, and he wanted to secure the provenance of the artworks for his two children.  The artist’s son, Claude Ruiz-Picasso, and the administrator of the Picasso estate were startled and intrigued, Mr. Neuer told the news media at the time.  Gazing at the unsigned cache and realizing that it was from the famed Spanish artist, they quickly grew suspicious.  Mr. Ruiz-Picasso knew that his father, a temperamental genius who died in 1973, had been an inveterate collector who gave away only artworks that he had recently made — and he would have signed them. “If you go see the Picasso estate and tell them, ‘These 271 works from Picasso fell from the ceiling,’ or, ‘I found them at a bric-a-brac market,’ no one will believe you,” Mr. Neuer said in a telephone interview on Saturday.  He said the court ruling this past week marked “the end of a cover-up.” The artwork that Mr. Le Guennec hauled in was estimated to have been painted between 1900 and 1932.  Anne Baldassari, a former president of the Pablo Picasso Museum in Paris, said at the couple’s first trial in 2015: “The Picasso I know wouldn’t let his artworks go. It would be like ripping up one’s own skin.” Mr. Le Guennec later changed his story, claiming that Jacqueline Roque, Picasso’s last wife, and not the artist himself, had given him the artwork. “It was in 1971. Madam called me as I was leaving Mr. Picasso’s house,” he said on Saturday of Ms. Roque. “And she said, ‘Keep this; this is for you.’” Ms. Le Guennec added in the interview that the couple initially said that Picasso had given them the artworks at Ms. Roque’s instructions. They also said that the works had sat untouched in their garage for more than four decades. But Mr. Neuer argued in court and in the interview on Saturday that because the artworks were in a greatly preserved state, they could not have been stored for so long in a garage in southern France, where they would probably have deteriorated. More contradictions followed, Mr. Neuer said. Mr. Le Guennec claimed to have cataloged all the artworks on his own. But Ms. Baldassari said that the descriptions and comparisons were of “an academic level.”  For one drawing, for example, Mr. Le Guennec had drawn a parallel with “Harlequin,” an oil painting by Picasso that is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But when Mr. Neuer asked Mr. Le Guennec at the couple’s 2015 trial to name Picasso’s most famous artwork at MoMA, the former electrician did not know what the New York museum was.  He and his wife were convicted that year. A higher court upheld that verdict in 2016, but the ruling was later quashed by the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court. Mr. and Ms. Le Guennec cannot appeal the final verdict, which was handed down on Tuesday by the Lyon Court of Appeal. Mr. Neuer speculated that art merchants, probably based in Switzerland, had used Mr. Le Guennec in the same way that traffickers would a drug mule.  Mr. Le Guennec called such a scenario “ridiculous” and said he was disappointed with the verdict. Of his experience as a handyman for Picasso, he said, “It was still fabulous and extraordinary for someone like me, the little people, to get to know these people.” ']",Pierre Le Guennec said that the artist had given him the artworks and that he had forgotten about them for decades. 
Likud Rival Slams Netanyahu and Calls for Primary to ‘Save the Country’,2019-11-23,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — A leading rival to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from within his own party rebuked the longtime Israeli premier on Saturday for calling his indictment on corruption charges an “attempted coup” and demanded a primary election be held to replace Mr. Netanyahu and “save the country.” The broadside by Gideon Saar, a popular and ambitious former minister who said he would be a candidate for Mr. Netanyahu’s job, compounded the political crisis confronting the prime minister and signaled what could be a bitter internecine fight for control of Likud, the right-wing party that has led Israel for most of the past four decades. “That isn’t an attempted coup,” Mr. Saar said of Mr. Netanyahu’s indictment by the Israeli attorney general. “Not only is it wrong to say that, it’s also irresponsible to say that. It’s completely out of touch.” At the same time, Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief from the Blue and White party who defeated Mr. Netanyahu in a Sept. 17 election but was unable to form a government, called upon the newly weakened prime minister to go along with an idea he has so far refused to entertain: allowing Mr. Gantz to serve as premier for two years, after which, if Mr. Netanyahu were acquitted, Mr. Gantz would allow him to resume his post. “A real patriot wouldn’t hold the citizens of Israel hostage to his legal battles,” Mr. Gantz said. “Likud leadership,” he added, “it is time to make your voices heard!” Charged on Thursday with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, making him the first sitting prime minister of Israel to be indicted, Mr. Netanyahu, 70, denounced the law-enforcement system as out to get him and called on his supporters to “investigate the investigators.” On Friday, Mr. Netanyahu said he would “accept the court’s decisions” but again demanded an investigation into how his cases were handled, saying law-enforcement officers who acted improperly “must be taken care of.” And he stepped up the political pressure by asking his supporters to rally behind him at a demonstration next week in Tel Aviv. But by Saturday evening, Mr. Netanyahu’s defiance appeared to have given an opening to his adversaries both in and out of Likud. Speaking on the Israeli version of “Meet the Press,” Mr. Saar said that Mr. Netanyahu’s problem in staying on as premier “isn’t legal, it’s political.” Mr. Netanyahu had been unable to form a government after elections in April and in September, he noted. “I haven’t heard a single person who thinks that after a third, or fourth, or fifth, or sixth election, that Prime Minister Netanyahu will succeed in forming a government,” Mr. Saar said. Were Mr. Netanyahu to stay at the helm of Likud, Mr. Saar warned, either “this insane crisis,” with Israel politically paralyzed, would continue, or the center-left would gain power. “There is only one way that will allow us to save the country and to extricate it from this crisis and to save the Likud’s rule — a primary to avert an election,” he said. Mr. Saar, 52, was the strongest vote-getter in Likud primaries in 2008 and 2012, but he took a hiatus in 2014. He re-entered public life in 2017, and ran in the Likud primary election in February, finishing third. He said Saturday night that he believed he would “easily” form a government where Mr. Netanyahu had been unable to. Only days ago, Mr. Netanyahu maintained rock-solid party support. But with Mr. Saar assailing him publicly, the cracks spread almost instantly. Haim Katz, a lawmaker who is chairman of the Likud Central Committee, endorsed Mr. Saar’s demand for an expedited primary election. Mr. Gantz, in a speech in Tel Aviv, pointed to Mr. Netanyahu’s long history of exploiting his opponents’ misfortunes, and of fanning the flames of popular anger among his right-wing base, to argue that the prime minister had no business trying to put his prosecutors on trial in the court of public opinion. “A man who squashed and stepped on his political rivals throughout his political life, had no compassion or mercy for them even in their most difficult hour, is the last person who can now enlist the public’s support to incite against detectives, incite against judges, incite against prosecutors,” Mr. Gantz said. He noted that Mr. Netanyahu had seized on corruption investigations into former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to demand his resignation in 2008, saying those made it impossible for him to maintain the public trust. And Mr. Gantz recalled Mr. Netanyahu’s role in leading right-wing protests against former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the days before his assassination in 1995. The prime minister, Mr. Gantz said, “needs to know well the dangerous price of words, which are liable to turn, heaven forbid, into lethal bullets.”']","The demand by Gideon Saar, a popular ex-minister, was the first crack in the party’s solidarity and signaled what could be a bitter internecine fight."
"Under U.S. Pressure, South Korea Stays in Intelligence Pact With Japan",2019-11-22,By Motoko Rich and Edward Wong,"['TOKYO — Under intense pressure from the United States, South Korea reversed itself at the last minute Friday and extended an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, a sign that the Seoul government wanted to halt fraying relations with the two countries. The decision to remain in the intelligence pact, which South Korea had vowed to abandon just three months ago, appeared to be at least a short-term victory for  Trump administration officials. They pressed to preserve the pact, and have been angered over an impasse with South Korea in a separate dispute over the costs of maintaining American troops in the country as a deterrent to North Korea.  South Korea’s decision also came as a bitter trade dispute with Japan showed signs of easing. Taken together, both developments suggested that President Moon Jae-in of South Korea was looking for ways to de-escalate underlying historical tensions, which have caused one of the most serious rifts between the two countries since they normalized relations 54 years ago.  The moves came on the eve of a Group of 20 meeting of foreign ministers in Nagoya, Japan, appearing to set the tone for improvement in relations with the United States and Japan that have been increasingly strained. American officials have attached great importance to the alliance as a principal way for the United States to exert its influence in Asia, particularly because of China’s rapidly expanding  military and economic footprints.  South Korea had been set to quit the intelligence-sharing pact after 11:59 p.m. Friday. Just hours before the deadline, officials decided to halt the withdrawal, for now. The Trump administration had been pressuring Mr. Moon to remain in the pact, which is regarded as an important tool in monitoring the missile and nuclear weapons activities of North Korea — still in a technical state of war with the United States and South Korea after nearly seven decades. At the same time, Mr. Trump has been demanding that Mr. Moon contribute much more to the expense of keeping more than 28,000 American troops deployed in South Korea, which he has described as “$5 billion of protection.”  On Tuesday American negotiators in Seoul took a hard approach by breaking off talks on that issue. It is unclear whether the American move directly contributed to Seoul’s reversal on the intelligence-sharing pact. But the extension of the pact will help Seoul improve relations with Washington and Tokyo. Officials in the administration of Mr. Moon emphasized that the decision on the pact, known as the General Security of Military Information Agreement or G.S.O.M.I.A., could change depending on negotiations with Japan. “We made our decision on the premise that we can terminate G.S.O.M.I.A. any time,” said Kim You-geun, deputy director of South Korea’s National Security Council. Just one day earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had made a renewed effort in Washington to persuade Tokyo and Seoul to work out a deal, as the deadline for leaving the agreement loomed.  He spoke by telephone with Kang Kyung-wha, the foreign minister of South Korea, formally known as the Republic of Korea, and the two “pledged to maintain close coordination and reaffirmed the importance of the ROK-Japan relationship,” according to the State Department. Mr. Pompeo and Ms. Kang also “praised the enduring strength of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and both sides reiterated their commitment to cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,” the State Department said in a statement summarizing the phone call. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper visited Seoul and publicly exhorted his South Korean counterpart to stay in the pact.  Mr. Esper has also pressed Seoul to increase its payments to maintain the troops. “South Korea is a wealthy country,” he said Tuesday while on a trip to the Philippines, according to Reuters. “They can and should contribute more.” American troops are stationed in South Korea and a small number help patrol the edge of a demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. The Korean War, in which the United States fought with South Korea against North Korea and China, was halted with an armistice in 1953, but has never been formally ended. Japanese officials had also encouraged South Korea to make a “wise decision” and remain in the intelligence-sharing agreement. South Korea’s decision came as Japan announced that it would resume negotiations with South Korea over export controls. Tokyo had imposed trade restrictions on shipments of certain products to South Korea and had removed it from a list of favored trading partners as the tensions escalated. But Yoichi Iida, a Japanese trade official, insisted on Friday that the trade and intelligence sharing developments were not linked. “We did not compromise,” he said. Analysts said Seoul’s decision seemed to signal a strengthening of the United States’ role in diplomacy in the region after a long period in which the Trump administration had failed in repairing the rift between its two East Asian allies, or even getting them to freeze hostilities. “The South Korean government was pushed hard by the United States government, especially the professionals” in the State and Defense Departments, said Lully Miura, the chief executive of the Yamaneko Research Institute in Tokyo. Washington strongly supports the agreement as a pillar of stability in the region. Intelligence sharing between Japan and South Korea allows both countries to swap information about North Korean missile launches as well as military actions by China, which is expanding its footprint in the surrounding seas and which the United States considers its greatest challenger for supremacy in Asia.  “The G.S.O.M.I.A. is a critical tool that allows Seoul and Tokyo to work together on a host of shared security challenges,” said Abraham M. Denmark, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia when the agreement was signed in 2016 and is now Asia program director at the Wilson Center in Washington.  “That both Seoul and Tokyo have agreed to stay in the G.S.O.M.I.A., despite significant political pressure at home, demonstrates the agreement’s real importance. A good decision by both sides, and a much-needed success for the United States after a string of setbacks.” Current and former American officials familiar with the intelligence-sharing agreement said its implementation was still in the early stages. Once the infrastructure and protocols are in place to make the agreement work, the two nations, in theory, would be able to coordinate on intelligence on critical security matters in Asia. Without the agreement, both nations need the American military to act as a go-between for coordinating on intelligence, American officials say. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan described South Korea’s decision on Friday as “strategic” in view of the need to cooperate “to take measures against North Korea.” Seoul’s decision in August to leave the pact came as disagreements with deep historical roots flared with Japan, severely straining ties. South Korea accused Japan of imposing export controls as a way of pressuring South Korea to resolve outstanding disputes over the legacy of Japan’s occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Seoul responded with its own trade actions against Tokyo, before sending the tensions to a peak by announcing its intention to leave the military agreement.  At the time, Mr. Kim, of South Korea’s National Security Council, said the trade restrictions imposed by Japan had “caused an important change in security-related cooperation between the two countries,” adding that staying in the pact “does not conform with our national interest.” Friday’s decision by South Korea and Japan’s call to resume trade talks indicated that both sides wished to cool tensions.  “At least it shows that both sides understand that they were heading toward a cliff and that once they jumped off there was no going back,” said Daniel C. Sneider,  a lecturer in international policy at Stanford University. “It doesn’t mean that there is any fundamental solution here. That still requires a fair bit of statesmanship and leadership on the part of both governments.” Ken Jimbo, a professor of international relations at Keio University in Tokyo, said that the last-minute decision, orchestrated with competing news conferences in Seoul and Tokyo, showed “a lot of Kabuki theater going on here,” but that it at least demonstrated that both sides were ready to negotiate. Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo, and Edward Wong from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea, and Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno and Eimi Yamamitsu from Tokyo.

Egypt Arrests Senior Editor of Independent News Outlet,2019-11-23,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['Egyptian security forces arrested a senior editor of the country’s last significant independent news outlet on Saturday, in a new peak to a six-year-old crackdown on press freedom under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  The editor in chief of the outlet, the online publication Mada Masr, said Saturday that a few weeks ago, the authorities had also deported another senior editor, who is an American citizen.  Known for its pioneering investigative journalism and published in both Arabic and English, Mada Masr has remained a critical source of information for intellectuals and activists inside Egypt as well as for researchers and policymakers around the world.  Since 2013, almost every other news organization in the country has come under the effective control of the government. In the latest example of the investigative reporting that has become its trademark, Mada Masr reported on Wednesday that Mr. el-Sisi was quietly removing his son Mahmoud from his senior role overseeing the intelligence service and sending him on an open-ended assignment to the Egyptian Embassy in Moscow.  Citing unidentified sources, the report said senior officials had grown concerned that Mahmoud el-Sisi’s poor performance in handling the news media and other aspects of his job would hurt his father’s image. The report said officials were mindful that concerns that former President Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son Gamal to succeed him had helped set off the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.  [Read: Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian leader ousted in Arab Spring, dies at 91.] The pro-government media uniformly ignored the report. It was not immediately clear whether the article played any role in the arrest on Saturday. Lina Attalah, the editor in chief of Mada Masr, said security forces had been inquiring for weeks about the editor who was arrested, “since before we even had a draft of the story.” The arrest represents “a dangerous signal,” said Khaled al-Balshy, the former deputy head of Egypt’s press union. “Mada Masr is one of very few voices that are fighting to present a different point of view,” he added. “The message appears to be: This is no longer acceptable.” The government official in charge of the state information service could not immediately be reached for comment. The arrest also raised alarms among researchers in Washington who rely on Mada Masr.  “Mada is one of the Middle East’s real treasures,” said Amy Hawthorne, a deputy director of research at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “It is probably the single most important publication for every Egypt-watcher or Egypt expert I know.” Mada Masr said Saturday that plainclothes security officers had arrested a senior Arabic language editor, Shady Zalat, 37, in a predawn raid on his home.  The news organization also said Saturday that an American editor who had been working in Cairo for it, Daniel O’Connell, 28, was recently stopped at Cairo’s international airport, deported and barred from re-entering the country. Mada Masr said the officers who arrested Mr. Zalat had presented no warrant for his arrest and offered no explanation. His whereabouts was unknown.  The officers confiscated his laptop and his wife’s, and then they returned a few minutes later, “seemingly agitated, looking for his cellphone,” Mada Masr said.  “He has done nothing more than use words to report the news,” Mada Masr said. Egypt had previously appeared to allow Mada Masr a unique degree of freedom, perhaps because the authorities had successfully made its contents difficult to view in Egypt, or because of its singular reputation in Western capitals. For more than two years, the publication has been blocked by government censors from easy internet access within Egypt.  Nearly two years ago, for example, Mada Masr obtained documents revealing how private companies controlled by the Egyptian intelligence services had worked behind the scenes to acquire control of most of Egypt’s privately owned and ostensibly independent media outlets.  The increased pressure on Mada Masr may be part of a broader crackdown on dissent since September.  Mr. el-Sisi’s government has never tolerated political opposition or public demonstrations. But in September, a series of online videos by a former contractor accusing the president and his circle of corruption set off a rare outburst of limited street protests. The authorities have responded by arresting more than 4,000 people, according to rights groups, in the largest wave of arrests since Mr. el-Sisi became president in 2014 after a military takeover the previous year.  Several journalists were detained for their reporting on the protests, and the government has also targeted the few other news media outlets outside state control. The authorities blocked access within Egypt to the BBC online and the United States government’s Arabic-speaking network website al-Hurra.  Mada Masr was among the first to report the blockage of both websites.']",The arrest was the latest step in a crackdown on press freedom over the past six years.
"Dozens of Babies Died Because of U.K. Hospital Failings, Report Finds",2019-11-21,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — Dozens of babies and three mothers died at hospitals in England over four decades because of major staff failings, in what experts said could become the biggest maternity scandal in the history of Britain’s National Health Service. The problems at the facilities that make up the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust from 1979 to 2017 resulted in dozens of stillbirths as well as the deaths of newborns and women who had just given birth, an independent investigation ordered by the government in 2017 has found. It also cited more than 50 cases of injury. The findings were summarized in an interim report first disclosed by The Independent and seen by The New York Times. It identifies hundreds of cases of repeated failings and clinical errors by doctors, midwives and hospital bosses, as well as a lack of transparency and honesty.  A senior official at the National Health Service called the findings a major and disturbing scandal. More and more people are coming forward by the day, he said, adding that the problems may well extend beyond the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. In one case at Shrewsbury and Telford, a baby suffered a brain injury at birth because the medical staff monitored the wrong heartbeat and thus missed signs of distress, the report said. In another, the hospital failed to notify a mother that her baby’s body had been returned from a post-mortem examination, and then advised her not to look at the body because it had decomposed during the delay, it said.  The report, written by a midwife, Donna Ockenden, warns that even now hospital staff members have not absorbed the lessons of their past failings. “The number of cases we are now being requested to review seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort,” the report says. “It will take time, confidence and considerable and meaningful staff effort from ‘Ward to Board’ to change this, and it will require strong leadership and the support and receptiveness of senior managers.” The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust said that it had not been made aware of the interim report, but that it had already made improvements to its maternity service. “On behalf of the trust, I apologize unreservedly to the families who have been affected,” said Paula Clark, the interim chief executive of the Trust.  Ms. Clark said: “I would like to reassure all families using our maternity services that we have not been waiting for Donna Ockenden’s final report before working to improve our services. A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases.” The inquiry into the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was prompted by a campaign by a couple demanding answers about the death of their first child in 2009. In an interview, the mother, Rhiannon Davies, said the scope of the failings revealed in the report was “horrific” but not surprising. “Exposing these details has been our reality for the past decade,” she said, “but yet we have been treated like we are guilty of something, whereas the midwives and hospital staff have been treated like the victims.” Ms. Davies was skeptical about claims that conditions had already improved. “They keep saying that lessons are being learned, but we keep getting confronted with the same abuses,” she said. “Why should we believe that anything will change now?” Ms. Davies’s daughter died after midwives at Ludlow Hospital failed to identify signs that the newborn was in critical condition and left her alone in a crib, she said. The child was airlifted to another hospital but died six hours after birth. The hospital also failed to classify Ms. Davies’s pregnancy as high-risk, even though she had a series of serious medical problems and was in and out of the hospital for two weeks before giving birth, she said.  In their decade-long battle for an investigation into their daughter’s death, Ms. Davies and her husband, Richard Stanton, had to threaten a judicial review of the hospital’s investigation of the death before they were granted an inquest, she said.  In 2013, that investigation by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which examines unresolved complaints against the government and the National Health Service, concluded that the child had died as a result of serious failings in care and that her death could have been avoided. Today, more than 600 cases of possible malpractice in the maternity wards of the Shrewsbury and Telford Trust are being investigated as more families come forward. The N.H.S. is carrying out a parallel investigation into the Trust. The West Mercia Police, which has jurisdiction over the trust, said it would wait for the findings of the independent inquiry before considering any criminal proceedings. “I feel like I’ve been pushing this huge boulder that could roll back and crush me at any point,” Ms. Davies said, “and indeed it has, many times. But now maybe, just maybe, it has some momentum and can roll without me.”']",
Retirement Home Told a Nun She Couldn’t Wear Religious Attire,2019-11-21,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — A Catholic nun who was told she could stay in a retirement home in France only if she stopped wearing religious clothing was wronged, French officials say, in a case that they say misinterpreted the country’s laws prohibiting religious attire in some public spaces. The nun, who is over 70 and has not been publicly identified, had been living in a convent in southeastern France when she decided to retire in Haute-Saône, her native region farther north.  Her application to live in a unit in a publicly funded retirement home in Vesoul, a town about 55 miles northeast of Dijon, was accepted in July. But the home, which is run by the local authorities, specified that she would have to accommodate the other residents by not wearing her religious habit or veil.  In a letter sent to the nun, and seen this week by the news outlet Agence France-Presse, the retirement home told her that “all ostentatious signs of belonging to a religious community cannot be accepted in order to guarantee everyone’s serenity.”  “Religion is a private matter and must remain so,” the letter said.  The nun did not agree to go without her habit, and the local parish helped her rent a private apartment instead. Officials now say that the retirement home wrongly applied France’s secularism laws, and Alain Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, apologized in a statement on Tuesday.  “This error of judgment is very regrettable,” Mr. Chrétien said, adding that he was “personally” committed to finding the nun a spot in a public retirement home if she so wished. France has faced numerous heated debates over the place of religion in society in recent years, centered on the concept of laïcité, a policy of state secularism that first emerged during the French Revolution and took form in the 19th century, culminating in a landmark 1905 law on the separation of church and state.  A cultural aversion to public expressions of all faiths still holds strong, but in recent years, it has focused on Muslim attire, especially women wearing head scarves. Recently, a local politician asked a Muslim mother on a school trip in Dijon to remove her hijab, igniting weeks of vitriolic nationwide debate.  The nun’s case had gone unnoticed until this week, when the Rev. Florent Belin, the parish priest in Vesoul, mentioned her in his monthly newsletter, lamenting that she had been forced to find her own apartment.  “People harp on with principles of laïcité that are not understood,” Father Belin wrote. “Old demons, mismanaged fears are blocking situations.” This week, Claude Ferry, the head of the public organization that manages the retirement home, told France Bleu, a network of local radio stations, that the nun had declined the spot in the home because she “did not want to accept the rules, which are the same for everyone.”  But French officials say those rules are a misguided use of France’s national policy.  Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that helps the government enforce laïcité, said that France’s religious neutrality restrictions applied only to state employees and other public servants on the job, not to the general public.  Mr. Cadène said in a telephone interview that the nun’s case was “the very demonstration” of a “wrong interpretation of laïcité.” “Under the rule of law, you don’t ban something because it displeases this or that individual. You only ban it if it is objectively disturbing public order,” he said. “And that is obviously not the case when you have simple citizens who are wearing religious attire and who don’t represent any public administrations.”  Mr. Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, said in an interview published by the magazine Le Point on Wednesday that the retirement home’s staff had committed a “big blunder” but that state employees were sometimes “paralyzed” when dealing with the “inflammable” issue of secularism.  “The topic is not consensual, because everyone has their own definition,” he said.  For Mr. Cadène, that is partly because debates over Muslims in France have led to a “great confusion” about secularism laws and have shifted public discourse toward a stricter understanding of laïcité.  “By constantly trying to extend neutrality, first by targeting a specific religion, it always winds up extending to other religions and beliefs,” he said. “It’s a real danger.”']",Officials apologized and said the case was an incorrect interpretation of France’s secularism law.
U.S. Commander Warns of Iranian Attack in Middle East,2019-11-23,By Eric Schmitt,"['MANAMA, Bahrain — The deployment of 14,000 additional American troops to the Persian Gulf region since the spring has probably not dissuaded Iran from planning a major attack on the scale of the recent missile and drone assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil fields, the commander of American forces in the Middle East says. The officer, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the head of the military’s Central Command, said the additional troops, fighter jets and air defenses that the Pentagon has dispatched might have deterred Iran from attacking American targets — like Iran’s downing of an unmanned surveillance drone in June. But he said strikes against Gulf nations were another matter. “My judgment is that it is very possible they will attack again,” General McKenzie said in an interview this past week ahead of an international security conference on Saturday. “It’s the trajectory and the direction that they’re on,” he added in a second interview later in the week. “The attack on the oil fields in Saudi was stunning in the depth of its audaciousness,” he said of an assault in September that the United States and its European allies blame Iran for. “I wouldn’t rule that out going forward.” General McKenzie did not offer specific evidence that Iran was plotting an imminent attack against targets like oil facilities or desalinization plants — citing only the ability of American military and spy agencies to detect patterns of worrisome but unspecified Iranian activities. “Iran is under extreme pressure,” General McKenzie said, referring to the maximum-pressure campaign of economic sanctions that the Trump administration is employing against the country. He added that Iran was trying to “crack the campaign” with attacks to provoke an American military response. Speaking on Saturday at a regional security conference in Manama, Bahrain, the home of the Navy’s Fifth Fleet, General McKenzie pledged a continued American security commitment to the Gulf despite a Trump administration policy shift to prioritize threats from China and Russia. He also urged regional partners like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Oman to work with Washington in confronting any Iranian aggression.  Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the Emirates have joined the United States, Britain, Australia and Albania to form a maritime coalition to ensure safe passage through Middle Eastern waterways after a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf this past spring. “Unfortunately, sometimes the Iranian regime has proved itself to be the bully in the neighborhood,” General McKenzie said in his remarks. “And the only way to stand up to a bully is to do it together.” Also addressing the security conference, John C. Rood, an under secretary of defense, said that “Iran has made clear its intent to pursue a pattern of aggressive behavior that is destabilizing.” The Pentagon officials’ comments came as regional allies have tried to de-escalate tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The Emirates, in particular, has broken ranks with President Trump’s hard-line approach to Iran, sending a Coast Guard delegation to Tehran in July to discuss maritime security issues. American diplomats have sought to play down any fissures with the Emirates or other Gulf partners, divisions that have raised questions about how reliable those nations would be in the event of a war between the United States and Iran. “We’re working very closely with the U.A.E. to try to convince Iran that the only solution is a political solution,” John Rakolta, a business executive from Detroit who is the new United States ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, told The Associated Press this month. Some critics of the administration say that allowing the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities and the oil tankers to go unchallenged by the United States military and its allies will embolden strikes by Iran.  Administration officials point to the recent protests in Iran over gasoline price increases as evidence that the economic pressure is working and that Washington’s restraint in response to the attacks is justified. General McKenzie said that the reinforcements sent to the Gulf region — including more than 3,000 troops to Saudi Arabia — were intended to send a strong deterrent signal to Iran but not to provoke Iranian military action. In the latest projection of force, the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln passed through the Strait of Hormuz last week, the first time a Navy carrier had traversed the Persian Gulf since April. Navy officials have noted that the Lincoln has been at sea for months in the Gulf of Oman without regular port calls for the crew, a potential morale issue that is due to be remedied soon. “There wasn’t any particular strategic necessity on the timing,” General McKenzie said. “It is important to demonstrate that we can do it when we want to.” At last year’s Bahrain conference, then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to tamp down concerns that if Washington reduced its security role in the Middle East, Russia would move quickly to fill the vacuum. At the time, the United States had not had an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in seven months, and the Pentagon was pulling Patriot missile-defense systems out of Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain as part of a realignment of firepower toward Russia and China. Yet Washington continues to keep a close watch on Iranian military strategy and capabilities. A lengthy report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency last week predicted that Iran will deploy increasing numbers of more accurate and lethal ballistic missiles and field new land-attack cruise missiles.  “On the conventional side, Iran’s military strategy is primarily based on deterrence and the ability to retaliate against an attacker,” Christian Saunders, the agency’s senior Iran analyst, said in releasing the report. Nor are Iran’s conventional arms the only focus of Washington’s attention.  Iran announced plans this month  to reactivate its most sensitive nuclear production site, a deep underground uranium enrichment center, in a step that dismantles some of the last major restrictions on the country under the 2015 nuclear deal that was signed with major international powers but which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from last year. It was the third time in six months that Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, had outlined a careful series of escalations of Iran’s nuclear capacity.  None of these steps immediately secures the makings of a bomb for Iran. But taken together they create the condition that the three-year negotiating process leading up to the nuclear accord was intended to stop, at least temporarily: Iran’s ability to develop the material for a bomb in a year.']","A top general said that America’s addition of 14,000 troops in the Persian Gulf since the spring would probably not deter Iran from carrying out a major strike."
"Iran Declares Protests Are Over, but the Evidence Suggests Otherwise",2019-11-21,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['The Iranian authorities moved Thursday to project the appearance of normalcy after a week of violent protests over gasoline price increases, partly restoring internet access and decreeing that the mayhem that convulsed the country was really a foreign-backed failure. But other developments suggested that a severe crackdown was underway in response to the street clashes, rioting and destruction that had upended life in dozens of Iranian cities and towns — and that the uprisings had not been completely crushed.  Doctors reported that hospitals were overfilled with people injured in the protests. They also said the Health Ministry had ordered all hospitals in Tehran and other cities to cancel elective surgeries because of the influx of emergency cases.  Iran’s student union said plainclothes agents of the pro-government Basij militia, hiding inside ambulances to evade restrictions on entering campuses, had seized more than 50 students at Tehran University after protests there. The government also came in for some extraordinary criticism from the nation’s writers guild over what amounted to an internet blackout that started on Sunday in the nation of 80 million, effectively obscuring much of what was happening during the protests. NetBlocks, a firm that tracks cybersecurity, said the shutdown had disconnected almost the entire country. “Shutting down the internet and cutting the access of Iranians and the outside world to the news is the latest tactic to crush protests without the eyes of the world on you,” the guild said Thursday in a statement posted on Telegram. President Trump, whose sanctions are at least partly blamed for Iran’s economic travails, broke six days of silence on the protests. Iran had become so unstable, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “that the regime has shut down their entire Internet System so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country.”  Later Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who shares Mr. Trump’s antipathy toward Iran’s hierarchy, appeared to validate its suspicions that the United States was abetting the protests. In his own Twitter posting, Mr. Pompeo said that he had asked protesters to send him videos and other evidence of the crackdown, and that the United States would “expose and sanction the abuses.” Amnesty International has said that more than 100 Iranians were killed in the protests, some by security forces using live ammunition to disperse and intimidate crowds. The government, which has portrayed the protesters as rioters and thugs inspired and paid by foreigners, has called the Amnesty report propaganda. “Any casualty figures not confirmed by the government are speculative and unreliable, and in many cases part of a disinformation campaign waged against Iran from outside the country,” Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s United Nations mission, said Wednesday in a Twitter post. A spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the elite force responsible for national security, said that several leaders of the unrest with dual citizenship and ties to foreign governments had been arrested. The semiofficial Fars News Agency reported that rioters had looted and burned chain stores in a number of Tehran suburbs, and that some had “received $60 for each place set on fire.” The Fars account did not specify who had supposedly provided that money. Despite the government’s clampdown on internet connectivity and censorship of what could be officially reported, Iranians who saw or participated in the protests found workarounds to transmit video and text of what they had witnessed.  The videos and postings, although anecdotal, depicted fear, bitterness and anxiety. Pejman Gholipour, 18, for example, went shopping Monday in the city of Karaj for a suit to wear to his brother’s wedding. On Wednesday, his family held a funeral for him in their coastal town of Langaroud, according to an Iranian journalist, Yasin Namakchian. Mr. Gholipour had been caught up in one of the protests when security forces opened fire and he was struck. Mr. Namakchian, who is from the same city as Mr. Gholipour, announced his death on Twitter. Not far from where Mr. Gholipour was killed, an unidentified young man’s lower leg was nearly severed by a bullet. A video showed protesters dragging him on the ground in the midst of clashes and sirens. Someone shouted “Stop, wrap his leg!” Blood oozed from his jeans as his partly severed leg dangled, according to a video shared on social media by another journalist in Iran. President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that the government had vanquished what he called foreign enemies instigating the unrest and that calm and order had been restored.  But Mr. Rouhani’s public show of bravado and unity belied signs of severe strain within the government hierarchy over the gasoline price increases and the response. Iranian media reported that during an emergency government meeting the same day, Mr. Rouhani argued with a conservative politician who had questioned him on the price increases and that Mr. Rouhani had stormed out. What started as relatively peaceful demonstrations over the increases shifted within days to a violent revolt against the system. As security forces were mobilized to stop them, the protesters became more brazen, suggesting a new phase in the dynamic of resistance and repression that has punctuated Iran’s history since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In many cities large and small, the streets look like war zones. Smoke and fire engulfed multiple buildings, banks and shops. Shattered glass and debris spread across major roads with no sign of commerce or traffic. Three residents of Tehran reached by phone said that the affluent northern part of the city was quiet, but that unrest persisted in middle-class and working-class neighborhoods. They said the capital had the appearance of a heavy security zone, with swarms of anti-riot police on motorcycles and Special Forces lined up on nearly every major road. Plainclothes Basij militia members were also out on the streets. “It’s definitely not normal. We are not leaving the house unless we have to and nearly all official business has come to a halt,” said Sara, a translator in Tehran who did not want her last name published.  She said patients at her husband’s medical clinic had canceled and many people were reluctant to send their children to school. The mayor of Shiraz, where clashes have been severe, said on Wednesday that transportation infrastructure in four of the city’s districts have been destroyed. The owner of a popular hypermarket, Refah, the Iranian equivalent of Walmart, said shops in three of its locations had been ransacked. Even political figures appeared bolder in their criticism of the government. One of Iran’s most prominent political activists close to the reformist faction, Abulfazl Ghadiani, issued a statement blaming Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has thrown his weight behind the gas increase policy and effectively shut the door to any reconsideration. “The main and final person responsible for the blood being spilled is Mr. Khamenei. He must be held accountable,” Mr. Ghadiani said. As news of the unrest dominated, the judiciary quietly moved to close a contentious espionage case against wildlife conservationists whose plight had gripped both Iranians and the international community. Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence had concluded that the conservationists, from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, were not spies. But the Revolutionary Guards, who operate a parallel intelligence bureaucracy, prosecuted the charges anyway. One defendant, Morad Tahbaz, an Iranian American from Connecticut, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and a co-defendant, Niloufar Bayani, a former project consultant and scientist for the United Nations environment agency, was sentenced to eight. They were both convicted by a Revolutionary Court for collaborating “with an enemy state.” The authorities also seized Ms. Bayani’s income from her United Nations employment. Four other co-defendants received sentences of between six and eight years. Two remaining co-defendants still await their verdict, according to an account posted by the Center for Human Rights in Iran.']","Signs of a severe crackdown over the protests were evident, including a Health Ministry order canceling elective surgeries because of an influx of emergency cases.

The Broken Promise of a Panda: How Prague’s Relations With Beijing Soured,2019-11-23,By Marc Santora,"['PRAGUE — On the top floor of an opulent Art Deco building in the heart of old Prague, the new lord mayor was standing with a glass of sparkling wine in hand, greeting diplomats as they made their way into his official residence for a New Year’s gathering. But when the Chinese ambassador reached Mayor Zdenek Hrib, the diplomat was not in a celebratory mood. “He demanded that I kick out the representative of Taiwan,’’ Mr. Hrib recalled of the confrontation last January. “I said, ‘We do not kick out our guests.’” As the line of people backed up, with other ambassadors urging the Chinese representative to move on, he grew more and more incensed until, finally, he stormed out. For Mr. Hrib, who had been elected just two months earlier, it was the first skirmish in a diplomatic spat that would culminate with Beijing and Prague severing ties as “sister cities” and that today threatens lasting damage to relations between the Czech Republic and China. At the root of the fight was the mayor’s refusal to line up behind Beijing’s “One China” policy, which insists that Taiwan is a part of China despite having its own democratically elected government. But more broadly, the disagreement has illuminated the ways China uses its economic clout as it tries to get its way diplomatically and looks to secure a foothold in the European marketplace. The Czech Republic is one of the smaller nations that Beijing has most aggressively courted.  The high point came in 2016, when China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was welcomed for a state visit by the populist President Milos Zeman, who had declared that his country would be China’s “gateway to Europe.” Before the visit, the local government in Prague had signed a sister-city agreement with Beijing that included a commitment to the “One China” policy — language not usually found in sister-city agreements that Beijing has with other municipalities around the world.  For the Czech Republic, closer ties with China came with promises of increased trade, investment and business deals. For Prague, the deal held the promise of more tourism, cultural exchanges and even a much-coveted panda for the city’s zoo. Three years later, much of the investment has not materialized, there is greater concern about Chinese espionage than excitement about trade deals and there is no panda at the Prague Zoo. “The honeymoon is over,” said Filip Jirous, an analyst at Sinopsis, a research group focused on China based at Charles University in Prague. “This is the sobering-up period.” And Mr. Hrib is part of the hangover. A 38-year-old doctor, he became mayor running with the anti-establishment Pirate Party, which has become the third-largest force in the Czech Parliament in less than a decade. The party has steadily gained power in part by challenging the eastward-looking foreign policy of Mr. Zeman and the transactional approach of Prime Minister Andrej Babis. When he took office last November, Mr. Hrib promised to examine the wording of the city’s agreement with Beijing. “Some people say that we should not be involved in foreign affairs,” Mr. Hrib said. “But what we have done is get rid of this ‘One China’ declaration, which dragged Prague into foreign affairs.” He said he had initially wanted to keep the agreement and just amend it by taking out the “One China” commitment.  But unlike the previous mayor, he was not willing to bend to what he thought unreasonable demands of the Chinese, and he invited a Taiwan representative to the New Year’s reception.  In March, Mr. Hrib traveled to Taiwan, where he had spent two months as a student, a visit that caused more ripples. By the summer, with the mayor making it clear that he was going to bring the language in the agreement to a vote in the City Council, the issue blew up. Chinese officials issued threats and began taking actions against institutions tied to the city.  One was the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, which had spent more than two years preparing a 14-city autumn tour of China.  If the orchestra wanted the show to go on, Chinese officials suggested, it should sign a document rejecting the mayor’s actions. The group refused. The trip was canceled. “The cancellation of the tour meant for the orchestra an economic loss of several million Czech crowns,” the orchestra’s director, Radim Otepka, said in a statement. “However, we consider as much more damaging the fact that culture has been subject to political pressure.” Mr. Hrib said the overt pressure by China reminded many Czechs of the ways their former Communist rulers operated. The tensions have also strayed into more consequential arenas. In December, the Czech government’s cybersecurity agency issued a directive warning that the Chinese tech giant Huawei represented a potential national security threat. It recommended blocking Huawei from building the infrastructure of the fifth generation of wireless technology, known as 5G, in key sectors. Huawei threatened legal and financial retaliation, and Mr. Zeman has accused the Czech intelligence services of “dirty tricks.” More recently, there have been concerns that China was trying to use its influence at academic institutions. The company that has profited the most from close ties to China is a privately held financial and investment firm, PPF Group. Its founder, Petr Kellner, is the Czech Republic’s richest man. The firm’s Home Credit division issued loans worth more than $15 billion to Chinese consumers this year alone, according to public records. This fall Home Credit announced that it wanted to sponsor a program at Charles University, the oldest institution of higher education in Central Europe. The contract included language that neither party would do anything to hurt the reputation of the other. Home Credit said that it did not insist on the clause and that it had no intention of stifling academic freedom; such language had been included in contracts the university had with other sponsors. But given Home Credit’s substantial business in China, students and professors recoiled, fearing that it could be used to censor discussion critical of China, and faculty members threatened to quit. The plan was scrapped, and the school’s rector issued a public apology. The Czech president, Mr. Zeman, has sought to limit the damage. He wrote a personal letter to Mr. Xi emphasizing “that the Czech Republic, its government, fully respects the policy of one China,” according to a summary provided by his office. Chinese officials, for their part, have threatened to limit the number of tourists coming to the country — a prospect that does not have many people in the clogged historical center of the city concerned. After sanctions were placed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Chinese quickly supplanted them as the biggest spenders on Prague’s version of Fifth Avenue, Parizska Street, which is lined with stores like Prada, Tiffany & Company, and Hermès. It is not the threat of fewer tourists that concerns officials, but rather, creating sustainable tourism that truly benefits local businesses. “We are not exactly trying to get more people into Prague,” Barbora Hruba, a spokeswoman for the Prague tourism office, said.  At the zoo, where officials had unveiled a $9 million plan to create a panda pavilion on top of a hill overlooking the city, two polar bears were still swimming, and officials have turned their sights on a different animal. “When I was little, I had this book with very nice black-and-white photos,” Mayor Hrib said. It illustrated a walk through the Prague Zoo. “And the coolest animal there was the pangolin,” he said. The creatures, which look like scaly anteaters, are the most trafficked nonhuman animals in the world. Taiwan has played a key role in saving them from extinction and is now home to what is probably the largest population of the creatures in captivity. Mr. Hrib has spoken to the mayor of Taipei and is hopeful that where panda diplomacy failed, the promise of the pangolin will become reality.

‘My Loneliness Keeps Me Going’: Fighting for Equality in India,2019-11-22,By Kai Schultz,"['RAIPUR, India — It happened one evening as Vidhya Rajput neared her home in the central Indian city of Raipur. A cluster of about two dozen men began screaming slurs at her from the roadside. There was nothing new or surprising about the scene. Growing up transgender in India, Ms. Rajput, 42, had endured decades of abuse. In school, boys had urinated on her and locked her in bathrooms so frequently that she was forced to go outside instead. In her teenage years, the abuse became so unbearable that she tried several times to take her own life. This time, though, something snapped, and Ms. Rajput turned and faced her tormentors. “I answered them in their own words,” she said in an interview. “I stood against them, because I am less than no one.” It was a galvanizing moment for Ms. Rajput, who since that confrontation a decade ago has grown into one of India’s most prominent transgender activists. Her talent for grass-roots lobbying has contributed to a remarkable transformation across India, where a gay rights revolution has recently toppled a clutch of repressive laws that classified people like Ms. Rajput as criminals. In recent years, Ms. Rajput has helped officials conduct a regional census of transgender Indians and persuaded her home state of Chhattisgarh to include sections about L.G.B.T. people in high school textbooks, to donate 190 apartments to transgender people and to spend thousands of dollars on a project recruiting transgender police officers. And in September, Ms. Rajput marched at the front of the first gay pride parade in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh. She said her most meaningful breakthrough was persuading officials to help organize 15 wedding ceremonies for transgender people from around the country this year. Legal recognition of those marriages is probably a distant proposition in India, where gay sex was decriminalized only last year. But Ms. Rajput said today’s horizon was brighter than the one she saw as a child, when she had no idea that her feelings could even be named. Her motivation, she said, was to help young Indians gain access to the things she never could. “My loneliness keeps me going, the discrimination, the fact that I do not have anyone to care for me,” Ms. Rajput said. “I think, ‘If I help others, the situation could be better.’ Loving them, mentoring them, all of that, I do.” Ms. Rajput was born in 1977, off a dirt road in Pharasgaon, a small village south of Raipur. When she was an infant, her father died of cancer, leaving her mother, who was illiterate, to support six children by growing and selling papaya, sal seeds to make flour and home-brewed liquor.  Ms. Rajput, whose first name was originally Vikas, knew at an early age that she felt different from other boys, gravitating to the girls in her village, learning to apply makeup and secretly trying on her mother’s clothing. Puberty brought a cycle of sexual and psychological torment. Peers stole her lunch at school and pulled down her pants. She says a neighbor regularly sexually assaulted her, as did one of her brothers.  Ms. Rajput said her mother would beat her when she complained and blamed her for inviting the abuse. Only later in life did she come to understand that this was her mother’s way of trying to protect her. “I realized she was scared that if I showed my true colors, I would face great threats,” Ms. Rajput said. But back then the hardships took their toll. “Every day I thought I should die,” she said of her youth. “I felt like I was in a river, and there was life, lots of water, and I had to journey here and there, but nobody understood me.” The family’s finances plummeted, and around the age of 12 Ms. Rajput starting sleeping with men to pay for pens and notebooks for school. Her depression become so severe that she tried to kill herself several times, swallowing poisonous seeds, drinking pesticide and, at one point, standing at the edge of a cliff, ready to jump off. Ms. Rajput said she had held back only because she could not bear the thought of leaving her mother.  Through it all, she says, she had a soft spot for her mother, whom she felt a need to protect. She was still determined to make peace. In the late 1990s, she moved to Raipur and took a job at a low-budget establishment called the Hotel Guru. The work was a blur of 12-hour-shifts, but there was a silver lining: Two employees, themselves transgender, told her about a park where other transgender people gathered. Ms. Rajput, who still presented as male, was unsure how to identify. She had not met transgender people in Pharasgaon, but knew that they were relegated to dark corners in India. Shunned by their families, many of them are forced to work for gurus — some of them transgender, others religious figures — who exchange social support for payments made through prostitution and begging. At the park, transgender women told Ms. Rajput horrifying stories about H.I.V. outbreaks, gang rapes and sexual slavery. She refused to accept that fate. “Everybody wants to live with dignity,” she said. By her 30s, Ms. Rajput had become more sure of herself. She began wearing makeup and growing out her hair. She changed her name to Vidhya. She also made peace with her mother, who moved into Ms. Rajput’s apartment, a gray, airless room with a communal bathroom and just enough space for a bed.  Then came the evening when Ms. Rajput confronted her abusers, who numbered around two dozen. After she yelled at them, they charged her. Fortunately, she was almost home, so she ran into her building and barricaded the door. Alarmed at the commotion, Ms. Rajput’s mother, then in her 60s, ran downstairs and lunged in front of her daughter just as the mob broke in and began beating them before neighbors intervened. “She was trying to protect me,” Ms. Rajput recalled through tears.  Several months later, Ms. Rajput was out running an errand when her mother suffered a fatal heart attack. They did not get to say goodbye.  “I miss her all the time,” Ms. Rajput said. “Despite not being so literate, she started to understand why I had come out of her stomach.” Ms. Rajput threw herself into activism as a way to heal. In 2009, she used her monthly salary of $14 from the Hotel Guru to start Chhattisgarh Mitwa Sankalp Samiti, a transgender advocacy organization.  Leaving meetings with government officials, she would regularly hear “loud roars of laughter” behind her. But the persistence paid off.  The government started allowing her to lead sensitivity training for state employees. Officials threw their support behind transgender beauty contests and sporting events that she organized. Using her own funds, she often provides young transgender people with money for food, and she calls them regularly to make sure they have a safe place to sleep. “She transformed my life,” said Soniya Janghel, 22, who worked in the sex trade before Ms. Rajput helped her get a job in the Chhattisgarh government last year.  As much as she has accomplished, Ms. Rajput knows there is still so much to do. To drive home the point, she grabbed a photo collage from the shelf above her bed. It was a present she had given to an ex-boyfriend a few years ago after completing her sexual reassignment surgery, portraits of them smiling and embracing. “Sweet Memories,” she said, reading the collage’s title. She laughed at this, and then started to cry. “His parents didn’t approve,” she said. “Men only keep a relationship with me in a dark room and take away everything — financially, physically, mentally, my belief in the world.” Ms. Rajput said her isolation reflected one of the hardest parts of her work: persuading others to view her as a worthy partner, employee and friend. It was this ache for love, she said, that would consume her until the very end. “Maybe in 200 years people will accept me as a woman,” she said. “I want to believe that, because I have everything, all of nature’s softness and power. There is no difference between you and me. Not a single thing.” Surabhi Singh contributed reporting.']","Vidhya Rajput, a transgender activist, has emerged as a leader in a gathering rights revolution in India.

"Israel’s Netanyahu Indicted on Charges of Fraud, Bribery and Breach of Trust",2019-11-21,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was indicted Thursday on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a set of long-running corruption cases, throwing his political future into doubt and heightening the uncertainty and chaos surrounding Israel’s fitful, yearlong struggle to choose its next leader. Mr. Netanyahu, 70, who in July became the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, now also has the distinction of being the first to be indicted while in office. The cases against Mr. Netanyahu involve allegations of giving or offering lucrative official favors to several media tycoons in exchange for favorable news coverage or gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The indictment threatened to open a dangerous new challenge to Israel’s democracy, as the nation’s top prosecutor and its premier accused each another of subverting the rule of law. “The public interest requires that we live in a country where no one is above the law,” Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said in a televised evening news conference. In a defiant speech an hour later, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that the case against him was built on lies and political animus. He declared that it was the police and prosecutors who should be called to account, urging Israel’s citizens to “investigate the investigators.” By turns fiery and maudlin, he told Israelis that they were “witnessing an attempted coup.” “I will not allow lies to prevail,” he vowed. “I will continue to lead this country.” Mr. Netanyahu is not legally required to step down. But with Israel’s political system already in uncharted territory, having failed to settle upon a new prime minister despite two elections and three attempts at forming a government since April, the criminal case against him could make it far more difficult for him to retain power. After his chief rival, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, failed to form a government by the Wednesday deadline, that task shifted to Parliament. If no lawmaker is successful in assembling a 61-seat majority over the next three weeks, a third round of elections will be called. While Mr. Netanyahu has maintained strong support from his political base so far, polls have shown that a formal indictment would change many minds, including among many right-wing voters. “We’ve seen consistently that a big majority of the public, about two-thirds, do not think a prime minister can serve and at the same time try to clear his name in court,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. In an October survey by the institute, nearly half of right-wing voters concurred. There were already signs of unrest in Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, as a popular younger lawmaker, Gideon Saar, called Thursday for a primary contest for prime minister, and said he would be a contender.  Even if Mr. Netanyahu fends off intraparty challengers, and assembles a viable coalition in Parliament, Mr. Plesner said that the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, might balk at assigning him the task of forming a government while he awaits trial. In addition, critics are expected to petition the Supreme Court to rule that Mr. Netanyahu must step down.  Existing law requires an ordinary government minister to resign when under indictment but whether that law applies to a prime minister has not been tested. There are also legal questions about whether the president may allow an indicted lawmaker to form a government. The decision by Mr. Mandelblit to prosecute the prime minister capped a drawn-out process that has loomed over Israel politics for two years, weakening Mr. Netanyahu politically and emboldening the center-left.  Mr. Netanyahu has fomented right-wing anger at Israel’s judiciary and law-enforcement community for months, accusing them of trying to bring him down. Alluding to that, Mr. Mandelblit warned against “violent and belligerent discourse against law enforcement officials,” which he called “playing with fire.” “Law enforcement is not a choice,” he added. “This is not a matter of left or right. This is not a matter of politics.” Mr. Netanyahu asked for the public’s sympathy, saying “my blood has been spilled,” along with that of his wife and son, in unfair attacks in the Israeli news media. The corruption cases helped fuel the rise of the Blue and White party, led by Mr. Gantz, whose animating idea was that the allegations disqualified Mr. Netanyahu from continuing to serve. Mr. Gantz issued a one-sentence statement late Thursday: “This is a very sad day for the state of Israel.” The No. 2 official in Blue and White, Yair Lapid, was more pointed: “If he still cares about the country he should do one more thing for it,” he said of Mr. Netanyahu. “Resign.” The cases have also slowly emboldened rivals within Likud. Mr. Saar said that “it will not be reasonable” to expect that Mr. Netanyahu could succeed in a third election, after having twice failed to form a government and now with the additional baggage of criminal charges.  “We need to set a Likud leadership primary,” he said at a Jerusalem Post conference on Thursday. “I’ll be able to form a government and I think I will be able to unify the nation.” Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, has focused enormous energy on persuading his supporters that the sprawling investigations were trumped-up and motivated by partisan bias, and on seeking to gain immunity from prosecution as long as he remains in office. For months as the investigations dragged on, Mr. Netanyahu complained that the Israeli left, the news media and law enforcement agencies were conspiring to oust him by legal means because they could not defeat him at the ballot box. In striking parallels to President Trump’s characterizations of the investigations against him, Mr. Netanyahu has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” and his allies have called it the product of a “deep state” conspiracy against Mr. Netanyahu — though Mr. Netanyahu himself appointed many of the key law-enforcement officials investigating him. Indeed, Mr. Mandelblit was once Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet secretary, perhaps his closest adviser in the government. The prime minister also seemed to work feverishly to use the legislative and political processes to aid his defense. Last December, he called a snap election for April, calculating that he might win a strong re-election mandate if the ballots were cast before Mr. Mandelblit announced whether he planned to seek an indictment. Then, having scheduled the vote, he argued that Mr. Mandelblit ought to delay announcing his decision until after it, to avoid unfairly influencing the outcome. Neither gambit worked: Mr. Mandelblit announced his intention to seek bribery and other charges 40 days before the April 9 vote. After the April election ended inconclusively, Mr. Netanyahu’s allies pushed a bill in Parliament to give all members, including Mr. Netanyahu, immunity from prosecution. It was abandoned when critics, including members of his party, called the idea authoritarian and antidemocratic.  He also reportedly discussed seeking legislation to give Parliament the power to override a potentially unfavorable ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court, if a law granting Mr. Netanyahu immunity were challenged. Again and again, Mr. Netanyahu sought to portray himself as a victim, in part as a way to keep his conservative political base united behind him. He petitioned unsuccessfully to bar evidence in the corruption cases from being published before the do-over election on Sept. 17. Failing that, he called damaging reports about that evidence a “terror attack against democracy.” Finally, Mr. Netanyahu extracted repeated promises from members of Likud and of its allied right-wing and religious parties to stick by him and insist on entering a new government only if he remained prime minister. It was vital to Mr. Netanyahu to stay on as prime minister, rather than agree to share power with Mr. Gantz taking the top job first, because if he held any post lower than prime minister, he would have to resign immediately if indicted.  Current Israeli law allows a prime minister to remain in office until a final court verdict, after appeals have been exhausted — a process that could take years. That solidarity posed an insurmountable obstacle for Mr. Gantz and Blue and White, which finished narrowly ahead of Likud in the September ballot, but far short of a majority. On Wednesday, Mr. Gantz acknowledged that he had been unable to form a governing coalition. The three cases against Mr. Netanyahu all involve trading official favors. In the most serious, in which he was charged with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust, Mr. Netanyahu was accused of providing regulatory benefits worth hundreds of millions of dollars as a bribe to the parent company of Walla, a leading Israeli news website, for favorable coverage of the prime minister and his family, and rough treatment of his adversaries. Bribery is considered the gravest corruption charge in Israel.  In the two other cases, Mr. Netanyahu was charged with fraud and breach of trust. In one, Mr. Mandelblit said the Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, an expatriate Israeli, along with the Australian billionaire James Packer, had sent hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts to the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem, including what he called a “veritable supply chain” of cigars and Champagne. In return, Mr. Mandelblit said, Mr. Netanyahu had taken actions benefiting Mr. Milchan on a visa application, a tax exemption and a business merger. In the other, Mr. Netanyahu was accused of discussing, though not consummating, another trade for favorable coverage. Prosecutors said that in calls with the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, one of Israel’s biggest newspapers, Mr. Netanyahu offered to press a competing newspaper, Israel Hayom, to curtail its free circulation, which was undercutting Yediot financially.  Israel Hayom is owned by Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire casino owner who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Netanyahu’s. Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyers sought to avert indictment at a four-day hearing in October. But Mr. Mandelblit said they had succeeded only in modifying the allegations against the prime minister, not refuting them. Several other people were indicted in connection with the cases against Mr. Netanyahu, including the Yediot Ahronot publisher, Arnon Mozes, and Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Bezeq, the parent company of Walla News.']","The first prosecution of a sitting Israeli premier deepens the political paralysis in a country that has had two inconclusive elections this year, and may be headed to a third vote."
U.K. Takes Back Children From Former ISIS Territory,2019-11-22,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Several unaccompanied children have been repatriated from former Islamic State territory in Syria to Britain, as European nations grapple with questions about what to do with the potential return of citizens who joined the terrorist group. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the children’s repatriation had been “a great success,” but he cautioned that it would be “over-optimistic to say that we could do it in every single case.”  The British foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said in October that “unaccompanied minors or orphans” who were caught up in the fighting in Syria could be returned to Britain “assuming they would not represent a security threat.” On Thursday, Mr. Raab said that repatriating such children “was the right thing to do.” “These innocent, orphaned, children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war,” Mr. Raab said in a statement. “Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life.”  Britain has been among the most resistant countries to repatriate its citizens, even stripping a teenager, Shamima Begum, who traveled to Syria to marry an Islamic State fighter, of her citizenship.  Pressure on European countries to repatriate citizens has increased since Turkey invaded Kurdish-controlled territory in northern Syria last month. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said in recent weeks that he would deport dozens of captured Islamic State militants and their families. The British authorities did not make the number of children or their age public, or offer any other details, but a senior Kurdish official posted on Twitter that three British orphans of parents who had joined ISIS had been handed over to a British delegation. The Rojava Information Center, an information service led by activists in Kurdish-held areas, said the children were ages 7 to 10.  The Kurdish official, Abdulkarim Omar, posted a video on Facebook in which he is seen greeting Britain’s special envoy for Syria, Martin Longden, and signing documents that appear to make the handover official.  The children, who were believed to be all from one family, were flown to London after the meeting, according to judiciary officials quoted by British news outlets, and were met by members of their extended family. The legacy of ISIS “still creates victims, including the children of their own foreign fighters,” Mr. Longden says in the video. “Those children, they have no responsibility for the situation they now find themselves in.” An email sent to the foreign secretary’s office seeking comments was not immediately answered on Friday. Human rights organizations and lawyers have urged governments to take back families who traveled to territories once controlled by ISIS, arguing that the longer the children stay, the harder it will be to reintegrate them into their home country. In April, Kosovo repatriated more than 70 children, and Central Asian countries have taken back hundreds of others, including more than 350 in Kazakhstan. But the prospect of the potential return of children of ISIS members has been met with much greater resistance over all. Since the American-led coalition defeated ISIS in its last territory in March, European nations have repatriated just a limited number of children and families on a case-by-case basis.  France repatriated five children in March, and 12 more in June. That same month, Belgium took back six children, and Norway five. Mr. Omar, the Kurdish official, said on Tuesday on Twitter that Kurdish forces had handed over an orphaned child to a Danish delegation. Courts in some countries, including the Netherlands and Belgium, have ruled that some families should be repatriated, but in general, analysts say, European governments have taken a passive approach on repatriation. “European governments have taken the few fighters and families sent in their direction by Turkish authorities or the Kurds, but they are not proactively demanding repatriation or seeking to accelerate it,” said Thomas Renard, a senior research fellow at the Egmont Institute, a research group in Brussels.  Nonprofit organizations and experts have warned that thousands of women and children remain stranded in squalid camps, suffering from, and dying of, malnutrition, disease, and in the winter, exposure to the cold.  Yet, while the Turkish incursion in northern Syria may have prodded European governments to address repatriations, it may have made the returns more complicated, analysts said.  “The Kurdish forces used to be the only interlocutor for repatriation, and now we’ve added Turkey, and potentially another interlocutor if the regime of Bashar al-Assad puts its hands on citizens of European countries at some point,” Mr. Renard said, referring to the Syrian leader. As Turkish forces moved into Kurdish-controlled territories in northern Syria last month, Kurdish militias struck a deal with the Russian-backed Syrian government allowing Mr. Assad’s army to retake control of northern territories. That fed fears among Western governments that citizens could be detained by Syrian forces and then used as bargaining chips. The announcement that Britain would take back at least some children from Syria was welcomed by advocates, although they urged the government to repatriate more. “It shows that the route remains open and the repatriations are possible, despite the tense situation on the ground,” said Orlaith Minogue of the charity Save the Children.  Estimates vary, but up to 60 British children are still in Syria, according to the organization.  “Three children are the tip of the iceberg,” said Joana Cook, a senior research fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King’s College in London.  Ms. Cook said that by repatriating only orphaned children, the British authorities were creating a “hierarchy of victims,” with the most vulnerable orphans seen as the most acceptable to be repatriated. “That is not addressing the problem in the way the current situation requires it,” Ms. Cook added. ']",The Kurdish authorities said three children in Syria had been handed over to British officials.
Hong Kong Court Reinstates Mask Ban Before Citywide Election,2019-11-22,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court on Friday temporarily reinstated a ban on wearing face masks that targeted antigovernment protesters, after an earlier ruling found the law unconstitutional in what had been a rare victory for pro-democracy activists. The judgment on Friday was handed down just days after China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress, said that it would step in, if necessary, to overrule the city’s judiciary. The warning was seen as the most decisive move yet by Beijing to intervene in Hong Kong’s political crisis. It also came just ahead of citywide district elections on Sunday that are being seen as a referendum on the protest movement. The ruling, by Hong Kong’s High Court, said that the ban on facial coverings would be brought back for seven days to give the government an opportunity to apply for an appeal. The court said the ruling had been made “in view of the great public importance of the issues raised in this case, and the highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing.” Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who had challenged the mask ban in court, said he was “naturally disappointed by the judgment.”  “If a law has already been declared unconstitutional and violates the basic human rights of the Hong Kong people,” he said, “it should not be enforced at all, not even one day, not even one second.”  The court had struck down the ban on Monday, ruling that it violated Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. The decision was a blow to the local government’s ability to characterize the continuing protests as a situation requiring the invocation of emergency powers. Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong Law School, said the court’s ruling to reinstate the ban for seven days was “not normal.” He said the Chinese government could directly intervene through an “interpretation,” a rarely exercised authority granted by the Basic Law that allows Beijing to decide on the city’s legal affairs. Such a move would almost certainly provoke widespread alarm and anger in the territory.  “Beyond seven days, whether the same court or the appeal court will maintain the suspension will no doubt be contested,” Mr. Young said. But by the time the courts reach another decision on the mask ban, he added, an “interpretation” by the leadership of China’s Communist Party may “have rendered these questions moot.” In the six months since the demonstrations began, in opposition to an unpopular bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, the protesters’ demands have grown to include calls for more democracy and an investigation into accusations of police brutality. The extradition bill has since been withdrawn, but Beijing’s assertion of authority over Hong Kong has caused concern in the city, where a more transparent court system has been a central feature of the “one country, two systems” policy that promises the territory greater freedoms than in mainland China. The mask ban, which was enacted in October and had been mostly ignored by protesters, further inflamed tensions in the city and set off a series of violent clashes. The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, imposed the ban without seeking legislative approval by invoking powers granted under a rarely used emergency regulations ordinance.']",The ruling came just days before a vote that is being seen as a referendum on the protest movement in the semiautonomous territory.
Mike Pence Makes Unannounced Visit to Iraq,2019-11-23,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Vice President Mike Pence made an unexpected visit to Iraq on Saturday, arriving as protests aimed at toppling the Iraqi leadership and changing the political system continued to roil the country.  Mr. Pence made two stops: He landed with the permission of the Iraqi government at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq’s western desert, where many of the American troops are billeted while they train and assist the Iraqi forces fighting the remains of the Islamic State. He then flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.  Mr. Pence received a classified briefing at the air base, from which American Special Forces had launched the operation in Syria last month that led to the death of the Islamic State leader,  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He then spoke by phone with Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mehdi but did not meet with him, according to the Mr. Mehdi’s office.  In a statement, his office said the two men “discussed the latest developments in Iraq and the Iraqi government efforts at reform in response to the demonstrators’ demands.” Mr. Pence told reporters that Mr. Mehdi promised “that they would work to protect and respect peaceful protesters as part of the democratic process.” In Erbil, Mr. Pence met with two powerful Kurdish politicians who are cousins: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and Masrour Barzani, the prime minister.   Mr. Pence denied that there was any tension with Iraqi or Syrian Kurds over Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision in October to withdraw American forces from northeast Syria, where Syrian Kurdish forces had been fighting the Islamic State alongside the Americans.   “I don’t think there was any confusion now among the leadership here in the Kurdish region of President Trump’s commitment to our allies here in Iraq as well as those in the Syrian Defense Forces, the Kurdish forces who fought alongside us. It’s unchanging,” Mr. Pence said.  The sudden departure of the American troops in October left Syrian Kurdish civilians and forces vulnerable to Turkish forces who entered their territory, taking ground and killing nearly 100 civilians and displacing 200,000, according to the United Nations.    Mr. Pence’s trip came 11 months after President Trump made a similar, unannounced visit to Al Asad, just days after announcing that he was pulling American troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The change in policy caused a major shake-up in the White House defense and foreign policy team. Mr. Trump’s plans to meet with Mr. Mehdi were canceled.  The timing of the trip by Mr. Pence — the second-most-senior member of the American government — was significant. It underscored the United States’ continued engagement in Iraq and was an implicit riposte to Iran, which has often tried to present itself to Iraqi leaders as a more consistent partner than the Americans.  Iran has dispatched Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the leader of its Quds Force, the most elite arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, on multiple occasions to address difficult political situations. He was in Baghdad recently to help the Iraqis plot a response to the protests. Later Saturday, Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, served Thanksgiving lunch to about 150 troops, and the vice president delivered remarks to about 200 personnel. The United States has about 6,000 troops in Iraq.  Speaking at Erbil Air Base, Mr. Pence praised the efforts of American troops and their allies in defeating the Islamic State but did not mention the Iraqi military by name, though thousands of its personnel gave their lives. Mr. Pence also made no distinction between the Kurds in Syria who fought long, grueling battles against the Islamic State over the past two years, and those he was visiting in Iraqi Kurdistan, who also played a role but were not involved in the same level of combat.  “The American people will also never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of the brave Kurdish fighters who stood shoulder to shoulder with us in the fight against ISIS,” he said. The visit occurred as Iraqi government leaders have struggled to deal with street protests, which have galvanized many in the south of the country as well as in the capital, Baghdad.  On Saturday, Iraqi officials said one person had been shot dead and dozens of others wounded as protests continued in the capital. Iran, which sees the uprising in Iraq as a threat that  has encouraged a similar if more limited movement at home, has advocated a tough response. The United States has lobbied against that approach, encouraging Iraq to work with the nonviolent protesters, but has taken the same view as Iran toward the prime minister.  Both countries’ leadership believe that he should remain in power for the moment, because if he were swept away — as some protesters want — it could lead to a chaotic situation in which bloodshed or even a renewed civil war could occur.  Unlike Iran, the United States wants to see reforms made in the Iraqi system to root out corruption and create an electoral system that is less dominated by sectarian apolitical parties that tend to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people.  Less than 24 hours before Mr. Pence’s arrival, a rocket was fired at Green Zone, the location of the United States Embassy. ']",The vice president’s trip signaled the United States’ continuing engagement in the country and came 11 months after President Trump made his own surprise visit to Iraq. 
"Evo Morales Raises a Fist, but Knows His Presidency is Over",2019-11-23,By Elisabeth Malkin and Elda Cantú,"['MEXICO CITY — Evo Morales, the ousted president of Bolivia, now lives in exile on a military base in Mexico City, where he says he spends much of the day taking calls from Bolivians pleading for his help. More than 3,000 miles from his country, where politicians are threatening to have him arrested if he returns, Mr. Morales is still trying to carry on as the president who delivers for his constituents — in his eyes, the savior of Bolivia.  And yet, Mr. Morales seemed to acknowledge during an interview that his time in power — and his worldwide renown as Bolivia’s first Indigenous president — had come to an end.  After almost 14 years in power, he left the country with what he said was little more than the clothes on his back. He had run for a fourth term, and declared himself the winner, but the election result was in dispute.  With protesters blocking the streets, and his police and military turning against him, he was spirited out of the country by a Mexican military plane and arrived in Mexico City on Nov. 12. It all happened so fast that he left behind his Bolivian passport, he said. “I am already Mexican. Look,” he joked, brandishing his new Mexican immigration permit at the start of an interview at the offices of The New York Times in Mexico City on Friday.  He was driven to the interview in a sport utility vehicle and hustled from the street into the building by Mexico’s equivalent of the secret service.  In a photo session, he raised a fist in the defiant gesture of a revolutionary leader. He said that he is still the president of his country, at least until Jan. 22, when his term officially ends, and should be allowed to return to Bolivia to finish out the last two months of his presidency.  “Here, what can we do?” he asked, regret in his voice. “We have to defend, not just defend Evo, defend the social programs.” He is convinced that there is a resounding call for him to return to Bolivia, and that the country cannot progress without him. His party, which has a majority in congress, has proposed granting him and his inner circle immunity from prosecution, according to a local news report. But events in Bolivia’s administrative capital, La Paz, have rushed forward since he left. Amid continuing protests by his supporters and violent crackdowns by security forces, his own party and the opposition are working on passing legislation that would pave the way for new elections, The Associated Press reported.  He shrugged off statements from some in his own party that they will run new candidates in new elections, declaring that it’s only “some compañeros who I think are not listening to the people’s clamorous demand.” He promised to support his party’s candidate for president, calling it an obligation. And he added that now that he is “freed from being president,” he will have more time to campaign for his party’s candidates.  In a tone far more subdued than in some other recent public appearances, he spoke nostalgically about his country. He said that he missed the coca leaf — a stimulant that many Bolivians chew: He is the longtime leader of the union of coca growers. He joked that Mexican food was a little too spicy, and that he had to learn to eat tortillas instead of quinoa. The Mexican government offered Mr. Morales asylum and welcomed him as it would a dignitary: He was greeted by the foreign minister when he landed in Mexico City and named a distinguished guest by the city’s mayor.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador assigned military officers who belonged to the disbanded presidential guard to protect him. The government settled him into a military facility that he has been told not to identify for security reasons.  He admitted that he now feels caged, beginning his days with a jog in the base’s gym at 6 a.m. He lives there with a small entourage that accompanied him into exile, including his vice president, Alvaro García Linera, and his health minister, Dr. Gabriela Montaño. His two children, he said, were expected to arrive in Argentina on Saturday, and were not planning to come to Mexico.  He spends his days giving interviews to the media, he said, his voice trailing off.  He spoke with longing for the days when he traveled through Bolivia with the power to oversee the building of public projects for Bolivia’s Indigenous communities, the poorest people in one of the poorest countries in South America. “I miss that,” he said. “Delivering public works, approving new works, knowing Bolivia better, its needs. That is the job. For me you do not govern just in the palace, you govern in every part of the country.” But he had no regrets, he said — not about his decision to run for a fourth term, or the presidential election in October that set off rioting after he declared that he had won.  He said that he resigned the presidency three weeks later to save the lives of his supporters whose houses had been burned down by opponents.  He decided to leave for Mexico he said, to save lives, perhaps even his own. He said that a member of his security team had showed him an anonymous text message claiming that there was a $50,000 bounty on his head to arrest or even kill him.  It was not the step that a revolutionary would take, he acknowledged, quoting Fidel Castro’s slogan “Fatherland or Death.” He said that he resisted at first, but his ministers persuaded him to leave.  The Mexican government sent a plane but for hours it was unable to land, as the Bolivian military placed bureaucratic obstacles in its way. Finally, a full day after he resigned, the plane took off.  “When we were in the airplane, I said, ‘our lives are safe,’” he recalled.  While he was on his way out, he said he heard that the United States government had spoken to his foreign minister and offered to send its own plane to take him out of the country. He said that he had joked, “Maybe they will take me to Guantánamo.” Washington and his political opponents were determined to keep him out of Bolivia, he said. “I am not desperate to be president, but they should give me my political rights, so that I can go back,” he said. “Why are they so afraid of Evo?”   ']",
"Julian Assange ‘Could Die’ in U.K. Jail, Doctors Warn",2019-11-25,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON —\xa0The mental and physical condition of Julian Assange has so deteriorated that he could die in a British jail before his February hearing on extradition to the United States, a group of international doctors has warned. In an open letter to Britain’s home secretary, Priti Patel, more than 60 doctors called for Mr. Assange, the 48-year-old founder of WikiLeaks, to be transferred from the high-security Belmarsh prison in London to a university teaching hospital to receive an expert medical assessment. “Were such urgent assessment and treatment not to take place, we have real concerns, on the evidence currently available, that Mr. Assange could die in prison,” the letter said. “The medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose.” Their assessment is based on witness accounts from an October hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, in which Mr. Assange was described as “exhibiting the symptoms of a torture victim.” The analysis was corroborated this month by Nils Melzer, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, who wrote a report about Mr. Assange’s health, warning that his life was at risk. “What we have seen from the U.K. government is outright contempt for Mr. Assange’s rights and integrity,” Mr. Melzer wrote in the report. “Despite the medical urgency of my appeal, and the seriousness of the alleged violations, the U.K. has not undertaken any measures of investigation, prevention and redress required under international law.” The doctors’ letter describes how, over the years, Mr. Assange was threatened with arrest if he left the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to seek treatment for a series of ailments, including a cracked molar and shoulder stiffness.  In 2015, a trauma and psychosocial expert who assessed Mr. Assange’s condition at the embassy concluded that he was suffering from moderately severe depression. Mr. Assange is serving a 50-week prison sentence for jumping bail, imposed after he took refuge in Ecuador’s Embassy seven years ago. He faces espionage charges in the United States for publishing classified military and diplomatic documents. Last week, the Swedish authorities dropped a long-running investigation into a rape allegation against Mr. Assange after prosecutors concluded that too much time had elapsed since the events in question. Richard Galpin, a BBC journalist present at Mr. Assange’s court hearing in October, described the WikiLeaks founder as “frail- looking” and said Mr. Assange had struggled to remember when he was born. Doctors who carried out medical assessments on Mr. Assange last year while he was in the Ecuadorean Embassy warned that his time there was “dangerous to his physical and mental health” and a “clear infringement to his human right to health care.” The doctors who signed the open letter to Ms. Patel this week said they had done so out of a professional duty to report suspected torture. “We wish to put on record, as medical doctors, our collective serious concerns and to draw the attention of the public and the world to this grave situation,” they wrote.']",More than 60 physicians signed a letter saying that the WikiLeaks founder might not survive until February unless he receives an urgent expert medical assessment.
Would-Be Chinese Defector Details Covert Campaigns in Hong Kong and Taiwan,2019-11-23,By Steven Lee Myers and Damien Cave,"['BEIJING — A man claiming to be a disillusioned Chinese intelligence operative has told the Australian authorities that China’s military intelligence agencies were directly intervening in politics in Hong Kong and Taiwan, buying media coverage, infiltrating universities, funneling donations to favored candidates and creating thousands of social media accounts to attack Taiwan’s governing party. So far, some Western diplomatic officials believe the claims by an asylum seeker named Wang Liqiang to be reliable at least in part, according to two people briefed on the matter. While some of his details appeared speculative and impossible to verify, the officials were taking his claims seriously, the people said.  If verified, his account would be one of the most detailed ever made public of China’s covert measures to manipulate politics and public opinion in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Mr. Wang’s account, a 17-page plea for political asylum in Australia, reads in parts like an espionage thriller. He detailed code names of covert operations, shadowy business ventures and ultimately his dawning disenchantment with what he described as China’s efforts to stifle democracy and human rights around the world. “I do not want to see Taiwan becoming a second Hong Kong,” he wrote. “And I would not become an accomplice in the conspiracy of turning an originally democratic and free land into autocratic land.” The office of Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed receiving Mr. Wang’s statement, which was first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. An English translation was provided to The New York Times by a person familiar with his request for asylum. The people familiar with Mr. Wang’s statement requested anonymity because his allegations are still being investigated. On Sunday, the Chinese government answered Mr. Wang’s allegations by saying he was a convicted swindler who had been sentenced to more than a year in prison in a 2016 fraud case and was wanted by the Shanghai police in a case from earlier this year.   Mr. Wang’s statement to the Australian authorities surfaced as protests continue to convulse Hong Kong, driven in large part by concerns over the steady encroachment of Communist Party rule despite Beijing’s pledge to respect the former British colony’s economic and political autonomy.  In his account, Mr. Wang said he was involved with the apprehension by Chinese agents in 2015 of five booksellers in Hong Kong, an incident often cited by demonstrators. He said he received orders “to pay close attention” to one of them, Lee Bo, for his involvement in publishing a gossipy book called “Xi Jinping and His Six Women” that purported to delve into the personal life of China’s top leader. The statement also emerged only weeks before Taiwan’s presidential election in January. The campaign has already been shaken by allegations of Chinese interference. The governing party has accused China of supporting the opposition party, the Kuomintang.  “I have to repeat that China is factually interfering in Taiwan’s election, and it happens every day,” Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, said on Tuesday as she officially launched a re-election campaign. Beijing has made no secret of its opposition to Ms. Tsai and her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has sought to bolster Taiwan’s political and economic independence. Her challenger is Han Kuo-yu, a populist who was last year elected mayor of Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan, and who has promised to improve relations with the mainland. According to his account, Mr. Wang himself helped funnel campaign donations of roughly $2.8 million to Mr. Han in the 2018 elections. “Now that the 2020 presidential election is approaching, China will be putting much more efforts into it,” he wrote. Chao Chien-min, one of Mr. Han’s policy advisers, strongly disputed the accusations.  “How could Han Kuo-yu dare to casually accept 20 million renminbi in unknown money?” he said. “Does he still want to survive in Taiwan’s political arena? I believe that is impossible.”  Mr. Wang’s allegations seem certain to reverberate widely in Taiwan, in Hong Kong and on the mainland. Although China’s intelligence operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong have long been presumed to be robust, the statement provided an extraordinary amount of detail.  “We had an inkling this was happening, but we have never had evidence or an insider’s account,” Adam Ni, a researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney who has been recently working in Taiwan, said in a telephone interview. With the elections in Taiwan, for example, Mr. Wang described how the separate branches of China’s military divided up their labors.  Mr. Wang said intelligence efforts included creating more than 20 media and internet companies to launch “targeted attacks,” and spending roughly $200 million over an unspecified period to invest in television stations in Taiwan. His statement did not explain how such a large sum of money failed to be noticed or raise alarms. The disclosures could also further sour relations between China and Australia, which recently passed a law seeking to rein in foreign interference after several wealthy Chinese businessmen tied to Beijing were accused of trying to manipulate Australian politics.  One of those businessmen, Huang Xiangmo, was a successful developer who had his Australian residency canceled in February. According to Mr. Wang’s statement, Mr. Huang led a group of Australian state and local lawmakers to visit Hong Kong, where they met with Mr. Wang’s boss, a man named Xiang Xin. Mr. Huang, who has previously rejected the claim that he has tried to interfere in Australian politics on behalf of Beijing, could not be reached for comment.  These kinds of connections between Australian lawmakers, Chinese wealth and officials whose Communist Party ties are masked by big business have put much of Australia on edge. Earlier this week, the former head of Australia’s main foreign intelligence agency described China’s espionage efforts as “insidious.” Mr. Wang described himself as the son of a public servant, but little else is known about him, including his age and hometown. He could not be reached for comment. One clue from his statement is that he studied to be a painter, winning awards in Anhui Province in eastern China.  Seeking a job, he ended up at an investment firm called China Innovation Investment Limited, run by Mr. Xiang. Mr. Wang wrote that the company was in fact a front for an arm of China’s Ministry of National Defense to conduct a range of political and economic espionage. Mr. Xiang, 54, is an owner or top director at more than a dozen Hong Kong companies. Some of the companies are co-owned by his wife, Gong Qing, whose biography includes positions at two government-tied institutions. One of those was the China National Science and Technology Information Center, a military intelligence organization within the People’s Liberation Army.  Asked to comment, Mr. Xiang denied any knowledge of Mr. Wang. “I never knew Wang,” he wrote in an email. China Innovation Investments is registered in the Cayman Islands and publicly traded in Hong Kong. The company focuses on both private and public investments related to the “integration of military and civil sectors,” according to company documents. Mr. Xiang is the chairman and Ms. Gong is listed as an alternative director. The operations in Hong Kong Mr. Wang described occurred before the protests erupted. He said he became disillusioned when he was tasked to travel to Taiwan in May to take part in operations related to the coming election. He received a false identity with a South Korean passport and a predated French visa, which was mailed to him from the National University of Defense Technology in Hunan Province. His wife, also a painter, moved to Australia to study in 2012, he wrote. After visiting her and their child in December 2018, he decided to defect and seek asylum.  It is far from clear that he will receive it.  In 2005, Chen Yonglin, a Chinese consular official, sought asylum, promising to divulge details of China’s spy network. The Australian government initially rejected his request, prompting a parliamentary inquiry. It found that he was told the denial was “for reasons of foreign affairs.” Mr. Chen’s application was later approved.  Mr. Wang suggested he understood that Australia might again need to be persuaded before standing up for a single defector. He condemned China’s autocratic ways, expressing his “resolute opposition to the actions imposed by the Communist Party of China that trample on democracy, human rights and freedom.”  “If I return to the place under their control,” he added, “I will surely be killed for disclosing the secrets because I know too much.”  Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Damien Cave from Sydney. Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong. Claire Fu in Beijing contributed research.

Suspect Arrested in Anti-Semitic Harassment of Jewish Family,2019-11-24,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — A suspect has been arrested after a man was videotaped reading Bible passages to a Jewish man and a boy in the London Underground and accusing them of being “impostors,” in an episode of anti-Semitism that drew outrage. The British Transport Police said on Saturday that the man, who was not named, was detained on suspicion of having committed a racially aggravated public order offense. Video of the harassment emerged on social media on Friday afternoon, a few hours after the encounter on the Northern Line of London’s subway system. Video footage posted by another passenger and retweeted more than 18,000 times shows a man reading a section from the Bible to the Jewish man and boy, who are both wearing skullcaps. Witnesses said they were father and son. The man with the Bible is shown leaning into the boy, quoting Scripture and pointing from the text to the family. The boy stares ahead, looking bewildered, while the man presumed to be his father, one arm wrapped around his son, speaks to him calmly. The man and boy have not been identified. When another passenger objected, the man with the Bible began making threats.  “You get out of my face or I’m going to smack you right in the nose,” the man said. “Back up from me,” he continued, using a string of curse words. “I’m not no Christian pastor.”  At that point, a woman wearing a hijab intervened, telling him, “There’s children here.” The man then turned his attention to the woman, later identified by local news outlets as Asma Shuweikh.  “Listen, these people are impostors, trying to claim our heritage,” he told her, referring to the Jewish passengers. He also asked her why she was wearing pants. Anti-Semitic episodes have been on the rise in Britain as a whole, according to recent figures, with the issue rising to the forefront of the nation’s politics because of accusations against members of the opposition Labour Party. In the first six months of the year, Community Security Trust, a British charity focused on the security of Jews in the country, recorded 892 anti-Semitic cases across Britain — the highest ever recorded in the period running from January to June, according to a charity report published in August. The confrontation Saturday on the London Underground was brought to the police’s attention after Chris Atkins, a filmmaker who shot the footage of the racial abuse, shared the video online.  Mr. Atkins wrote on Twitter that Ms. Shuweikh had been “incredibly brave” and that he had changed seats with the young boy. Ms. Shuweikh, who could not be reached on Sunday, told Sky News that the man with the Bible had approached the Jewish man and boy, who were with other people not seen in the video, as soon as he saw them on the subway line in northern London.  “I thought, if I reason with him and talk to him and pretend that I’m sympathetic with what he’s saying, maybe I can defuse the problem because he was actually talking to a little boy,” Ms. Shuweikh said. She added that the children of the group looked scared. She said the boy was asking, “Daddy, what’s happening?” “I did start to panic when he came up into my face, but I managed to keep a calmness and keep trying to defuse the situation,” Ms. Shuweikh said.']",A video shared on social media showed a man quoting Bible passages to a man and boy wearing skullcaps in the London Underground.

Voters in Romania Reject Years of Scandals and Chaos,2019-11-24,By Kit Gillet and Marc Santora,"['BUCHAREST, Romania — In late 2016, a populist political party swept to power in Romania promising generous social spending, tax cuts and a continuation of the country’s alignment with the European Union, nine years after it had joined the bloc. What followed was a cascade of corruption scandals and political chaos, with the government led by the Social Democrats running through three prime ministers and almost 100 ministers. The party’s leader was carted off to prison. On Sunday, Romanian voters offered a verdict on the past almost three years: enough. President Klaus Iohannis — who spent his first term battling with the successive governments of the governing party — garnered more than 60 percent of the votes, according to early results, a tally that signaled a strong rejection of a party that was big on promises but defined by scandal. “I promise to be a president for all Romanians,” Mr. Iohannis, 60, said as the results came in. “The winner today is modern Romania, European Romania, the normal Romania.”  His opponent, Viorica Dancila, the recently deposed Social Democrat prime minister, conceded after exit polls showed her trailing by some 30 points. Official results were expected late Sunday or early Monday, but with 95 percent of polling stations around the country reporting, Mr. Iohannis had won around 63 percent of the vote. While the president has limited authority in the country’s parliamentary system, the campaign has been widely viewed as a referendum on the Social Democrats’ government and the party’s stumbling efforts to fight corruption, which continues to plague many facets of daily life in one of the poorest nations in the European Union. Romanians, especially the young and educated, have left the country in droves over the past decade, drawn by better opportunities elsewhere in Europe, but also by despondency over the lack of progress at home. Mr. Iohannis has increasingly positioned himself as the bulwark against attacks on the rule of law. In a televised news event days before the vote, he claimed that without him, the rule of law would have been broken in Romania. Ms. Dancila, for her part, has labeled him arrogant and a coward for refusing to face her in a public debate. In many ways, the struggle in Romania echoes the political drama playing out in other parts of the world, where leaders touting a populist agenda tapped into deep public dissatisfaction to take power, only to then push an agenda aimed more at sustaining their power than solving problems. In Romania, the architect of the Social Democrats platform was the all-powerful party boss, Liviu Dragnea. In the aftermath of the party’s 2016 victory, Mr. Dragnea followed a well-trodden path, promising generous social welfare programs while engaging in conspiracy-theory rhetoric.  From the outset, there were concerns that he would follow the example of other populist leaders, such as Viktor Orban in Hungary, and lead his party to use democratic means to build an “illiberal democracy,” a kind of soft authoritarianism where the essential organs of the state are compromised. But when the Romanian government attempted to decriminalize a number of graft offenses soon after coming to power, signaling one of the boldest retreats from anticorruption efforts in the European Union, the public backlash was swift and fierce. Specifically, the government adopted an emergency law that would have made official misconduct punishable by prison time only in cases in which the financial damage was more than 200,000 lei, or about $46,000. It was not lost on anyone that Mr. Dragnea stood to benefit, because he was facing charges of abuse of power involving about $25,800. More than half a million people poured into the streets to express their outrage in the largest demonstrations since the end of communist rule three decades earlier. While the government backed down from that legislation, other measures followed, and the protests have continued off and on. Antigovernment protests in August 2018 led to clashes between security forces and demonstrators, with hundreds injured after tear gas and water cannons were deployed. The Social Democrats turned to a familiar playbook to push back. They accused their opponents of being part of a dark conspiracy, some linking it to the Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, who often serves as an all-purpose boogeyman for populists worldwide. At a rally last spring in the Romanian capital, Bucharest — where the party bused in tens of thousands of supporters — the government sought to tie its travails to those suffered by President Trump. “We salute President Trump’s fight against the American deep state,” Liviu Plesoianu, a Social Democrat lawmaker, told supporters. “We know what forces are thrown against him.” Mr. Dragnea received support last summer from Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who sent a letter to Mr. Iohannis criticizing Romania’s anticorruption efforts. But in elections for the European Parliament in May, it was clear that voters were not buying the rhetoric, and the party was roundly rejected, garnering only 23 percent of the vote, half of what it achieved in the December 2016 domestic parliamentary elections. The day after the European vote, the police took Mr. Dragnea from his home after a final court ruling ordered him to begin serving three and a half years in prison for abuse of power. Then last month, Ms. Dancila’s government was ousted in a no-confidence vote, with the Social Democrats’ main rival, the National Liberals, forming a minority government. Mr. Iohannis, a member of the German minority of Transylvanian Saxons, has been accused of being somewhat remote. A staunch supporter of the European project, he is generally considered to be a safe steward and someone respected by foreign leaders. This is in contrast to Ms. Dancila, who during her time as prime minister was regularly assailed for her verbal gaffes and accused of rising to the position only because of her closeness to Mr. Dragnea. According to Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj, while Mr. Iohannis has not been the most charismatic of presidents, many Romanians continue to support him because “he’s a convinced pro-European and has confronted the corruption and regression embodied by the Social Democratic Party while it’s been in power.” Sorin Ionita, a political analyst at the Bucharest-based research group Expert Forum, said that Mr. Iohannis was fortunate to have received support from outside the country at crucial moments during his first term, but over all, he had been a good president.  “He had a contribution, counteracting the Social Democrats during the worst moments of the last almost three years,” Mr. Ionita said. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, Mr. Iohannis — nodding to the turmoil of the past few years — has opted for a more mundane message: “For a Normal Romania.”  Kit Gillet reported from Bucharest, and Marc Santora from Warsaw.']","President Klaus Iohannis claimed victory as his challenger, Viorica Dancila, conceded."
France Announces New Measures to Tackle Domestic Violence,2019-11-25,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — The French government unveiled new measures to combat domestic violence on Monday, amid growing awareness of the sometimes deadly toll it has taken on women in France. But advocacy groups said that the proposals, which seek to protect women from violent partners and to encourage them to file complaints, lacked the funding to be truly effective. Tens of thousands of people marched in Paris and other cities on Saturday to protest against gender-based violence in France, where last year 121 women were killed by current or former partners.  At the marches, participants wearing purple held up the names, pictures and ages of victims of domestic violence. A campaign of posters and graffiti around the country has also warned of an epidemic of “femicide.”  According to government figures, a woman is killed in France by a partner or former partner every three days, one of the highest rates in Western Europe.  Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said on Monday — the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women — that for too long there had been a “collective silence” on the failure to address the problem.  “This silence kills, and continues to do so,” Mr. Philippe said at a news conference in Paris to outline the new measures, which came after months of consultations among French officials, lawyers, prosecutors and associations.  Mr. Philippe said the government would increase efforts in schools to raise awareness of gender-based violence, open a round-the-clock domestic violence hotline, hire more specialized social workers in police stations, and increase treatment of violent partners to avoid repeat offenses. Every year in France, an estimated 219,000 women aged 18 to 75 are the targets of physical or sexual violence by current or former partners, but only 20 percent file official complaints, government statistics show. Mr. Philippe, noting that women were often the target of psychological as well as physical violence, said that the government would also change the law to recognize that victims of abuse can be under the psychological control of their abusers, unable to act independently.  “By putting it into the law, we are telling these women, ‘You are not the origin of what is happening, you are the victims,’” he said, adding, for instance, that the government would impose harsher penalties for partners who harass and push women to attempt suicide. Mr. Philippe said that the government would also work with doctors to ease confidentiality restrictions in cases where there is an “immediate danger” of renewed violence against the victim, enabling practitioners to flag cases to the legal authorities without a patient’s consent.  Currently, doctors can only do so when a patient is a minor or is “vulnerable,” a broad term that can refer to a disabled person, or when a person’s life is at imminent risk.  Some have balked at the idea, arguing that strict patient-doctor confidentiality is the only way women will feel comfortable coming forward with allegations of domestic violence. Gilles Lazimi, a doctor who is also a member of several women’s advocacy groups, told radio Franceinfo that the decision to report a case should rest with the victim. “You have to accompany them in the long term, respect them, explain to them what the aggressor’s strategy is, enable them to talk,” he said.  Mr. Philippe had announced emergency measures in September, including auditing police forces to ensure that women’s complaints are taken seriously and creating a universal protocol to assess the danger of a complainant’s living situation. France’s lower house of Parliament has also adopted legislation to increase the use of electronic bracelets to help judges and police officers enforce restraining orders. So far, only 1,000 such bracelets are expected to be deployed next year.  Parliament will examine other measures, including the potential for judges to suspend guardianship of children in cases of domestic violence. For those who kill their partners, such authority would be automatically stripped.  Advocacy groups have welcomed the surge in awareness of domestic violence, but on Monday they said some of the government’s measures did not go far enough.  Nous Toutes, or All of Us, one of the groups that organized the demonstrations on Saturday, said that some of the measures announced by Mr. Philippe, like training programs for teachers, already existed but lacked funding or were insufficiently applied.  “The disappointment is as high as the huge expectations that rose up these past months,” the group said in a statement. “We were expecting funding that showed a change in scale.” Caroline De Haas, a prominent activist who is part of Nous Toutes, welcomed Mr. Philippe’s strong condemnation of domestic violence but said that he had failed to back up his words. “He talks of major dysfunctions, he talks of a collective failure, but he does not draw any conclusions in terms of public policy,” Ms. De Haas said in a video statement.  At the heart of the disagreement is money. Mr. Philippe said that next year the government would spend 360 million euros, or nearly $400 million, on the fight against domestic violence. That is roughly the same amount as this year, advocacy groups say, but they were hoping for a substantial increase. “We want one billion, not one million,” was one of the rallying cries during the protests on Saturday.  A report last year from the High Council for Gender Equality, a governmental advisory body, estimated that it would take at least 500 million euros annually to effectively reduce domestic violence. ']","Advocacy groups welcomed a surge of awareness, but said the government’s proposals did not go far enough, and were not supported with nearly enough money. "
Meet 5 of Hong Kong’s Newest Politicians,2019-11-25,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s district council election saw the pro-establishment camp have one of its biggest defeats since the territory returned to Chinese control 22 years ago, as dozens of seasoned politicians were replaced with a crop of newcomers, many of whom were inspired to run by the antigovernment protests. The district councils are local advisory bodies that do not hold any lawmaking power, but the lopsided results were seen as a strong public endorsement of the continuing protest movement. Several newly elected district council members seized on the demands of the demonstrators as part of their campaign platforms, and seem eager to push their roles beyond the usual remit of neighborhood noise complaints and sanitation problems. Here’s a look at five of the most interesting new district councilors and what they have to say: Mr. Siu, 40, embraced the image of a protester in his campaign. A campaign photo features him in a yellow hard hat, goggles and a gas mask with his fingers extended to represent the demands of the protest movement, including calling for an investigation into use of force by the police, amnesty for arrested protesters and expanded democracy. Mr. Siu said he ran for the sake of his 2-year-old daughter, but had not expected to win. “I am no super man, not a social worker, not someone who speaks out for the people,” he wrote on Facebook. “But I hope that others can stand up for themselves, and I want to create a platform to give others the platform to speak up.”  Ms. Chau, 23, who works as a relationship manager at a bank in North Point, was arrested in August while live-streaming a protest, but she was never charged. She subsequently received harassing phone calls and was shoved and punched in the head while campaigning in October, one of several candidates on both sides who was assaulted during the campaign.  She condemned the authorities for failing to respond adequately to the violence surrounding the campaign. “We are innocent people who’ve been attacked,” she said. Ms. Chau defeated Hui Ching On, 53, a financial consultant who had held the seat since 1999. HK01, a Hong Kong news outlet, reported that during the previous four years, Mr. Hui had only spoken for 80 seconds during district council meetings. Mr. Sham, 32, was another candidate who was assaulted during the campaign. He was attacked by a group of men with hammers last month and continues to use crutches to walk.  As a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group of pro-democracy organizations, Mr. Sham helped organize several large, peaceful marches this summer. He was attacked previously, in August, on a day when the police announced they were banning plans for another march. Ray Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker who is gay, celebrated the victory of Mr. Sham, who is also gay, on a day that several establishment politicians who had opposed same-sex marriage and made homophobic comments had lost their district council races. Mr. Sham said that his own victory in the district race reflected a broader yearning for civic freedoms. “We are trying to listen to the demands of the people and to fight for their rights,” he said. Public criticism of the police and the officers’ use of force have been animating issues of the protest movement. Few embodied the issue more than Ms. Yau, 36, who formerly served as a police officer but quit this year after more than a decade on the force. “This year, I have decided to take off my uniform and gear, and stand together with Hong Kongers,” she said in announcing her campaign. Ms. Yau defeated Yolanda Ng, who had held the seat since 2007 and ran uncontested four years ago.  “The Hong Kong police force has become a political tool,” Ms. Yau wrote last week, adding that “police brutality and indiscriminate arrests have clearly illustrated the inseparable relationship between politics and society.” With his handwritten candidate introduction, Mr. Chan, a 27-year-old student, showed he was a political novice with no powerful backing. But despite his inexperience, he defeated Chris Ip, 39, a prominent figure in the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest pro-Beijing party.  Mr. Ip, who was the chairman of the Yau Tsim Mong district council, became a target of protesters in July after he blocked debate on the extradition bill that incited the protests this summer.

Hong Kong Election Results Give Democracy Backers Big Win,2019-11-24,"By Keith Bradsher, Austin Ramzy and Tiffany May","[""HONG KONG — Pro-democracy candidates buoyed by months of street protests in Hong Kong won a stunning victory in local elections on Sunday, as record numbers voted in a vivid expression of the city’s aspirations and its anger with the Chinese government.  It was a pointed rebuke of Beijing and its allies in Hong Kong, and the turnout — seven in 10 eligible voters — suggested that the public continues to back the democracy movement, even as the protests grow increasingly violent. Young Hong Kongers, a major force behind the demonstrations of the past six months, played a leading role in the voting surge.  With three million voters casting ballots, pro-democracy candidates captured 389 of 452 elected seats, up from only 124 and far more than they have ever won. The government’s allies held just 58 seats, a remarkable collapse from 300. To many democracy advocates, Sunday was a turning point.  “There has been a very deep awakening of the Hong Kong people,” said Alan Leong, chairman of the Civic Party, one of the largest pro-democracy parties.  The elections were for district councils, one of the lowest elected offices in Hong Kong, and they are typically a subdued affair focused on community issues. The job mostly entails pushing for neighborhood needs like bus stops and traffic lights.  But this election took on outsize significance, and was viewed as a referendum on the unrest that has created the city’s worst political crisis in decades. In a semiautonomous part of China where greater democracy is one of the protesters’ biggest demands, it gave residents a rare chance to vote.  The gains at the ballot box are likely to embolden a democracy movement that has struggled with how to balance peaceful and violent protests to achieve its goals. They are also likely to deepen the challenges for China’s central government, which wants to curb the unrest in Hong Kong. And they might exacerbate Beijing’s fears about giving the city’s residents even greater say in choosing their government. The district councils are among the most democratic bodies in Hong Kong. Almost all the seats are directly elected, unlike the legislature, where the proportion is just over half. The territory’s chief executive is also not chosen directly by voters, but is instead selected by a committee stacked in favor of Beijing. The election results will give democracy forces considerably more influence on that committee, which is scheduled to choose a new chief executive in 2022. The district councils name about a tenth of the group's 1,200 members, and now all of these will flip from pro-Beijing to pro-democracy seats. Democracy advocates already control about a quarter of the seats, while other previously pro-Beijing sectors of the committee are now starting to lean toward democracy, most notably accountants and real estate lawyers. Mr. Leong, the Civic Party chairman, called on the Chinese Communist Party to change its policies in Hong Kong. “Unless the C.C.P. is doing something concrete to address the concerns of the Hong Kong people,” he said, “I think this movement cannot end.”  Regina Ip, a cabinet member and the leader of a pro-Beijing political party, said she was surprised to see so many young voters, many of whom tried to confront her with the protesters’ demands.  “Normally,” she said, “the young people do not come out to vote. But this time, the opposition managed to turn them out.” Ahead of the election, the city’s leadership was concerned that the vote would be marred by the chaos of recent months. Some of the most violent clashes yet between protesters and the police took place last week, turning two university campuses into battlegrounds.  But the city remained relatively calm on Sunday as voters turned out in droves. Long lines formed at polling centers in the morning, snaking around skyscrapers and past small shops. Riot police officers were deployed near polling stations on Sunday.  David Lee, a retired printer approaching his 90th birthday, was among the earliest voters on Hong Kong Island and said he had come because he wanted democracy. “This is important,” he said.  Some analysts had predicted that pro-democracy candidates would have difficulty making big gains. Pro-Beijing candidates are much better financed, and the district races have traditionally been won on purely local issues, not big questions like democracy, said Joseph Cheng, a retired professor at City University of Hong Kong. But voter turnout soared to 71 percent, far surpassing expectations. Typically in district council elections, it is little more than 40 percent. Four years ago, after the 2014 Umbrella Movement increased public interest in politics, turnout climbed to 47 percent. This year, the number of registered voters hit a record.  On Sunday, several prominent pro-Beijing politicians lost their races, among them Michael Tien, a longtime establishment lawmaker. After his defeat, he said the increase in young voters signaled that they were becoming more politically engaged, adding that the government should listen to them. In the district of Tuen Mun, about a hundred people celebrated with cheers and champagne the defeat of Junius Ho, a controversial lawmaker many protesters accused of supporting mob attacks against them. The victory on Sunday eclipsed the pro-democracy camp’s last big win in these elections, when they won 198 seats, still short of a majority, following huge protests in 2003. Those demonstrations led the government to scrap a national security bill requested by Beijing that critics said would have endangered civil liberties in Hong Kong. The government’s allies dominated the elections that followed, though. Beijing began investing heavily in grass-roots mobilization efforts, including busing large numbers of older Hong Kong citizens from retirement homes in mainland China to polling places in Hong Kong. Instead of just focusing on local issues, many pro-democracy candidates ran on the broad themes of the protest movement, especially anger at police brutality, and the intensity of the demonstrations sometimes spilled into the race. Candidates on both sides were attacked while campaigning.  Mandy Lee, 53, a homemaker who voted at the Kowloon Bay neighborhood, showed up to vote for the pro-Beijing establishment and criticized the protests.  “It’s not that I have no sympathy toward young people, but I strongly believe that their efforts are futile,” she said. “We are a tiny island; it’s only a matter of time before China takes us over and integrates us.” The outcome of the election could further complicate the position of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive. Critics say that she has failed to engage with the community over the protests and many have demanded she step down. On Monday, Mrs. Lam said in a statement that the government respected the results of the election. “Many have pointed out that the results reflect the public’s dissatisfaction with the social situation and deep-seated problems,” she said, adding that the government would “listen to the views of the public with an open mind and seriously reflect on them.” In June, Mrs. Lam set off enormous protests by pushing ahead with a bill that would have allowed the extradition of Hong Kong residents to the opaque judicial system in mainland China. The issue played to deeper worries about Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong, which has maintained its own political and judicial system since the former British colony was reclaimed by China in 1997. Mrs. Lam withdrew her proposal after months of protests, but many said she acted too late. The protesters are now demanding additional concessions, including the introduction of universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police conduct.  The election results on Sunday will allow them to argue that the public supports them. About 57 percent of voters cast ballots for pro-democracy candidates, while nearly 40 percent voted for Beijing’s allies. The remaining 3 percent voted for independents, who won five seats. Many pro-Beijing political parties receive large donations from the Hong Kong subsidiaries of state-owned enterprises in mainland China, which they use to organize picnics and other campaign events. But the results on Sunday showed the limits of these efforts. Reporting was contributed by K.K.

Royal Jewels of ‘Immeasurable’ Value Are Stolen From a German Museum,2019-11-25,By Melissa Eddy and Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — Thieves broke into a museum in the eastern German city of Dresden early Monday and made off with three collections of jewelry from the royal house of Saxony, made of gold and precious stones, that authorities said were of immeasurable historical and cultural value.  The break-in took place in the Jewel Room, one of 10 rooms in the Royal Palace known as the Grünes Gewölbe, or Green Vault. The rooms hold a collection of 3,000 individual objects, gathered by August the Strong, an 18th-century ruler of the German state of Saxony, as well as of Poland and Lithuania. At least two thieves broke the special security glass of a display case and made off with an unknown number of objects from three sets of royal jewels comprising more than 90 individual pieces — cuff links, buttons and brooches adorned with rubies, sapphires and diamonds — the Dresden police and museum authorities said.  “I don’t have to tell you how shocked we are by the brutality of this break-in,” Marion Ackermann, general director of the consortium of museums known as the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, of which the Green Vault was a part, told reporters hours after the crime was discovered. “As you know, the historical and cultural value of this is immeasurable.” Ms. Ackermann did not assign a monetary value to the objects, but said that an examination of the display case later Monday revealed that fewer pieces were taken than previously feared.  “Many works are still in the display cases,” she told ZDF, a public broadcaster. “The thieves were not able to take everything because each work was individually attached” to the background on which they were displayed.  The objects in the Green Vault are one of the world’s most intact collections of Baroque jewels. The building was heavily damaged during World War II, but was painstakingly rebuilt after German reunification and reopened to the public in 2006. The police said they received a call at 4:59 a.m. from security guards at the museum who witnessed the robbery on a live video feed from the room in the Green Vault that housed the display case. Ms. Ackermann said that it was standard museum procedure for the guards, who are not armed, to alert the police instead of intervening personally. The first officers arrived at the museum within 10 minutes of receiving the call, but by that time, the thieves were already gone, Jörg Kubiesa, chief of Dresden police, said. The officers found a broken security gate and window into the room where the collection had been displayed. The police said they had later moved to shut down the highway around the city and alerted their colleagues in neighboring cities and countries to the hunt for the thieves, although they conceded that it would take no more than four minutes to reach the highway from the museum. At about the same time as the first call to the police, firefighters were called to an electrical fire on the nearby August Bridge, said Claudia Kuba of Drewag, the electricity supplier for Dresden. An electrical distributor for the area around the museum had to be manually shut off because of the fire, she said.  The ensuing power shutdown caused the streetlights around the museum to go out, though the building itself appeared not to have been affected, the police said, adding that officers were investigating whether the fire and power interruption were linked to the break-in. About 15 minutes after the initial alert from the museum, firefighters were called to put out a blaze in a car parked in a street across the Elbe River from the museum, said Volker Lange, chief of the Dresden criminal police. The authorities were investigating whether the car, which was unregistered, had been used by the thieves.  The stolen jewelry is far more valuable as a collection than as individual pieces, Ms. Ackermann said, and she appealed to the thieves not to break them apart or melt them down. Dirk Syndram, director of the Green Vault, said, “Nowhere else in Europe has any other collection of royal jewels been preserved in this form and quality and quantity.”  He said the museum planned to put out detailed information in the course of the day about the exact pieces that were taken, in hopes of helping to relocate them. At least one famed treasure of the palace’s permanent exhibition was not stolen. A flawless, 41-carat gem, the Dresden Green Diamond, is on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the “Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe” exhibition scheduled to start on Monday. The diamond is normally on show in its own case, one story above the ground-level floor where the stolen jewels were displayed, Mr. Syndram said. August the Strong, a prince-elector of Saxony and little-loved monarch of Poland and Lithuania, collected rare, glittering objects like the goldsmith Johann Melchior Dinglinger’s jewel-encrusted figurines “Court of the Grand Moghul of Delhi” and the “Golden Coffee Set.” In 1723, August founded the Green Vault, so named for the pale green color of its domed ceiling. It eventually came to house more than 3,000 medieval, Renaissance and early Baroque works, the biggest surviving princely art collection in Europe. “Not only have the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen been robbed, but also we Saxons!” Michael Kretschmer, the state governor, wrote on Twitter. “The history of Saxony cannot be understood without the Grünes Gewölbe. The treasures found here have been acquired by the people of our state for years.” A sign posted outside the Dresden museum and on its website said that it would be closed on Monday for “organizational reasons.” The authorities later said that they expected the museum would reopen on Wednesday.

American Aid Worker for U.N. Is Killed in Afghan Capital,2019-11-25,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — An American national working for the United Nations in Afghanistan was killed and two others were wounded in a blast targeting a U.N. vehicle in Kabul on Sunday, officials said, underscoring a growing threat to aid workers. The attack led U.N. agencies in Afghanistan to impose lockdowns on Monday, while other major international organizations restricted their movements as a precaution. Officials said the U.N. also canceled flights, even though many smaller aid organizations rely on air travel to get to parts of the country not accessible by roads increasingly plagued by fighting. The latest attack further complicates humanitarian work at a time of dire need in the country and as a harsh winter looms. The U.N. estimates that about one million Afghans are “on the move,” having been either internally displaced by the intensifying conflict or because they are refugees in need of humanitarian assistance. “It is with profound sadness that the U.N. family in Afghanistan confirms the killing tonight of a colleague, as well as injuries to two others, when a U.N.-marked vehicle was attacked in Kabul,” the local U.N. mission said in a statement late on Sunday. Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, said three other civilians were also wounded in the attack. While the U.N. statement provided no details on the aid worker who died, Afghan and Western officials said it was an American citizen who was helping the United Nations Development Program manage the payroll for Afghan security forces.  The officials said the cause of the blast was likely a magnetic bomb that had been attached to the roof of the armored vehicle. Photos from the scene showed the roof having been blown apart. United Nations vehicles in the northern province of Panjshir recently came under gunfire, but no one was hurt in that case, officials said. The attack comes at a peculiar moment in the Afghan capital, as the number of large and high-profile assaults has dropped in recent weeks, with officials crediting a recent prisoner swap with the Taliban for the dip in such violence. But smaller, more targeted attacks, have been on the rise, security officials said.  Over the past month, nearly a dozen high-profile assassinations or attempted assassinations targeting political or military figures have been reported in Kabul, either by magnetic bombs attached to vehicles or assassins riding on the backs of motorcycles. One of the latest targeted killings took the life of Waheed Muzhda, a high-profile pro-Taliban analyst who was slain outside his home by men on motorbikes. The uptick has raised fears of Kabul becoming like other Afghan cities, such as the southern hub of Kandahar, where a reduction in large-scale indiscriminate assaults was only replaced by a sustained campaign of target killings. Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.']",The killing of the United Nations employee underscores the growing threat to aid workers at a time Afghanistan is in dire need of humanitarian assistance.
Suicides by K-Pop Stars Prompt Soul-Searching in South Korea,2019-11-25,By Choe Sang-Hun and Su-Hyun Lee,"['SEOUL, South Korea — When the K-pop star Sulli ended her own life last month, her fellow K-pop singer Goo Hara was heartbroken, bidding a farewell to her best friend in a live-streaming video. With tears running down her cheeks, Ms. Goo expressed hope that Sulli would live “as she pleases” in heaven. “I will live twice more diligently now that you are gone,” she said. “Dear fans, I will be fine. Don’t worry about me.” But on Sunday, six weeks after Sulli’s death, Ms. Goo herself was found dead in her Seoul home in what the police were calling a suicide. The suicides by two of K-pop’s most beloved stars have left fans in South Korea soul-searching over what has gone wrong in K-pop, their country’s most successful cultural export. Lee Yong-pyo, the chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters that Ms. Goo’s body was found by a maid on Sunday evening. Investigators also found a handwritten memo in which Ms. Goo expressed her despair, Mr. Lee said. As grief-stricken fans flocked to the Seoul hospital where her body lay, her family was planning to hold the funeral in private. Once popular mainly just in Asian countries, K-pop girl groups and boy bands, like BTS, now command huge global followings. The genre has captured the imagination of fans around the world with its fusion of synthesized songs, video art, fashionable outfits and synchronized dance routines that mix teasing sexuality with doe-eyed innocence.  But entertainment industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden K-pop industry, which has remained largely hidden behind its glamour. Legions of young South Koreans train for years, often starting in their early teens, honing their singing skills and dance moves in hopes of impressing “star management” agencies who deem them good enough to debut their first song. Even after they make the cut to become K-pop idols, their star status rarely lasts long, as younger stars with cuter looks and fancier dance moves replace them. K-pop stars in their late 20s are already considered old, and these fading idols often try to carve out new roles in acting or as solo singers or talk-show regulars — a difficult transition that is often not successful. The K-pop phenomenon gets disseminated largely through YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and other social media channels, where its stars are exposed to both a flood of fan letters and hateful comments and cyberbullying on everything from their looks to their singing skills to their private lives. “From an early age, they live a mechanical life, going through a spartan training regimen,” said Lee Hark-joon, a South Korean journalist who has produced a TV documentary on the making of a K-pop girl group and co-wrote the book “K-pop Idols: Popular Culture and the Emergence of the Korean Music Industry.” “They seldom have a chance to develop a normal school life or normal social relationships as their peers do.” “Their fall can be as sudden and as dramatic as their rise to the height of fame,” and all at a young age, Mr. Lee added. “Theirs is a profession especially vulnerable to psychological distress — they are scrutinized on social media around the clock, and fake news about their private lives is spread instantly.” In 2017, Sulli, a former member of the South Korean girl group f(x), attended a memorial for another K-pop star, Kim Jong-hyun, 27, who had killed himself after leaving a note that said he was consumed by depression.  Sulli, 25, took her own life  last month after she bitterly complained about misogynistic internet trolls, especially after she joined a feminist campaign that advocated not wearing bras. Ms. Goo, 28, a former member of the wildly popular K-pop girl group Kara, had also struggled with online attacks. Trolls spread rumors that she owed her looks largely to plastic surgery. She admitted that she had gone under the knife for droopy eyes. Things turned worse for her after she broke up with her hair-designer boyfriend, Choi Jong-beom. And rumors spread that there was video footage of the couple engaging in sex. “I won’t be lenient on these vicious commentaries any more,” Ms. Goo wrote on her Instagram account in June, complaining about her “mental health” problems and “depression.” (After her death, such posts on her Instagram account were removed.) At times, she sounded desperate, pleading for her critics to relent. “Is there no one out there with a beautiful mind who can embrace people who suffer?” she pleaded. “Public entertainers like myself don’t have it easy — we have our private lives more scrutinized than anyone else and we suffer the kind of pain we cannot even discuss with our family and friends,” she said. “Can you please ask yourself what kind of person you are before you post a vicious comment online?” The situation with her ex-boyfriend, Mr. Choi, became particularly contentious. She sued him last year, accusing him of threatening to spread the footage of them having sex. In August, he was sentenced to a year and a half in prison on charges of blackmailing, coercion and inflicting bodily harm against Ms. Goo. But his jail term was suspended by the court, keeping him free. Ms. Goo’s suicide has already resulted in soul-searching in South Korea. The number of people who supported an online petition to the office of President Moon Jae-in asking for harsher punishment for sexual harassment has more than doubled to 217,000 since her suicide was reported. In her last Instagram message, Ms. Goo uploaded a photo of her lying on her bed. She wrote “Jalja,” or “sleep tight.”']","Two beloved female stars, Sulli and Goo Hara, ended their own lives in two months, exposing the painful side of being a K-pop idol."
"Pope Francis, in Japan, Warns of ‘Selfish Decisions’ on Nuclear Energy",2019-11-25,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — In the first visit to Japan by a pontiff in 38 years, Pope Francis on Monday edged close to calling for the renunciation of all nuclear power in a country that experienced the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl but has yet to determine a viable alternative for its energy needs.  A day after traveling to Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the only places where atomic bombs have ever been used in war, the pope met in Tokyo on Monday with victims of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown that ravaged northeastern Japan. Francis noted that the Catholic bishops of Japan had called for the shutdown of all nuclear plants in Japan after the 2011 disaster, in which waves from the tsunami overpowered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and set off catastrophic meltdowns in three reactors.  “As we think about the future of our common home, we need to realize that we cannot make purely selfish decisions,” the pope said on Monday, “and that we have a great responsibility to future generations.” Although Japan has a tiny and shrinking Catholic population, the pope drew thousands of people to his appearances in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where he called for an end to the nuclear arms race. In denouncing any use of atomic weapons as “a crime not only against the dignity of human beings but against any possible future for our common home,” he appeared to go further than his predecessors, who called for an end to stockpiling nuclear arms. “The arms race wastes precious resources that could be better used to benefit the integral development of peoples and to protect the natural environment,” the pope said in an address in Peace Park in Nagasaki, which commemorates the 74,000 people who died in the atomic bombing on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, which killed 140,000 people.  “In a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money that is squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, upgrading, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons are an affront crying out to heaven,” he added. Nagasaki, a port city that first had contact with European explorers in the 1500s, is the center of Catholic life in Japan, although the observant population in the country has fallen to just over 450,000, a tiny minority in a nation of 126 million people. The vast majority of religious Japanese are either Buddhist or Shinto, with many practicing elements of both. Catholics have a history of being ostracized for their faith in Japan, and 26 Christians who were executed in the late 16th century under orders from the warlord Hideyoshi Toyotomi are commemorated in a monument in Nagasaki.  When American pilots dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, it destroyed Urakami Cathedral, then the largest cathedral in East Asia, and killed about 8,000 Catholics in the area.  The last pope to visit Japan, John Paul II in 1981, also visited Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where he warned of the dangers of nuclear power and said the suffering from the atomic bombings persisted. On Monday, Francis also addressed the deterioration of international ties at a time when populist governments and leaders have taken to looking inward.  “We are witnessing an erosion of multilateralism, which is all the more serious in light of the growth of new forms of military technology,” he said in Nagasaki. “Such an approach seems highly incongruous in today’s context of interconnectedness; it represents a situation that urgently calls for the attention and commitment of all leaders.” In Tokyo on Monday, the pope met with the newly enthroned emperor, Naruhito, and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Before an audience of about 50,000 people, he said Mass at the Tokyo Dome, home of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team. He described what he called the disconnectedness of a group of young people he had met at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Tokyo.  “They remain on the margins, unable to grasp the meaning of life and their own existence,” he said. “Increasingly, the home, school and community, which are meant to be places where we support and help one another, are being eroded by excessive competition in the pursuit of profit and efficiency. Many people feel confused and anxious; they are overwhelmed by so many demands and worries that take away their peace and stability.” For the pope, the trip to Japan, which followed a three-day visit to Thailand, was in some ways the fulfillment of a long-ago ambition. “I don’t know if you are aware of this, but ever since I was young, I have felt a fondness and affection for these lands,” Francis said on Saturday when he addressed a conference of bishops. As a young Jesuit in Argentina, he had hoped to be sent on a mission to Japan, but a bout of life-threatening pneumonia thwarted the trip.

British Man and Filipino Woman Rescued From Kidnappers in Philippines,2019-11-25,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — Philippine special forces on Monday rescued a 70-year-old British national and a Filipino woman nearly two months after they were kidnapped by gunmen in the southern Philippines, the military said. The soldiers rescued Allan Arthur Hyrons and Welma Paglinawan-Hyrons, a married couple, after they were abandoned by their captors early Monday after days of clashes on the southwestern Philippine island of Jolo. “This morning there was a 10-minute gun battle and the two were left behind by their captors,” said Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the regional military commander. “They scampered away to different directions but we are pursuing them,” the general said of the kidnappers. General Sobejana identified the captors as members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf group, which has been blamed for a rash of high-profile kidnappings of foreigners in the past. The faction of the group responsible for the kidnapping is closely allied with the Islamic State, and their members have been accused of carrying out a number of suicide bombings in Jolo. Troops had been pursuing the militants for weeks and on Sunday a pitched battle between the soldiers and insurgents on the island left at least five militants dead. “This will have a big impact on our efforts against the Abu Sayyaf,” General Sobejana said. “This is a big blow to their morale.” It was not clear who initially seized the couple. The kidnapping was apparently planned by local gunmen who took the couple from a beach resort in October and ferried them by boat in the direction of Jolo, a far-flung island that is a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf. Jolo is the site of a suicide bombing at a Catholic Church that left 23 dead in January. That attack was believed to have been carried out by an Abu Sayyaf faction led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who is believed to be the new leader of the local Islamic State affiliate. Mr. Sawadjaan took over from Isnilon Hapilon, who was killed two years ago by troops after he led Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern militants in sacking the southern city of Marawi. Five months of gun battles there left more than a thousand militants, soldiers and civilians dead. General Sobejana said he expected Abu Sayyaf militants to retaliate by going after what he called “soft targets.” He advised civilians to help the local authorities by reporting people engaged in suspicious activity. He said the abducted couple appeared to be faring well despite their ordeal. “The two appeared O.K. and would be subject to hospital checks,” he said. ']",The husband and wife were rescued by soldiers after insurgents came under attack and abandoned the couple.
"Across Northern England, Labour’s ‘Red Wall’ Is Showing Cracks",2019-11-25,By Mark Landler,"['KIRKBY-IN-ASHFIELD, England — The red brick houses that march up a gentle rise in this worse-for-wear town have long stood as part of the “red wall” in British politics, the gritty stronghold of coal and factory towns in the Midlands and north of England that voted as reliably for the Labour Party as blue-collar precincts in the American Midwest once voted for the Democrats. So when Natalie Fleet, the Labour candidate for Parliament, knocked on the first of those doors last week, and was told by the woman who answered, Donna Savage, that she was thinking of voting for the Conservatives in next month’s election, it was a jolting sign of how much British politics has changed. “I want to get Brexit done,” Ms. Savage, a 43-year-old teacher and lifelong Labour voter, told Ms. Fleet, echoing a phrase frequently used by the Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson. Plus, Ms. Savage added, “I don’t want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister,” referring to the leftist Labour leader, who is deeply unpopular in this part of the country. Mr. Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union swiftly, and he hopes to use that message to attract and convert fed-up Labour voters. His Conservative Party has targeted Ashfield as one of the districts it has the greatest chance of turning Tory in the election on Dec. 12.  If Mr. Johnson succeeds, it would not only give him the Parliamentary majority he needs to finally deliver Brexit, it would also amount to a breathtaking realignment of British politics. “These Midlands seats are the equivalent of the swing states in the U.S.,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London. “Where they go, the election goes.” In Ashfield, the Labour incumbent, Gloria De Piero, hung on to her seat by just 441 votes in the last election in 2017 and opted not to run again — a decision that looks like a case of reading the writing on the wall. Mr. Johnson has already visited twice, attesting to the district’s status as a prime battleground. Working-class voters in Ashfield have reviled the Tories ever since the free-market revolution of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, which they blame for hastening the demise of the coal industry.  But Brexit has replaced Thatcher as the defining issue, and Mr. Johnson’s promise appeals to people in this district, who voted by more than 70 percent to leave the European Union in 2016 — one of the biggest endorsements of Brexit in Britain — and have seethed over the last three and a half years as the political class has failed to carry out their wishes. That frustration, combined with a fraying social fabric and long-term corrosion in economic opportunity, has created a volatile atmosphere in Ashfield: anti-immigrant, distrustful of the political elite and receptive to populist appeals from the right that would have been jeered a few years ago. “What I voted for is to leave the E.U., make a clean break and then negotiate a new deal with them from a position of strength,” said Glyn Street, 57, who drives a street sweeper. “We’ve got to get out of Europe, because otherwise our kids will be under a dictatorship.” Mr. Street is backing the Brexit Party’s candidate, Martin Daubney, a former journalist who was elected to the European Parliament in May and whose last job was editing a men’s magazine, “Loaded.” He is campaigning on a platform that Mr. Johnson’s pro-Brexit credentials are suspect and that his own party is the “last chance to save Brexit.”  To complicate matters further, there is also an ambitious district councilman, Jason Zadrozny, who is running as an independent with a pox-on-both-their-houses message about the major parties. In this bumper-car pileup of a race, rife with personal feuds and animosities, Ms. Fleet could well finish third. “It’s like the country is turning upside down,” said Lee Anderson, 52, a Labour Party exile and onetime coal miner who is the Conservative Party’s candidate in Ashfield. “As bizarre as it seems, Boris and Donald Trump connect with working-class voters. People like plain English.” Mr. Anderson has gone further than blunt language. Last week, he posted a video on Facebook in which he proposed to evict supposedly unruly residents from a local public-housing project and put them in tents, where they would be forced to pick potatoes and other vegetables from dawn till dusk. Anticipating blowback, he stipulated that it was “my own personal opinion — nobody else’s.” Opponents accused him of sowing divisions and being hardhearted. But Steven Larvin, a 61-year-old greengrocer with a stall in the nearby town of Sutton, confessed sheepishly that the proposal appealed to him. Mr. Johnson has been more cautious: On Sunday, he presented the Conservative Party’s agenda, promising Brexit, of course, and that the government would recruit 50,000 additional nurses. But otherwise it avoided the radical measures that characterized Labour’s manifesto or that of his predecessor, Theresa May, who hurt her chances in 2017 when her tough health care proposals backfired. The Conservatives, Mr. Anderson argues, better embody the traditional values that people in Ashfield want to preserve than does Labour. Without the coal mines and factories, he said, the Labour Party no longer has a “captive audience of useful idiots” for its outmoded policies. Mr. Anderson was himself a member of that audience. A longtime Labour activist who once ran Ms. De Piero’s district office, he defected from the party after falling out with colleagues over his vote for Brexit. Still, Mr. Anderson does not have a good answer for how Mr. Johnson will reconcile the free-market, entrepreneurial policies that drive his Brexit campaign — one built on a vision of turning Britain into Singapore-on-Thames — with the yearning in the Midlands for a strong state and a return to the kind of traditional industrial economy that powered the country in the 1960s. For all his workingman credibility, running as a Conservative can still be a bruising experience. Last week, as he knocked on doors in the hillside village of Jacksdale, a passing motorist rolled down his window and yelled, “Tory scum!” “There are still some people who won’t forget — can’t forget — that the Conservatives shut the pits,” said Jon Ball, the head of content at the local newspaper, The Mansfield and Ashfield Chad. “But there are many other people who have moved on.”  The betting markets have Mr. Anderson running neck-and-neck with the independent candidate, Mr. Zadrozny. A onetime Liberal Democrat who voted in favor of Brexit, his political career almost ended after he was arrested in 2015 on charges of child sex abuse. The charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. Now, Mr. Zadrozny presents himself as a pragmatic public servant who will get things done without being tied to the orthodoxy of either major party.  At a time when politicians are in disrepute, he argues that this formula will resonate. “People were crying out for something different, and I guess we’re a conduit for that,” Mr. Zadrozny said. “I’m offering the one thing they really want from Conservatives, which is Brexit, but without the rabid, right-wing Tory bit.” As he shook hands in the market square, however, Mr. Zadrozny discovered the limits of being an anti-politician. Theresa Woodland, 60, a retired hairdresser, told him that however much she appreciated his work for the district, she was going to vote for the Labour Party. “If I vote for you, I think Boris will get in,” she told him. “If Labour gets in, I think Ashfield will benefit.” That is the kind of loyalty Ms. Fleet is counting on to avoiding being swallowed up by the political earthquake rolling across Britain. A onetime single mother who had a child at 16, Ms. Fleet promotes her credentials as a product of Ashfield, in all of its hardship and heartbreak. She speaks movingly about her sick grandmother, languishing in a hospital without proper care. But Ms. Fleet acknowledges that Brexit is the overriding issue, and Labour’s policy on it strikes many as hopelessly muddled: The party says it would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union and then put that to a second referendum — a multi-step process that leaves people in Ashfield pulling out their hair. “I want to get it done — get it sorted — so we can go back to discussing bread-and-butter issues that people really care about,” said Ms. Fleet, who works as a union official and canvassed for Hillary Clinton in Ohio in 2016. For Ms. Fleet, however, the biggest threats in this campaign are personal. Last week, the windows of her campaign office were smashed by an unknown assailant wielding a hammer. She has been vilified on social media by pro- and anti-Brexit extremists, much as Ms. De Piero was during her last three years in Parliament. That vitriol, Ms. De Piero said, contributed to her decision not to run again. Ms. De Piero, a former television journalist, often accompanies Ms. Fleet on her door-knocking rounds. She takes comfort that she rarely encounters the same rage face-to-face that she gets on Facebook and Twitter. But with passions running high and the sun setting at 4 p.m. in the weeks leading up to this rare pre-Christmas election, there is safety in numbers when approaching a darkened doorway. “You’ve just been called a traitor, and you think about that every time before you go door-knocking,” Ms. De Piero said. “If they talk this way to me on social media, why wouldn’t they talk this way at their door?” Anna Schaverien contributed reporting from London.']","As in America, Britain’s rust belt regions are turning to the right, possibly heralding a realignment in next month’s general election."
"Luis Lacalle Pou Leads in Tight Uruguay Election, but Ballot Counting Continues",2019-11-25,By Daniel Politi and Ernesto Londoño,"['BUENOS AIRES — Former Senator Luis Lacalle Pou appeared to have carved out a narrow victory in Uruguay’s presidential election on Sunday, the latest sign that unrest simmering across Latin America favors anti-incumbent candidates. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a center-right veteran lawmaker, had more than 48.8 percent of the vote, with more than 97 percent of precincts counted, preliminary results showed. That put him slightly more than  1 percentage point ahead of  his rival, Daniel Martínez.  But late Sunday, election officials still had not called the race because the number of provisional ballots exceeded the margin between the two candidates. Pollsters said exit polls and the preliminary results appeared to give Mr. Lacalle Pou a clear edge.  Mr. Lacalle Pou stopped short of claiming victory when he addressed supporters shortly past midnight, but said his lead was “irreversible.” Noting how tight the election turned out to be, Mr. Lacalle Pou struck a conciliatory note. “This reaffirms that this must unite as a society,” he said. “We must unite as Uruguayans.” If the results are confirmed, Mr. Lacalle Pou’s victory  would be the latest setback for leftist politicians in Latin America. They have long regarded prosperous and politically stable Uruguay as an exemplar for its robust social safety net and its comparatively low inequality. Mr. Martínez celebrated his party’s performance, noting it had exceeded expectations. He did not concede the race, noting that provisional ballots could conceivably alter the outcome. “Uruguayans are smart people,” he told supporters late Sunday night. “They decide with their head and their heart.” In the campaign’s final days, polls had indicated that Mr. Lacalle Pou, 46, of the National Party would easily beat Mr. Martínez, 62, of the Broad Front coalition. But Mr. Martínez, a former mayor of Montevideo, the capital, appears to have enjoyed a surge in support during the final stretch. The Broad Front is a coalition of center-left and leftist parties that has held the presidency since 2005. Mr. Martínez was the front-runner in the first round of voting on Oct. 27, winning 39 percent of the vote. But Mr. Lacalle Pou gained momentum after that with backing from the main candidates who did not qualify for the runoff. Polls show that voters have lost faith in the governing coalition amid a rise in crime and a slowdown in economic growth. Still, Broad Front governments have largely avoided the corruption scandals and economic slumps that have bedeviled other leftists in the region. On their watch, Uruguay’s economy has grown steadily, inequality has shrunk and the nation of 3.4 million people has made international headlines by championing some liberal social initiatives that were largely popular at home. Uruguay’s Congress legalized abortion in 2012, and the following year it passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. In 2017, Uruguay became the first country to fully legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use, creating a model for taxing and regulating the sale of drugs that drew wide international interest. But the Broad Front struggled to persuade voters that continuity was the right course, said Gerardo Caetano, a professor of history and political science at the University of the Republic in Montevideo. “Uruguay is part of this pattern of angry, unhappy societies that have seen an increase in purchasing power, and due to that increase they began demanding more,” he said. “People are angry and have turned against the government.” Public safety also weighed heavily on voters, experts said. Last year, killings and violent robberies increased substantially, a dynamic that gave Mr. Lacalle Pou a useful line of attack against the Broad Front. “The biggest challenge has been public security,” said Jennifer Pribble, an associate professor of political science at the University of Richmond who studies Uruguayan politics. “The Broad Front was slow to respond to citizen concerns, while the opposition used that quite masterfully.” Sluggish growth also worked against Mr. Martínez. Uruguay’s gross domestic product is expected to increase by 0.4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. “Although the economic situation is not a crisis, there are indicators that are concerning, including slow growth, inflation and unemployment,” said Mariana Pomiés, executive director of Cifra, a local pollster. “This change leads the population to consider an alternative that can fix a few things.” Experts and voters say Mr. Martínez was further stymied by fractures in the Broad Front and that he struggled to excite voters. “Martínez does not have the profile to be president,” said Mercedes Peirano, 61, who said she had voted for him, albeit unenthusiastically. “He’s a good person but lacks charisma and stumbles when he talks.” Mr. Lacalle Pou — the son of former President Luis Alberto Lacalle, who governed from 1990 to 1995 — has spent the years since his failed presidential bid in 2014 cobbling together an alliance of opposition factions. He promised to rein in debt, accusing the Broad Front government of fiscal irresponsibility, argued that the government can do more to help small businesses succeed and vowed to improve security with sweeping reforms of the police. “Lacalle Pou began to think about the 2019 campaign the day after he lost in 2014,” said Fernanda Boidi, a political consultant in Montevideo and regional coordinator of Vanderbilt University’s Latin American Public Opinion Project. “Lacalle Pou has been preparing very assiduously for this opportunity and carried out a very solid, very unified campaign.” The cluster of parties that unified behind Mr. Lacalle Pou’s candidacy includes politicians from a broad ideological spectrum. Experts said that may prove challenging as the new president seeks to push changes through Congress, including an overhaul of the pension system. Among his supporters is a new far-right party, Cabildo Abierto, led by a former military leader, a jarring development for Uruguayans who have bleak memories of despotic military rule in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a lawyer by training, served in the lower house of Congress from 2000 to 2015 and served in the Senate until resigning his seat in August to focus on the political race.  Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and Ernesto Londoño from Rio de Janeiro.']","The ruling leftist party appears to be on its way out after nearly 15 years, as slow economic growth drags down incumbents.

Egypt Escalates Pressure on Last Major Independent News Site,2019-11-24,By Nada Rashwan,"['CAIRO — Egyptian security forces on Sunday escalated their pressure on the last major independent news outlet in the country, raiding its offices and temporarily detaining three top editors. Another editor of the publication, Mada Masr, had been arrested on Saturday. Mada Masr, which publishes online in both Arabic and English, has won international accolades for its pioneering investigative reporting despite a six-year crackdown on press freedom under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Egypt has become one of the world’s most aggressive jailers of reporters, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and security forces have arrested eight other journalists since a flurry of antigovernment street protests in September.  Almost all of the state and privately owned media now speak with a single pro-government voice. Most of the privately owned Egyptian news media has been quietly taken over by intelligence agencies or allies of Mr. Sisi’s. Mada Masr, however, has defied the government pressure and continued to publish groundbreaking investigations, including a report last week that the president’s son, Mahmoud el-Sisi, was being removed from his senior role in the intelligence agencies because of his poor performance. [Read: Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian leader ousted in Arab Spring, dies at 91.] The Egyptian authorities have blocked access to the Mada Masr in Egypt for the last two years. But the publication has remained an indispensable source of information for Egyptian activists and intellectuals, who can often reach it via a VPN service, as well as for Western analysts and policymakers. Its Arabic name is a play on words that literally means the scope of Egypt but could also refer to a stone-setting, as though Egypt were a jewel. The tightening of government pressure on Mada Masr escalated Saturday with the arrest of a senior editor, Shady Zalat, 37, in a dawn raid on his home. After being held at an undisclosed location overnight, Mr. Zalat was released on Sunday evening by the side of a highway, Mada Masr said in a statement. In the hours before his release, as many as nine armed plainclothes security officers raided the Mada Masr offices. The officers detained the organization’s staff, confiscated their telephones, and interrogated them for three hours. The officers also asked some of the journalists to unlock their smartphones and laptops and searched their devices. The editor in chief, Lina Attalah, along with the journalists Mohamed Hamama and Rana Mamdouh, were then briefly detained at a nearby police station. Ms. Attalah, 36, founded Mada Masr in 2013, shortly before the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power. In addition, two foreign nationals working in Cairo for Mada Masr — Ian Louie, an American, and Emma Scolding, a British citizen — were forced to present their passports for inspection but ultimately released. Another American editor, Daniel O’Connell, 28, was recently stopped at Cairo’s international airport, deported and barred from re-entering the country. Muhammad Nagui, a researcher at the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression in Cairo, said that raiding the office of an internationally well known publication was a line the government had rarely crossed. But certain topics, like reporting on the president’s family, “are a red line for journalists,” he said. “This is a message to any independent voice,” he added. “If you cross the line we draw for you, we will crush you.” David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London.']","Security forces raided the publication’s office, detaining three editors, the day after arresting another editor."
"100 Protest Leaders Arrested, Iran Says, as U.S. Penalizes a Top Official",2019-11-23,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran’s judiciary said Friday that about 100 people accused of having led violent antigovernment protests over fuel price increases had been arrested nationwide, and a top cleric said they deserved the “maximum penalty.” The declaration by the cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, leader of Friday Prayers, suggested the authorities intended to make examples of the suspects to help crush any remnants of the deadly protests, which upended life in dozens of Iranian cities and towns.  While Mr. Khatami did not specify if he meant that the suspects should receive the death penalty, the Kayhan newspaper, mouthpiece of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said they should be hanged. “This is not a system that will be shaken by these stupid evils,” Mr. Khatami said, according to a translation by Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency. In scrambling to respond to the protests, Iranian officials disconnected almost the entire country from the internet, effectively censoring the true extent of casualties and destruction. The shutdown also blocked Iranians from using social media messaging apps, crippling a popular way to share information.  The Trump administration, which welcomed the protests, said Friday that it had penalized Iran’s minister of information and telecommunications technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, for what it called his responsibility for the internet shutdown. “While Iranian regime leaders maintain access to the internet and social media accounts for themselves and their cronies, they deprive their people of these basic tools of expression and communication,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. The United States, he said, “stands with the people of Iran in their struggle against an oppressive regime that silences them while arresting and murdering protesters.”  The sanction means the United States could impound any assets in its jurisdiction that Mr. Azari Jahromi owns.  Mr. Azari Jahromi, a frequent Twitter user, reacted as though the sanction were a badge of honor. “I’m not the only member of club of sanctioned persons (Based on Trump’s fairytales),” he wrote in a post.   Mr. Azari Jahromi has said in the past week that the Supreme National Security Council had ordered him to shut down the internet and that he could fully restore it only when the council allowed. As of Friday, internet access had been restored to less than 20 percent of its normal level, according to NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet usage and cybersecurity. The limited access was for government agencies, universities, security forces and some commercial businesses, but ordinary Iranians still appeared to be disconnected. Amnesty International said the death toll had climbed to at least 115, but a confirmed tally was impossible to ascertain given limited access to the country. Iranian officials have denounced Amnesty’s figure as speculative but have not specified how many people were killed or injured. An anecdotal picture of widespread destruction and harsh crackdown has emerged from videos and postings that Iranians managed to share despite the internet restriction. Official accounts have also shown remnants of ransacked stores and burned banks but have said the mayhem was contained within a few days, and have denounced what they called American-backed attempts to stoke more unrest. “Based on information we have received, the Americans have gone mad that the riots were over within 48 hours and are disappointed that there is no more disorder in Iran,” Brig. Gen. Ali Fadavi, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps., said on Friday in remarks quoted by Iranian media.  But General Fadavi said protests and riots had raged in more than 100 cities across Iran. He also said the unrest had amounted to “a war” and drew a comparison to a notoriously bloody battle during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, known as Operation Karbala 4, that left 12,000 Iranian troops dead in three days.  The reference to Karbala 4 appeared to be among the first public acknowledgments by an Iranian official that hinted at the scope of damage and casualties.

"On Day to End Violence Against Women, Spain’s Far Right Champions Men",2019-11-25,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Monday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and Vox, Spain’s surging far-right party, appears to have had a plan. First members of the party, which in a breakthrough election two weeks ago won 52 seats in Parliament, managed to block approval by the Madrid city government of a resolution commemorating the day, which the United Nations established two decades ago. Then on Monday at City Hall, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary general of Vox, took the opportunity to reaffirm his party’s demand that Spain repeal a 15-year-old law aimed at stopping violence against women. Women at the gathering, already angry at Vox’s refusal to observe the Elimination of Violence Against Women Day, were outraged.  “This is shameful!” several shouted, booing as they left City Hall, which has been governed by a right-wing coalition since May. In lieu of pointing a spotlight at violence against women, Mr. Ortega Smith used his speech to talk about men who have been killed by women, as well as women who have suffered “violence from their lesbian partners.” When he returned to his front-row seat, he was confronted by Nadia Otmani, the president of a women’s association called Al Amal. Ms. Otmani was shot and left paralyzed two decades ago when she tried to protect her sister from her abusive husband. “I have been in a wheelchair for 20 years,” she told Mr. Ortega Smith. “Respect for the dead and respect for the women who are victims of violence across the whole of this country. Respect, please.” Mr. Ortega Smith looked away as Ms. Otmani shouted at him, surrounded by journalists. Ms. Otmani is from Morocco, and has long lived in Spain;  her association helps other Moroccan women settle in the country. Vox has been pushing to clamp down on Islamic migration and reassert Roman Catholic values in Spain. In winning the 52 parliamentary seats in the Nov. 10 national election, Vox became Spain’s third-largest political party. The election, the country’s fourth in four years, underlined the fragmentation and polarization of Spanish politics, with the ultranationalist Vox making the clearest gains. With no party close to a parliamentary majority, Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, is negotiating the formation of a new government in a coalition with another left-wing party, Unidas Podemos. Parliament must still approve what would be a minority government. The gender violence law that Vox wants repealed was passed in 2004 under a new Socialist government led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. At the time, the law was considered groundbreaking, and was part of a broader overhaul of the country’s social legislation. The following year, Spain became one of the first Western countries to legalize same-sex marriage. The law took several steps to help protect women. It set up special courts to handle their cases. It made it easier for women to report violence, notably by using a specific toll-free number. And it toughened sentences for offenders and made it harder for them to later come into contact with their victims. Violence against women in Spain, however, remains a serious problem. Over a thousand women have been reported killed since statistics were first officially gathered in 2003. Last year, women reported almost 167,000 cases of domestic violence, while the courts issued more than 39,000 restraining orders. On Monday, a man was alleged to have killed his partner on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which is part of the Canary archipelago, raising the total number of women killed in Spain this year to 52. According to Spanish news reports, the woman was killed after her partner grabbed a knife from her grandmother, who had tried to intervene after she heard her granddaughter shouting for help. Since the gender violence law came into force, it has been challenged about 200 times in court as unconstitutional. Vox has been unsparing in its criticism, describing the law as “the pact of shame,” and arguing that it violates the right to equality inscribed in the Spanish Constitution.  “I thought all Spaniards were equal before the law, but it turns out that women have privileges, which seems to me unfair for the man,” Rocío Monasterio, one of the most prominent women in Vox, said on a television program. Ms. Monasterio said the law made it too hard for men to defend themselves against unfounded accusations of domestic violence. “To have a law that does not respect the presumption of innocence seems to me to be worthy of a third-world country,” she said.  Last week, ahead of Monday’s commemoration, the women of Vox issued their own manifesto, saying that they oppose all violence, with no regard for gender. The manifesto also called on Spain to turn its focus toward abuses against women in countries that “do not belong to Western civilization.”']",
Truck Driver Pleads Guilty to 2 Charges in Essex Deaths,2019-11-25,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The driver of the tractor-trailer in which the bodies of 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in southeastern England last month pleaded guilty on Monday in a London court to charges related to the case. The driver, Maurice Robinson — a 25-year-old from Northern Ireland who is one of three people to have been charged in the case — pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property, the Essex Police said in a statement.  He also faces one count of manslaughter for each of the 39 victims, and one count each of transferring criminal property and conspiracy to traffic people. The case sent shock waves internationally when the bodies were discovered on Oct. 23 in a refrigerated truck in an industrial park in Grays, an Essex town 25 miles east of London. This month, the police identified all of the 39 dead as Vietnamese citizens, the youngest of whom was 15. Mr. Robinson’s case will resume in court on Dec. 13.  Christopher Kennedy, a 23-year-old from Northern Ireland, is also scheduled to appear in court that day in relation to this case. Mr. Kennedy was charged this weekend with counts related to human trafficking, the Essex Police said.  Eamonn Harrison, 22, another truck driver from Northern Ireland, has also been charged. He faces counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses. Mr. Harrison, who is being held in Ireland, appeared in court there last week over a request that he be extradited to Britain. The police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, in the case. The brothers have links to the shipping and cargo hauling industries in Northern Ireland and Ireland, the police said this month.

Merkel and Macron Publicly Clash Over NATO,2019-11-23,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was uncharacteristically furious. At a dinner to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, she huddled with President Emmanuel Macron of France, who had just given an interview in which he cited the “brain death” of NATO and wondered whether its commitment to collective defense still held. Mr. Macron had also been the sole leader to veto the start of lengthy membership talks for North Macedonia to join the European Union, despite Skopje’s having done everything Brussels had asked of it, including changing the country’s name. “I understand your desire for disruptive politics,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I’m tired of picking up the pieces. Over and over, I have to glue together the cups you have broken so that we can then sit down and have a cup of tea together.” Mr. Macron defended himself, saying that he could not simply go to a NATO meeting in London in early December and pretend that the United States and Turkey had behaved in the collective interest in Syria.  “I cannot sit there and act like nothing has happened,” he said. The conversation underscores the serious strains in the Franco-German relationship and the tensions surrounding the abbreviated NATO meeting on the outskirts of London, which was carefully downgraded from a summit to a gathering of leaders to celebrate the alliance’s 70th anniversary. “I haven’t seen Franco-German relations at such a low point in a very long time,” said Claudia Major, a security analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “I’ve rarely seen such bitterness and misunderstanding.” Mr. Macron, as an ambitious French president with nearly royal powers, is increasingly impatient with Ms. Merkel’s slow pragmatism and Germany’s federalism and coalition government, Ms. Major said.  His wish, “in his impatient and almost nervous style,” to lead and disrupt “clashes with the German system, which is very slow with Merkel in her last term and a coalition just trying to survive,” she said. Mr. Macron is eager to put forward longer-term strategic proposals, but is increasingly impatient with a more stagnant Germany and a divided coalition in that country, where the left-leaning Social Democrats block his European military and security proposals and the conservative Christian Democrats block his proposals for more economic integration, higher spending and eurozone reform. Mr. Macron misread Ms. Merkel, thinking that in her last term she would want to create a historical legacy for the European project, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl did by accepting the euro, and the French leader feels almost betrayed by her caution, a senior French official said.  But that is to misunderstand Ms. Merkel, who “does not have big visions and is as pragmatic as you can get, and she is not going to change after 10 years,” Ms. Major said. Then there is NATO, which Germany relies on for deterrence along with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, whose leaders have been sharply critical of Mr. Macron’s musings about the alliance’s weaknesses. Ms. Merkel refused to publicly accept Mr. Macron’s “brain death” criticism, calling his words “drastic.”  While many agree privately with Mr. Macron that President Trump’s unpredictability and moodiness have hurt NATO, made worse by his special dealings with an increasingly authoritarian and Moscow-leaning Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, they believe it was wrong to state those doubts publicly. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called Mr. Macron irresponsible, describing his comments questioning NATO’s commitment to collective defense, known as Article Five, as dangerous. Mr. Morawiecki told his Parliament that any moves to question the guarantee included in the NATO treaty were a threat to the future of the European Union and the military alliance. As François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, put it, Mr. Macron was “talking like a think tanker” instead of as the leader of a key NATO ally and nuclear power. But there are divisions in NATO, he said, and “at least Macron is trying to address the problem at hand.’’ NATO officials are struggling to agree on a joint statement, something less than a formal communiqué, celebrating the anniversary and recommitting NATO members to more military spending.  French officials are pressing for a reference to the need for a new strategic review of NATO’s mission, to replace the last one, which was completed in 2010 and is severely outdated, while most countries prefer to wait to see whether Mr. Trump is re-elected before broaching such a fundamental discussion of NATO’s purpose. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, trying to prevent a clash in London like the one that marred a tempestuous NATO summit meeting in Brussels nearly two years ago, has proposed an “expert group” to strengthen NATO’s political thinking.  The idea would be to put the group under the consensual direction of NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who works hard to maintain good relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Stoltenberg is also traveling to Paris next week to meet Mr. Macron, presumably to discuss the French president’s interview comments calling into question the continuing validity of Article Five.  To question it aloud is to undermine it, something Mr. Trump was criticized heavily for doing early in his presidency, when he initially hesitated to endorse the provision and then mused over whether America would fight for Montenegro, a NATO member. All of that has brought some glee to Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, who praised Mr. Macron’s remarks and his veto of accession talks to the European Union of North Macedonia and Albania, something Moscow has been working for years to forestall.  Moscow has also worked to undermine NATO and keep it from enlarging to the Balkans, Georgia and Ukraine. “In the light of President Macron’s statement,” Mr. Chizhov told The Financial Times, NATO “has a lot to discuss in close format” in London next month. He added: “We all know what President Trump had to say about NATO at different stages of his presidency.” There are also concerns among allies that Mr. Macron is considering a speech about creating a nuclear deterrence based on Europe, so as not to rely on the Americans. That idea will further infuriate Berlin and the Central Europeans, in part because no one believes that France’s nuclear deterrent is capable of covering the Continent, and the British nuclear deterrent is almost entirely dependent on American nuclear missiles. Mr. Macron loves being disruptive and asking questions that others do not ask, at least in public. But if he does that on the question of nuclear deterrence, Ms. Major said, “it will be champagne on ice in Moscow.”']","With relations at a new low, Chancellor Angela Merkel berated President Emmanuel Macron over his comments about the alliance’s ‘‘brain death.” "
"With Boeing in Cross Hairs, Lion Air Gets a Pass on Poor Safety Record",2019-11-24,By Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono,"['When things go wrong, those in power often promise to make it right. But do they? In this series, The Times investigates to see if those promises were kept. JAKARTA, Indonesia — When Lion Air Flight 610 took off in clear skies a year ago, the 737 jetliner carried with it an anti-stall system designed by Boeing that would propel the plane into a nose-dive minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 aboard. But the plane was saddled with another safety burden. Flight 610 was operated by Lion Air, a low-cost Indonesian carrier that has benefited from its political connections to become one of the world’s fastest growing airlines, despite a questionable safety record.  While Boeing has faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes in less than five months, Lion Air has escaped similar attention, despite obvious failings that contributed to the disaster of Flight 610.  An investigation by The New York Times, based on interviews with dozens of officials and airline employees, including pilots and members of maintenance teams, found that Lion Air has a track record of working its pilots to the point of exhaustion, faking pilot training certification and forcing pilots to fly planes they worried were unsafe, including the plane that crashed.  Despite making vague promises of improvements after last year’s accident, the air carrier has neither fully acknowledged nor expeditiously addressed the concerns that have been raised about its safety practices, both by government investigators and whistle-blowers interviewed by The Times.  “The Boeing issue was an absolute godsend for Lion Air,” said John Goglia, a former member of the United States National Transportation Safety Board and an aviation safety expert. “It means Lion Air doesn’t have to deal with what is clearly failure after failure after failure and make the changes needed.” Of the nine factors that caused the crash, according to the final report issued by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee last month, a fatal Boeing design flaw in an automated system was what captured the world’s attention, especially after the crash of another plane in Ethiopia linked to its anti-stall system. Although the report documented lapses on Lion Air’s part, like shoddy maintenance and undertrained pilots, examples of Lion Air’s culpability were underplayed when the report was presented, dismaying critics who note that Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, struggles with endemic corruption.  “You get the sense that the raw data that makes Lion look bad is buried in the report for whatever political reasons,” Mr. Goglia said.  Lion Air has not accepted responsibility for the failures listed in the report, and it dismissed most of the safety issues raised to The Times by current and former employees.  In a response attached to the final report, the airline wrote that it was “aware of efforts that have been made to criticize the Lion Air pilots, engineers and maintenance personnel who operated or worked” on the aircraft. The carrier said “such criticisms are misplaced and should not be considered as contributing factors of the Flight JT610 accident.”  Despite the life-or-death urgency of some of the government report’s safety recommendations, including making improvements to Lion’s hazard-reporting process and its safety training, the company seems to be mulling its next steps, rather than taking immediate, decisive action. “Give me time,” Daniel Putut, Lion Air’s managing director, said in an interview, when asked how quickly the carrier could implement the recommendations. “Let’s say another one or three months because we need to study it to learn if there are things we need to change.” “The report,” he added by way of explaining the delay, “is 323 pages long.” While denying that the deficiencies cited in the report played a part in the crash, Mr. Putut said that Lion Air has “tried to improve” how it identifies safety hazards since the disaster.  “The accident hurt us so we have done a deep study of our operational safety to prevent something from occurring again,” he said. At the same time, however, Mr. Putut defended Lion Air’s business culture, which critics say prioritizes growth over safety.  A former Lion Air chief pilot, Jimmy Kalebos, said that refusing to acknowledge problems was symptomatic of the company’s approach to safety before the crash. That it continues to do so after so many deaths, he added, does not bode well. “How can you fix a problem,” Mr. Kalebos asked, “if you don’t admit it exists?” What We Found In the view of some of the company’s most important employees — its pilots — Lion Air has not taken steps to fix numerous flaws since the crash.  The safety culture at Lion Air has “absolutely not improved,” a pilot said. Like other current and former Lion Air staff members, he agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity to protect his career. Not a single Lion Air employee has been fired as a result of last year’s accident, according to both government investigators and current and former employees. Mr. Putut refused to confirm or deny if anyone had been let go. Just as the company does not seem pressed to adopt changes from the report (which is actually 322 pages long), Indonesian officials were quick to defend a carrier that has had 11 accidents and incidents since its founding in 1999, according to the Aviation Safety Network.  In comparison, Spirit Airlines, the American low-cost carrier founded in 1980, has suffered two in its history, one in 2002, the other in 2005. Neither was fatal. What’s more, many additional serious safety lapses at Lion Air were never investigated by the government because the carrier downplayed them or failed to divulge their likely causes, pilots and maintenance workers at the airline said. In one case in 2016, a Lion Air jet suffered a total loss of engine oil, forcing the pilot to shut down the engine in flight, according to former employees. Yet the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee was never called in to investigate. “What we see in the news is only the visible part of the iceberg,” one pilot said. But members of the Indonesian government seemed sanguine about the airline’s safety. “Lion Air maintenance is good,” said Luhut Pandjaitan, a government minister whose portfolio includes oversight of Indonesia’s transportation network. “Lion pilots have no problem. Lion Air facilities are very good.” He said much of the criticism was fueled by “Western arrogance.”  But Atmadji Sumarkidjo, one of the minister’s own deputies, said there was an unwritten government preference for civil servants to avoid flying Lion Air.  “You can fly Lion Air,” he said, “but you need to pray to God.” What We Found Few airline businesses grew as quickly as Lion Air Group, which oversees several carriers in addition to Lion Air. In 1999, Rusdi Kirana started a low-cost carrier with a few rickety jets. By the time of the crash, Lion Air Group had signed deals for 450 brand-new planes from Boeing and Airbus. On many routes within Indonesia, whose sprawling archipelago makes air travel an everyday necessity, Lion Air was often the only choice, making its peremptory motto oddly appropriate: “We make people fly.” The Indonesian government has hailed Mr. Kirana as a visionary whose company employed 30,000 people. A Christian in a Muslim majority country, Mr. Kirana took on a leadership position in an Islamic political party with ties to the government and was named ambassador to Malaysia. As Lion Air grew, all those new planes needed captains, and the company soon suffered from a dangerous shortage of pilots, according to those who watched the company transform. In 2016, for example, Lion Air had about 3.5 flight crews (a chief pilot and first officer) for each plane in its fleet, according to company insiders, while the industry norm for airlines operating similar kinds of routes with similar planes is at least twice that.  “Do the math,” said Mr. Kalebos, the former Lion Air pilot. “It just doesn’t add up to safety being No. 1.” While that ratio has since improved, according to current and former employees, the conditions for pilots remain onerous. Under Indonesian law, pilots are not allowed to fly more than 110 hours a month. But faked logs of flying hours were rampant at the company, according to former and current pilots. Eki Adriansjah, a former chief pilot at Lion who also served as a flight instructor, said he once worked far more hours in a month than the 110-hour limit and was chided by authorities. “I told them, ‘Why are you catching me and not the company?’” he said. “Lion was the one pushing me to work like that.” Airline representatives denied its pilots were overworked. The carrier also hired pilots with contracts that tied them to the carrier for up to 20 years unless they paid a hefty release fee.  “We are all tired,” said a current Lion Air pilot bound by such a restrictive contract. “I want to stop but I can’t.” On Nov. 18, a co-pilot for Wings Air, another airline within the Lion Air Group, committed suicide after receiving a termination letter from the carrier telling him he owed $500,000 in penalties for the training he had received. In a statement after his death, Wings Air said it had taken employment actions against an “undisciplined” employee. Some Lion Air pilots say the workload has improved since last year’s crash, with a computerized system, strengthened after the catastrophe, making it harder to cheat on flying hours. “This was a problem at Lion, but now not so much,” said Koko Indra Perdana, a Lion Air chief pilot and secretary general of the Indonesian Pilots Professional Association. Others are skeptical. “I talk to my friends, and they say it’s the same now, they’re just more careful about hiding it,” Mr. Kalebos said.  What We Found Current and former pilots at Lion Air recounted dozens of instances, both before and after the crash, in which they felt pressured to fly, despite concerns about the weather, the plane’s airworthiness or even their own alertness. In two cases, pilots said they were ordered to fly to airports near where forest fires were raging and smoke obscured visibility.  “The manager told me, ‘Oh, you don’t need to see the runway because we have instruments that can see for you,’” said Mr. Eki, the former Lion pilot.  In another case, a Lion Air maintenance crew signed off on a plane as good to go. But the pilot wasn’t confident the plane was fit to fly, and he refused to take off. Frustrated, a member of the maintenance team contacted a top executive at Lion Air. The pilot soon took to the skies. Lion Air also had trouble giving its pilots the training necessary to pass a safety audit by the International Air Transport Association, which helps formulate global aviation standards.  Allowing the pilots time for training was hard because the understaffed airline needed them in the air, not in classrooms.  When it became clear that Lion Air would not be able to meet its training targets, a new solution was found, multiple people with the airline at the time said: faking documentation that training had been conducted.  “Fake certificates and a fake attendance list,” said one pilot who was party to the deception. “Now, magically, the S.M.S. training is compliant on paper,” the pilot added, referring to safety management system training. Lion received its I.A.T.A. safety certification in 2016. Mr. Putut, the carrier’s managing director, said he was not aware of any falsified paperwork. “I’ve never heard about it, these fake certificates,” he said. “I need to check on that.” What We Found The Indonesian report on the crash notes how the plane experienced problems with speed and altitude readings for several days before the Oct. 29 crash. On the morning of Oct. 28, a different flight crew aboard the doomed plane was told to fly it to the island of Bali because an engineer said a fix would be more easily found there. Friends of the pilot said he was uncomfortable with the decision, given that on the previous leg, the plane had given him highly irregular data readings. But he flew there anyway on the plane that would crash the next day. The pilot did not respond to queries for comment. “In any other country, making a pilot fly an unsafe plane like that is illegal,” said Mr. Goglia, the former National Transportation Safety Board member. “I don’t have words to describe how bad it is.” At the Bali airport, a vane, known as an angle of attack sensor, was replaced.  Crash investigators were presented with photographs supposedly showing that a mandatory test was done after the vane had been replaced. But upon further inspection, investigators concluded the photos were from a different aircraft. “This is a test that Lion Air was required to do, and they didn’t,” said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant. If the test had been done, engineers likely would have realized the vane was calibrated incorrectly by 21 degrees. The misalignment would prove fatal because it mistakenly catalyzed Boeing’s anti-stall system, forcing the plane into its final plummet. No government action has been taken related to the doctored photographs. Questionable decisions continued after the plane took off from Bali on its next-to-last flight. While in the air, the faulty sensor and the automated anti-stall system kept compelling the plane’s nose down. But once on the ground in Jakarta late on Oct. 28, the flight crew failed to document the full extent of the problems in the plane’s log, 31 pages of which were missing when it was presented to investigators, a breach for which Lion Air was never chided. As the plane took off on its final flight, the crew of Flight 610 had no idea of all the troubles faced by the pilots a few hours earlier. “That plane was unairworthy for days,” Mr. Goglia said. “It continued to be unairworthy because Lion Air didn’t take proper corrective action. It was an accident waiting to happen, and it happened.” What We Found In Indonesia, there are close ties between airlines and regulators, which industry experts believe have muted criticism and influenced investigations. Last year, Nurcahyo Utomo, a lead investigator for the National Transportation Safety Committee, repeatedly said at a news conference that the crashed plane was “unairworthy” on its second-to-last flight. Lion complained. The next morning, the government agency released a statement saying that Mr. Nurcahyo had “NEVER said” what he had, in fact, said. Government employees in the aviation sector need to fly to keep their pilot licenses. To do so, they fly for and get paid by airlines like Lion Air. This money can outstrip their government paychecks. The flow of staff from airline to government — and back again — occurs in management ranks, too. The lead investigator of Lion Air’s first fatal accident, in which 25 people died in 2004 after a pilot overshot the runway, was Ertata Lananggalih. Four years after releasing a report that critics said underplayed Lion Air’s culpability in the crash, he joined the company, working his way up to managing director. He left Lion Air in 2012 and returned to government work as a senior air safety investigator. “Indonesia is a corrupt country, but the corruption at Lion is the biggest of all,” said Wicaksono Budiarto, a former pilot for the airline who joined 17 others, including Mr. Eki and Mr. Kalebos, in a lawsuit against the company for dismissing them after they refused to fly in what they considered unsafe flying conditions. The pilots won significant damages, but Lion Air has refused to pay. “Nothing’s going to change,” Mr. Wicaksono said. “Lion has too much power.” The Takeaway: After a crash, a company — and a government — deny problems, deflect blame and drag their feet on improvements. ']","A focus on Boeing after two fatal crashes has given cover to an Indonesian air carrier with global ambitions — a company that will neither fully admit to, nor swiftly address, its safety issues."
How an Unknown Female Senator Came to Replace the Bolivian President Evo Morales,2019-11-24,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Cesar Del Castillo,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — A day after the downfall of Bolivia’s longest-serving president, Evo Morales, the country was in chaos: Soldiers and protesters were out in the streets, looters terrorized the suburbs and no one was in charge. Catholic church leaders called an urgent meeting of the country’s main political forces on that Monday, Nov. 11, to decide who should take the reins. The line of succession leading out of the power vacuum traced to Jeanine Añez, a senator from a remote tropical region who had sat out October’s elections and was about to retire. “Who was Jeanine? No one knew,” said Jorge Quiroga, a former president of Bolivia and a conservative statesman who helped organize its political transition this month. “But we knew that she was the only constitutional thread that we had.” In two days, Ms. Añez rose from political obscurity to supplant Mr. Morales, the country’s first Indigenous leader and a leftist who led with a single-minded pursuit of his vision for 14 years.  The story behind Ms. Añez’s rise, told by five people in the meetings that decided the country’s future, is a story of stunted political parties and a bitterly divided society, which continue to convulse this South American nation. Much was at stake. As looting and violence escalated, Bolivia’s civilian leaders became increasingly worried that generals might take control to restore order, returning the country to its dark history of military dictatorships. “The probability of this was growing by the hour,” said Samuel Doria Medina, a Bolivian cement magnate and conservative politician involved in the transition talks.  Mr. Morales’s fall began when he decided to run for an unprecedented fourth term, disregarding term limits that he himself had approved. He declared victory after the elections in late October, but the results were widely contested and the country exploded in protests.  The demonstrations spread for weeks, reaching a climax on Nov. 8, when police officers joined the protesters and the military refused to support Mr. Morales. Abandoned by allies, he denounced “a civic, military and police coup” against him and fled the administrative capital, La Paz, on Nov. 10 for his stronghold in the coca farming region in central Bolivia where he began his political career. From his hide-out on a farm deep in tropical foothills pocketed with coca plots, Mr. Morales took to Twitter to denounce his opponents as “racists” and mobilize allies.  He posted on Twitter on Nov. 11 that his supporters “have never abandoned me; I will never abandon them.” The same day, coca farmers loyal to Mr. Morales began barricading Bolivia’s main highway, and his party’s activists encircled La Paz, paralyzing an already hobbled economy. Ms. Añez was an unlikely successor to Mr. Morales. Her role as the second vice president of the Bolivian Senate was a largely ceremonial one.  Most senior opposition senators preferred comfortable committee jobs with power over budgets and appointments, said Mr. Quiroga, the former president. The second vice presidency “was not a particularly fought-for position,” he said. Even that ceremonial title was about to expire. Ms. Añez was set to retire in January after deciding not to run in last month’s elections. Her small regional party got only 4 percent of the vote. Her prospects changed with Mr. Morales’s resignation. As he stepped down, senior officials from his party, including  congressional leaders, also resigned in droves. The resignations suddenly made Ms. Añez the first in line to assume the interim presidency under the Constitution. From her constituency in the sparsely populated province of Beni, she announced late on Nov. 10 that the presidency belonged to her. That claim was met without enthusiasm by opposition leaders in La Paz, who thought the gravity of the crisis required a stronger popular mandate and greater national clout. “She was saying, ‘I’m the president,’” but she was merely a retiring regional politician from a moribund party, said Mr. Doria Medina, the magnate, who had campaigned with Ms. Añez in the past. Ms. Añez did not respond to a request for an interview.  Mr. Morales’s resignation set off unruly street celebrations in Bolivia’s big cities. The revelries were followed by a wave of nationwide looting and vandalism as his supporters reacted with rage to his ouster and delinquents exploited the chaos.  In the coca region, Mr. Morales was denouncing what he said was a police plot against him. His senior election officials were arrested on allegations of fraud, and radical opposition leaders claimed that the police had issued arrest warrants for Mr. Morales, too.  About 25 members of Mr. Morales’s party and family had sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy in La Paz.  Fearing arrest, or worse, Mr. Morales instructed his justice minister, Hector Arce, early on Nov. 11 to contact Mr. Doria Medina to bring together a group of opposition power brokers for negotiations, according to the magnate.  “They were really worried,” Mr. Doria Medina said. Mr. Arce did not respond to an interview request. For his part, Mr. Morales denied there were any political negotiations to arrange his departure.  “No, not at all,” Mr. Morales insisted Friday in an interview in Mexico City.  By Nov. 11, the situation on the streets was critical. That morning, hectic backdoor talks to fill the power vacuum began to crystallize into formal negotiations brokered by officials with the Roman Catholic Church and the European Union, according to five people involved in the discussions. “We spent a long time without a president,” said the Rev. Jose Fuentes, deputy leader of the Bolivian Catholic bishops conference and a mediator in the talks. “There was no one who could give orders to the police and the armed forces.” Despite losing the presidency, Mr. Morales’s party, Movement to Socialism, remained the country’s most potent political force, with a two-thirds majority in the Bolivian Congress and the final word over any official appointments. In return for sitting down for transition talks, the party asked the opposition to broker Mr. Morales’s safe passage to Mexico. Mexico’s left-wing government offered him asylum and sent a military plane to pick him up the morning of Nov. 11. While opposition negotiators set to work persuading Bolivia’s rudderless military to allow a foreign military plane into the nation’s airspace, they also moved to bring Ms. Añez to La Paz to pre-empt any power grab.  Movement to Socialism, known as MAS, and the opposition finally met on the afternoon of Nov. 11. MAS’s senior lawmaker, Adriana Salvatierra, agreed to support a new transitional government in Congress if Mr. Morales and his inner circle were allowed to leave, according to the five people in the meeting. Ms. Salvatierra did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Morales said the Mexican plane was allowed to land because both he and his vice president, Alvaro García Linera, had spoken personally to the commander of the Bolivian Air Force, Gen. Jorge Gonzálo Terceros. Three people present in the room said the negotiations that day were suddenly thrown into disarray by the unexpected decision of neighboring Peru to reject a refueling permit to the Mexican plane if Mr. Morales got on board.  During the delay, Ms. Salvatierra and some opposition leaders began suggesting other senators who could assume the interim presidency instead of Ms. Añez, who was seen as too inexperienced and too close to the political leaders of Bolivia’s Santa Cruz region, according to the people present. While eastern Santa Cruz is the heart of Bolivia’s economy, political power has traditionally rested in La Paz in the west, provoking tense regional rivalry in negotiations. A decision by the military to deploy to the streets on the evening of Nov. 11 to quell the unrest forced the negotiators’ hands. No civilian official had ordered the military to deploy, which only underscored the danger of prolonging the power vacuum. The negotiators agreed on Ms. Añez shortly before Mr. Morales’s plane took off for Mexico the evening of Nov. 11, Mr. Quiroga said. “We got up from the table with a deal,” said Luis Vásquez, a former senator who was at the talks. But when the opposition lawmakers gathered in Congress the following day to swear in Ms. Añez, the MAS lawmakers did not show up. Opposition negotiators and one of the mediators at the talks said this broke the agreement. Another mediator said the lawmakers from Mr. Morales’s party had turned back at the last minute out of fear for their safety. Neither mediator wanted to be named because the political situation is still so delicate. Left without congressional support, Ms. Añez pronounced herself the interim president on Nov. 12 by citing a Supreme Court ruling that recognized her as Bolivia’s de facto leader. Holding a Bible, she told a crowd gathered under the balcony of the presidential palace, “My commitment is to bring back democracy and tranquillity to the country.” From his exile in Mexico, Mr. Morales accused Ms. Añez’s government of exacting revenge and stoking racial tensions. He expressed hope to return to Bolivia to finish his term. Elisabeth Malkin and Elda Cantu contributed reporting from Mexico City.']",
"Who Needs Canvas? In Dakar, Street Artists Express Their Visions on Sides of Homes",2019-11-23,By Anemona Hartocollis,"['DAKAR, Senegal — On one wall, the painting of a marabout, a Muslim holy man, peers out from behind a line hung with laundry. Nearby, a poster of an African woman in a bustle has been pasted to a house. Still further along, women socialize in front of a wall covered in an intricate black-and-white abstract pattern. These are the painted houses of the Médina, a poor and working-class neighborhood near downtown Dakar. The neighborhood has welcomed street artists from all over the world to practice their craft in what the founder of the project calls the open sky museum. Dozens of wall paintings dot the neighborhood, bringing color to usually drab cement walls, and adding to the flourishing international art scene in Dakar. Artists from not just Senegal but Burkina Faso, Algeria, Morocco, Congo, France and Italy have come to paint on these walls. They in turn have brought art lovers and tourists into a neighborhood where they otherwise might not go, to mingle with people they otherwise might not meet. The wall art of the Médina “can bring together people who normally don’t even see each other,” said Mauro Petroni, a ceramist who has lived in Dakar for many years. Street art seems to come naturally to Senegal, where many small shops are adorned with images of what they sell. Paintings of scissors signify tailors; heads with fancy hairstyles advertise barbers; images of cows and bowls of milk herald the ubiquitous sweet milk shops; a drawing of a sheep broadcasts the presence of a vendor serving grilled meat. Shop art is commissioned by the shop owners, and sometimes painted by them too. But to paint on a house in the Médina neighborhood, it helps to go through Mamadou Boye Diallo, known as Modboye. Mr. Diallo, 31, was born and raised in the Médina, the son of an elevator operator. He dropped out of school at 15 to become a break dancer and rollerblader. He got to know the art scene by working as a messenger, delivering fliers on roller blades for art galleries. In 2010, he created Yataal Art, a nonprofit arts collective, and painted the first wall in the Médina with friends. The beauty of it is that “you don’t have to take a nice shower and wear perfume” to see the art, Mr. Diallo said. Among street artists seeking a wall to paint on, Mr. Diallo became the man to see. “You have to pass by him in order to work in the Médina,” one of the street artists, Doline Legrand Diop, said. “He functions a bit like a curator.” Ms. Legrand Diop lived in Dakar for many years and has two children by a Senegalese man, though she now lives in France. Her pictures of black people dressed as aristocrats, her #remakehistory project, can be seen on the walls of the Médina. In the beginning, it was not always easy to convince homeowners to let people paint on their walls. “They wanted money,” Mr. Diallo said. But as the project caught on, they wanted to keep up with their neighbors. “It’s for the community,” said Tonton Kaba, a retired chauffeur, who has a Legrand Diop collage on his house. Abdoulaye Camara, known as Père Djim, allowed an artist to paint the word “suba,” Wolof for tomorrow, on his house. He makes furniture of wood and animal horns on the street in the Médina, home to many artisans, so he could relate. Still, what residents expect and what artists deliver are not always the same thing. Giacomo Bufarini, an Italian artist who goes by the art name Run, painted the wall of a house with a giant silhouette of the woman who lived there. He incorporated a window into her head, like a window into her mind. Rather than being impressed by the concept, she complained that he had left the peeling paint on the window frame. “I told her I’m not like a decorator,” Mr. Bufarini recalled, sounding both peeved and guilty. Another artist, Ernesto Novo, had to tiptoe around a large bull while he painted a row of African statuettes onto a wall last March. The animal is still there (as is the art). The spirit of the open sky gallery is improvisational, just like the lives of many of the artists. Traveling through West Africa from France, an artist called the Wa, who would not give his real name, wound up in Senegal by accident, after his visa expired in Mauritania, and he and his friends drove to Senegal “for a beer.” Mr. Bufarini recalled that after finishing his painting, he, Mr. Diallo and friends celebrated by going for a fish barbecue on the beach. Having no barbecue, they cooked on refrigerator racks scavenged from the trash, after burning off the plastic coating. The painted-houses project has gotten so big that this year, Delphine Buysse, a Belgian curator, has arranged for artists in residence to live at a luxury hotel in Dakar, the Pullman, for a week, while painting in the Médina. One of the most recent wall paintings was a collaboration between Kouka Ntadi, a Congolese-French artist, and Barkinado Bocoum, a Senegalese artist. Mr. Ntadi painted abstract portraits in black-and-white, and Mr. Bocoum added folksier portraits in bright colors. Mr. Ntadi loved sharing the neighborhood with the commercial artists of the barbershops and the milk stores. “I would say there is not really a border between the two in Africa,” he said. “It’s not like in France or the U.S. where there is a snobbism about art, and you can’t be in marketing. So for sure, we can still be an artist and make a design for a bottle of milk or a side of beef.”']",
Record Turnout in Hong Kong Vote After Months of Protests and Rising Violence,2019-11-23,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Keith Bradsher","['HONG KONG — After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, voters on Sunday had a chance to voice their opinion on the city’s future — and they turned out in droves, shattering the city’s records for turnout. The election on Sunday was for district council members, one of the lowest rungs of Hong Kong’s elected offices. District councils mainly deal with noise complaints, bus stop locations and neighborhood beautification projects. Elections for them are usually quiet affairs focused on community issues.  But in the midst of the increasingly violent protests that have divided the city, the race took on outsize significance. The vote was the first test of whether the protests could transform public anger that has led millions to take to the streets into actual votes, or whether the populace had grown weary of acts of civil disobedience that have snarled transportation and forced the closing of schools and businesses. The results are expected hours after the polls closed at around 10:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The election drew record-setting throngs of voters to polling places on Sunday. Through it all, the city was calm, as democracy advocates appeared to focus on participating in one of the few elections that Beijing allows in the territory under its sovereignty.  “Politically speaking, the battle of the district councils as a whole is a crucial battle in taking control,” said Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy legislator who is also running for district council.  Here’s a look at the race and what is at stake:  More than 69 percent of voters had hit the polls with around an hour left to go before the election closed. Those numbers surpassed the 47 percent turnout in the entire election four years ago. Back then, it had already set a record, lifted by an awakening of political interest that accompanied the Umbrella Movement a year earlier. Before voting began on Sunday morning, the government had strongly denied a persistent rumor on social media that the polls might close after the first several hours, instead of being open for the scheduled 15 hours.  That rumor gave both sides in the election an incentive to urge their voters to show up early. Four times as many people voted in the first hour of polling as did in the 2015 district council elections.  “I haven’t been voting for a while — this time is very important,” Ada Chan, a 30-year-old office worker, said as she left a polling place after casting her ballot early. Lines quickly became so long on Sunday morning that Patrick Nip, the territory’s secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, appealed to the public to have more confidence that the polls would stay open.  “The voting time is very abundant, so you don’t have to concentrate on voting at the same time,” he said. By late afternoon, lines had disappeared at some locations. The voters had dwindled to a trickle at the Yau Ma Tei Community Center polling station, nestled between the city’s famous street market for jade and the graceful banyan trees of an ancient temple. A call to expand Hong Kong’s limited democracy is one of the demands of the protest movement, which began in June over a now-withdrawn proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.  Protesters have called for direct elections for the entire legislature, where currently only 40 of the 70 seats are selected by popular vote. They have also called for the chief executive, who is selected by a largely pro-Beijing election committee, to instead be chosen by voters.  The district councils have no lawmaking power. They control small amounts of public funds for simple infrastructure, like rain shelters. They lodge concerns with government departments over noise, traffic, sanitation and other issues. (Of the 479 district council seats, 452 are directly elected.) The district council members do have a modest role in choosing the chief executive, Hong Kong’s highest official. Whichever side wins a majority of the seats controls 117 votes in the 1,200-member chief executive election committee. That election committee is dominated by pro-establishment corporate interests, and the chief executives they have selected have always been loyal to Beijing. But a win would give the overall pro-democracy camp control of an additional 10 percent of the votes, and put it close to the 150 votes necessary to nominate a candidate. The brochures of district council candidates typically show neighborhood concerns they pledge to fix: trash-filled alleys, air-conditioners dripping on sidewalks and streets lined with illegally parked cars. This year, several pro-democracy candidates have included protest slogans on their materials. Law Cheuk-yung, 22, said he was inspired to run for district council because of recent social movements. He said he would demand answers from the police after residents complained of possible testing of tear gas in his district, Tuen Mun.  “I want to imagine local government being more responsive,” he said. “At the moment the district council is just a rubber stamp. They do whatever the government wants.”  For such candidates, it is more about playing to the sentiment of the protests rather than taking action. They would not have much of a role in addressing protesters’ demands, which include an investigation into the police’s use of force, offering amnesty to those arrested in the protests and expanding direct elections. “They are all trying to capitalize on public anger,” said Suzanne Pepper, a scholar of Chinese politics who lives in Hong Kong. Establishment parties have long had an advantage in these races, in part because they are much better funded, with backing from businesses. Currently the pro-Beijing camp holds 327 district council seats versus 124 for the pro-democracy group.  Rising interest in the election has meant that pro-democracy candidates are participating in every race, unlike previous years, when some establishment district council members ran unopposed. And after worries about disqualifications, only one of the camp’s candidates, the prominent activist Joshua Wong, was barred from running this year for political reasons. An election officer ruled that Mr. Wong could not uphold Hong Kong law because his political organization viewed independence from China as a possible goal for the city. A string of violent attacks on election candidates has hung over the race. Twelve opposition figures, including prominent politicians and activists as well as first-time candidates, have been ambushed and bloodied by gangs of masked men or attacked while canvassing for votes. “We can see Hong Kong isn’t as free and as civilized as we’d previously imagined,” said Jannelle Leung, a 25-year-old accountant who was struck in the back of her head with a hard object in early October the day she announced she was officially running. She also said she received sexually harassing phone calls before the attack.  Jocelyn Chau, a first-time candidate like Ms. Leung who received similar lurid calls before being punched by a man while canvassing last month in the pro-Beijing neighborhood of North Point, criticized the government for not condemning the attacks on pro-democracy figures. “Not even superficial gestures,” said Ms. Chau, 23. The polarizing pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho was injured in a knife attack this month and his offices were vandalized. He called the attack “a dark day for the district council election,” adding that the “orderly election had been completely obliterated.” The attacks on candidates and vandalism had stirred worries that the election might be postponed. Some pro-democracy figures had said that a delay could harm their strength at the polls. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said the government would do its best to ensure the election would go on as scheduled. The government posted riot police officers near polling places across the city, though outside the zones marked with yellow tape where only voters could go.  The city had been convulsed by two weeks of intense protest, including on several campuses. At Chinese University of Hong Kong, protesters clashed with the police and occupied the college for five days. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, more than 1,000 people at one point were trapped by a police siege. Patrick Nip, the secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, warned Monday that further unrest would reduce the chances of the election’s being held as scheduled. He called for an end to violence “and all kinds of duress.”  In the past few days, protests have ebbed drastically, however, as the city prepared to take its conflicts to the polls. ']","The citywide district council election, normally a quiet, local affair, is seen as a referendum on the demonstrations."
Picassos in the Garage? Artist’s Handyman Is Convicted of Hiding Stolen Works,2019-11-23,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — One September day in 2010, a man who said he was the former electrician of Pablo Picasso entered the Paris office of the Picasso estate, wheeling a suitcase filled with 271 of the Spaniard’s artworks. The electrician, Pierre Le Guennec, had traveled from his home in southern France with his wife, Danielle. He said he wanted to authenticate 180 watercolor paintings, lithographs and Cubist collages, as well as two notebooks with 91 drawings.  The treasure trove had been in their garage for almost 40 years, Mr. Le Guennec said, gifts from Picasso decades earlier. Thus began a nearly 10-year saga in which a lawsuit claimed that the artworks were “stolen goods”; the police began an investigation; the courts heard contradictory testimony; and multiple appeals and hearings took the defendants and Picasso’s heirs all the way to France’s top appeals court.  It culminated this past week in a decision by a top French court confirming the convictions of Mr. Le Guennec and his wife for receiving and concealing stolen artwork by Picasso.  It was the third time they were found guilty, but Mr. and Ms. Le Guennec, 80 and 76, are not going to jail. The court handed the couple two-year suspended jail sentences.  They were not present for the final verdict. Mr. Le Guennec said in a telephone interview on Saturday that the couple had learned of the ruling through neighbors and a newspaper article. The couple have always denied stealing the artwork. Mr. Le Guennec had been employed as an electrician and handyman in various homes of the artist in southern France in the early 1970s, fixing an oven and setting up an alarm system in at least one property, among other duties.  Ms. Le Guennec told The New York Times in 2010 that “my husband was getting ready to leave” one day when Picasso gave him “a box.” The artist, she added, “never explained anything.”  Among the artworks are nine rare Cubist collages, a painting from Picasso’s iconic Blue period, watercolors, lithographs and dozens of drawings in notebooks. They are estimated to be worth several dozens of millions of dollars, although no precise valuation has been done, according to Jean-Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for Picasso’s son. They are now housed at the Banque de France.  Mr. Le Guennec said that he went to the Paris office  in 2010 because he had recently learned that he had cancer, and he wanted to secure the provenance of the artworks for his two children.  The artist’s son, Claude Ruiz-Picasso, and the administrator of the Picasso estate were startled and intrigued, Mr. Neuer told the news media at the time.  Gazing at the unsigned cache and realizing that it was from the famed Spanish artist, they quickly grew suspicious.  Mr. Ruiz-Picasso knew that his father, a temperamental genius who died in 1973, had been an inveterate collector who gave away only artworks that he had recently made — and he would have signed them. “If you go see the Picasso estate and tell them, ‘These 271 works from Picasso fell from the ceiling,’ or, ‘I found them at a bric-a-brac market,’ no one will believe you,” Mr. Neuer said in a telephone interview on Saturday.  He said the court ruling this past week marked “the end of a cover-up.” The artwork that Mr. Le Guennec hauled in was estimated to have been painted between 1900 and 1932.  Anne Baldassari, a former president of the Pablo Picasso Museum in Paris, said at the couple’s first trial in 2015: “The Picasso I know wouldn’t let his artworks go. It would be like ripping up one’s own skin.” Mr. Le Guennec later changed his story, claiming that Jacqueline Roque, Picasso’s last wife, and not the artist himself, had given him the artwork. “It was in 1971. Madam called me as I was leaving Mr. Picasso’s house,” he said on Saturday of Ms. Roque. “And she said, ‘Keep this; this is for you.’” Ms. Le Guennec added in the interview that the couple initially said that Picasso had given them the artworks at Ms. Roque’s instructions. They also said that the works had sat untouched in their garage for more than four decades. But Mr. Neuer argued in court and in the interview on Saturday that because the artworks were in a greatly preserved state, they could not have been stored for so long in a garage in southern France, where they would probably have deteriorated. More contradictions followed, Mr. Neuer said. Mr. Le Guennec claimed to have cataloged all the artworks on his own. But Ms. Baldassari said that the descriptions and comparisons were of “an academic level.”  For one drawing, for example, Mr. Le Guennec had drawn a parallel with “Harlequin,” an oil painting by Picasso that is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But when Mr. Neuer asked Mr. Le Guennec at the couple’s 2015 trial to name Picasso’s most famous artwork at MoMA, the former electrician did not know what the New York museum was.  He and his wife were convicted that year. A higher court upheld that verdict in 2016, but the ruling was later quashed by the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court. Mr. and Ms. Le Guennec cannot appeal the final verdict, which was handed down on Tuesday by the Lyon Court of Appeal. Mr. Neuer speculated that art merchants, probably based in Switzerland, had used Mr. Le Guennec in the same way that traffickers would a drug mule.  Mr. Le Guennec called such a scenario “ridiculous” and said he was disappointed with the verdict. Of his experience as a handyman for Picasso, he said, “It was still fabulous and extraordinary for someone like me, the little people, to get to know these people.” ']",Pierre Le Guennec said that the artist had given him the artworks and that he had forgotten about them for decades. 
Leaked China Files Show Internment Camps Are Ruled by Secrecy and Spying,2019-11-24,By Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley,"['HONG KONG — As the government accelerated mass detentions of Muslim minorities in northwest China, a senior official issued a secret directive giving detailed orders for how the rapidly expanding indoctrination camps holding them should be managed. Guards should impose pervasive, round-the-clock video surveillance to prevent escapes. Inmates were to be kept isolated from the outside world and held to a strict scoring system that could determine when they might be released. And the facilities were to be shrouded in secrecy, with even employees banned from bringing in mobile phones. “It is necessary,” the directive from two years ago said, “to strengthen the staff’s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline.” Now that secrecy has been shattered with the publication of the directive itself. It is one of six internal documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that shed new light on China’s crackdown in the Xinjiang region, where a million or more ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others have been detained in the past three years. The disclosure of the 24 pages of documents amounts to a second significant leak from inside China’s ruling Communist Party related to the crackdown. A member of the Chinese political establishment shared a different, 403-page set of internal papers with The New York Times earlier this year, expressing hope that it would make it more difficult for party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to escape culpability for the mass detentions. While the source of the new documents is unknown — they were provided by Uighur overseas networks — their disclosure may amount to another sign of dissent in the party over the crackdown.  The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, led the inquiry into the documents, bringing together more than 75 journalists from the consortium and 17 partner organizations, including The Times, in 14 countries. Outside experts also reviewed the papers and concluded they were authentic. “In terms of documentary evidence, we have reached a next level of disclosure,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher who has studied the camps and a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a human rights group in Washington. “The evidence we have now is very comprehensive, very complete. It’s kind of game over for Beijing in terms of the cover-up, the denials and the half-truths.” The most significant of the new documents is the secret directive on how to manage the camps, which is the only document in both sets of leaked papers to describe the inner workings of these facilities. The nine-page order was issued in November 2017 by the Communist Party committee in Xinjiang that oversees legal affairs. The papers also include four “daily bulletins” from another regional party committee that provide information about those that have been targeted for investigation and detention in camps and a court judgment sentencing a Uighur resident to 10 years in prison on charges of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination, a vaguely defined crime. Beijing has rejected criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers that use humane methods to fight the spread of Islamic extremism. Internally, the government often uses language consistent with that position. The leaked directive, for example, refers to the camps as “vocational skills education and training centers” and the detainees as “students.” But it also lays bare the punitive underpinnings of these facilities, and some of its language on guarding against escapes and other incidents is identical to that used in guidelines for prisons and other detention sites. The orders called on guards to strictly control and monitor the activities of students. “Prevent escapes while they are at class, dining, using the toilet, washing, receiving medical care or meeting with family.” Other instructions call for erecting guardhouses and internal partitions inside the camps to prevent inmates from moving around freely; rigorously checking any people, vehicles or goods entering,  and recruiting informants to spy on other detainees. “Evaluate and resolve students’ ideological problems and abnormal emotions at all times,” the directive said. The document included orders for “full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots,” and prohibited detainees from having contact with the outside world, except in strictly monitored interactions. The government says these sites help prevent Uighurs and other Muslims from being drawn to religious extremism by teaching them the Chinese language, job skills and how to be law-abiding citizens. In response to the earlier leak of documents, the government argued that its methods have effectively stifled extremist violence in Xinjiang. Former detainees, though, have described the classes as numbing, harsh and ultimately futile attempts at brainwashing. And residents have been sent to internment camps for behavior that would be commonplace elsewhere: traveling abroad, showing signs of religious devotion praying regularly or growing a long beard, or installing certain cellphone apps, such as encrypted messaging tools. Mr. Zenz, the scholar who reviewed the documents, said he also obtained a cache of more than 25,000 files from government departments that provides new detail on the scale of the detentions and their impact on families. In six villages in Yarkand, a county in southwestern Xinjiang where nearly all the residents are Uighur, he found that about one in six rural adult residents were interned or in prison. In two villages in that county, nearly 60 percent of households had at least one person in custody. The detainees in Xinjiang are mostly working-age men, he wrote in a new paper, and that has led to hardships for families. In one case Mr. Zenz documented, five children were effectively orphaned after their father was imprisoned and their mother put in an indoctrination camp. One of the leaked daily bulletins orders an investigation of people from Xinjiang who have obtained foreign citizenship or applied for visas or other documents at Chinese embassies abroad. Another describes how 15,683 “suspicious persons” were sent to centers in southern Xinjiang on the week of June 19, 2017. The government has repeatedly refused to say how many people are being held in these camps. Other bulletins reveal how the authorities settled on targets for detention by using databases that collect and collate information on Xinjiang residents, especially Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. The daily bulletins and the document on camp operations were signed by Zhu Hailun, who was then the top security official in Xinjiang. He was assigned to another position in the regional legislature early this year. Mr. Zhu, 61, appears to have been a key enforcer of the internment campaign, turning the orders of the regional party secretary, Chen Quanguo, into detailed plans. A party official who spent his career in Xinjiang, Mr. Zhu had previously served as the head of Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, succeeding an official who was fired in 2009 after bloody ethnic riots killed nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese. Like many in his generation, Mr. Zhu was no stranger to the idea that minds can be reprogrammed through intense indoctrination and propaganda: He grew up in Mao’s era, when such techniques were widespread. In an official biography, Mr. Zhu described the two years he spent as a teenager working in a rural commune as a period of “re-education.” Over 40 years later, Mr. Zhu was uncompromising as Mr. Chen’s right-hand man for security. An internal document from 2017 signed by Mr. Zhu that was among the papers leaked to The Times attributed attacks in London and Manchester in part to putting “human rights above security.” The directive on camp operations instructed officials to keep extensive records on detainees, and described a scoring system that measured how they behaved to determine their fate. Inmates should be assigned to one of three zones based on how dangerous they are judged to be — general management, strict, and very strict, the document said. But detainees could be moved between the grades of control depending on their scores.  “Break down scores and manage and individually assess the students’ ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline,” the document said.  Officials were told to assign inmates to fixed positions in dormitories, classes, lineups and workshops, and to control every detail of life inside the camps, at every moment of the day, including wake-up, meals, studies and showers. Detainees must meet “disciplinary demands” or face punishment, the directive added.  “Strengthen the management of the students’ hygiene,” it said. “Ensure that they get timely haircuts and shave, change and wash their clothes. Arrange for them to have baths once or twice a week, so that they develop good habits.” The demands listed in the directive echoed the accounts of former detainees like Orynbek Koksebek, an ethnic Kazakh man who spent four months in an indoctrination camp in Xinjiang after being detained by the Chinese authorities in December 2017.  “There was military discipline in everything we did, how you walk, stand up straight. If you didn’t, they would slap you,” he said in an interview in the Kazakh city of Almaty earlier this year. A key disclosure in the leaked directive is an official description of the conditions that detainees must meet to be released from the camps. Aside from achieving a good score in the point system, the document said, inmates must be categorized at the lowest threat level and have served a minimum term of one year — though interviews with former detainees indicate that camps sometimes release people sooner. The directive also emphasized the importance of showing remorse. Discussions with detainees should “promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past behavior,” it said. A different document, among the set shared with The Times earlier this year, described how family members outside the camps are told that their behavior can also affect when a detainee is released — a implied threat aimed at silencing complaints.  Former detainees said the criteria for release seemed arbitrary, and there was little clarity on when or why people could leave. “You enter the camp with 1,000 points. You can’t gain points. You can only lose them if you yawn or smile,” recalled Rahima Senbai, who was held in a camp in October 2017 and only allowed to return to her home in Kazakhstan a year later. “If you ever went under 500 points, you’d have to stay for another year.” Zharqynbek Otan, who was held in a camp for seven months after his arrest in January 2017 and has since fled China, said the goal of the detention was to impose loyalty to the Chinese state. “The main purpose is to brainwash you,” he said, “so you forget your roots and everything about Islam and ethnic identity.”']",A secret document reflects leaders’ struggle to manage Xinjiang sites swelling with Muslim detainees.
Likud Rival Slams Netanyahu and Calls for Primary to ‘Save the Country’,2019-11-23,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — A leading rival to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from within his own party rebuked the longtime Israeli premier on Saturday for calling his indictment on corruption charges an “attempted coup” and demanded a primary election be held to replace Mr. Netanyahu and “save the country.” The broadside by Gideon Saar, a popular and ambitious former minister who said he would be a candidate for Mr. Netanyahu’s job, compounded the political crisis confronting the prime minister and signaled what could be a bitter internecine fight for control of Likud, the right-wing party that has led Israel for most of the past four decades. “That isn’t an attempted coup,” Mr. Saar said of Mr. Netanyahu’s indictment by the Israeli attorney general. “Not only is it wrong to say that, it’s also irresponsible to say that. It’s completely out of touch.” At the same time, Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief from the Blue and White party who defeated Mr. Netanyahu in a Sept. 17 election but was unable to form a government, called upon the newly weakened prime minister to go along with an idea he has so far refused to entertain: allowing Mr. Gantz to serve as premier for two years, after which, if Mr. Netanyahu were acquitted, Mr. Gantz would allow him to resume his post. “A real patriot wouldn’t hold the citizens of Israel hostage to his legal battles,” Mr. Gantz said. “Likud leadership,” he added, “it is time to make your voices heard!” Charged on Thursday with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, making him the first sitting prime minister of Israel to be indicted, Mr. Netanyahu, 70, denounced the law-enforcement system as out to get him and called on his supporters to “investigate the investigators.” On Friday, Mr. Netanyahu said he would “accept the court’s decisions” but again demanded an investigation into how his cases were handled, saying law-enforcement officers who acted improperly “must be taken care of.” And he stepped up the political pressure by asking his supporters to rally behind him at a demonstration next week in Tel Aviv. But by Saturday evening, Mr. Netanyahu’s defiance appeared to have given an opening to his adversaries both in and out of Likud. Speaking on the Israeli version of “Meet the Press,” Mr. Saar said that Mr. Netanyahu’s problem in staying on as premier “isn’t legal, it’s political.” Mr. Netanyahu had been unable to form a government after elections in April and in September, he noted. “I haven’t heard a single person who thinks that after a third, or fourth, or fifth, or sixth election, that Prime Minister Netanyahu will succeed in forming a government,” Mr. Saar said. Were Mr. Netanyahu to stay at the helm of Likud, Mr. Saar warned, either “this insane crisis,” with Israel politically paralyzed, would continue, or the center-left would gain power. “There is only one way that will allow us to save the country and to extricate it from this crisis and to save the Likud’s rule — a primary to avert an election,” he said. Mr. Saar, 52, was the strongest vote-getter in Likud primaries in 2008 and 2012, but he took a hiatus in 2014. He re-entered public life in 2017, and ran in the Likud primary election in February, finishing third. He said Saturday night that he believed he would “easily” form a government where Mr. Netanyahu had been unable to. Only days ago, Mr. Netanyahu maintained rock-solid party support. But with Mr. Saar assailing him publicly, the cracks spread almost instantly. Haim Katz, a lawmaker who is chairman of the Likud Central Committee, endorsed Mr. Saar’s demand for an expedited primary election. Mr. Gantz, in a speech in Tel Aviv, pointed to Mr. Netanyahu’s long history of exploiting his opponents’ misfortunes, and of fanning the flames of popular anger among his right-wing base, to argue that the prime minister had no business trying to put his prosecutors on trial in the court of public opinion. “A man who squashed and stepped on his political rivals throughout his political life, had no compassion or mercy for them even in their most difficult hour, is the last person who can now enlist the public’s support to incite against detectives, incite against judges, incite against prosecutors,” Mr. Gantz said. He noted that Mr. Netanyahu had seized on corruption investigations into former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to demand his resignation in 2008, saying those made it impossible for him to maintain the public trust. And Mr. Gantz recalled Mr. Netanyahu’s role in leading right-wing protests against former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the days before his assassination in 1995. The prime minister, Mr. Gantz said, “needs to know well the dangerous price of words, which are liable to turn, heaven forbid, into lethal bullets.”']","The demand by Gideon Saar, a popular ex-minister, was the first crack in the party’s solidarity and signaled what could be a bitter internecine fight."
Egypt Arrests Senior Editor of Independent News Outlet,2019-11-23,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['Egyptian security forces arrested a senior editor of the country’s last significant independent news outlet on Saturday, in a new peak to a six-year-old crackdown on press freedom under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  The editor in chief of the outlet, the online publication Mada Masr, said Saturday that a few weeks ago, the authorities had also deported another senior editor, who is an American citizen.  Known for its pioneering investigative journalism and published in both Arabic and English, Mada Masr has remained a critical source of information for intellectuals and activists inside Egypt as well as for researchers and policymakers around the world.  Since 2013, almost every other news organization in the country has come under the effective control of the government. In the latest example of the investigative reporting that has become its trademark, Mada Masr reported on Wednesday that Mr. el-Sisi was quietly removing his son Mahmoud from his senior role overseeing the intelligence service and sending him on an open-ended assignment to the Egyptian Embassy in Moscow.  Citing unidentified sources, the report said senior officials had grown concerned that Mahmoud el-Sisi’s poor performance in handling the news media and other aspects of his job would hurt his father’s image. The report said officials were mindful that concerns that former President Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son Gamal to succeed him had helped set off the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.  [Read: Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian leader ousted in Arab Spring, dies at 91.] The pro-government media uniformly ignored the report. It was not immediately clear whether the article played any role in the arrest on Saturday. Lina Attalah, the editor in chief of Mada Masr, said security forces had been inquiring for weeks about the editor who was arrested, “since before we even had a draft of the story.” The arrest represents “a dangerous signal,” said Khaled al-Balshy, the former deputy head of Egypt’s press union. “Mada Masr is one of very few voices that are fighting to present a different point of view,” he added. “The message appears to be: This is no longer acceptable.” The government official in charge of the state information service could not immediately be reached for comment. The arrest also raised alarms among researchers in Washington who rely on Mada Masr.  “Mada is one of the Middle East’s real treasures,” said Amy Hawthorne, a deputy director of research at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “It is probably the single most important publication for every Egypt-watcher or Egypt expert I know.” Mada Masr said Saturday that plainclothes security officers had arrested a senior Arabic language editor, Shady Zalat, 37, in a predawn raid on his home.  The news organization also said Saturday that an American editor who had been working in Cairo for it, Daniel O’Connell, 28, was recently stopped at Cairo’s international airport, deported and barred from re-entering the country. Mada Masr said the officers who arrested Mr. Zalat had presented no warrant for his arrest and offered no explanation. His whereabouts was unknown.  The officers confiscated his laptop and his wife’s, and then they returned a few minutes later, “seemingly agitated, looking for his cellphone,” Mada Masr said.  “He has done nothing more than use words to report the news,” Mada Masr said. Egypt had previously appeared to allow Mada Masr a unique degree of freedom, perhaps because the authorities had successfully made its contents difficult to view in Egypt, or because of its singular reputation in Western capitals. For more than two years, the publication has been blocked by government censors from easy internet access within Egypt.  Nearly two years ago, for example, Mada Masr obtained documents revealing how private companies controlled by the Egyptian intelligence services had worked behind the scenes to acquire control of most of Egypt’s privately owned and ostensibly independent media outlets.  The increased pressure on Mada Masr may be part of a broader crackdown on dissent since September.  Mr. el-Sisi’s government has never tolerated political opposition or public demonstrations. But in September, a series of online videos by a former contractor accusing the president and his circle of corruption set off a rare outburst of limited street protests. The authorities have responded by arresting more than 4,000 people, according to rights groups, in the largest wave of arrests since Mr. el-Sisi became president in 2014 after a military takeover the previous year.  Several journalists were detained for their reporting on the protests, and the government has also targeted the few other news media outlets outside state control. The authorities blocked access within Egypt to the BBC online and the United States government’s Arabic-speaking network website al-Hurra.  Mada Masr was among the first to report the blockage of both websites.']",The arrest was the latest step in a crackdown on press freedom over the past six years.
Hong Kong Election Landslide Signals More Frictions With Beijing,2019-11-25,By Keith Bradsher,"['HONG KONG — In the run-up to local elections in Hong Kong on Sunday, Beijing and its allies in the city were portraying the vote as a way to hear the voice of a silent majority after nearly six months of increasingly violent antigovernment protests. Now, that majority has spoken — and it has come out overwhelmingly against Beijing and its allies. The city’s Beijing-backed establishment camp suffered a staggering defeat in elections for district councils as democracy advocates swept 87 percent of the seats, up from less than a third. Beijing and its supporters in Hong Kong, including the city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, must now reckon with a resounding, very public display of support for the democracy camp and the protest movement. “This election is not just about livelihood issues, but also a direct referendum regarding the justifiability of this regime,” Cary Lo, a newly elected district councilor supporting democracy, told reporters on Monday. “It has indicated that Carrie Lam’s government has lost its legitimacy.” What all sides agree on is that the election landslide puts China’s ruling Communist Party under even greater pressure to respond to the protest movement. Where their views differ is on what it means.  To the pro-democracy camp, that means addressing the broader Hong Kong public’s calls for more official accountability. Other politicians are concerned that the vote could be seen by Beijing as a sign that the territory is slipping further from its grip and requires a harsher response. The protesters started campaigning in June against a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Their demands have since morphed into broader calls for expanded democracy and an investigation into alleged police brutality. Beijing and its local allies had been convinced that the protest movement had antagonized the public by blocking roads and rail lines and scaring off shoppers and tourists. The democrats’ triumph at the polls showed instead that Hong Kong residents remain broadly sympathetic to the movement. The councils have very little actual power. They advise the government on neighborhood issues like the location of bus stops, not big questions like democracy. But the democrats’ victory also means that they will gain a larger say on the committee that chooses the territory’s chief executive in 2022. Democracy advocates were ebullient on Monday as they made clear they would continue to challenge government policies and stand in solidarity with antigovernment demonstrators. They walked as a group to Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where dozens of protesters have been trapped for more than a week by the police. “Save our brothers and sisters,” chanted Owan Li, a newly elected district councilor who is also a student member of the university’s management council. “We have shown the police force that university campuses are not to be trampled upon.” The victory in the district council races handed the pro-democracy movement a boost of confidence — and new financial support for its campaigners. (Council members earn about $50,000 a year for the part-time job.) The camp will now be looking at how it can build on this momentum to drum up support for legislative elections next year. The city’s pro-Beijing camp, in contrast, found itself in full retreat. Leaders of the main pro-Beijing political party gathered on Monday to bow their heads in a televised public apology. A federation of pro-Beijing labor unions which suffered heavy losses in district races on Sunday angrily blamed Mrs. Lam’s policies, seeking to distance itself from the unpopular administration. Mrs. Lam gave few clues on her next move, saying in a statement that the Hong Kong government would “listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect.” Now what remains to be seen is how Beijing will respond and one possibility is — it won’t. Leaders in Beijing may just ignore the outcome of the elections and maintain their hard line against the protest movement, which they have denounced as the work of foreign-backed separatist forces.  Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a powerful Beijing advisory group, said that the Communist Party had already decided at a high-level meeting last month that it would more closely oversee Hong Kong. Beijing would not allow the outcome of the local elections to affect that decision, and would not yield to the demands of protesters, he said in a telephone interview on Monday. “The gist of the decision is to strengthen Beijing’s leadership of the Hong Kong government and strengthen the protection of national security,” he said. Trying to put a positive spin on a huge electoral defeat, Mr. Lau said that with the democrats seizing control of 17 of the city’s 18 district councils — compared with none before — the opposition might find activism on councils to be an alternative to violence.  “The opposition forces will have a new platform to attack Beijing and the Hong Kong government,” he said. “At the same time, they will have less need to go to the streets.”  Ronny Tong, a pro-Beijing moderate in Mrs. Lam’s cabinet, also tried to find a glimmer of hope in the government’s crushing electoral defeat.  Mr. Tong said that the vote was proof that “democracy is alive and well” in Hong Kong — and there was no need for the United States to proceed with legislation to punish Hong Kong officials for their role in harsh police tactics. President Trump has not yet said if he will sign the legislation, which passed both houses with veto-proof margins. But Mr. Lau, the Beijing adviser, said that he believed either the Hong Kong government or the Communist Party would now have to push through stricter security legislation for the territory — a step that the democracy movement would be certain to oppose stridently. In China, the pro-Beijing camp’s defeat could only be seen as a repudiation of the party’s rule over the semiautonomous region, just weeks after President Xi Jinping gave Mrs. Lam his enthusiastic backing. The Chinese government’s reaction on Monday was strikingly muted, as if the authorities were surprised by the results. China’s state television network covered the voting extensively as it happened on Sunday, but then lapsed into silence once the outcome was clear.  A number of state media outlets, while not describing the results as either a win or loss, on Monday accused hostile foreign forces of aiding the opposition. A foreign ministry spokesman said Beijing would not brook any challenge to its sovereignty over the territory. “Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” said Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman.  Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said by telephone that the results in Hong Kong showed how out of touch the Communist leadership in Beijing was when it came to understanding popular sentiment and democratic processes. “Whenever China has tried to manage democracy, they have failed,” she said. “They are very bad at understanding democracies and how democratic societies function.” But democracy supporters and political analysts were also caught completely off guard by the scale of the victory, after predicting as late as Sunday afternoon that pro-Beijing politicians would keep control of most of the district councils. A rout by democracy advocates “was beyond our imagination,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at City University of Hong Kong and longtime democracy advocate. “No one could say that, they would think you were crazy.” Reporting was contributed by Steven Lee Myers in Beijing and Katherine Li and Ezra Cheung in Hong Kong.

U.S. Commander Warns of Iranian Attack in Middle East,2019-11-23,By Eric Schmitt,"['MANAMA, Bahrain — The deployment of 14,000 additional American troops to the Persian Gulf region since the spring has probably not dissuaded Iran from planning a major attack on the scale of the recent missile and drone assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil fields, the commander of American forces in the Middle East says. The officer, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the head of the military’s Central Command, said the additional troops, fighter jets and air defenses that the Pentagon has dispatched might have deterred Iran from attacking American targets — like Iran’s downing of an unmanned surveillance drone in June. But he said strikes against Gulf nations were another matter. “My judgment is that it is very possible they will attack again,” General McKenzie said in an interview this past week ahead of an international security conference on Saturday. “It’s the trajectory and the direction that they’re on,” he added in a second interview later in the week. “The attack on the oil fields in Saudi was stunning in the depth of its audaciousness,” he said of an assault in September that the United States and its European allies blame Iran for. “I wouldn’t rule that out going forward.” General McKenzie did not offer specific evidence that Iran was plotting an imminent attack against targets like oil facilities or desalinization plants — citing only the ability of American military and spy agencies to detect patterns of worrisome but unspecified Iranian activities. “Iran is under extreme pressure,” General McKenzie said, referring to the maximum-pressure campaign of economic sanctions that the Trump administration is employing against the country. He added that Iran was trying to “crack the campaign” with attacks to provoke an American military response. Speaking on Saturday at a regional security conference in Manama, Bahrain, the home of the Navy’s Fifth Fleet, General McKenzie pledged a continued American security commitment to the Gulf despite a Trump administration policy shift to prioritize threats from China and Russia. He also urged regional partners like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Oman to work with Washington in confronting any Iranian aggression.  Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the Emirates have joined the United States, Britain, Australia and Albania to form a maritime coalition to ensure safe passage through Middle Eastern waterways after a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf this past spring. “Unfortunately, sometimes the Iranian regime has proved itself to be the bully in the neighborhood,” General McKenzie said in his remarks. “And the only way to stand up to a bully is to do it together.” Also addressing the security conference, John C. Rood, an under secretary of defense, said that “Iran has made clear its intent to pursue a pattern of aggressive behavior that is destabilizing.” The Pentagon officials’ comments came as regional allies have tried to de-escalate tensions in the Persian Gulf region. The Emirates, in particular, has broken ranks with President Trump’s hard-line approach to Iran, sending a Coast Guard delegation to Tehran in July to discuss maritime security issues. American diplomats have sought to play down any fissures with the Emirates or other Gulf partners, divisions that have raised questions about how reliable those nations would be in the event of a war between the United States and Iran. “We’re working very closely with the U.A.E. to try to convince Iran that the only solution is a political solution,” John Rakolta, a business executive from Detroit who is the new United States ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, told The Associated Press this month. Some critics of the administration say that allowing the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities and the oil tankers to go unchallenged by the United States military and its allies will embolden strikes by Iran.  Administration officials point to the recent protests in Iran over gasoline price increases as evidence that the economic pressure is working and that Washington’s restraint in response to the attacks is justified. General McKenzie said that the reinforcements sent to the Gulf region — including more than 3,000 troops to Saudi Arabia — were intended to send a strong deterrent signal to Iran but not to provoke Iranian military action. In the latest projection of force, the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln passed through the Strait of Hormuz last week, the first time a Navy carrier had traversed the Persian Gulf since April. Navy officials have noted that the Lincoln has been at sea for months in the Gulf of Oman without regular port calls for the crew, a potential morale issue that is due to be remedied soon. “There wasn’t any particular strategic necessity on the timing,” General McKenzie said. “It is important to demonstrate that we can do it when we want to.” At last year’s Bahrain conference, then Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to tamp down concerns that if Washington reduced its security role in the Middle East, Russia would move quickly to fill the vacuum. At the time, the United States had not had an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in seven months, and the Pentagon was pulling Patriot missile-defense systems out of Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain as part of a realignment of firepower toward Russia and China. Yet Washington continues to keep a close watch on Iranian military strategy and capabilities. A lengthy report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency last week predicted that Iran will deploy increasing numbers of more accurate and lethal ballistic missiles and field new land-attack cruise missiles.  “On the conventional side, Iran’s military strategy is primarily based on deterrence and the ability to retaliate against an attacker,” Christian Saunders, the agency’s senior Iran analyst, said in releasing the report. Nor are Iran’s conventional arms the only focus of Washington’s attention.  Iran announced plans this month  to reactivate its most sensitive nuclear production site, a deep underground uranium enrichment center, in a step that dismantles some of the last major restrictions on the country under the 2015 nuclear deal that was signed with major international powers but which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from last year. It was the third time in six months that Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, had outlined a careful series of escalations of Iran’s nuclear capacity.  None of these steps immediately secures the makings of a bomb for Iran. But taken together they create the condition that the three-year negotiating process leading up to the nuclear accord was intended to stop, at least temporarily: Iran’s ability to develop the material for a bomb in a year.']","A top general said that America’s addition of 14,000 troops in the Persian Gulf since the spring would probably not deter Iran from carrying out a major strike."
"Student Sets Himself on Fire, Highlighting Broader Distress in France",2019-11-24,By Mélissa Godin,"['PARIS — Early this month, Anas K., 22, sat in front of the student center at a university in Lyon and posted what he believed would be his final Facebook status. “I accuse Macron, Hollande, Sarkozy and the European Union of having killed me by creating uncertainties for the future of all,” he wrote. Shortly after clicking the post button, he set himself on fire. Today, the young man, whose family has asked that his full name not be published to protect his privacy, has burns over 90 percent of his body. As of Nov. 18, Anas K.’s condition is stable, though he remains in an artificial coma. Although little is known publicly of Anas K.’s psychological state before his suicide attempt on Nov. 8, the act touched a nerve with students across France. It quickly became another indication, like the Yellow Vest protests, of the precariousness that many French feel has come to define their lives.  The episode has inspired protests in various cities against student financial insecurity. Student unions have demanded a re-evaluation of university tuition and changes to scholarships. They also want more student housing and better health services on campuses.  Thousands of students have blocked the entrances of universities in recent weeks, and they have demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Higher Education. On Twitter, some have posted using the hashtag #LaPrécaritéTue, or “Precariousness kills.”  Such an outpouring of anger over economic uncertainty among students may seem out of place in France. The price of higher education, even at some of the country’s best colleges, is nowhere near comparable to that in the United States, where the average yearly costs for both public and private four-year universities are in the five-figure range.  In France, a bachelor’s program at a public university costs 170 euros, or about $187, a year. Many of the “Grandes Écoles,” the elite universities in France, charge students based on their parents’ income.  Students can receive money from the state to subsidize their living expenses. In 2017, 39 percent of students qualified for financial assistance. Yet many French students still struggle to get by.  One in five French students lived below the poverty line in 2017, according to a report by the National Union of Students of France. Almost half worked during the school year to finance their studies.  For the past 10 years, the cost of living for students in France has increased, further compounding their financial instability. And for some students, that insecurity continues after they finish their studies.  In his Facebook post, Anas K. expressed anxiety about his future, wondering whether he would be able to find work at a time of “mass unemployment” in a country where, despite recent improvements, 20.77 percent of young people were unemployed in 2018.  Anas K. was repeating his second year at university for the third time, and his academic troubles had resulted in the rescinding of his scholarship at University Lumière Lyon 2. In the post, which has since been taken down, Anas K. explicitly attributed his suicide attempt to the financial insecurity he faced as a student, writing that his “last wish is that my peers continue to fight so we can be finished with this, once and for all.” At first, the government was slow to respond to the episode, which received widespread media attention in France, and was initially dismissive of students’ concerns, denouncing “the political instrumentalization” of the event.  Amélie de Montchalin, the secretary of European affairs, said she found it “dangerous” that activist associations were “using the situation.” The student protests have now become yet another obstacle for the government of President Emmanuel Macron to navigate in an increasingly tumultuous political landscape.  Though Mr. Macron’s government is still vowing to change France, a proliferation of protests on a number of fronts is threatening to upend his agenda.  This month alone, hospital workers protested poor working conditions, and 28,000 Yellow Vest protesters turned out to mark the one-year anniversary of their movement. Tens of thousands marched in Paris and across France to protest high rates of domestic violence in the country, where more than 100 women have been killed so far this year by a partner or former partner. And protests against Mr. Macron’s proposed retirement overhaul are scheduled for Dec. 5.  As a result, and as student anger remains unabated, the government has begun to tread more carefully. Frédérique Vidal, the French minister of education, met with student associations in recent days, promising to create a help line for students by the end of the year.  To the protesters’ dismay, however, she did not increase the budget for student financial assistance, saying the current budget of €5.7 billion was underutilized.  Instead, the government promised measures to make students more aware of existing financial resources. In a radio interview, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said that many students did not take advantage of existing systems, “either because it is too complicated or because they do not know these arrangements exist.” ‘‘We’re trying to improve our communication,” he said. Now, Mr. Macron himself has weighed in.  “Such acts are always unfathomable and inexplicable,’’ he said of Anas K.’s action. “His suffering reminds us, though it does not make us discover, the difficulties of student life.” He also reminded students of the things he had already done for them, like decreasing the cost of a driver’s license and simplifying the scholarship system.  “Right now, our country is too negative about itself,” he said. But many students have found the government response unsatisfying. “We are living in a time of economic uncertainty, we are constantly passing reforms that make work and retirement more precarious,” said Sophie Lapoix, 25, a friend of Anas K. and a member of his student union.  “We don’t know if all the hardship and hard work we put into our studies will be rewarded, because we know more and more people who have several diplomas and master’s that find themselves without work,” she added. “On top of that, there is uncertainty about the climate.” Such financial stresses contribute to the fact that students are more likely to have “suicidal ideas” than the general French population, according to data from the French Observatory of Student Life. “The feeling of being in great financial danger is associated with higher levels of depression,” said Yannick Morvan, a clinical psychologist and a member of the group.  Dr. Morvan said that in Anas K.’s case, “talking about the psychological aspects of this could be seen as diminishing the political message of this act.” In France, protesting is seen as a rite of passage, and citizens expect the state to provide a level of financial security that would be unimaginable in an American context. While French students may be relatively well-off when compared with the United States, Ms. Lapoix, the student, said she did not think “it should be a race to the bottom.” “I understand that from an American perspective, we are privileged,” said Ms. Lapoix. “We know we have ambitious political ideas, but we believe the right to education is a fundamental one that must be available to everyone.” Still, the students have not persuaded everyone of their distress, and some consider their demands overblown. “I do not think financial insecurity or poverty is a massive phenomenon among students,” said Olivier Galland, a French sociologist and a director at the French National Center for Scientific Research.  He pointed out that most students were supported by their parents or by the state. But that does not mean that Mr. Macron’s government could risk ignoring their complaints, either. “I think governments, no matter who they are, are always scared of young people,” Dr. Galland said. “Young people are unpredictable.”']","Since a 22-year-old’s desperate act in Lyon this month, other French students have joined protests against their financial insecurity.

The Broken Promise of a Panda: How Prague’s Relations With Beijing Soured,2019-11-23,By Marc Santora,"['PRAGUE — On the top floor of an opulent Art Deco building in the heart of old Prague, the new lord mayor was standing with a glass of sparkling wine in hand, greeting diplomats as they made their way into his official residence for a New Year’s gathering. But when the Chinese ambassador reached Mayor Zdenek Hrib, the diplomat was not in a celebratory mood. “He demanded that I kick out the representative of Taiwan,’’ Mr. Hrib recalled of the confrontation last January. “I said, ‘We do not kick out our guests.’” As the line of people backed up, with other ambassadors urging the Chinese representative to move on, he grew more and more incensed until, finally, he stormed out. For Mr. Hrib, who had been elected just two months earlier, it was the first skirmish in a diplomatic spat that would culminate with Beijing and Prague severing ties as “sister cities” and that today threatens lasting damage to relations between the Czech Republic and China. At the root of the fight was the mayor’s refusal to line up behind Beijing’s “One China” policy, which insists that Taiwan is a part of China despite having its own democratically elected government. But more broadly, the disagreement has illuminated the ways China uses its economic clout as it tries to get its way diplomatically and looks to secure a foothold in the European marketplace. The Czech Republic is one of the smaller nations that Beijing has most aggressively courted.  The high point came in 2016, when China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was welcomed for a state visit by the populist President Milos Zeman, who had declared that his country would be China’s “gateway to Europe.” Before the visit, the local government in Prague had signed a sister-city agreement with Beijing that included a commitment to the “One China” policy — language not usually found in sister-city agreements that Beijing has with other municipalities around the world.  For the Czech Republic, closer ties with China came with promises of increased trade, investment and business deals. For Prague, the deal held the promise of more tourism, cultural exchanges and even a much-coveted panda for the city’s zoo. Three years later, much of the investment has not materialized, there is greater concern about Chinese espionage than excitement about trade deals and there is no panda at the Prague Zoo. “The honeymoon is over,” said Filip Jirous, an analyst at Sinopsis, a research group focused on China based at Charles University in Prague. “This is the sobering-up period.” And Mr. Hrib is part of the hangover. A 38-year-old doctor, he became mayor running with the anti-establishment Pirate Party, which has become the third-largest force in the Czech Parliament in less than a decade. The party has steadily gained power in part by challenging the eastward-looking foreign policy of Mr. Zeman and the transactional approach of Prime Minister Andrej Babis. When he took office last November, Mr. Hrib promised to examine the wording of the city’s agreement with Beijing. “Some people say that we should not be involved in foreign affairs,” Mr. Hrib said. “But what we have done is get rid of this ‘One China’ declaration, which dragged Prague into foreign affairs.” He said he had initially wanted to keep the agreement and just amend it by taking out the “One China” commitment.  But unlike the previous mayor, he was not willing to bend to what he thought unreasonable demands of the Chinese, and he invited a Taiwan representative to the New Year’s reception.  In March, Mr. Hrib traveled to Taiwan, where he had spent two months as a student, a visit that caused more ripples. By the summer, with the mayor making it clear that he was going to bring the language in the agreement to a vote in the City Council, the issue blew up. Chinese officials issued threats and began taking actions against institutions tied to the city.  One was the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, which had spent more than two years preparing a 14-city autumn tour of China.  If the orchestra wanted the show to go on, Chinese officials suggested, it should sign a document rejecting the mayor’s actions. The group refused. The trip was canceled. “The cancellation of the tour meant for the orchestra an economic loss of several million Czech crowns,” the orchestra’s director, Radim Otepka, said in a statement. “However, we consider as much more damaging the fact that culture has been subject to political pressure.” Mr. Hrib said the overt pressure by China reminded many Czechs of the ways their former Communist rulers operated. The tensions have also strayed into more consequential arenas. In December, the Czech government’s cybersecurity agency issued a directive warning that the Chinese tech giant Huawei represented a potential national security threat. It recommended blocking Huawei from building the infrastructure of the fifth generation of wireless technology, known as 5G, in key sectors. Huawei threatened legal and financial retaliation, and Mr. Zeman has accused the Czech intelligence services of “dirty tricks.” More recently, there have been concerns that China was trying to use its influence at academic institutions. The company that has profited the most from close ties to China is a privately held financial and investment firm, PPF Group. Its founder, Petr Kellner, is the Czech Republic’s richest man. The firm’s Home Credit division issued loans worth more than $15 billion to Chinese consumers this year alone, according to public records. This fall Home Credit announced that it wanted to sponsor a program at Charles University, the oldest institution of higher education in Central Europe. The contract included language that neither party would do anything to hurt the reputation of the other. Home Credit said that it did not insist on the clause and that it had no intention of stifling academic freedom; such language had been included in contracts the university had with other sponsors. But given Home Credit’s substantial business in China, students and professors recoiled, fearing that it could be used to censor discussion critical of China, and faculty members threatened to quit. The plan was scrapped, and the school’s rector issued a public apology. The Czech president, Mr. Zeman, has sought to limit the damage. He wrote a personal letter to Mr. Xi emphasizing “that the Czech Republic, its government, fully respects the policy of one China,” according to a summary provided by his office. Chinese officials, for their part, have threatened to limit the number of tourists coming to the country — a prospect that does not have many people in the clogged historical center of the city concerned. After sanctions were placed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Chinese quickly supplanted them as the biggest spenders on Prague’s version of Fifth Avenue, Parizska Street, which is lined with stores like Prada, Tiffany & Company, and Hermès. It is not the threat of fewer tourists that concerns officials, but rather, creating sustainable tourism that truly benefits local businesses. “We are not exactly trying to get more people into Prague,” Barbora Hruba, a spokeswoman for the Prague tourism office, said.  At the zoo, where officials had unveiled a $9 million plan to create a panda pavilion on top of a hill overlooking the city, two polar bears were still swimming, and officials have turned their sights on a different animal. “When I was little, I had this book with very nice black-and-white photos,” Mayor Hrib said. It illustrated a walk through the Prague Zoo. “And the coolest animal there was the pangolin,” he said. The creatures, which look like scaly anteaters, are the most trafficked nonhuman animals in the world. Taiwan has played a key role in saving them from extinction and is now home to what is probably the largest population of the creatures in captivity. Mr. Hrib has spoken to the mayor of Taipei and is hopeful that where panda diplomacy failed, the promise of the pangolin will become reality. Magdalena Sodomkova contributed reporting.']","When a new mayor of the Czech capital refused to toe the line on Taiwan, Beijing severed its sister-city relationship. Broader repercussions followed. "
"3 Afghan Schools, 165 Accounts of Students Being Raped",2019-11-25,By David Zucchino and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The 14-year-old Afghan boy said his teacher had asked him for “a little favor” in return for not failing him on his final exams. Then the man took him to the school library, locked the door and raped him, the boy said.  At the same school, a 17-year-old boy reported similar treatment from the school’s principal. He said the man had threatened to kill him if he told anyone. But the boys did talk, giving their accounts to a child advocacy group in their province and repeating them later in interviews with The New York Times. The advocacy group discovered that those two boys were not the only victims. From just three schools in one area of Logar Province, south of the Afghan capital, the group said it had taken statements from 165 boys who said they had been sexually abused at their schools, or by local officials they went to for help.  Now, Afghanistan is again caught up in discussion of rampant sexual abuse of children, and of a deep reluctance by many officials to deal with the issue at all. After talking with the TOLO news channel about the investigation, the leader of the Logar advocacy group, Mohammad Musa, and a colleague, Ehsanullah Hamidi, were detained by Afghanistan’s national intelligence agency late last week, the group says. On Monday, former President Hamid Karzai said that if verified, the detention of Mr. Musa by the intelligence agency was “a very wrong thing.” A spokesman for the National Directorate of Security declined to comment Monday. Mr. Musa has not been reachable for comment since late Thursday.  Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state, said on Twitter that the United States was closely following the case and was “greatly concerned.” He called on the Afghan government “to take action to protect survivors and bring perpetrators to justice.” It is unclear whether the cases at the three schools are related. But the prevalence of systematic sexual abuse of boys in Afghanistan has been a problem for generations.  Bacha bazi — it means boy play — is common among men in powerful positions who keep boys as sex slaves. Bacha bazi boys are forced to dress as girls and to dance for men before being raped. Sometimes the boys are prostituted to the highest bidder. In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Musa said that his group — the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution — began intensively investigating after a troubling Facebook post in May that showed men with boys in sexual positions. One video provided by the group shows a teenage boy dancing barefoot for about two dozen men who stand or sit in a circle around him. The post came down quickly, Mr. Musa said, but the group was able to preserve many of the images. Some of the boys were recognizable, and had complained of sexual abuse before, he said.  The Logar group began methodically talking to students in the area, finding dozens who said they had been raped. Many of their accounts were confirmed by teachers or other people in the area, who along with four of the boys were also interviewed by The Times.  As the accounts unfolded, at least seven boys who said they had been raped were found dead, Mr. Musa said, most likely at the hands of their own families.  Mr. Musa said that the advocacy group took the boys’ statements to Logar provincial police, but that no action was taken. He said several boys who had agreed to be questioned by the police were subsequently raped by officers. Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar provincial police, said the accusations were false. “Nobody has come to the police for rape cases,” he said. “It’s just rumors.” The Logar provincial governor, Mohammad Anwar Ashaqzai, said officials were examining boys’ statements provided by the advocacy group. He said he was not aware of any rapes in the province’s schools. “If we find these documents are incomplete and they are fake, then those who are involved will face the law and should be punished,” Mr. Ashaqzai said. Still, in response to the group’s accusations, the Ministry of Education in Kabul said on Nov. 14 that it was sending a delegation to the province to investigate. In Logar, Shafiullah Afghanzai, the executive officer of Hamid Karzai high school, where the 14-year-old and the 17-year-old said they had been raped, told The Times that the school’s headmaster had been transferred to another district earlier this year after he was accused of sexually assaulting a boy.  Mr. Afghanzai said boys had also been raped by teachers at two other schools in the province. He said three boys who had reported rapes were later killed by the Taliban, who condemn the sexual abuse as anti-Islamic. “If they get evidence that teachers were involved, they will hang them,” Mr. Afghanzai said of the militants. A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Hassibullah Stanikzai, the head of the Logar provincial council, said the bodies of several boys had been found in areas of Logar under Taliban control. But he said there was no evidence that their deaths were related to sexual assault. A teacher at one school in Logar, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Hamid, said he had spoken to 13 boys who said they had been raped by teachers there. He said the families of three of those boys had moved away to avoid the social stigma of rape, especially after images were posted on Facebook. “It’s a crisis,” Hamid said. “We want to do something to stop this mafia, but we don’t know what to do.” Mr. Musa, of the advocacy group, said 25 families abandoned their homes in shame after their sons said they had been raped. In some cases, he said, the boys’ faces had been visible in images on the anonymous Facebook page before it was taken down. In several cases, boys had been banished from home by their fathers, Mr. Musa said. “We don’t trust anyone, neither the Taliban nor the government,” Mr. Musa said. One school is in an area contested by the Taliban, and two are in government-controlled areas. Wakil Kaliwal, the head of the education department in Logar, said there were perhaps one or two cases of student rape in the province’s schools but no epidemic of sexual assault. He said the principal at Hamid Karzai high school had been transferred for beating a boy but also had been accused of raping another boy. Mr. Kaliwal added, referring to sexual assaults of boys: “It is an issue across the country and Logar isn’t exceptional.” Mohammad Qasim Sediqqi, a member of the Logar provincial council, said there was no evidence of widespread rape in schools. “Maybe there are one or two cases, because this is Afghanistan and crime exists everywhere,” he said. President Ashraf Ghani, who is from Logar, promised in 2015 to crack down on bacha bazi. But pederasty is still widely tolerated in Afghan culture, and prosecutions of men who sexually assault boys are rare. An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by the Afghan security forces or others in power, and that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a first sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. That article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction on the military’s reticence to confront the abuse.  Afghanistan made bacha bazi and related offenses violations of the national criminal code in May 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up to three years in prison — three to five years if the dancing is “a public event.” If a teacher, instructor or “superior in any way is involved,” the penalty is five years in prison.  But Charu Lata Hogg, executive director of All Survivors Project, a human rights group based in Liechtenstein, said the group interviewed 24 male rape victims in four Afghan provinces, not including Logar. “We found that sexual violence against boys and young men is pervasive and happens within communities, police checkpoints and in detention settings,” Ms. Hogg said. She said her group welcomed the 2017 laws, but she added that the authorities must “apply the law and hold perpetrators to account.” In a 2018 report, the United Nations documented 78 cases of sexual assault against boys in Afghanistan, adding, “Impunity for perpetrators remains a serious challenge.” Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, called on the authorities to investigate the Logar allegations and prosecute anyone involved. She asked government officials to protect members of the advocacy group and refrain from “the language of fear and intimidation.” Amnesty International warned that the two detained rights activists were at risk of torture “and other ill-treatment” as long as they remained in custody. Lyla Lynn Schwartz, who counsels victims of trauma in Afghanistan, including rape, said Afghan boys raped by men often suffer extreme emotional and psychological distress, often for the rest of their lives. The victims are often ostracized, or even attacked, by their family members over a perceived dishonor.  The 17-year-old from Hamid Karzai high school said in an interview that he was left homeless after his father banished him. He said he no longer attends school. “My father says if he sees me again,” he said, “he will kill me.”  Reporting was contributed by Farooq Jan Mangal from Khost, Afghanistan, and by a New York Times journalist from Logar Province.']","An advocacy group says it has documented systematic sexual abuse  by teachers, principals and other authorities of dozens of boys in one rural area."
Mike Pence Makes Unannounced Visit to Iraq,2019-11-23,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Vice President Mike Pence made an unexpected visit to Iraq on Saturday, arriving as protests aimed at toppling the Iraqi leadership and changing the political system continued to roil the country.  Mr. Pence made two stops: He landed with the permission of the Iraqi government at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq’s western desert, where many of the American troops are billeted while they train and assist the Iraqi forces fighting the remains of the Islamic State. He then flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.  Mr. Pence received a classified briefing at the air base, from which American Special Forces had launched the operation in Syria last month that led to the death of the Islamic State leader,  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He then spoke by phone with Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mehdi but did not meet with him, according to the Mr. Mehdi’s office.  In a statement, his office said the two men “discussed the latest developments in Iraq and the Iraqi government efforts at reform in response to the demonstrators’ demands.” Mr. Pence told reporters that Mr. Mehdi promised “that they would work to protect and respect peaceful protesters as part of the democratic process.” In Erbil, Mr. Pence met with two powerful Kurdish politicians who are cousins: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and Masrour Barzani, the prime minister.   Mr. Pence denied that there was any tension with Iraqi or Syrian Kurds over Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision in October to withdraw American forces from northeast Syria, where Syrian Kurdish forces had been fighting the Islamic State alongside the Americans.   “I don’t think there was any confusion now among the leadership here in the Kurdish region of President Trump’s commitment to our allies here in Iraq as well as those in the Syrian Defense Forces, the Kurdish forces who fought alongside us. It’s unchanging,” Mr. Pence said.  The sudden departure of the American troops in October left Syrian Kurdish civilians and forces vulnerable to Turkish forces who entered their territory, taking ground and killing nearly 100 civilians and displacing 200,000, according to the United Nations.    Mr. Pence’s trip came 11 months after President Trump made a similar, unannounced visit to Al Asad, just days after announcing that he was pulling American troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The change in policy caused a major shake-up in the White House defense and foreign policy team. Mr. Trump’s plans to meet with Mr. Mehdi were canceled.  The timing of the trip by Mr. Pence — the second-most-senior member of the American government — was significant. It underscored the United States’ continued engagement in Iraq and was an implicit riposte to Iran, which has often tried to present itself to Iraqi leaders as a more consistent partner than the Americans.  Iran has dispatched Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the leader of its Quds Force, the most elite arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, on multiple occasions to address difficult political situations. He was in Baghdad recently to help the Iraqis plot a response to the protests. Later Saturday, Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, served Thanksgiving lunch to about 150 troops, and the vice president delivered remarks to about 200 personnel. The United States has about 6,000 troops in Iraq.  Speaking at Erbil Air Base, Mr. Pence praised the efforts of American troops and their allies in defeating the Islamic State but did not mention the Iraqi military by name, though thousands of its personnel gave their lives. Mr. Pence also made no distinction between the Kurds in Syria who fought long, grueling battles against the Islamic State over the past two years, and those he was visiting in Iraqi Kurdistan, who also played a role but were not involved in the same level of combat.  “The American people will also never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of the brave Kurdish fighters who stood shoulder to shoulder with us in the fight against ISIS,” he said. The visit occurred as Iraqi government leaders have struggled to deal with street protests, which have galvanized many in the south of the country as well as in the capital, Baghdad.  On Saturday, Iraqi officials said one person had been shot dead and dozens of others wounded as protests continued in the capital. Iran, which sees the uprising in Iraq as a threat that  has encouraged a similar if more limited movement at home, has advocated a tough response. The United States has lobbied against that approach, encouraging Iraq to work with the nonviolent protesters, but has taken the same view as Iran toward the prime minister.  Both countries’ leadership believe that he should remain in power for the moment, because if he were swept away — as some protesters want — it could lead to a chaotic situation in which bloodshed or even a renewed civil war could occur.  Unlike Iran, the United States wants to see reforms made in the Iraqi system to root out corruption and create an electoral system that is less dominated by sectarian apolitical parties that tend to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people.  Less than 24 hours before Mr. Pence’s arrival, a rocket was fired at Green Zone, the location of the United States Embassy. ']",The vice president’s trip signaled the United States’ continuing engagement in the country and came 11 months after President Trump made his own surprise visit to Iraq. 
New Suspect Charged in Trafficking After Truck Deaths in Britain,2019-11-24,By Yonette Joseph,"['LONDON — The police in Essex, England, have charged another man with human trafficking in the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people whose bodies were found in the refrigerated trailer of a truck in October. The man, Christopher Kennedy, 23, of County Armagh, Northern Ireland, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. He was detained in connection with the investigation into the grisly discovery in Grays, England, on Oct. 23, the Essex Police said Sunday in a statement. Mr. Kennedy is expected to appear in Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court in Essex on Monday on charges including “conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of U.K. immigration law,” the statement said. The driver of the truck, Maurice Robinson, 25, also of Northern Ireland, was charged in October with manslaughter, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering in connection with the deaths, which the police said were the tragic outcome of an international trafficking operation. Another truck driver from Northern Ireland, Eamonn Harrison, 22, has also been charged in Ireland in the case. He faces counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses but last week challenged attempts to extradite him to Britain. Separately on Thursday, officials in Ireland began an investigation after 16 migrants were found in a sealed truck container on an overnight ferry traveling from France to Ireland. Some sought asylum. On Sunday, the police said, nine of the men in the group were missing, according to local news reports.  Days before, eight people, including four children, who said they were from Afghanistan were discovered in a refrigerated truck headed to Britain from the port city of Calais, France, local news outlets reported. They were taken to the hospital with signs of hypothermia. Also this month, 31 Pakistanis were found in a truck in southern France near the border with Italy, French prosecutors said. In the Essex case, after initially identifying the victims as Chinese, the police said this month that they were all from Vietnam and released all 39 names. The victims had set out from Vietnam seeking better lives in Europe and were transported in a trailer from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to the industrial park in Grays. Grieving families in Vietnam told reporters that they had been struggling to repatriate the bodies for burial, and that neither the British nor the Vietnamese government would pay the costs.  Bui Huy Cuong, deputy chairman of a district people’s committee in Ha Tinh Province, where many of the victims were from, told news outlets that the Vietnamese government was willing to grant loans to the families to return the remains but that the they would have to repay the debt. Pham Van Thin, the father of one victim, Pham Thi Tra My, told the British newspaper The Guardian of the choices that Vietnamese officials had given him. “They gave me a document saying the two governments will not pay for repatriation,” he was quoted as saying. “They offered two options: receiving ashes or the body.” He said he would have to pay about $1,750 to return his daughter’s ashes, or about $2,800 for her body. A GoFundMe page to help pay to repatriate the victims’ bodies had raised more than $25,000 by Sunday.']",Christopher Kennedy of Northern Ireland stands accused a month after the bodies of 39 Vietnamese were found in a refrigerated trailer in southern England.
"Amid Death and Debris From Earthquake, Albania Clings to Hope",2019-11-27,By Marc Santora and Elian Peltier,"['DURRES, Albania — The first tremors hit Monday night, just as the nine members of the Lala family were getting ready for bed. A few hours later, the ground shook again, waking neighbors but doing little damage. Then, shortly before 4 a.m., the big one hit. In 30 seconds of unstoppable violence, the earth’s crust shifted and the Lalas’ four-story concrete home collapsed on itself like a pancake. By the end of the next day, the rubble had produced just a single survivor, a 17-year-old boy. For the rescued teenager, mere feet had made the difference between life and death, a story replicated through a region of Albania devastated by the biggest earthquake to hit the country in decades. At least 31 people have been reported dead. At the remains of the Lala house on Wednesday, Italian search teams with rescue dogs sifted through the rubble, finding the bodies of four other family members, including two children. The fate of the remaining four occupants remained unknown. The drama, much of it playing out on live television, struck a chord in a nation still reeling from the quake and desperate for hope. The country’s prime minister, Edi Rama, seemed to touch on that during a visit to a hospital in Tirana, the capital, where victims were being treated. “We have lost human lives,” he told reporters. “We have also saved a lot of lives.” With whole sections of towns reduced to rubble and emergency workers arriving from around Europe to provide assistance, Albanians were still trying to grasp the scale of the devastation. Apart from the dead, hundreds were injured and thousands were left homeless by the 6.4-magnitude quake. In small villages not yet reached by emergency crews, residents issued desperate pleas for water and other supplies. Even as some 300 aftershocks rattled already-damaged buildings — and survivors’ nerves — police officers, soldiers, firefighters and residents turned to whatever tools were at hand to reach people still trapped under debris. The coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane were among the hardest hit by the quake. Some buildings broke apart or collapsed entirely. Others were damaged badly enough that people were wary of staying in them. Even some whose houses seemed intact stayed outdoors.  “We were afraid to go home and that there would be another big earthquake,” said Burim Ajdini, 29. “Tonight I’m not going to sleep at home.” The government sought to reassure people whose homes were destroyed or uninhabitable that it would find them accommodations. All of them will have temporary shelter soon, and new homes next year, the prime minister said. But on Wednesday, at least, many Albanians woke up in tents, cars and a soccer stadium.  “Thousands of families spent last night out under the sky, and we can’t let them pass the winter in tents,” Mr. Rama said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure that all of them spend Christmas with a roof.” It was an ambitious promise for one of the poorest countries in Europe, one still struggling to fathom the extent of the destruction. Mr. Rama renewed calls to European Union members and Middle East nations to provide assistance. “It’s too big of a disaster and a challenge to deal with for our little country and our limited resources,” he said. The Albanian government has begun an online donation page to help with relocation and reconstruction for hundreds — possibly thousands — of families. Destructive earthquakes are fairly common in the Balkan region, near where two of the earth’s major tectonic plates, the Eurasian and African meet. That instability was underscored by a 5.4-magnitude quake that struck Bosnia and Herzegovina just hours after the tremor in Albania, and a 6.0-magnitude quake that rattled the island of Crete, in Greece, on Wednesday. Later on Wednesday, a 5.3-magnitude aftershock in Albania sent people running out of their homes and offices. The quake on Tuesday, centered near Durres, on the Adriatic coast, came just two months after a temblor in the same area injured dozens and damaged hundreds of homes. “The first earthquake was terrible, but now we realize how small this was compared to this one,” Mr. Rama said. Durres, the country’s second-largest city, is home to more than 175,000 people, and lies close to where the quake and a swarm of aftershocks were centered. Residents whose homes were destroyed or damaged spent the night outside, covered in blankets and sitting on mattresses, as workers from the Red Cross distributed food and army officers set up white tents in the city’s stadium.  There was no way to know how many people might still be buried in the rubble. By late afternoon, firefighters and emergency search teams had pulled 49 survivors from under the debris, sometimes in harrowing hourslong rescue missions.  Italian rescue workers on the scene said they would continue to dig because people have been found alive, against all odds, after much longer periods trapped in earthquake wreckage. Xhuliano Palku, the manager of the seven-story hotel Vila Palma in Durres, said that for 20 hours on Tuesday, he had participated in a risky operation to rescue a young man who had been sleeping on the third floor when the building collapsed.  The man, the hotel owner’s son, was taken to a hospital after being pulled from the rubble. The three-star Vila Palma was one of the many buildings in the city to fall, and among the four people who had been sleeping there, Mr. Palku said, one was found dead. “It was a mess, it was a total mess,” he said. But Mr. Palku, too, saw reason for hope. “When I see the hotel, I think it’s a miracle,” he said. “I didn’t think someone could survive in that catastrophic scene.” Countries including Italy, Montenegro and Serbia responded to Albania’s call for assistance. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, visited Durres as 40 Greek emergency workers and a sniffer dog joined the search and rescue effort, according to news reports. “We too have been through this,” Mr. Dendias told reporters on Tuesday, “and we are standing by the Albanian people and its government.” As a cold rain began to fall late in the day, the hundreds of people who had taken shelter in a hastily erected tent camp outside the Niko Dovana stadium in downtown Durres got word Wednesday that they were on the move again.  Soldiers made their way through the encampment, encouraging people to leave while Beldi Klosi, the minister of tourism and environment, announced that the camp would soon close. Buses were waiting to take the displaced residents to hotels and other shelters. But not everyone wanted to go, fearing that the buildings might be compromised. A 35-year-old man named Dashimir said he and his family had fled a seventh-floor apartment during the quake and were not ready to be indoors. “We do not want to go to a hotel,” he said. “The hotels are near the coast, and another quake could go off anytime.” As volunteers brought blankets and food to families debating what to do next, the buses slowly started to fill up and the tents began to be folded and cleared away.']",The death toll rose to 31 a day after the Balkan country was struck by one of the strongest tremors there in decades.
"Julian Assange ‘Could Die’ in U.K. Jail, Doctors Warn",2019-11-25,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON —\xa0The mental and physical condition of Julian Assange has so deteriorated that he could die in a British jail before his February hearing on extradition to the United States, a group of international doctors has warned. In an open letter to Britain’s home secretary, Priti Patel, more than 60 doctors called for Mr. Assange, the 48-year-old founder of WikiLeaks, to be transferred from the high-security Belmarsh prison in London to a university teaching hospital to receive an expert medical assessment. “Were such urgent assessment and treatment not to take place, we have real concerns, on the evidence currently available, that Mr. Assange could die in prison,” the letter said. “The medical situation is thereby urgent. There is no time to lose.” Their assessment is based on witness accounts from an October hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, in which Mr. Assange was described as “exhibiting the symptoms of a torture victim.” The analysis was corroborated this month by Nils Melzer, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, who wrote a report about Mr. Assange’s health, warning that his life was at risk. “What we have seen from the U.K. government is outright contempt for Mr. Assange’s rights and integrity,” Mr. Melzer wrote in the report. “Despite the medical urgency of my appeal, and the seriousness of the alleged violations, the U.K. has not undertaken any measures of investigation, prevention and redress required under international law.” The doctors’ letter describes how, over the years, Mr. Assange was threatened with arrest if he left the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to seek treatment for a series of ailments, including a cracked molar and shoulder stiffness.  In 2015, a trauma and psychosocial expert who assessed Mr. Assange’s condition at the embassy concluded that he was suffering from moderately severe depression. Mr. Assange is serving a 50-week prison sentence for jumping bail, imposed after he took refuge in Ecuador’s Embassy seven years ago. He faces espionage charges in the United States for publishing classified military and diplomatic documents. Last week, the Swedish authorities dropped a long-running investigation into a rape allegation against Mr. Assange after prosecutors concluded that too much time had elapsed since the events in question. Richard Galpin, a BBC journalist present at Mr. Assange’s court hearing in October, described the WikiLeaks founder as “frail- looking” and said Mr. Assange had struggled to remember when he was born. Doctors who carried out medical assessments on Mr. Assange last year while he was in the Ecuadorean Embassy warned that his time there was “dangerous to his physical and mental health” and a “clear infringement to his human right to health care.” The doctors who signed the open letter to Ms. Patel this week said they had done so out of a professional duty to report suspected torture. “We wish to put on record, as medical doctors, our collective serious concerns and to draw the attention of the public and the world to this grave situation,” they wrote.']",More than 60 physicians signed a letter saying that the WikiLeaks founder might not survive until February unless he receives an urgent expert medical assessment.
Japan’s Support for Gay Marriage Is Soaring. But Can It Become Law?,2019-11-27,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — Ikuo Sato stood in front of a Tokyo court in April and told the world he was gay.  To a packed room, he described the anxiety he had felt as a young man, struggling to express his sexuality in Japan’s restrictive society. If the law is changed to allow same-sex marriage, he said, perhaps “we’ll make a society where the next generation doesn’t have to feel that way.” Somewhere in the courtroom, his partner sat silently watching, hoping to go unnoticed. His family and co-workers do not know he is gay, and he hopes — at least for now — to keep it that way, fearing discrimination in his workplace. The couple’s story epitomizes the contradictions that shape the lives of gay people across Japan.  In many ways, there has been dramatic change. Lawsuits filed this year by Mr. Sato, his partner and five other couples seeking recognition of same-sex marriage are the first of their kind in Japan. Public support for same-sex marriage has surged in the last few years, making it seem suddenly within reach. Local governments are increasingly recognizing same-sex partnerships, and even Japan’s famously rigid companies have begun coming out in favor of them. Yet in other ways, the gains remain abstract. Gay people face overwhelming pressure to conform to the silent, stifling norms of a society in which many parents and workers are still uncomfortable with the idea of their own children and colleagues being gay. And the conservative politicians who run the country and extol its sometimes inflexible culture refuse to touch the issue.  “The Japanese people think we should recognize same-sex marriage,” said Taiga Ishikawa, who in July became the first openly gay man elected to the country’s Parliament. But, he said, some politicians in the governing party “still have outdated views on this,” adding that there is a mistaken belief “that same-sex relationships are a ‘hobby’ or will add to the declining birthrate.”  A recent poll reflected the dichotomy. The survey, by the advertising giant Dentsu, found that more than half of gay men and lesbians in Japan were concerned about coming out. Yet it also showed that almost 80 percent of people 60 and under now support same-sex marriage. That widespread backing, a jump of 20 or more points in just a few years, comes as Japan has caught up with patterns in other developed countries and has experienced what many describe as a “boom” in L.G.B.T. awareness.  Advocates see the groundswell in support as an opening.  Haru Ono, an illustrator and rights activist, and her partner, Asami Nishikawa, who are in their 40s and live together in a Tokyo suburb, have long thought it was unfair that they could not marry. But they kept their activism quiet, fearing that making their relationship public could expose their children — who are now grown — to bullying at school. A run-in with a hospital changed all that. When Ms. Nishikawa brought one of Ms. Ono’s children in for a procedure, the staff refused to allow her to check the boy in, saying that he needed to be accompanied by a member of his “real family.” The experience “haunted me for a long time,” Ms. Ono said. Her anxiety only grew when she learned she had breast cancer and began to fear that her partner might not be allowed to be with her as she underwent treatment. For years, Ms. Ono said, lawyers had told the couple that “the time wasn’t right” to sue the government for the right to marry. Then, suddenly, it was. In February, they joined the 12 other couples across Japan in filing lawsuits. Others have since followed. A galvanizing moment had come the previous summer. In an interview with Shincho 45, a conservative magazine, a lawmaker, Mio Sugita, dismissed gay men and lesbians as “unproductive” members of society who would not bear children. Ms. Sugita speculated that recognizing same-sex marriage could cause Japan to collapse as it faces a growing population crisis. The remarks were widely publicized, raising awareness of discrimination against gay people, said Alexander Dmitrenko, a Canadian lawyer and resident of Tokyo who has been a prominent advocate of same-sex marriage. “It was like Japan’s Stonewall,” he said, referring to the 1969 police raid and following protests that set off the gay rights movement in the United States.  When Taiwan approved Asia’s first same-sex marriage law this May, he said, it was a further prod for many Japanese, who have long prided themselves on being the leading democracy in the region. Noting the country’s L.G.B.T. “boom,” Kazuya Kawaguchi, a sociology professor at Hiroshima Shudo University, pointed to two television dramas featuring the lives of gay men — “Ossan’s Love” and “What Did You Eat Yesterday?” — that became surprise hits this summer. Four episodes of “Queer Eye” were also set in Japan. The television dramas “improved people’s impressions of gay couples,” Mr. Kawaguchi said, adding that “the way they were shot, the language, were easy to understand.” At the same time, attitudes have been changing among Japanese companies as they have embraced gay consumers and steadily increased their support for gay employees.  Still, many of them have stopped short of becoming involved in the politics of same-sex marriage. In September 2018, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan issued a position paper arguing that legalizing same-sex marriage would make the country more attractive for talent from abroad. Sixty-seven organizations have signed on to the statement, but so far only a handful have been Japanese firms, including Panasonic and the building materials manufacturer Lixil. While domestic media coverage of changing norms abroad has “contributed to a huge amount of discussion here, very few people in the Japanese corporate workplace or in family situations feel comfortable coming out,” said Laurence Bates, 63, who became one of the few openly gay directors of a major Japanese company last year when he was appointed to Panasonic’s board.  The mixed feelings are evident in statistics from the 26 localities that recognize same-sex partnerships. As of October, only 617 couples had registered their partnerships, according to Nijiiro Diversity, a nonprofit that fights discrimination against gay people in the workplace. Advocates note, however, that the process involves considerable red tape and delivers few concrete benefits.  On the national level, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has refused to deliberate a bill proposed by opposition parties that would change Japan’s civil code to recognize same-sex marriages.  The party insists that legalizing the unions would require changing the country’s Constitution: Article 24 of the document says that “marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes,” language that conservative lawmakers have interpreted as requiring the participation of one man and one woman. That argument, however, has already begun to show weaknesses. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations has rejected the position, and in September, a local court became the first in Japan to recognize two people of the same sex as being in a common-law marriage. In the ruling, in which a woman whose female partner had an affair was awarded damages, the judge said that Article 24’s wording did not prohibit unions between same-sex partners. The lawyers fighting on behalf of Mr. Sato, Ms. Ono and the other couples hope that their lawsuits will make it even harder for the government to continue making its claim. It could be several years, though, before the courts issue a judgment, said Makiko Terahara, the lead lawyer on the case and a director of Marriage for All Japan, a nonprofit organization.  “It’s an important tool, but of course it’s better if the Diet were to make same-sex marriage a reality by changing civil law first,” she said, referring to the national Parliament. For the couples, a change in the law cannot come soon enough. “The No. 1 reason I thought I had to participate in this lawsuit was that I wanted to show my children that it’s O.K. that we’re a family,” Ms. Ono said. “When we’re at home, we’re very naturally a family, but when we go out, there are times when we are treated as though we aren’t,” she added. Mr. Sato, who works at a nonprofit promoting H.I.V. education, does not know if he will be around to see the change. He is H.I.V.-positive and has diabetes and high blood pressure. “I hope it happens while I’m still alive,” he said.  He expects that legalization of same-sex marriage will encourage his partner to express his sexuality beyond the gay community and open up to his family and colleagues. “There would be no greater happiness,” he told the court, “than legally marrying my partner and becoming a couple in the real sense before I die.”']",The country is being pulled in two directions as it experiences a “boom” in L.G.B.T. awareness but also remains committed to a sometimes inflexible traditional culture.
"Saudi Arabia Is Stepping Up Crackdown on Dissent, Rights Groups Say",2019-11-26,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia’s long-running drive to muzzle dissent has escalated again in recent weeks with the arrests of several journalists, writers and academics who had not vocally criticized the government in years, according to two rights groups that monitor the kingdom. At least eight people have been detained since Nov. 16, the rights groups said.  Since Prince Mohammed bin Salman became Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader in 2017, the government has arrested dozens of activists, bloggers and others perceived as political opponents, showing almost zero tolerance for dissent even in the face of international condemnations of the crackdown.  Saudi Arabia is preparing for another moment in the international eye next month, when it is expected to take public its flagship state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, in what could be the largest initial public offering ever. But the recent detentions indicate that the prince appears determined to stay the course, as he did after widespread rebukes over the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, the kingdom’s military campaign in Yemen and the detentions of several women’s rights activists. Activists said the recent arrests undermined Prince Mohammed’s efforts to introduce social changes to the kingdom — or, at least, the international image boost they have given him. Along with diversifying the economy, the prince aims to open up what is still a highly traditional society by encouraging concerts and movie theaters, promoting tourism, and granting women more freedoms, such as the right to drive. “It’s very clear now that the Saudi government hasn’t learned any lessons from the international pressure,” said Yahya Assiri, the director of ALQST, one of the rights groups. “The only thing they’ve learned is that they can avoid international pressure with sports and entertainment and P.R. campaigns.”  The people arrested recently were “not activists, and they haven’t been critical for many years,” he said. “It’s just repression.” Those arrested over the past 10 days included a female journalist at the newspaper Al Watan, Maha al-Rafidi, who had supported some political prisoners with posts on Twitter, according to Prisoners of Conscience, a rights group that tracks the kingdom. Another, Fouad al-Farhan, an entrepreneur and blogger who had started a business skills training company, had been detained previously for publicly supporting democratic reforms, but he had signed a pledge to stop his activism and was not currently writing about politics, Mr. Assiri said. In a bid to make peace with the government, some of the others had even publicly come out in favor of Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 plan for transforming Saudi Arabia’s economy, Mr. Assiri said. They included the writers Abdulmajeed al-Buluwi and Badr al-Rashed. Sulaiman al-Saikhan al-Nasser, an academic who had been involved in government cultural initiatives, was also targeted, according to Prisoners of Conscience.  Mr. Assiri said that many of those arrested were friends or acquaintances who moved in the same intellectual circles. But it was unclear why some of the others were arrested, the groups said. Detainees who were swept up in previous crackdowns continue to face solitary confinement and torture in some cases, according to ALQST. They include a group of women and men who had agitated for women to be allowed to drive before Prince Mohammed lifted the ban last year, some of whom have said in court that they were tortured and sexually harassed in prison. The Saudi authorities promised an investigation into their allegations, but closed it this spring after saying they had found no evidence of torture. For all the furor over the Khashoggi killing and the questions raised over the kingdom’s human rights record, Saudi Arabia has continued to enjoy support from crucial partners. The most important of those is President Trump, who has embraced his relationship with Prince Mohammed, refusing to hold him responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s gruesome death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year, though American intelligence agencies have found that the prince most likely ordered the killing. The prince has denied doing so. And while many prominent American executives backed out of a major investment conference in Saudi Arabia that took place after Mr. Khashoggi’s murder last year, some of the same corporate titans were back at this year’s conference. Some international corporations had stopped doing business with the kingdom, but relations are once again warming.  Another test of the prince’s campaign to reform the Saudi economy will come next month, when Saudi Aramco is expected to go public in an offering that analysts have valued at as much as $1.7 trillion.  It is not yet clear whether the company will be able to attract international investors to the offering, which Prince Mohammed originally estimated at $2 trillion.']","At least eight people have been arrested this month, some of whom had not expressed criticism of the government in years, the groups said."
Bangladesh Sentences 7 to Death Over 2016 Bakery Attack,2019-11-27,By Julfikar Ali Manik and Kai Schultz,"['DHAKA, Bangladesh — Seven militants linked to the Islamic State were sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court on Wednesday for their role in planning a gruesome 2016 attack at an upscale bakery in Dhaka, one of the worst such attacks the country has suffered. The attack, which left 24 people dead and was initially claimed by the Islamic State, at the time represented one of the clearest indications that the group had made inroads in South Asia. And after their sentence was handed down on Wednesday, the convicted men vowed to carry out an even bloodier attack.  The violence took place in July 2016 in a diplomatic enclave of Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country. Militants armed with machetes, grenades and rifles stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery, sorted foreigners from Bangladeshis, and then slaughtered hostages during an 11-hour standoff with the military.  The gunmen complained to the restaurant’s staff that foreigners, with their revealing clothing and ease consuming alcohol, were a threat to Islam. Eventually, they ordered patrons to cite verses from the Quran and killed those who could not.  At one point, according to survivors, the attackers asked the restaurant’s staff to turn on the Wi-Fi network and then posted images of the carnage online.  The seven convicted men belonged to the banned militant group Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh.  Abdullah Abu, a public prosecutor on the case, said that 21 people were implicated in plotting the attack, including five militants who were killed when soldiers rushed the bakery. Eight other people were killed in subsequent security raids. Mr. Abu said the remaining men were involved in supplying arms, money and training to the attackers, who came mostly from educated, cosmopolitan backgrounds. One person was acquitted for lack of evidence. On Wednesday, the convicted men did not appear to show remorse for their actions, the prosecutor said. “The attackers’ ultimate goal was to implement their plan of jihad,” he said. “The judge said this terror attack was horrifying and had spread shock waves inside and outside the country.” Among the dead were nine Italians, seven Bangladeshis, seven Japanese, one American and one Indian.  For months after the attack, Dhaka’s diplomatic area was eerily quiet. Restaurants were empty for days, and foreigners did not leave their compounds. When the Holey Artisan Bakery reopened in 2017, visitors burst into tears and hugged staff members. The attack encouraged Islamist militants in Bangladesh, where Western intelligence officers had worried that the Islamic State and other extremist groups could find fertile ground to spread their message. Until 2016, local militants had carried out only isolated killings, mostly of religious minorities and bloggers critical of hard-line Islam.  Mohammad Delwar Hossain, a lawyer representing four of the convicted men, said they planned to appeal the sentence.  He also expressed surprise that some of the convicted men had worn caps bearing an Islamic State-like emblem to the hearing. “They were produced before the court through special security,” he said. “So this is also my question: How and from where did they get this cap?” As the men were taken back to prison in a caged police van, they screamed at journalists huddled on the roadside. Among their cries: “We are soldiers of God! We are not scared of death sentences! We are the winners! We will carry out an even bigger incident than this one.” Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.']","The militants were found guilty in violence that killed two dozen people at an upscale bakery, one of the worst such attacks in the country."
France Announces New Measures to Tackle Domestic Violence,2019-11-25,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — The French government unveiled new measures to combat domestic violence on Monday, amid growing awareness of the sometimes deadly toll it has taken on women in France. But advocacy groups said that the proposals, which seek to protect women from violent partners and to encourage them to file complaints, lacked the funding to be truly effective. Tens of thousands of people marched in Paris and other cities on Saturday to protest against gender-based violence in France, where last year 121 women were killed by current or former partners.  At the marches, participants wearing purple held up the names, pictures and ages of victims of domestic violence. A campaign of posters and graffiti around the country has also warned of an epidemic of “femicide.”  According to government figures, a woman is killed in France by a partner or former partner every three days, one of the highest rates in Western Europe.  Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said on Monday — the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women — that for too long there had been a “collective silence” on the failure to address the problem.  “This silence kills, and continues to do so,” Mr. Philippe said at a news conference in Paris to outline the new measures, which came after months of consultations among French officials, lawyers, prosecutors and associations.  Mr. Philippe said the government would increase efforts in schools to raise awareness of gender-based violence, open a round-the-clock domestic violence hotline, hire more specialized social workers in police stations, and increase treatment of violent partners to avoid repeat offenses. Every year in France, an estimated 219,000 women aged 18 to 75 are the targets of physical or sexual violence by current or former partners, but only 20 percent file official complaints, government statistics show. Mr. Philippe, noting that women were often the target of psychological as well as physical violence, said that the government would also change the law to recognize that victims of abuse can be under the psychological control of their abusers, unable to act independently.  “By putting it into the law, we are telling these women, ‘You are not the origin of what is happening, you are the victims,’” he said, adding, for instance, that the government would impose harsher penalties for partners who harass and push women to attempt suicide. Mr. Philippe said that the government would also work with doctors to ease confidentiality restrictions in cases where there is an “immediate danger” of renewed violence against the victim, enabling practitioners to flag cases to the legal authorities without a patient’s consent.  Currently, doctors can only do so when a patient is a minor or is “vulnerable,” a broad term that can refer to a disabled person, or when a person’s life is at imminent risk.  Some have balked at the idea, arguing that strict patient-doctor confidentiality is the only way women will feel comfortable coming forward with allegations of domestic violence. Gilles Lazimi, a doctor who is also a member of several women’s advocacy groups, told radio Franceinfo that the decision to report a case should rest with the victim. “You have to accompany them in the long term, respect them, explain to them what the aggressor’s strategy is, enable them to talk,” he said.  Mr. Philippe had announced emergency measures in September, including auditing police forces to ensure that women’s complaints are taken seriously and creating a universal protocol to assess the danger of a complainant’s living situation. France’s lower house of Parliament has also adopted legislation to increase the use of electronic bracelets to help judges and police officers enforce restraining orders. So far, only 1,000 such bracelets are expected to be deployed next year.  Parliament will examine other measures, including the potential for judges to suspend guardianship of children in cases of domestic violence. For those who kill their partners, such authority would be automatically stripped.  Advocacy groups have welcomed the surge in awareness of domestic violence, but on Monday they said some of the government’s measures did not go far enough.  Nous Toutes, or All of Us, one of the groups that organized the demonstrations on Saturday, said that some of the measures announced by Mr. Philippe, like training programs for teachers, already existed but lacked funding or were insufficiently applied.  “The disappointment is as high as the huge expectations that rose up these past months,” the group said in a statement. “We were expecting funding that showed a change in scale.” Caroline De Haas, a prominent activist who is part of Nous Toutes, welcomed Mr. Philippe’s strong condemnation of domestic violence but said that he had failed to back up his words. “He talks of major dysfunctions, he talks of a collective failure, but he does not draw any conclusions in terms of public policy,” Ms. De Haas said in a video statement.  At the heart of the disagreement is money. Mr. Philippe said that next year the government would spend 360 million euros, or nearly $400 million, on the fight against domestic violence. That is roughly the same amount as this year, advocacy groups say, but they were hoping for a substantial increase. “We want one billion, not one million,” was one of the rallying cries during the protests on Saturday.  A report last year from the High Council for Gender Equality, a governmental advisory body, estimated that it would take at least 500 million euros annually to effectively reduce domestic violence. ']","Advocacy groups welcomed a surge of awareness, but said the government’s proposals did not go far enough, and were not supported with nearly enough money. "
Meet 5 of Hong Kong’s Newest Politicians,2019-11-25,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s district council election saw the pro-establishment camp have one of its biggest defeats since the territory returned to Chinese control 22 years ago, as dozens of seasoned politicians were replaced with a crop of newcomers, many of whom were inspired to run by the antigovernment protests. The district councils are local advisory bodies that do not hold any lawmaking power, but the lopsided results were seen as a strong public endorsement of the continuing protest movement. Several newly elected district council members seized on the demands of the demonstrators as part of their campaign platforms, and seem eager to push their roles beyond the usual remit of neighborhood noise complaints and sanitation problems. Here’s a look at five of the most interesting new district councilors and what they have to say: Mr. Siu, 40, embraced the image of a protester in his campaign. A campaign photo features him in a yellow hard hat, goggles and a gas mask with his fingers extended to represent the demands of the protest movement, including calling for an investigation into use of force by the police, amnesty for arrested protesters and expanded democracy. Mr. Siu said he ran for the sake of his 2-year-old daughter, but had not expected to win. “I am no super man, not a social worker, not someone who speaks out for the people,” he wrote on Facebook. “But I hope that others can stand up for themselves, and I want to create a platform to give others the platform to speak up.”  Ms. Chau, 23, who works as a relationship manager at a bank in North Point, was arrested in August while live-streaming a protest, but she was never charged. She subsequently received harassing phone calls and was shoved and punched in the head while campaigning in October, one of several candidates on both sides who was assaulted during the campaign.  She condemned the authorities for failing to respond adequately to the violence surrounding the campaign. “We are innocent people who’ve been attacked,” she said. Ms. Chau defeated Hui Ching On, 53, a financial consultant who had held the seat since 1999. HK01, a Hong Kong news outlet, reported that during the previous four years, Mr. Hui had only spoken for 80 seconds during district council meetings. Mr. Sham, 32, was another candidate who was assaulted during the campaign. He was attacked by a group of men with hammers last month and continues to use crutches to walk.  As a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group of pro-democracy organizations, Mr. Sham helped organize several large, peaceful marches this summer. He was attacked previously, in August, on a day when the police announced they were banning plans for another march. Ray Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker who is gay, celebrated the victory of Mr. Sham, who is also gay, on a day that several establishment politicians who had opposed same-sex marriage and made homophobic comments had lost their district council races. Mr. Sham said that his own victory in the district race reflected a broader yearning for civic freedoms. “We are trying to listen to the demands of the people and to fight for their rights,” he said. Public criticism of the police and the officers’ use of force have been animating issues of the protest movement. Few embodied the issue more than Ms. Yau, 36, who formerly served as a police officer but quit this year after more than a decade on the force. “This year, I have decided to take off my uniform and gear, and stand together with Hong Kongers,” she said in announcing her campaign. Ms. Yau defeated Yolanda Ng, who had held the seat since 2007 and ran uncontested four years ago.  “The Hong Kong police force has become a political tool,” Ms. Yau wrote last week, adding that “police brutality and indiscriminate arrests have clearly illustrated the inseparable relationship between politics and society.” With his handwritten candidate introduction, Mr. Chan, a 27-year-old student, showed he was a political novice with no powerful backing. But despite his inexperience, he defeated Chris Ip, 39, a prominent figure in the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest pro-Beijing party.  Mr. Ip, who was the chairman of the Yau Tsim Mong district council, became a target of protesters in July after he blocked debate on the extradition bill that incited the protests this summer.

Albania’s Earthquake: What We Know so Far,2019-11-26,By Marc Santora,"['A powerful earthquake in Albania on Tuesday toppled hundreds of buildings, trapping scores of people in the rubble and leaving at least 22 people dead.  The epicenter of the 6.4 magnitude quake was just 19 miles from the capital, Tirana, where rescue workers continued to search for survivors as night fell. George-Ilias Belidis, a resident of Tirana, a city of 900,000, was sleeping in his apartment when the powerful, seemingly interminable tremor jolted him awake. He experienced the quake “in all its rage” — and thought his end had come, he said. “Everything was moving in an unbelievable rhythm,” Mr. Belidis, a 24-year-old Greek citizen, said by telephone a few hours later. “I could hear the walls cracking, dishes and glass breaking.” With more than 650 people already treated at hospitals, according to state media, the authorities were bracing the public for more bad news in the days ahead. Prime Minister Edi Rama said rescuers would “continue to search patiently and thoroughly to the end.” “We have victims,” he said. “We are working to do everything possible in the affected areas.” Albania, the poorest country in Europe, issued an urgent plea for help from other nations as it deployed soldiers and emergency workers to the hardest-hit areas, and neighboring countries were sending in teams. But in some places, at least at first, citizens were on their own, and there were desperate scenes of people pulling away rubble by hand as they searched for friends and loved ones. At least 45 people were pulled out of the wreckage on Tuesday. Durres, a city on the coast, and Thumane, an inland town to the northwest, sustained some of the most extensive damage. Rescuers there were desperately trying to reach people still trapped in the rubble, according local media reports. One television station, N24, interviewed a man who said his daughter and niece were among those trapped. “I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone,” he said. “They said they are well and waiting for the rescue. Could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them.” The seven-story Vila Palma hotel also collapsed, crushing cars parked underneath, but there was no immediate word on casualties. The Balkans have a long history of deadly earthquakes, but this was the most powerful to strike the region since 1979, when a 6.9 magnitude quake killed 136 people and injured more than 1,000. The brunt of that earthquake was felt in Montenegro, a neighbor of Albania. It destroyed thousands of buildings and the authorities were forced to raze about 450 villages. In 1963, the Macedonian capital of Skopje was devastated by a 6.1 magnitude quake. More than 1,000 people were killed and 200,000 made homeless. On Tuesday, as many as 1.2 million people may have faced “strong” and “very strong” shaking, according to the United States Geological Survey. There have been numerous aftershocks, including a 5.4 magnitude quake near the city of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There were no immediate reports of damage from that quake.']","Hundreds injured, buildings toppled and many trapped in the rubble as the small Balkan nation tried to assess the damage."
U.S. Envoy Says Afghans Coerced Retraction of Rape Allegations,2019-11-26,By David Zucchino and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — In what the American ambassador to Afghanistan called “Soviet-style tactics,” the country’s intelligence agency released a video Tuesday in which a detained human rights activist retracted allegations that 165 boys had been raped by educators at three rural schools. The activist, Mohammad Musa, was quoted in a New York Times article on Monday that also quoted four boys and local school officials who said schoolboys had been raped by educators in Logar Province in central Afghanistan. The video showed Mr. Musa appearing to be speaking under duress during his fifth day in the custody of the National Directorate of Security, an agency with a reputation for treating detainees harshly. “It’s appalling to coerce confessions from civil society activists whose goal is to protect Afghan children,” John R. Bass, the American ambassador, said in a Twitter post. He said he was “deeply disturbed” by the government’s actions. President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, saying “I disagree with the approach” of the intelligence agency, ordered it to deliver Mr. Musa and a fellow detained activist to the Ministry of Interior for what he said was their own protection.  In a Twitter posting, Mr. Ghani also ordered the Ministry of Education, which had said it was investigating the allegations, to promptly send him a “thorough report.” The video, and the forceful response from the country’s top Afghan and American officials, capped a remarkable day for a country already shaken by allegations that scores of schoolboys had been sexually assaulted by their own teachers. The public rebuke of the government by Mr. Bass was a jarring break from diplomatic norms, and the upbraiding by Mr. Ghani of his own intelligence agency was equally noteworthy. Mr. Ghani was faced with the spectacle of shadowy government operatives rounding up two human rights activists without charge in a nominally democratic country supported by billions of dollars in American and Western aid and military assistance. In the Twitter posting, Mr. Ghani said he was “deeply disturbed” by the rape allegations. In photos and videos briefly posted anonymously to a Facebook page in May, some of the boys had been shown in sexual positions with men. Several boys were sexually assaulted by the police after having given statements about the school rapes, Mr. Musa told The Times. He said several others had been killed, in some cases by family members shamed by the Facebook posts or the boys’ reporting of rapes. Mr. Musa told The Times that he had taken statements from 165 boys who described being sexually assaulted by educators. In a Twitter post of support for Mr. Bass’s position,  Germany’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Peter Prügel, called the actions by the intelligence agency “just shameful and embarrassing.” On Tuesday, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan called for Afghanistan’s attorney general’s office to investigate the rape allegations. In a Twitter posting, the United Nations mission also urged the release of the two activists, who represent the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution. The rape accusations brought out in the open a deeply embedded practice by powerful male figures who keep boys as sexual slaves. The Afghan authorities are reluctant to acknowledge or discuss the rampant sexual abuse of boys, which is a crime in Afghanistan as it is around the world. But it also is a practice that dates back centuries in the country. On the video, the National Directorate of Security said Mr. Musa’s allegations were “baseless, without proof and without evidence.” The agency said the accusations had caused “public unrest” and “could even deprive our children of their education.” Looking drawn and anxious, Mr. Musa said on the video that his allegations were untrue and his investigation “incomplete.” “It was a mistake,” he said, speaking with his head down. “I apologize to the people and the government.” The other detained Logar activist, Ehsanullah Hamidi, also spoke briefly on the video. The two men were detained one week after Mr. Musa was interviewed by the Tolo news channel in Afghanistan on Nov. 14. Besides The Times, the Guardian newspaper of Britain also has reported on Mr. Musa’s allegations. A friend and a relative of Mr. Musa’s who said they had spoken with him shortly before he was detained last Thursday said he had gone to speak to officials at the American Embassy in Kabul. They said he was detained shortly after leaving the embassy, while en route to meet with the European Union’s ambassador in the capital. Amnesty International warned Monday that the two detained activists were at risk of torture “and other ill-treatment” as long as they remained in custody. On Tuesday, Amnesty released what the organization said was the final text message sent by Mr. Musa before he was detained. “ANDS is now trying to arrest me,” Mr. Musa’s message read, according to an Amnesty Twitter posting. “And accuse me for everything . . . blame me for everything.” Shaharzad Akbar, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said Tuesday she was concerned that Mr. Musa had been required to issue “a confession” and that he had not been allowed to see a lawyer. Mr. Ghani, who is from Logar Province, said the allegations of sexual assault should have been investigated by the human rights commission and the attorney general’s office. He said protecting the rights of human rights activists was the responsibility of the Interior Ministry, not the intelligence agency. The harsh treatment of the activists, whom the Interior Ministry said had not been charged with a crime, contrasted sharply with the leniency shown by Mr. Ghani’s government toward the former head of Afghanistan’s soccer federation, Karamuddin Keram. Afghan authorities issued an arrest warrant in June for Mr. Keram on criminal charges of sexually assaulting female players, but he has not been arrested. The government, and the United States military, has grappled for years with the practice of bacha bazi, or “boy play,” in which powerful militia or military commanders keep boys as sex slaves. The boys are typically forced to dress as girls and dance for men before being raped. An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by Afghan security forces and others in power, and determined that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the American military’s reluctance to confront the abuse.

Royal Jewels of ‘Immeasurable’ Value Are Stolen From a German Museum,2019-11-25,By Melissa Eddy and Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — Thieves broke into a museum in the eastern German city of Dresden early Monday and made off with three collections of jewelry from the royal house of Saxony, made of gold and precious stones, that authorities said were of immeasurable historical and cultural value.  The break-in took place in the Jewel Room, one of 10 rooms in the Royal Palace known as the Grünes Gewölbe, or Green Vault. The rooms hold a collection of 3,000 individual objects, gathered by August the Strong, an 18th-century ruler of the German state of Saxony, as well as of Poland and Lithuania. At least two thieves broke the special security glass of a display case and made off with an unknown number of objects from three sets of royal jewels comprising more than 90 individual pieces — cuff links, buttons and brooches adorned with rubies, sapphires and diamonds — the Dresden police and museum authorities said.  “I don’t have to tell you how shocked we are by the brutality of this break-in,” Marion Ackermann, general director of the consortium of museums known as the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, of which the Green Vault was a part, told reporters hours after the crime was discovered. “As you know, the historical and cultural value of this is immeasurable.” Ms. Ackermann did not assign a monetary value to the objects, but said that an examination of the display case later Monday revealed that fewer pieces were taken than previously feared.  “Many works are still in the display cases,” she told ZDF, a public broadcaster. “The thieves were not able to take everything because each work was individually attached” to the background on which they were displayed.  The objects in the Green Vault are one of the world’s most intact collections of Baroque jewels. The building was heavily damaged during World War II, but was painstakingly rebuilt after German reunification and reopened to the public in 2006. The police said they received a call at 4:59 a.m. from security guards at the museum who witnessed the robbery on a live video feed from the room in the Green Vault that housed the display case. Ms. Ackermann said that it was standard museum procedure for the guards, who are not armed, to alert the police instead of intervening personally. The first officers arrived at the museum within 10 minutes of receiving the call, but by that time, the thieves were already gone, Jörg Kubiesa, chief of Dresden police, said. The officers found a broken security gate and window into the room where the collection had been displayed. The police said they had later moved to shut down the highway around the city and alerted their colleagues in neighboring cities and countries to the hunt for the thieves, although they conceded that it would take no more than four minutes to reach the highway from the museum. At about the same time as the first call to the police, firefighters were called to an electrical fire on the nearby August Bridge, said Claudia Kuba of Drewag, the electricity supplier for Dresden. An electrical distributor for the area around the museum had to be manually shut off because of the fire, she said.  The ensuing power shutdown caused the streetlights around the museum to go out, though the building itself appeared not to have been affected, the police said, adding that officers were investigating whether the fire and power interruption were linked to the break-in. About 15 minutes after the initial alert from the museum, firefighters were called to put out a blaze in a car parked in a street across the Elbe River from the museum, said Volker Lange, chief of the Dresden criminal police. The authorities were investigating whether the car, which was unregistered, had been used by the thieves.  The stolen jewelry is far more valuable as a collection than as individual pieces, Ms. Ackermann said, and she appealed to the thieves not to break them apart or melt them down. Dirk Syndram, director of the Green Vault, said, “Nowhere else in Europe has any other collection of royal jewels been preserved in this form and quality and quantity.”  He said the museum planned to put out detailed information in the course of the day about the exact pieces that were taken, in hopes of helping to relocate them. At least one famed treasure of the palace’s permanent exhibition was not stolen. A flawless, 41-carat gem, the Dresden Green Diamond, is on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the “Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe” exhibition scheduled to start on Monday. The diamond is normally on show in its own case, one story above the ground-level floor where the stolen jewels were displayed, Mr. Syndram said. August the Strong, a prince-elector of Saxony and little-loved monarch of Poland and Lithuania, collected rare, glittering objects like the goldsmith Johann Melchior Dinglinger’s jewel-encrusted figurines “Court of the Grand Moghul of Delhi” and the “Golden Coffee Set.” In 1723, August founded the Green Vault, so named for the pale green color of its domed ceiling. It eventually came to house more than 3,000 medieval, Renaissance and early Baroque works, the biggest surviving princely art collection in Europe. “Not only have the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen been robbed, but also we Saxons!” Michael Kretschmer, the state governor, wrote on Twitter. “The history of Saxony cannot be understood without the Grünes Gewölbe. The treasures found here have been acquired by the people of our state for years.” A sign posted outside the Dresden museum and on its website said that it would be closed on Monday for “organizational reasons.” The authorities later said that they expected the museum would reopen on Wednesday.

Taiwan Detains 2 Executives of Firm Accused of Spying for China,2019-11-26,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Horton,"['BEIJING — Taiwan has detained two executives of a Hong Kong-based company accused of acting as a front for Chinese intelligence agencies working to undercut democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the official news agency there reported on Tuesday. Taiwan’s justice ministry ordered the two executives, Xiang Xin and his wife, Kung Ching, to remain in Taiwan while investigators looked into the assertions of a would-be defector in Australia that their company, China Innovation Investment Limited, acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence. The defector, Wang Liqiang, said he worked for the company and took part in — or knew of — covert intelligence operations that included buying media coverage, creating thousands of social media accounts to attack Taiwan’s governing party and funneling donations to favored candidates of the opposition party, the Kuomintang. Mr. Wang, 26, detailed his accusations in a 17-page appeal for asylum in Australia, where his wife and child had previously moved to study. While some analysts have raised doubts about Mr. Wang — who the Chinese say was convicted of fraud — two people briefed on his appeal in Australia said his claims were considered serious and reliable enough to warrant a deeper investigation. Mr. Xiang, the executive director of the company, denied even knowing Mr. Wang, and the company said that Mr. Wang was not an employee. Mr. Xiang and Ms. Kung, an alternate director, were in Taiwan when the accusations emerged last week, and were stopped at Taoyuan International Airport on Sunday and questioned by prosecutors in Taipei. The Taipei district prosecutors office is investigating Mr. Xiang and Ms. Kung under suspicion of violating Taiwan’s National Security Act. “At present, the two individuals are barred from leaving Taiwan,” a spokeswoman for the office, Chen Yu-ping, said in a phone interview. “They have both been willing to cooperate with our investigation.” If charged, they could each face up to five years in prison. The accusations against them came only weeks before Taiwan’s Jan. 11 presidential election and underscored what officials and experts have long warned: that China would attempt to interfere in the campaign. China has made no secret of its opposition to the incumbent, Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected in 2016. Her challenger from the Kuomintang is Han Kuo-yu, a populist who was elected mayor last year of the southern city of Kaohsiung. Mr. Wang alleged that the Chinese had directly supported Mr. Han’s candidacy in those elections with donations funneled through Hong Kong, an assertion denied by a political adviser to Mr. Han. The accusations have roiled politics in Taiwan, as well as in Australia, where reports about Chinese influence in the government have become a political lightning rod. Ms. Tsai, speaking to more than 10,000 supporters at a Sunday rally in Taichung, Taiwan’s second-largest city, reiterated her warnings about China, saying the Communist Party’s goal was to prevent her re-election. “China’s ability to influence Taiwan’s election will only increase, it’s not going to decrease,” she told the rally. “China will do whatever it takes to take down the presidential candidate they detest. Are you ready? Are you ready to protect democracy together and stand up to Chinese meddling?”']",The executives were detained as officials look into accusations that the company’s workers intervened in Taiwan’s looming national election campaign.
American Aid Worker for U.N. Is Killed in Afghan Capital,2019-11-25,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — An American national working for the United Nations in Afghanistan was killed and two others were wounded in a blast targeting a U.N. vehicle in Kabul on Sunday, officials said, underscoring a growing threat to aid workers. The attack led U.N. agencies in Afghanistan to impose lockdowns on Monday, while other major international organizations restricted their movements as a precaution. Officials said the U.N. also canceled flights, even though many smaller aid organizations rely on air travel to get to parts of the country not accessible by roads increasingly plagued by fighting. The latest attack further complicates humanitarian work at a time of dire need in the country and as a harsh winter looms. The U.N. estimates that about one million Afghans are “on the move,” having been either internally displaced by the intensifying conflict or because they are refugees in need of humanitarian assistance. “It is with profound sadness that the U.N. family in Afghanistan confirms the killing tonight of a colleague, as well as injuries to two others, when a U.N.-marked vehicle was attacked in Kabul,” the local U.N. mission said in a statement late on Sunday. Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, said three other civilians were also wounded in the attack. While the U.N. statement provided no details on the aid worker who died, Afghan and Western officials said it was an American citizen who was helping the United Nations Development Program manage the payroll for Afghan security forces.  The officials said the cause of the blast was likely a magnetic bomb that had been attached to the roof of the armored vehicle. Photos from the scene showed the roof having been blown apart. United Nations vehicles in the northern province of Panjshir recently came under gunfire, but no one was hurt in that case, officials said. The attack comes at a peculiar moment in the Afghan capital, as the number of large and high-profile assaults has dropped in recent weeks, with officials crediting a recent prisoner swap with the Taliban for the dip in such violence. But smaller, more targeted attacks, have been on the rise, security officials said.  Over the past month, nearly a dozen high-profile assassinations or attempted assassinations targeting political or military figures have been reported in Kabul, either by magnetic bombs attached to vehicles or assassins riding on the backs of motorcycles. One of the latest targeted killings took the life of Waheed Muzhda, a high-profile pro-Taliban analyst who was slain outside his home by men on motorbikes. The uptick has raised fears of Kabul becoming like other Afghan cities, such as the southern hub of Kandahar, where a reduction in large-scale indiscriminate assaults was only replaced by a sustained campaign of target killings.

"Sri Lankan Critics Fear a Crackdown Is Underway, and Some Flee",2019-11-27,By Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir,"['Fears of a potential crackdown on critics of the newly returned Rajapaksa political dynasty in Sri Lanka are rising just days after the election, as officials and journalists who investigated the Rajapaksas for human rights abuses and corruption began trying to flee the country, officials said. In a case that raised particular alarm, a Sri Lankan employee of the Swiss Embassy in Colombo was abducted on Monday by unidentified men and forced to hand over sensitive embassy information, Switzerland’s foreign ministry said. Officials in Colombo said the men forced her to unlock her cellphone data, which contained information about Sri Lankans who have recently sought asylum in Switzerland, and the names of Sri Lankans who aided them as they fled the country because they feared for their safety after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the presidency in elections this month.  On the same day, Mr. Rajapaksa imposed a blanket travel ban on more than 700 members of the Sri Lankan police unit that had been investigating the family. And other police officers raided a news outlet critical of the Rajapaksas and forced several journalists to hand their computers over for analysis, in what the police said was an investigation into accusations of hate speech. On Wednesday, a spokesman for President Rajapaksa at first denied the abduction of the Swiss Embassy employee, and then hours later said that “defense authorities have decided to look into those allegations to ascertain the truth.” More broadly, government officials said there was no intent to quash investigations of the Rajapaksas.  In the abduction case, the diplomatic officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the men held the embassy employee for several hours and then, before releasing her, threatened to kill her if she told anyone.  The officials said the men appeared to be focused on finding information about a Sri Lankan detective who had been investigating Mr. Rajapaksa. The detective fled to Switzerland with his family on Sunday. It was not clear whether the men were connected to Mr. Rajapaksa or were acting of their own accord as supporters of the popular leader and his political dynasty.  A spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, Pierre-Alain Eltschinger, told The New York Times, “We can confirm that a local employee of the embassy was detained against her will on the street and threatened at length by unidentified men in order to force her to disclose embassy-related information.”  “Switzerland regards this incident as a very serious and unacceptable attack,” he said, adding that the Swiss government was “demanding an immediate and complete investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.” The Rajapaksa family had held power for a decade until 2015, when they were voted out of office. Their last few years in government were marked by frequent abductions of opponents, who were often bundled away into vans by men in civilian clothing, never to be seen again.  But after a devastating terrorist attack by Islamist extremists killed hundreds of people in April, security concerns were thrust to the forefront of public consciousness, creating an opening for Mr. Rajapaksa and his family to gain in the elections.  Gotabaya Rajapaksa was defense secretary and his brother Mahinda was president during the crucial final phase of Sri Lanka’s long and deadly civil war. The Rajapaksas received wide credit within Sri Lanka for bringing the war to close. But the brutality of those years also led to a accusations against the brothers of war crimes and other abuses. Shortly after his election victory, President Rajapaksa appointed Mahinda as prime minister, keeping the country’s two most powerful political posts within the family. In a separate development that has worried Sri Lankan journalists, the police and plainclothes officers on Monday raided the offices of a news outlet, News Hub, known for its criticism of the Rajapaksa family. Several journalists said they were forced to unlock their computers for them to be examined. An associate of the News Hub website, Dhanushka Ramanayake, said in a news conference after the raid that he feared this was the beginning of a dark period for Sri Lanka. “This is a sign of emerging repression and a clear effort to instill fear,” said Mr. Ramanayake, who is also an opposition activist.  Ruwan Gunasekera, a police spokesman, said that the news outlet had been raided based on a complaint that it was propagating hate speech but that nothing incriminating was found. That raid unfolded as the police conducted a separate eight-hour interrogation of a journalist at a different news outlet who is known for his fierce criticism of the Rajapaksa family. Many diplomats had thought that Mr. Rajapaksa, who had handily won at the polls, would try to reconcile with his opponents. In a statement shortly after his victory, Mr. Rajapaksa had urged peace and unity. “We thought there would be a period of demonstrating benign intent,” said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, the executive director of the Colombo-based advocacy group, the Centre for Policy Alternatives. “But this is a situation in which anyone who stands in their way, anyone who is critical of the government or the president, will be seen as the enemy. We are in slow descent into something very frightening.”  The Rajapaksa family appears focused on unraveling several investigations into accusations of human rights abuses and corruption from their time in power. Those inquiries have gained traction in recent years. On Sunday, the president raged against the investigations of him, his family and their allies, dismissing them as politically motivated. The investigations’ “focus was to put those who fought the war, the former navy commander, intelligence officials and me in prison,” he said in a speech to Buddhist monks. “They forced officers to say my name and implicate me in investigations.” “That is not justice,” he added. “That is not the rule of law.” One case that may implicate Mr. Gotabaya had been set to begin on Wednesday, but was postponed until next month. It involves the 2010 disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, a journalist and critic of the Rajapaksas. Government investigators said that a military intelligence unit abducted and likely killed him, and an army lieutenant colonel and six others who served under President Rajapaksa’s command when he was defense secretary have been indicted. Mr. Eknaligoda’s wife, Sandya Eknaligoda, believes the trial will not go forward, and fears for her safety after a decade of accusing the Rajapaksas of abducting her husband. The infrastructure that had been built to support the investigations into the Rajapaksas and their allies has swiftly been unraveled over the last week. The Criminal Investigations Department, or C.I.D., which has been spearheading the inquiries, has been gutted, and its powers limited. The head of the C.I.D. was reassigned last week to a junior position away from the capital, Colombo, officials said. And the lead detective on many of the cases, Nishantha Silva, fled to Switzerland on Sunday. National television channels on Tuesday displayed the photos of other detectives involved in the investigations, accusing them of corruption and treason, after they were stripped of their personal security. A spokesman for the National Police Commission of Sri Lanka said they would decide in the next few weeks whether the investigations would continue. Mr. Silva was the lead detective in several investigations into Sri Lanka’s military, when President Rajapaska served as defense secretary. “Now he will not be there to give evidence at trial,” Ms. Eknaligoda said. “These vengeful actions against senior C.I.D. officials who led these investigations will cripple the entire department — they will all be afraid to act now.” On Monday, Mr. Rajapaksa ordered a blanket ban on travel out of the country for all 704 C.I.D. officials, a move seen as an attempt to prevent other police officers from fleeing. Some diplomats said Mr. Rajapaksa may be trying to take stock of the government he just took over. But, they added, they would be watching closely whether the travel ban is eventually lifted or whether the ban leads to the ranks of C.I.D. being purged. Kamal Gunaratne, Sri Lanka’s newly appointed defense secretary, said Mr. Silva had broken the rules by not seeking approval from the government before leaving to Switzerland. He denied accusations that the new government intended to derail the cases against the Rajapaksas and their associates. “We are not going against anybody or any officer of the C.I.D. We are just following the rule of law,” Mr. Gunaratne said in a telephone interview. “This is a democratic country. It is not a military rule, where dissent will be crushed.”  During the civil war, Mr. Gunaratne led a military unit that the United Nations accused of conducting summary executions of detained rebels. Mr. Gunaratne has denied the accusations.']",A Swiss Embassy employee was abducted and asked about asylum applications and investigators were banned from leaving just days after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected.
Suicides by K-Pop Stars Prompt Soul-Searching in South Korea,2019-11-25,By Choe Sang-Hun and Su-Hyun Lee,"['SEOUL, South Korea — When the K-pop star Sulli ended her own life last month, her fellow K-pop singer Goo Hara was heartbroken, bidding a farewell to her best friend in a live-streaming video. With tears running down her cheeks, Ms. Goo expressed hope that Sulli would live “as she pleases” in heaven. “I will live twice more diligently now that you are gone,” she said. “Dear fans, I will be fine. Don’t worry about me.” But on Sunday, six weeks after Sulli’s death, Ms. Goo herself was found dead in her Seoul home in what the police were calling a suicide. The suicides by two of K-pop’s most beloved stars have left fans in South Korea soul-searching over what has gone wrong in K-pop, their country’s most successful cultural export. Lee Yong-pyo, the chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters that Ms. Goo’s body was found by a maid on Sunday evening. Investigators also found a handwritten memo in which Ms. Goo expressed her despair, Mr. Lee said. As grief-stricken fans flocked to the Seoul hospital where her body lay, her family was planning to hold the funeral in private. Once popular mainly just in Asian countries, K-pop girl groups and boy bands, like BTS, now command huge global followings. The genre has captured the imagination of fans around the world with its fusion of synthesized songs, video art, fashionable outfits and synchronized dance routines that mix teasing sexuality with doe-eyed innocence.  But entertainment industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden K-pop industry, which has remained largely hidden behind its glamour. Legions of young South Koreans train for years, often starting in their early teens, honing their singing skills and dance moves in hopes of impressing “star management” agencies who deem them good enough to debut their first song. Even after they make the cut to become K-pop idols, their star status rarely lasts long, as younger stars with cuter looks and fancier dance moves replace them. K-pop stars in their late 20s are already considered old, and these fading idols often try to carve out new roles in acting or as solo singers or talk-show regulars — a difficult transition that is often not successful. The K-pop phenomenon gets disseminated largely through YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and other social media channels, where its stars are exposed to both a flood of fan letters and hateful comments and cyberbullying on everything from their looks to their singing skills to their private lives. “From an early age, they live a mechanical life, going through a spartan training regimen,” said Lee Hark-joon, a South Korean journalist who has produced a TV documentary on the making of a K-pop girl group and co-wrote the book “K-pop Idols: Popular Culture and the Emergence of the Korean Music Industry.” “They seldom have a chance to develop a normal school life or normal social relationships as their peers do.” “Their fall can be as sudden and as dramatic as their rise to the height of fame,” and all at a young age, Mr. Lee added. “Theirs is a profession especially vulnerable to psychological distress — they are scrutinized on social media around the clock, and fake news about their private lives is spread instantly.” In 2017, Sulli, a former member of the South Korean girl group f(x), attended a memorial for another K-pop star, Kim Jong-hyun, 27, who had killed himself after leaving a note that said he was consumed by depression.  Sulli, 25, took her own life  last month after she bitterly complained about misogynistic internet trolls, especially after she joined a feminist campaign that advocated not wearing bras. Ms. Goo, 28, a former member of the wildly popular K-pop girl group Kara, had also struggled with online attacks. Trolls spread rumors that she owed her looks largely to plastic surgery. She admitted that she had gone under the knife for droopy eyes. Things turned worse for her after she broke up with her hair-designer boyfriend, Choi Jong-beom. And rumors spread that there was video footage of the couple engaging in sex. “I won’t be lenient on these vicious commentaries any more,” Ms. Goo wrote on her Instagram account in June, complaining about her “mental health” problems and “depression.” (After her death, such posts on her Instagram account were removed.) At times, she sounded desperate, pleading for her critics to relent. “Is there no one out there with a beautiful mind who can embrace people who suffer?” she pleaded. “Public entertainers like myself don’t have it easy — we have our private lives more scrutinized than anyone else and we suffer the kind of pain we cannot even discuss with our family and friends,” she said. “Can you please ask yourself what kind of person you are before you post a vicious comment online?” The situation with her ex-boyfriend, Mr. Choi, became particularly contentious. She sued him last year, accusing him of threatening to spread the footage of them having sex. In August, he was sentenced to a year and a half in prison on charges of blackmailing, coercion and inflicting bodily harm against Ms. Goo. But his jail term was suspended by the court, keeping him free. Ms. Goo’s suicide has already resulted in soul-searching in South Korea. The number of people who supported an online petition to the office of President Moon Jae-in asking for harsher punishment for sexual harassment has more than doubled to 217,000 since her suicide was reported. In her last Instagram message, Ms. Goo uploaded a photo of her lying on her bed. She wrote “Jalja,” or “sleep tight.”']","Two beloved female stars, Sulli and Goo Hara, ended their own lives in two months, exposing the painful side of being a K-pop idol."
"Pope Francis, in Japan, Warns of ‘Selfish Decisions’ on Nuclear Energy",2019-11-25,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — In the first visit to Japan by a pontiff in 38 years, Pope Francis on Monday edged close to calling for the renunciation of all nuclear power in a country that experienced the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl but has yet to determine a viable alternative for its energy needs.  A day after traveling to Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the only places where atomic bombs have ever been used in war, the pope met in Tokyo on Monday with victims of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown that ravaged northeastern Japan. Francis noted that the Catholic bishops of Japan had called for the shutdown of all nuclear plants in Japan after the 2011 disaster, in which waves from the tsunami overpowered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and set off catastrophic meltdowns in three reactors.  “As we think about the future of our common home, we need to realize that we cannot make purely selfish decisions,” the pope said on Monday, “and that we have a great responsibility to future generations.” Although Japan has a tiny and shrinking Catholic population, the pope drew thousands of people to his appearances in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where he called for an end to the nuclear arms race. In denouncing any use of atomic weapons as “a crime not only against the dignity of human beings but against any possible future for our common home,” he appeared to go further than his predecessors, who called for an end to stockpiling nuclear arms. “The arms race wastes precious resources that could be better used to benefit the integral development of peoples and to protect the natural environment,” the pope said in an address in Peace Park in Nagasaki, which commemorates the 74,000 people who died in the atomic bombing on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, which killed 140,000 people.  “In a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money that is squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, upgrading, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons are an affront crying out to heaven,” he added. Nagasaki, a port city that first had contact with European explorers in the 1500s, is the center of Catholic life in Japan, although the observant population in the country has fallen to just over 450,000, a tiny minority in a nation of 126 million people. The vast majority of religious Japanese are either Buddhist or Shinto, with many practicing elements of both. Catholics have a history of being ostracized for their faith in Japan, and 26 Christians who were executed in the late 16th century under orders from the warlord Hideyoshi Toyotomi are commemorated in a monument in Nagasaki.  When American pilots dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, it destroyed Urakami Cathedral, then the largest cathedral in East Asia, and killed about 8,000 Catholics in the area.  The last pope to visit Japan, John Paul II in 1981, also visited Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where he warned of the dangers of nuclear power and said the suffering from the atomic bombings persisted. On Monday, Francis also addressed the deterioration of international ties at a time when populist governments and leaders have taken to looking inward.  “We are witnessing an erosion of multilateralism, which is all the more serious in light of the growth of new forms of military technology,” he said in Nagasaki. “Such an approach seems highly incongruous in today’s context of interconnectedness; it represents a situation that urgently calls for the attention and commitment of all leaders.” In Tokyo on Monday, the pope met with the newly enthroned emperor, Naruhito, and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Before an audience of about 50,000 people, he said Mass at the Tokyo Dome, home of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team. He described what he called the disconnectedness of a group of young people he had met at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Tokyo.  “They remain on the margins, unable to grasp the meaning of life and their own existence,” he said. “Increasingly, the home, school and community, which are meant to be places where we support and help one another, are being eroded by excessive competition in the pursuit of profit and efficiency. Many people feel confused and anxious; they are overwhelmed by so many demands and worries that take away their peace and stability.” For the pope, the trip to Japan, which followed a three-day visit to Thailand, was in some ways the fulfillment of a long-ago ambition. “I don’t know if you are aware of this, but ever since I was young, I have felt a fondness and affection for these lands,” Francis said on Saturday when he addressed a conference of bishops. As a young Jesuit in Argentina, he had hoped to be sent on a mission to Japan, but a bout of life-threatening pneumonia thwarted the trip.

British Man and Filipino Woman Rescued From Kidnappers in Philippines,2019-11-25,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — Philippine special forces on Monday rescued a 70-year-old British national and a Filipino woman nearly two months after they were kidnapped by gunmen in the southern Philippines, the military said. The soldiers rescued Allan Arthur Hyrons and Welma Paglinawan-Hyrons, a married couple, after they were abandoned by their captors early Monday after days of clashes on the southwestern Philippine island of Jolo. “This morning there was a 10-minute gun battle and the two were left behind by their captors,” said Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the regional military commander. “They scampered away to different directions but we are pursuing them,” the general said of the kidnappers. General Sobejana identified the captors as members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf group, which has been blamed for a rash of high-profile kidnappings of foreigners in the past. The faction of the group responsible for the kidnapping is closely allied with the Islamic State, and their members have been accused of carrying out a number of suicide bombings in Jolo. Troops had been pursuing the militants for weeks and on Sunday a pitched battle between the soldiers and insurgents on the island left at least five militants dead. “This will have a big impact on our efforts against the Abu Sayyaf,” General Sobejana said. “This is a big blow to their morale.” It was not clear who initially seized the couple. The kidnapping was apparently planned by local gunmen who took the couple from a beach resort in October and ferried them by boat in the direction of Jolo, a far-flung island that is a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf. Jolo is the site of a suicide bombing at a Catholic Church that left 23 dead in January. That attack was believed to have been carried out by an Abu Sayyaf faction led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who is believed to be the new leader of the local Islamic State affiliate. Mr. Sawadjaan took over from Isnilon Hapilon, who was killed two years ago by troops after he led Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern militants in sacking the southern city of Marawi. Five months of gun battles there left more than a thousand militants, soldiers and civilians dead. General Sobejana said he expected Abu Sayyaf militants to retaliate by going after what he called “soft targets.” He advised civilians to help the local authorities by reporting people engaged in suspicious activity. He said the abducted couple appeared to be faring well despite their ordeal. “The two appeared O.K. and would be subject to hospital checks,” he said. ']",The husband and wife were rescued by soldiers after insurgents came under attack and abandoned the couple.
"Across Northern England, Labour’s ‘Red Wall’ Is Showing Cracks",2019-11-25,By Mark Landler,"['KIRKBY-IN-ASHFIELD, England — The red brick houses that march up a gentle rise in this worse-for-wear town have long stood as part of the “red wall” in British politics, the gritty stronghold of coal and factory towns in the Midlands and north of England that voted as reliably for the Labour Party as blue-collar precincts in the American Midwest once voted for the Democrats. So when Natalie Fleet, the Labour candidate for Parliament, knocked on the first of those doors last week, and was told by the woman who answered, Donna Savage, that she was thinking of voting for the Conservatives in next month’s election, it was a jolting sign of how much British politics has changed. “I want to get Brexit done,” Ms. Savage, a 43-year-old teacher and lifelong Labour voter, told Ms. Fleet, echoing a phrase frequently used by the Conservative prime minister, Boris Johnson. Plus, Ms. Savage added, “I don’t want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister,” referring to the leftist Labour leader, who is deeply unpopular in this part of the country. Mr. Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union swiftly, and he hopes to use that message to attract and convert fed-up Labour voters. His Conservative Party has targeted Ashfield as one of the districts it has the greatest chance of turning Tory in the election on Dec. 12.  If Mr. Johnson succeeds, it would not only give him the Parliamentary majority he needs to finally deliver Brexit, it would also amount to a breathtaking realignment of British politics. “These Midlands seats are the equivalent of the swing states in the U.S.,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London. “Where they go, the election goes.” In Ashfield, the Labour incumbent, Gloria De Piero, hung on to her seat by just 441 votes in the last election in 2017 and opted not to run again — a decision that looks like a case of reading the writing on the wall. Mr. Johnson has already visited twice, attesting to the district’s status as a prime battleground. Working-class voters in Ashfield have reviled the Tories ever since the free-market revolution of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, which they blame for hastening the demise of the coal industry.  But Brexit has replaced Thatcher as the defining issue, and Mr. Johnson’s promise appeals to people in this district, who voted by more than 70 percent to leave the European Union in 2016 — one of the biggest endorsements of Brexit in Britain — and have seethed over the last three and a half years as the political class has failed to carry out their wishes. That frustration, combined with a fraying social fabric and long-term corrosion in economic opportunity, has created a volatile atmosphere in Ashfield: anti-immigrant, distrustful of the political elite and receptive to populist appeals from the right that would have been jeered a few years ago. “What I voted for is to leave the E.U., make a clean break and then negotiate a new deal with them from a position of strength,” said Glyn Street, 57, who drives a street sweeper. “We’ve got to get out of Europe, because otherwise our kids will be under a dictatorship.” Mr. Street is backing the Brexit Party’s candidate, Martin Daubney, a former journalist who was elected to the European Parliament in May and whose last job was editing a men’s magazine, “Loaded.” He is campaigning on a platform that Mr. Johnson’s pro-Brexit credentials are suspect and that his own party is the “last chance to save Brexit.”  To complicate matters further, there is also an ambitious district councilman, Jason Zadrozny, who is running as an independent with a pox-on-both-their-houses message about the major parties. In this bumper-car pileup of a race, rife with personal feuds and animosities, Ms. Fleet could well finish third. “It’s like the country is turning upside down,” said Lee Anderson, 52, a Labour Party exile and onetime coal miner who is the Conservative Party’s candidate in Ashfield. “As bizarre as it seems, Boris and Donald Trump connect with working-class voters. People like plain English.” Mr. Anderson has gone further than blunt language. Last week, he posted a video on Facebook in which he proposed to evict supposedly unruly residents from a local public-housing project and put them in tents, where they would be forced to pick potatoes and other vegetables from dawn till dusk. Anticipating blowback, he stipulated that it was “my own personal opinion — nobody else’s.” Opponents accused him of sowing divisions and being hardhearted. But Steven Larvin, a 61-year-old greengrocer with a stall in the nearby town of Sutton, confessed sheepishly that the proposal appealed to him. Mr. Johnson has been more cautious: On Sunday, he presented the Conservative Party’s agenda, promising Brexit, of course, and that the government would recruit 50,000 additional nurses. But otherwise it avoided the radical measures that characterized Labour’s manifesto or that of his predecessor, Theresa May, who hurt her chances in 2017 when her tough health care proposals backfired. The Conservatives, Mr. Anderson argues, better embody the traditional values that people in Ashfield want to preserve than does Labour. Without the coal mines and factories, he said, the Labour Party no longer has a “captive audience of useful idiots” for its outmoded policies. Mr. Anderson was himself a member of that audience. A longtime Labour activist who once ran Ms. De Piero’s district office, he defected from the party after falling out with colleagues over his vote for Brexit. Still, Mr. Anderson does not have a good answer for how Mr. Johnson will reconcile the free-market, entrepreneurial policies that drive his Brexit campaign — one built on a vision of turning Britain into Singapore-on-Thames — with the yearning in the Midlands for a strong state and a return to the kind of traditional industrial economy that powered the country in the 1960s. For all his workingman credibility, running as a Conservative can still be a bruising experience. Last week, as he knocked on doors in the hillside village of Jacksdale, a passing motorist rolled down his window and yelled, “Tory scum!” “There are still some people who won’t forget — can’t forget — that the Conservatives shut the pits,” said Jon Ball, the head of content at the local newspaper, The Mansfield and Ashfield Chad. “But there are many other people who have moved on.”  The betting markets have Mr. Anderson running neck-and-neck with the independent candidate, Mr. Zadrozny. A onetime Liberal Democrat who voted in favor of Brexit, his political career almost ended after he was arrested in 2015 on charges of child sex abuse. The charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. Now, Mr. Zadrozny presents himself as a pragmatic public servant who will get things done without being tied to the orthodoxy of either major party.  At a time when politicians are in disrepute, he argues that this formula will resonate. “People were crying out for something different, and I guess we’re a conduit for that,” Mr. Zadrozny said. “I’m offering the one thing they really want from Conservatives, which is Brexit, but without the rabid, right-wing Tory bit.” As he shook hands in the market square, however, Mr. Zadrozny discovered the limits of being an anti-politician. Theresa Woodland, 60, a retired hairdresser, told him that however much she appreciated his work for the district, she was going to vote for the Labour Party. “If I vote for you, I think Boris will get in,” she told him. “If Labour gets in, I think Ashfield will benefit.” That is the kind of loyalty Ms. Fleet is counting on to avoiding being swallowed up by the political earthquake rolling across Britain. A onetime single mother who had a child at 16, Ms. Fleet promotes her credentials as a product of Ashfield, in all of its hardship and heartbreak. She speaks movingly about her sick grandmother, languishing in a hospital without proper care. But Ms. Fleet acknowledges that Brexit is the overriding issue, and Labour’s policy on it strikes many as hopelessly muddled: The party says it would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union and then put that to a second referendum — a multi-step process that leaves people in Ashfield pulling out their hair. “I want to get it done — get it sorted — so we can go back to discussing bread-and-butter issues that people really care about,” said Ms. Fleet, who works as a union official and canvassed for Hillary Clinton in Ohio in 2016. For Ms. Fleet, however, the biggest threats in this campaign are personal. Last week, the windows of her campaign office were smashed by an unknown assailant wielding a hammer. She has been vilified on social media by pro- and anti-Brexit extremists, much as Ms. De Piero was during her last three years in Parliament. That vitriol, Ms. De Piero said, contributed to her decision not to run again. Ms. De Piero, a former television journalist, often accompanies Ms. Fleet on her door-knocking rounds. She takes comfort that she rarely encounters the same rage face-to-face that she gets on Facebook and Twitter. But with passions running high and the sun setting at 4 p.m. in the weeks leading up to this rare pre-Christmas election, there is safety in numbers when approaching a darkened doorway. “You’ve just been called a traitor, and you think about that every time before you go door-knocking,” Ms. De Piero said. “If they talk this way to me on social media, why wouldn’t they talk this way at their door?” Anna Schaverien contributed reporting from London.']","As in America, Britain’s rust belt regions are turning to the right, possibly heralding a realignment in next month’s general election."
"Luis Lacalle Pou Leads in Tight Uruguay Election, but Ballot Counting Continues",2019-11-25,By Daniel Politi and Ernesto Londoño,"['BUENOS AIRES — Former Senator Luis Lacalle Pou appeared to have carved out a narrow victory in Uruguay’s presidential election on Sunday, the latest sign that unrest simmering across Latin America favors anti-incumbent candidates. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a center-right veteran lawmaker, had more than 48.8 percent of the vote, with more than 97 percent of precincts counted, preliminary results showed. That put him slightly more than  1 percentage point ahead of  his rival, Daniel Martínez.  But late Sunday, election officials still had not called the race because the number of provisional ballots exceeded the margin between the two candidates. Pollsters said exit polls and the preliminary results appeared to give Mr. Lacalle Pou a clear edge.  Mr. Lacalle Pou stopped short of claiming victory when he addressed supporters shortly past midnight, but said his lead was “irreversible.” Noting how tight the election turned out to be, Mr. Lacalle Pou struck a conciliatory note. “This reaffirms that this must unite as a society,” he said. “We must unite as Uruguayans.” If the results are confirmed, Mr. Lacalle Pou’s victory  would be the latest setback for leftist politicians in Latin America. They have long regarded prosperous and politically stable Uruguay as an exemplar for its robust social safety net and its comparatively low inequality. Mr. Martínez celebrated his party’s performance, noting it had exceeded expectations. He did not concede the race, noting that provisional ballots could conceivably alter the outcome. “Uruguayans are smart people,” he told supporters late Sunday night. “They decide with their head and their heart.” In the campaign’s final days, polls had indicated that Mr. Lacalle Pou, 46, of the National Party would easily beat Mr. Martínez, 62, of the Broad Front coalition. But Mr. Martínez, a former mayor of Montevideo, the capital, appears to have enjoyed a surge in support during the final stretch. The Broad Front is a coalition of center-left and leftist parties that has held the presidency since 2005. Mr. Martínez was the front-runner in the first round of voting on Oct. 27, winning 39 percent of the vote. But Mr. Lacalle Pou gained momentum after that with backing from the main candidates who did not qualify for the runoff. Polls show that voters have lost faith in the governing coalition amid a rise in crime and a slowdown in economic growth. Still, Broad Front governments have largely avoided the corruption scandals and economic slumps that have bedeviled other leftists in the region. On their watch, Uruguay’s economy has grown steadily, inequality has shrunk and the nation of 3.4 million people has made international headlines by championing some liberal social initiatives that were largely popular at home. Uruguay’s Congress legalized abortion in 2012, and the following year it passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. In 2017, Uruguay became the first country to fully legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use, creating a model for taxing and regulating the sale of drugs that drew wide international interest. But the Broad Front struggled to persuade voters that continuity was the right course, said Gerardo Caetano, a professor of history and political science at the University of the Republic in Montevideo. “Uruguay is part of this pattern of angry, unhappy societies that have seen an increase in purchasing power, and due to that increase they began demanding more,” he said. “People are angry and have turned against the government.” Public safety also weighed heavily on voters, experts said. Last year, killings and violent robberies increased substantially, a dynamic that gave Mr. Lacalle Pou a useful line of attack against the Broad Front. “The biggest challenge has been public security,” said Jennifer Pribble, an associate professor of political science at the University of Richmond who studies Uruguayan politics. “The Broad Front was slow to respond to citizen concerns, while the opposition used that quite masterfully.” Sluggish growth also worked against Mr. Martínez. Uruguay’s gross domestic product is expected to increase by 0.4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. “Although the economic situation is not a crisis, there are indicators that are concerning, including slow growth, inflation and unemployment,” said Mariana Pomiés, executive director of Cifra, a local pollster. “This change leads the population to consider an alternative that can fix a few things.” Experts and voters say Mr. Martínez was further stymied by fractures in the Broad Front and that he struggled to excite voters. “Martínez does not have the profile to be president,” said Mercedes Peirano, 61, who said she had voted for him, albeit unenthusiastically. “He’s a good person but lacks charisma and stumbles when he talks.” Mr. Lacalle Pou — the son of former President Luis Alberto Lacalle, who governed from 1990 to 1995 — has spent the years since his failed presidential bid in 2014 cobbling together an alliance of opposition factions. He promised to rein in debt, accusing the Broad Front government of fiscal irresponsibility, argued that the government can do more to help small businesses succeed and vowed to improve security with sweeping reforms of the police. “Lacalle Pou began to think about the 2019 campaign the day after he lost in 2014,” said Fernanda Boidi, a political consultant in Montevideo and regional coordinator of Vanderbilt University’s Latin American Public Opinion Project. “Lacalle Pou has been preparing very assiduously for this opportunity and carried out a very solid, very unified campaign.” The cluster of parties that unified behind Mr. Lacalle Pou’s candidacy includes politicians from a broad ideological spectrum. Experts said that may prove challenging as the new president seeks to push changes through Congress, including an overhaul of the pension system. Among his supporters is a new far-right party, Cabildo Abierto, led by a former military leader, a jarring development for Uruguayans who have bleak memories of despotic military rule in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr. Lacalle Pou, a lawyer by training, served in the lower house of Congress from 2000 to 2015 and served in the Senate until resigning his seat in August to focus on the political race.  Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and Ernesto Londoño from Rio de Janeiro.']","The ruling leftist party appears to be on its way out after nearly 15 years, as slow economic growth drags down incumbents.

Where the Nurse Prescribes Heroin,2019-11-27,By Anna Schaverien and Allison McCann,"['LONDON — Homeless drug users in Scotland will be allowed to inject pharmaceutical-grade heroin twice a day under the supervision of medical officials as part of a new program intended to reduce drug deaths and H.I.V. infection. From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week, a $1.5 million facility in Glasgow that opened on Tuesday will allow a handful of drug users to receive doses of the drug alongside other treatment for their physical and psychological health, according to Glasgow City Council. The pilot project, known as heroin-assisted treatment, is the first such licensed operation in Scotland, a country that has been called the “drug death capital of the world.” It has struggled to cope with high rates of fatal drug overdoses and its worst H.I.V. outbreak in decades.  The program will target those with the “most severe, longstanding and complex addiction issues,” the City Council said.  It aims to reduce the risk of overdoses and the spread of viruses such as H.I.V. by prescribing diamorphine — the clinical name for pharmaceutical-grade heroin — for patients to inject in a secure clinical room under the supervision of trained medics. The clinic opened in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, after Britain’s Home Office granted it a license, and follows a similar initiative that began in Middlesbrough, England, last month. Up to 20 patients are expected to take part in the first year of Glasgow’s program, with the number set to double in the second year. “Heroin-assisted treatment is a much more clinical service aimed at getting people stable,” Andrew McAuley, a senior research fellow on substance use at Glasgow Caledonian University, said in an interview on Wednesday. “The program is a significant step forward, albeit for a very small number of people.”  The program, called the Enhanced Drug Treatment Service, is intended for those who have exhausted other treatment options such as residential rehabilitation, methadone and community addiction services. It is available only to drug users already involved with the city’s team fighting addiction among homeless people.  The program is not intended to be long-term, with research suggesting that clinical benefits can be seen after six weeks of treatment.  It requires patients to visit the city clinic twice a day, seven days a week, a demand that may be too much for those not used to such a routine, Mr. McAuley said. “It’s a large commitment,” he said. Glasgow has ambitious plans to support its residents with drug-addiction issues, but Scottish officials say it has been hindered by Britain’s 1971 drug law.  Glasgow officials have pushed for years to establish consumption spaces in the city where drug users could inject their own drugs in a safe, clean environment, but their efforts have been rebuffed by the British government.  Britain’s Misuse of Drugs Act, the 1971 law, stipulates that anyone “concerned in the management of any premises” or any occupier who knowingly allows drugs to be prepared there can face prosecution.  “It is still illegal to have safe consumption sites, which puts us out of sync with most Western countries,” said Mr. McAuley, whose research group will evaluate the Glasgow program. “Glasgow is arguably the most compelling case for a drug consumption site.” Austin Smith, a policy officer at Scottish Drugs Forum, a national resource of expertise on drug use issues, said, “This part of the law was to stop people opening up opium dens and was never intended to stop safe services, but that is what it does.” More than 100 supervised consumption services have been established in countries like Australia, Canada, France, Switzerland and Germany, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based organization that campaigns to end America’s “war on drugs.”  A report on Scotland’s drug problem that was released this month by the British Parliament’s Scottish Affairs Committee endorsed the treatment method.  “Safe drug-consumption facilities are proven to reduce the number of drug-related deaths and can act as a gateway to further treatment,” said Pete Wishart, the committee’s chairman. “Every drug death is preventable, and these centers could play a vital role in addressing Scotland’s drug crisis.” Scotland’s drug problem has worsened in recent years, and official statistics indicate that drug-related deaths there are at a record high. Fatal drug overdoses have been highest among older users. The number of deaths directly caused by drugs has risen in Scotland almost year on year since records began in the mid-1990s. And the number has climbed drastically: to 1,187 drug-related deaths last year from 244 in 1996, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Scotland’s drug death rate is nearly three times that of Britain as a whole and is the highest in the European Union. By some measures, Scotland has even surpassed — by a small margin — the United States’ rate of 217 drug-related deaths per million of the population.  The number of homeless drug users with H.I.V. in Glasgow also increased in recent years, which one study attributed to the sharing of needles and other equipment. City health workers say the outbreak has still not been contained. “This challenging social issue demands innovative treatments,” the chairwoman of Glasgow’s Alcohol and Drug Partnership, Susanne Millar, said in a statement on Tuesday. “People might question why health services are spending money providing heroin for people with addictions,” she said. “The answer is we can’t afford not to.” ']",A new program in Glasgow will give drug users pharmaceutical-grade heroin twice daily in a bid to reduce drug-related deaths. 
"On Day to End Violence Against Women, Spain’s Far Right Champions Men",2019-11-25,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Monday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and Vox, Spain’s surging far-right party, appears to have had a plan. First members of the party, which in a breakthrough election two weeks ago won 52 seats in Parliament, managed to block approval by the Madrid city government of a resolution commemorating the day, which the United Nations established two decades ago. Then on Monday at City Hall, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary general of Vox, took the opportunity to reaffirm his party’s demand that Spain repeal a 15-year-old law aimed at stopping violence against women. Women at the gathering, already angry at Vox’s refusal to observe the Elimination of Violence Against Women Day, were outraged.  “This is shameful!” several shouted, booing as they left City Hall, which has been governed by a right-wing coalition since May. In lieu of pointing a spotlight at violence against women, Mr. Ortega Smith used his speech to talk about men who have been killed by women, as well as women who have suffered “violence from their lesbian partners.” When he returned to his front-row seat, he was confronted by Nadia Otmani, the president of a women’s association called Al Amal. Ms. Otmani was shot and left paralyzed two decades ago when she tried to protect her sister from her abusive husband. “I have been in a wheelchair for 20 years,” she told Mr. Ortega Smith. “Respect for the dead and respect for the women who are victims of violence across the whole of this country. Respect, please.” Mr. Ortega Smith looked away as Ms. Otmani shouted at him, surrounded by journalists. Ms. Otmani is from Morocco, and has long lived in Spain;  her association helps other Moroccan women settle in the country. Vox has been pushing to clamp down on Islamic migration and reassert Roman Catholic values in Spain. In winning the 52 parliamentary seats in the Nov. 10 national election, Vox became Spain’s third-largest political party. The election, the country’s fourth in four years, underlined the fragmentation and polarization of Spanish politics, with the ultranationalist Vox making the clearest gains. With no party close to a parliamentary majority, Pedro Sánchez, the caretaker Socialist prime minister, is negotiating the formation of a new government in a coalition with another left-wing party, Unidas Podemos. Parliament must still approve what would be a minority government. The gender violence law that Vox wants repealed was passed in 2004 under a new Socialist government led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. At the time, the law was considered groundbreaking, and was part of a broader overhaul of the country’s social legislation. The following year, Spain became one of the first Western countries to legalize same-sex marriage. The law took several steps to help protect women. It set up special courts to handle their cases. It made it easier for women to report violence, notably by using a specific toll-free number. And it toughened sentences for offenders and made it harder for them to later come into contact with their victims. Violence against women in Spain, however, remains a serious problem. Over a thousand women have been reported killed since statistics were first officially gathered in 2003. Last year, women reported almost 167,000 cases of domestic violence, while the courts issued more than 39,000 restraining orders. On Monday, a man was alleged to have killed his partner on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which is part of the Canary archipelago, raising the total number of women killed in Spain this year to 52. According to Spanish news reports, the woman was killed after her partner grabbed a knife from her grandmother, who had tried to intervene after she heard her granddaughter shouting for help. Since the gender violence law came into force, it has been challenged about 200 times in court as unconstitutional. Vox has been unsparing in its criticism, describing the law as “the pact of shame,” and arguing that it violates the right to equality inscribed in the Spanish Constitution.  “I thought all Spaniards were equal before the law, but it turns out that women have privileges, which seems to me unfair for the man,” Rocío Monasterio, one of the most prominent women in Vox, said on a television program. Ms. Monasterio said the law made it too hard for men to defend themselves against unfounded accusations of domestic violence. “To have a law that does not respect the presumption of innocence seems to me to be worthy of a third-world country,” she said.  Last week, ahead of Monday’s commemoration, the women of Vox issued their own manifesto, saying that they oppose all violence, with no regard for gender. The manifesto also called on Spain to turn its focus toward abuses against women in countries that “do not belong to Western civilization.”']",
Truck Driver Pleads Guilty to 2 Charges in Essex Deaths,2019-11-25,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The driver of the tractor-trailer in which the bodies of 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in southeastern England last month pleaded guilty on Monday in a London court to charges related to the case. The driver, Maurice Robinson — a 25-year-old from Northern Ireland who is one of three people to have been charged in the case — pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property, the Essex Police said in a statement.  He also faces one count of manslaughter for each of the 39 victims, and one count each of transferring criminal property and conspiracy to traffic people. The case sent shock waves internationally when the bodies were discovered on Oct. 23 in a refrigerated truck in an industrial park in Grays, an Essex town 25 miles east of London. This month, the police identified all of the 39 dead as Vietnamese citizens, the youngest of whom was 15. Mr. Robinson’s case will resume in court on Dec. 13.  Christopher Kennedy, a 23-year-old from Northern Ireland, is also scheduled to appear in court that day in relation to this case. Mr. Kennedy was charged this weekend with counts related to human trafficking, the Essex Police said.  Eamonn Harrison, 22, another truck driver from Northern Ireland, has also been charged. He faces counts of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offenses. Mr. Harrison, who is being held in Ireland, appeared in court there last week over a request that he be extradited to Britain. The police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, in the case. The brothers have links to the shipping and cargo hauling industries in Northern Ireland and Ireland, the police said this month. The victims found in the refrigerated container, which had been transported from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, are believed to have set out for Europe from Vietnam in search for better lives. A GoFundMe page to raise money toward the cost of repatriating their bodies had raised more than $25,000 by Monday.  Despite the potentially fatal risks of such smuggling, migrants from various parts of the world continue to try to reach Europe in this way. Forty-one men and boys from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria were discovered alive in a truck in Greece this month, and 12 men from Syria and Sudan were found alive last month in a refrigerated trailer in Belgium.

Albania Earthquake Kills at Least 23,2019-11-26,"By Elian Peltier, Iliana Magra and Daniel Victor","[""Rescuers in Albania dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings in search of survivors on Tuesday, after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the Balkan nation, killing at least 23 people and injuring 650. Using everything from earth-moving equipment to their bare hands, local residents and emergency crews in cities across the country had pulled 45 people alive from under mounds of debris by the evening, the government said. Thirty people were hospitalized. The deadly quake was the strongest to hit Albania in decades, in a region known for its devastating temblors, and came just two months after the country was struck by another strong quake that damaged hundred of homes. Across the country, buildings crumbled, fallen facades left structures ripped open to the elements, and many others had ominous cracks snaking across their walls. In Durres, a hard-hit coastal city, the seven-story Vila Palma hotel collapsed, crushing cars parked underneath, but there was no immediate word on casualties. Many buildings on the outskirts of the city were also destroyed, raining concrete and bricks onto streets, vehicles and gardens. “What we are seeing now is a very strong, very powerful sequence of earthquakes,” said Jadranka Mihaljevic, the head of engineering in the seismology department of the Institute for Hydrometeorology and Seismology in neighboring Montenegro, where she said the earthquake was felt across the country. The earthquake struck at 3:54 a.m. near the Adriatic coast, about 19 miles west of Tirana, home to nearly 900,000 people.  A resident of Tirana, George-Ilias Belidis, was sleeping in his apartment when a powerful, seemingly interminable tremor jolted him awake, and he said he thought his end had come.  “Everything was moving in an unbelievable rhythm, I could hear the walls cracking, dishes and glass breaking,” Mr. Belidis, a 24-year-old Greek citizen, said by phone a few hours after experienced the deadly quake “in all its rage.” Videos and pictures shared on social media showed chaotic scenes of residents rummaging through the rubble, or trying to extricate people trapped under collapsed buildings. In one video, a group of people in Durres struggled in darkness to extract a young boy who was trapped in the wreckage crying out in pain. In Elbasan, a town about 35 miles from Durres, Olsi Shehi, a 39-year-old cook, said a four-story house had fallen, trapping people inside. “I could hear six people screaming to get them out,” he said. Albania’s president, Ilir Meta, described the situation “dramatic” as he visited Thumane, the town closest to the epicenter, where several people died. “We hope to overcome it with the least loss,” he wrote in a post on Twitter that included pictures of him talking with local people and an army officer.  In a statement, Mr. Meta vowed that rescuers would “save every human life under the rubble of buildings” and help the injured. It was unclear how many people were still trapped, but locals worried the death toll could rise considerably.  As many as 1.2 million people may have faced “strong” and “very strong” shaking, according to the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists said that the quake and its aftershocks were felt in neighboring Montenegro, in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in southern Italy. Hours later, a 5.4-magnitude quake struck southern Bosnia and Herzegovina; there were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities. On Sept. 21, a 5.6-magnitude quake in Albania injured dozens of people and damaged hundreds of homes in the same area hit on Tuesday. Officials and seismologists said that quake was the strongest to strike the country in 30 years.  Ms. Mihaljevic said the stability of the buildings in Albania might have been greatly compromised by the previous earthquake, and that their fragile state could lead to increased fatalities.  As the Albanian authorities requested international help, Montenegro and Serbia sent support and rescue teams, according to Prime Minister Edi Rama, who added that various leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, were preparing to help.  Emergency teams from Kosovo, Romania, Italy and Greece joined the effort, and European Union officials said they had reached out to Albania’s government to offer assistance. Countries in the Balkans and in southern Europe have a long history of destructive earthquakes. In 1999, a 7.6-magnitude quake killed 17,000 people in Turkey; and in 2016, more than 241 people died in a 6.2-magnitude quake in central Italy, seven years after the deadly Abruzzo earthquake that left more than 300 people dead. A series of quakes also ravaged the region in the late 1970s, killing more than 1,500 people in Romania in 1977, dozens in Greece in 1978, and hundreds in 1979 in what was then Yugoslavia.  “The deadly 1977-1979 series was followed by a quiet period where new seismic energy was accumulating,” Ms. Mihaljevic said. “But after 40 years of relatively calm seismicity, strong quakes seem to be back.” Many residents who rushed out of their houses in Tirana or Durres in the early hours of Tuesday, only to face numerous aftershocks in the open air. Mr. Belidis, the 24-year-old Tirana resident, said he didn't know where he would live, describing his apartment as “uninhabitable.”  Even in houses and buildings that were still standing, the quake left walls bulging, and their inhabitants, most of whom remained outside even after the earthquake ended, terrified. “Some were on the street, others in their cars,” said Mr. Shehi, in Durres. “You look around and you think, ‘We’re lucky we’re alive.’ ”""]","The 6.4-magnitude quake, one of the strongest to hit the country in decades, struck near Tirana, the capital.

‘Evo Morales Is Like a Father to Us’,2019-11-27,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Federico Rios,"['VILLA TUNARI, Bolivia — The road to Evo Morales’s political stronghold, in the heart of Bolivia’s coca farming region, is nearly impassable these days.  First, tires and wooden crates block the way, forcing travelers to stop and negotiate with supporters of Mr. Morales, the ousted Bolivian president, who have cut off access to the region. Farther ahead, the road is obstructed by tree trunks and barbed wire, and then by towering mounds of stones and earth.  At each of the nearly 100 barricades along the way, suspicious guards — sometimes several hundred of them — wield sticks and nail boards, turning away anyone without a permit or medical emergency.  Finally, after traveling 100 miles through the seemingly endless debris, the tropical town of Villa Tunari emerges in a lush river valley in the Andean foothills. This is where Mr. Morales, the country’s first Indigenous president, started and ended his political career — and where he is still treated with almost superhuman reverence.  It’s also where the headquarters of resistance to Bolivia’s new interim government is found. Thousands of coca farmers — including children — are camped around the town’s strategic river bridge, obstructing Bolivia’s main highway and paralyzing its national economy. With no movement of goods, there are food and fuel shortages in major cities. “Evo Morales is like a father to us,” said Antonietta Ledezi, a coca farmer who traveled 30 miles to Villa Tunari to join the blockade two weeks ago. “If he doesn’t return, there won’t be peace.” Bolivia this week began to move toward resolving the vicious political crisis that led to Mr. Morales’s resignation from office earlier this month after 14 years as president. His downfall came after violent protests over a disputed election that he claimed to win, and after he had lost the backing of the military and the police.  New elections — in which Mr. Morales is barred from running — are planned. But farmers here in Villa Tunari, which I reached on a reporting trip in recent days, are determined to fight on for the return of their exiled leader. For the 50,000 local coca farming families, the ousting of Mr. Morales represents more than the end of a government that gave them a political voice and vast improvements in infrastructure, education and health. It is a threat to the peace that Mr. Morales, called Evo by everyone here, brought to this stigmatized and violent region. A mere mention of Evo can unleash uncontrolled wailing at the barricades. Many remember him personally as a fellow coca farmer who rose to become the president of the confederation of local coca unions, a title he nominally holds to this day. “He was the only president we have ever seen,” said Gregorio Choque, a coca farmer. “He was in the fields with us.” Farmers began to converge on Villa Tunari on Nov. 10, the day Mr. Morales announced his resignation from the country’s presidency at the nearby headquarters of the coca confederation, an act that turned this gentrifying tourism hot spot into a war camp.  The next day, Mr. Morales fled the country to seek asylum in Mexico, departing from an airport in the coca region. Soon after, sprawling assemblies of makeshift tents, hastily constructed out of tree trunks and branches, covered the highway, as groups of farmers took shifts reinforcing the barricades, cooking communal meals or trying to rest on bare asphalt in the sweltering heat. They competed for status by decorating their sections of the barricades with placards calling for the resignation of the country’s interim president, Jeanine Añez, and justice for about 30 pro-Evo protesters killed in clashes with security forces. “We don’t recognize this new illegal government,” said Andronico Rodríguez, Evo’s deputy in the local labor movement, who is seen by many here as the former president’s successor. “Our objective is to allow Evo to finish out his term.” “In less than 24 hours, we can mobilize 100,000 farmers,” added Mr. Rodríguez. The swift rise of Mr. Rodríguez, 30, reflects Evo’s social investments in the region.  Mr. Rodríguez began attending his local union meetings after school with his mother when he was 9, reading out the meeting minutes to the mostly illiterate members. Now, he has the unenviable challenge of aligning the coca farmers’ eternal loyalty to Evo with the country’s evolving political landscape. This week, he traveled to La Paz to join negotiations over the country’s looming elections. The coca farmers’ discipline, self-sufficiency in food and strategic location in the center of the country give them an ability to keep up the blockade for months, if their demands are not met, he said. Many barricades hang effigies of Ms. Añez, as well as conservative opposition leaders and the former military chief, Gen. Williams Kaliman, who refused to deploy soldiers to save Evo’s government. The neat, usually flawless, wording of the placards was itself a sign of pride in the huge advances in literacy that Evo brought to the region.  After checking my credentials and luggage on the trip I took to the area, the guards at nearly every barricade on the way to the town insisted that I get out of the car so they could speak with a reporter. They wanted to document their political grievances, another legacy of the self-worth instilled by Evo in the local residents, whom many Bolivians write off as rabble-rousing pawns in the global drug trade. “They call us drug traffickers, terrorists, vandals who are not worth anything,” said one farmer, Hironimo Tosico, breaking into tears. “I’m a producer of banana, plantain, citruses, watermelons. I’m not a troublemaker. I’m a good citizen.” Bolivia’s Indigenous people have used coca plants for centuries to fight fatigue and hunger, but the plant is also the raw material for cocaine. On coming to power, Mr. Morales legalized coca production for traditional use, but put in place strict output limits. Under his rule, coca production in the region, Chapare, fell despite a large increase in the farming population and global cocaine demand, according to the United Nations. Local unions today regulate the planting area to protect prices and prevent excess crops going to cocaine labs. These policies brought economic stability that allowed farmers to diversify into other crops. They also brought social peace after decades of territorial infighting and repression by the military’s coca eradication squads. Mr. Morales’s party got 90 percent of the vote in Chapare in the last elections in October. But not everyone here supports the blockade. The tension is largely generational. Many of the region’s older coca farmers have since invested in shops, small hotels and restaurants in Villa Tunari, becoming the town’s new middle class and helping to convert it into an outdoor tourism hub.  Now, as the blockade grinds into its third week, the town’s shuttered hotels are already looking worn down, with jungle vegetation growing freely around abandoned swimming pools. Empty restaurants are cooking one meal a day with firewood. Locals without land have also been hard hit. Nora Choque, who works in a motel, last week began walking with her two small children to the closest city, Cochabamba, 100 miles up the mountains, because she said she had run out of food. “There’s nothing left for us here,” she said, as she trudged through Villa Tunari in the afternoon heat. The blockade has also swept up unexpected bystanders.  Groups of Chinese road builders sat gloomily by their isolated campsites on the blockaded highway. Families of Haitian labor migrants heading on foot to Chile sat stranded in a tollbooth. A lone European backpacker scoured for food amid the barricades near Villa Tunari’s hostel. The barricades fully come to life at dusk.  With a reprieve from the heat, the blocked-off road becomes a bustling human sea. Street sellers appear out of nowhere with steaming pots of giant corn kernels, freeze-dried baby potatoes, yucca and spicy peanut sauce for those with a couple spare dollars. Those less fortunate chew on the coca leaf to beat the hunger. After dinner, the union members gather for a roll call and a discussion, usually in the local Quechua language, of the day’s political news from La Paz, before setting down to rest on the asphalt or bare earth under skimpy tarps or tree branches. The silence of the road at night is occasionally broken by the screeching of buses carrying reinforcements to the protest’s front line, outside Cochabamba. “It’s tough being here, while our crops rot in the fields,” said Serafino Oliveros, a coca farmer, while perched under a six-foot wet tarp with four union companions. “But we understand that this is a necessary sacrifice so that our children have the same rights we had under Evo.” Norman Chinchilla contributed reporting from Cochabamba, Bolivia, and Cesar Del Castillo from La Paz.']","In the coca-growing region where the former Bolivian president got his political start, farmers are loyal to him — and demanding his return."
"Beijing Was Confident Its Hong Kong Allies Would Win. After the Election, It Went Silent.",2019-11-26,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The Chinese government seemed confident that its allies would prevail in the Hong Kong elections on Sunday. For a week, commentators wrote brassy pieces saying the Hong Kong public would go to the polls to “end social chaos and violence,” a vote against what they saw as rogues and radicals. Editors at state-run news outlets prepared stories that predicted withering losses for the protest movement. When it became clear early Monday that democracy advocates in the semiautonomous territory had won in a landslide, Beijing turned silent. The news media, for the most part, did not even report the election results. And Chinese officials directed their ire at a familiar foe: the United States. The sudden pivot reflects the ruling Communist Party’s continuing struggle to understand one of its worst political crises in decades. At various moments in the monthslong protests in Hong Kong, Beijing has been caught off guard, forced to recalibrate its propaganda machine. After the election loss, Chinese officials resorted to a favorite tactic by blaming the West, a nationalistic message that plays well to the masses at home. For months, officials have said the protests are the work of foreign “black hands” bent on fomenting an uprising in the former British colony.  “Beijing knows very well that they lost the game in the election,” said Willy Lam, a political analyst who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Beijing had to blame somebody, so in this case it is blaming outside foreign forces, particularly in the United States, for interfering in the elections.” Since the antigovernment protests erupted in June, Beijing has sought to portray the protesters in Hong Kong as violent thugs colluding with foreign forces to undermine the party. The government, under President Xi Jinping, has repeatedly denounced the protesters as a fringe group that does not enjoy broad public support.  In the days leading up to the election, state-run news outlets echoed that message. Xinhua, the state news agency, reported that most voters were opposed to violence and worried that the election would become a “stage for political performances.” It didn’t matter that the elections on Sunday were for district councils, some of the least powerful positions in Hong Kong’s government. Like those in the pro-democracy camp, the Chinese media also appeared to position the vote as a referendum on the protests, albeit as a chance for the public to decry the violence and the pro-democracy movement. But the vote on Sunday severely undercut the government’s narrative.  In a rebuke to Beijing, pro-democracy candidates captured 389 of 452 elected seats, far more than they had ever won. Beijing’s allies held just 58 seats, down from 300. It was a strong message from Hong Kong voters, with record turnout of 71 percent. As the bruising loss for the pro-Beijing camp became clear,  the Chinese news media didn’t cover it. A brief news article by Xinhua stated simply that ballots had been counted and blamed social unrest for “disrupting the electoral process.”  Xu Qinduo, a political commentator for China Radio International, a state-owned broadcaster, said the lack of coverage might be at least partly a face-saving measure. His outlet’s website posted the basic report by Xinhua. “People see it as somehow a failure of the central government,” he said, referring to the victory for pro-democracy candidates. He said he disagreed with that perception. Mr. Xu added that the silence from the news media suggested the government had not decided yet how to respond. “There’s probably a lack of conclusion, a lack of consensus even, over how to respond to the election and what kind of narrative we are going to have,” he said. The failure of the political establishment in Beijing to predict the outcome also raised questions about the party’s grasp of the political forces in Hong Kong. There are grumblings that Mr. Xi’s government has misread the grievances of the protesters and underestimated the depth of the anger in Hong Kong.  Chinese state media has simultaneously argued that the frustrations have stemmed from economic issues like sky-high housing costs and depicted demonstrators as paid thugs. And those provocateurs, in Beijing’s view, didn’t have the broad support of the Hong Kong public. “They believed in their own propaganda,” said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who is critical of the government. “They thought the situation would pivot and the public would support them.” Hong Kong’s leadership has sought to play down the elections results. On Tuesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, disputed the idea that the losses for pro-Beijing candidates had broader implications. But she acknowledged that there appeared to be dissatisfaction with how the government handled the extradition bill that originally sparked the protests. “There are people who want to express the view that they could no longer tolerate this chaotic situation,” Mrs. Lam said at a regular news briefing. “There are of course people who felt that our government has not handled competently the legislative exercise and its aftermath.” Since the election, Chinese officials have renewed their attacks on the United States and criticized Congress for recently passing a bill to support the protesters, known as the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the American ambassador to Beijing, Terry Branstad, on Monday to complain about the bill.  Zheng Zeguang, a vice foreign minister, told Mr. Branstad that the United States should “stop interfering in China’s internal affairs,” according to the ministry. “Any attempt to destabilize Hong Kong and undermine its stability and prosperity will never succeed,” Mr. Zheng said, according to the ministry. The bill, which passed both houses of Congress with veto-proof majorities, could impose sanctions on Chinese officials for cracking down on the protesters. The White House, which is engaged in delicate trade negotiations with China, has not said whether President Trump will sign it. At their meeting on Monday, Mr. Branstad told Mr. Zheng that the United States was watching the situation in Hong Kong with “grave concern,” according to a spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing. Mr. Branstad added that “the United States believes that societies are best served when diverse political views can be represented in genuinely free and fair elections,” according to the embassy. The state-run news media has also sharpened its criticism of American politicians. On Tuesday, People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published a scathing editorial accusing American officials of harboring “sinister intentions” and encouraging unrest in Hong Kong as a way of containing China’s rise.  CCTV, the state broadcaster, aired a segment on the evening news quoting American, Russian and Singaporean experts who argued that the United States was interfering in China’s affairs. The tone in the state media is likely to grow more aggressive in the weeks ahead, analysts say, as Beijing tries to rein in a pro-democracy movement that feels vindicated by its electoral victories. “The stage is set for more confrontation between the radical protesters in Hong Kong and a recalcitrant Beijing,” said Mr. Lam, the political analyst. “Beijing may end up squeezing Hong Kong further and further.” Tiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

"Godfrey Gao, ‘Mortal Instruments’ Actor, Dies While Filming TV Show",2019-11-27,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — “Chase Me,” a Chinese television show, is famous for pushing its contestants to the limits. Participants scale tall buildings, skid down obstacle courses and hang from tightropes, often to the delight of screaming fans. But on Wednesday, the show came under national scrutiny in China after a 35-year-old actor and model, Godfrey Gao, died suddenly while filming an episode in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. Mr. Gao collapsed while running, apparently from a heart problem, according to a statement on Wednesday by the “Chase Me” production team. The death of Mr. Gao, who was born in Taiwan and raised in Canada, set off a wave of anger on the Chinese internet, with millions of people criticizing the entertainment industry as focused on ratings at the expense of safety.  By Wednesday evening, the death of Mr. Gao was one of the most widely discussed topics on Weibo, a popular microblogging site, and hashtags about it had garnered hundreds of millions of views. “You don’t have a heart,” wrote one Weibo user, addressing the show’s producers. Some people called for a boycott of Zhejiang Television, the state-owned channel that aired the show. Others argued that the government should regulate reality television shows, including game shows like “Chase Me,” more strictly, noting other cases of injury and death in the industry. “The show’s awareness of safety precautions is too poor,” Xu Zheng, a prominent actor and director, wrote on Weibo. “It must be held responsible!” Reality television shows have become very popular in China in recent years, especially online. A news article last year by Xinhua, the state news agency, said that the number of reality shows on streaming platforms had doubled last year from 2017, reaching 385. Even by the standards of such shows, “Chase Me,” which is in its first season, has pushed boundaries. The show invites actors as well as ordinary people to compete in variety of sports challenges, often to the point of exhaustion. Adrenaline-pumping moments are a staple, often filmed at night in a downtown stretch of Ningbo. In one recent episode, a professional boxer fell into a ball pit and struggled to emerge as his teammates watched on. Early on Wednesday, Mr. Gao was filming a guest appearance on the ninth episode of “Chase Me” when he collapsed, according to the statement by the show’s producers. The show’s medical staff tried to revive him, but when they could not, Mr. Gao was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead, the producers said. “We feel very grieved and extremely sad!” the statement said. Zhejiang Television issued a statement late Wednesday saying it deeply regretted Mr. Gao’s death and would take “corresponding responsibility.” The channel promised to improve safety at the network. Mr. Gao was known for his work as a model for Louis Vuitton, as well as his roles on several television shows and movies. He was the voice of Ken, opposite Barbie, in the Mandarin-language version of the 2010 movie “Toy Story 3” for its release in Taiwan. He also drew a following for his role as the high warlock of Brooklyn in the 2013 action film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.” With more than 5.7 million followers on Weibo, Mr. Gao had a loyal following in mainland China, where he was known for playing a disabled architect on a Chinese soap opera, “Remembering Lichuan.” There he often went by his Chinese name, Gao Yixiang. Mr. Gao’s agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on Wednesday. “He has unfortunately left us,” the agency said in a statement on Weibo. “It is shocking and terribly sorrowful to us. We cannot accept it even now!” On his Instagram account, Mr. Gao recently posted about taking part in a charity dinner and playing tennis with the actor Adam Sandler. “Everyone can make a difference,” he wrote in a post in July, “one small step at a time.” Wang Yiwei, Claire Fu and Albee Zhang contributed research.']","When the 35-year-old performer and model collapsed with an apparent heart attack during filming for a strenuous, stunt-filled series, it set off a wave of anger on Chinese social media."
U.K. Chief Rabbi Denounces Labour Party on Anti-Semitism,2019-11-26,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Britain’s chief rabbi chastised the Labour Party on Monday for its handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks, breaking rabbinical convention to join other Jewish institutions in cautioning people against supporting the party in next month’s election. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, reacted defiantly on Tuesday night, refusing to apologize in a BBC interview for his party’s response and defending the slow pace of some investigations into anti-Semitic remarks by party members. The chief rabbi’s rebuke instantly generated fierce debate among British Jews, with some seeing it as reflecting their fears of Labour and others saying that he did not speak for them. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, an Orthodox rabbi who used to lead a North London synagogue, suggested in an article in The Times of London that Mr.  Corbyn was “unfit for office.” “The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud — of dignity and respect for all people,” he wrote. Later in the article, he called it a “mendacious fiction” that Labour was doing everything it could to stamp out anti-Semitism in the party. “A new poison — sanctioned from the top — has taken root in the Labour Party,” he wrote, adding that in the election next month, “the very soul of our nation is at stake.” It was not the first time that British Jewish organizations — or even prominent rabbis — had spoken out strongly against Labour in recent weeks, though some observers called it the most remarkable, given the chief rabbi’s usual reluctance to get involved in party politics. The role of chief rabbi in Britain, unlike in other European countries, does not have formal ties to the state, though Prince Charles attended Rabbi Mirvis’s induction in 2013. Rabbi Mirvis leads a body of Orthodox congregations not only in Britain but across the Commonwealth; in Britain, those synagogues account for just over half of total synagogue membership, according to a 2010 report. Attacks on Labour’s handling of anti-Semitism have already become a centerpiece of the election campaign, and Britain’s Conservative Party quickly seized on Rabbi Mirvis’s remarks. The Church of England offered public support for the chief rabbi. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said the article “ought to alert us to the deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews.” But some British Jews also criticized the way Labour’s political opponents were putting Rabbi Mirvis’s words to use. Not all British Jews recognize the chief rabbi as the leader of their communities. And some people warned that Rabbi Mirvis had sidestepped a greater threat posed to Jews and other British minority groups by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has himself been accused of making racist and Islamophobic remarks and energizing parts of the far right similar to those responsible for recent attacks on Jews in the United States. “We understand why so many in our community feel unable to vote for the Labour party, however we must not make the mistake of thinking the Conservatives are a safer alternative,” an organization called Jews Against Boris wrote on Twitter. “This is a party which is courting nationalist votes by demonizing and threatening minorities, and undermining the rule of law. The idea that this would be a safe environment for Jews is incredibly dangerous.” The group, modeled in part on the efforts of American Jews to organize against President Trump, said keeping British Jews safe meant standing in solidarity “with all other communities experiencing oppression.” Rabbi Mirvis highlighted several episodes that have pained British Jews, among them the party’s handling of anti-Semitism complaints, Mr. Corbyn’s reluctance to adopt a widely accepted definition of anti-Semitism and his calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah “friends.” Mr. Corbyn later said he regretted using that language, and the Labour Party has always strongly denied turning a blind eye to anti-Semitism. But Mr. Corbyn only stoked more skepticism with his BBC interview on Tuesday night. Andrew Neil, the interviewer, repeatedly asked him whether it was anti-Semitic to say that the Rothschild banking family runs Israel and global governments, a false, age-old conspiracy theory. Mr. Corbyn sidestepped the question several times, before eventually calling it an “anti-Semitic trope.” He also denied that anti-Semitism had become a bigger problem in Labour under his watch. Mr. Corbyn said that he had strengthened the party’s oversight process and that he had spent his life fighting against racism in all forms. “We will in government, as in opposition, protect any community that’s under any threat from any sort,” Mr. Corbyn said. “We will not allow anti-Semitism in any form in our society because it is poisonous and divisive just as much as Islamophobia or far-right racism is.”']","The rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, suggested the opposition party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was “unfit for office,” adding that Britain’s soul was at stake in next month’s election."
Hong Kong Election Landslide Signals More Frictions With Beijing,2019-11-25,By Keith Bradsher,"['HONG KONG — In the run-up to local elections in Hong Kong on Sunday, Beijing and its allies in the city were portraying the vote as a way to hear the voice of a silent majority after nearly six months of increasingly violent antigovernment protests. Now, that majority has spoken — and it has come out overwhelmingly against Beijing and its allies. The city’s Beijing-backed establishment camp suffered a staggering defeat in elections for district councils as democracy advocates swept 87 percent of the seats, up from less than a third. Beijing and its supporters in Hong Kong, including the city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, must now reckon with a resounding, very public display of support for the democracy camp and the protest movement. “This election is not just about livelihood issues, but also a direct referendum regarding the justifiability of this regime,” Cary Lo, a newly elected district councilor supporting democracy, told reporters on Monday. “It has indicated that Carrie Lam’s government has lost its legitimacy.” What all sides agree on is that the election landslide puts China’s ruling Communist Party under even greater pressure to respond to the protest movement. Where their views differ is on what it means.  To the pro-democracy camp, that means addressing the broader Hong Kong public’s calls for more official accountability. Other politicians are concerned that the vote could be seen by Beijing as a sign that the territory is slipping further from its grip and requires a harsher response. The protesters started campaigning in June against a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Their demands have since morphed into broader calls for expanded democracy and an investigation into alleged police brutality. Beijing and its local allies had been convinced that the protest movement had antagonized the public by blocking roads and rail lines and scaring off shoppers and tourists. The democrats’ triumph at the polls showed instead that Hong Kong residents remain broadly sympathetic to the movement. The councils have very little actual power. They advise the government on neighborhood issues like the location of bus stops, not big questions like democracy. But the democrats’ victory also means that they will gain a larger say on the committee that chooses the territory’s chief executive in 2022. Democracy advocates were ebullient on Monday as they made clear they would continue to challenge government policies and stand in solidarity with antigovernment demonstrators. They walked as a group to Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where dozens of protesters have been trapped for more than a week by the police. “Save our brothers and sisters,” chanted Owan Li, a newly elected district councilor who is also a student member of the university’s management council. “We have shown the police force that university campuses are not to be trampled upon.” The victory in the district council races handed the pro-democracy movement a boost of confidence — and new financial support for its campaigners. (Council members earn about $50,000 a year for the part-time job.) The camp will now be looking at how it can build on this momentum to drum up support for legislative elections next year. The city’s pro-Beijing camp, in contrast, found itself in full retreat. Leaders of the main pro-Beijing political party gathered on Monday to bow their heads in a televised public apology. A federation of pro-Beijing labor unions which suffered heavy losses in district races on Sunday angrily blamed Mrs. Lam’s policies, seeking to distance itself from the unpopular administration. Mrs. Lam gave few clues on her next move, saying in a statement that the Hong Kong government would “listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect.” Now what remains to be seen is how Beijing will respond and one possibility is — it won’t. Leaders in Beijing may just ignore the outcome of the elections and maintain their hard line against the protest movement, which they have denounced as the work of foreign-backed separatist forces.  Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a powerful Beijing advisory group, said that the Communist Party had already decided at a high-level meeting last month that it would more closely oversee Hong Kong. Beijing would not allow the outcome of the local elections to affect that decision, and would not yield to the demands of protesters, he said in a telephone interview on Monday. “The gist of the decision is to strengthen Beijing’s leadership of the Hong Kong government and strengthen the protection of national security,” he said. Trying to put a positive spin on a huge electoral defeat, Mr. Lau said that with the democrats seizing control of 17 of the city’s 18 district councils — compared with none before — the opposition might find activism on councils to be an alternative to violence.  “The opposition forces will have a new platform to attack Beijing and the Hong Kong government,” he said. “At the same time, they will have less need to go to the streets.”  Ronny Tong, a pro-Beijing moderate in Mrs. Lam’s cabinet, also tried to find a glimmer of hope in the government’s crushing electoral defeat.  Mr. Tong said that the vote was proof that “democracy is alive and well” in Hong Kong — and there was no need for the United States to proceed with legislation to punish Hong Kong officials for their role in harsh police tactics. President Trump has not yet said if he will sign the legislation, which passed both houses with veto-proof margins. But Mr. Lau, the Beijing adviser, said that he believed either the Hong Kong government or the Communist Party would now have to push through stricter security legislation for the territory — a step that the democracy movement would be certain to oppose stridently. In China, the pro-Beijing camp’s defeat could only be seen as a repudiation of the party’s rule over the semiautonomous region, just weeks after President Xi Jinping gave Mrs. Lam his enthusiastic backing. The Chinese government’s reaction on Monday was strikingly muted, as if the authorities were surprised by the results. China’s state television network covered the voting extensively as it happened on Sunday, but then lapsed into silence once the outcome was clear.  A number of state media outlets, while not describing the results as either a win or loss, on Monday accused hostile foreign forces of aiding the opposition. A foreign ministry spokesman said Beijing would not brook any challenge to its sovereignty over the territory. “Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” said Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman.  Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said by telephone that the results in Hong Kong showed how out of touch the Communist leadership in Beijing was when it came to understanding popular sentiment and democratic processes. “Whenever China has tried to manage democracy, they have failed,” she said. “They are very bad at understanding democracies and how democratic societies function.” But democracy supporters and political analysts were also caught completely off guard by the scale of the victory, after predicting as late as Sunday afternoon that pro-Beijing politicians would keep control of most of the district councils. A rout by democracy advocates “was beyond our imagination,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at City University of Hong Kong and longtime democracy advocate. “No one could say that, they would think you were crazy.” Reporting was contributed by Steven Lee Myers in Beijing and Katherine Li and Ezra Cheung in Hong Kong.

Iran Strengthens Response to Protests,2019-11-27,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['The authorities in Iran strengthened their reprisals on Tuesday over the protests that engulfed the country last week, arresting “six main elements” accused of rioting in Tehran and penalizing Iranian journalists overseas who publicized the mayhem. Although internet service that had been suspended in Iran after the protests erupted has been partly restored, it may be curtailed indefinitely, government officials warned. Mobile phone access to the internet remains blocked. The intensified response to the protests, reported in official Iranian media, came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States government had received nearly 20,000 messages, videos, photographs and notes from Iranians after his call last week for evidence that the protests had been violently suppressed during the internet blackout. Mr. Pompeo, whose appeal to Iranians has enraged the Tehran leadership, did not specify what the received materials showed but said, “I hope they will continue to be sent to us.” The protests began peacefully over the government’s abrupt announcement on Nov. 15 that it was raising gasoline prices by as much as 200 percent and imposing a rationing system, with the proceeds from the higher prices going, it said, to needy Iranians in the form of cash subsidies. The changes took many people in Iran by surprise and their protests soon turned into violent demonstrations about a litany of grievances in the country of 80 million, where unemployment and inflation have been growing worse.  Many Iranians blame their government for the country’s economic travails, although at least some of the problems are linked to sanctions imposed by the United States. Iran’s leaders have accused a mix of enemies, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel, monarchists and seditionists, of exploiting the anger over the gasoline prices to stoke riots in dozens of cities and towns that were crushed by force within a few days.  Despite the internet shutdown that cut off much of the country, many videos and photos were posted that painted an anecdotal picture of widespread street clashes, burning buildings and shootings of unarmed demonstrators, presumably by members of the security forces.  The government has yet to report figures on casualties and arrests, but there are strong indications that the protests were the deadliest in the country since the election unrest that convulsed Iran a decade ago.  Amnesty International has said more than 140 people were killed, mostly by firearms — a figure that officials have criticized as speculative. Two journalists contacted inside the country, speaking on condition of anonymity because of concern for their safety, said they believed that the death toll was at least 218, based on coroners’ reports, with more than 1,900 people injured and at least 7,000 arrested. The government said last week that about 100 “ringleaders and masterminds” had been rounded up nationwide, and it indicated that more arrests were forthcoming. The police commander in Tehran, Mohsen Khancherli, said Tuesday that the authorities had “arrested six main elements behind violent riots that recently hit Tehran,” and that “the suspects had confessed to their acts of sabotage.” Officials also moved to punish Iranian journalists abroad who had reported on the protests remotely. The Judiciary announced “legal and judicial restrictions” on assets owned by Iranian reporters at Iran International, a Britain-based broadcaster that Iran’s state-owned PressTV news website described as a “Saudi-Zionist television channel.”  “The broadcaster was at work to disrupt Iran’s security, fan the flames of riots and organize acts of terror, subversion and secession across the country,” PressTV quoted the Judiciary announcement as saying. The government has warned Iranian journalists inside the country to strictly limit their accounts of the unrest. Last Friday Iranian intelligence agents were reported to have arrested Mohammad Mosaed, an independent economics reporter, at his home in Tehran after he had found a way to bypass the internet shutdown to post “Hello Free World!” on social media.  Iranians reached by telephone on Tuesday also said new anger was brewing over who would qualify for the cash subsidies created by increased gasoline prices.  Originally officials said 60 million Iranians — three-quarters of the population — would be eligible. But Mohammad Shariatmadari, the minister of labor and welfare, told Iranian state television that the government would have to examine the assets, bank accounts and trips abroad of all Iranians to ensure that only the neediest received the benefit. Some experts said that likely meant only about 20 million Iranians would be eligible. The increased cost of gasoline has already affected prices of everyday goods and transportation. Several Iranians reached in Tehran and other cities said the price of basic goods — rice, oil, bread and dairy — had increased between 5 percent and 10 percent. Iran’s official news agency reported that the costs of public transportation, messenger services and moving goods had spiked by nearly 50 percent. Lara Jakes contributed reporting.

"In Scotland, Brexit Is on the Line. So Is the Future of the U.K.",2019-11-27,By Stephen Castle,"['GLASGOW — Pushing purposefully through the crowd, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, stops abruptly, her path blocked by a well-wisher cradling a photogenic 5-month-old. Without hesitation, Ms. Sturgeon gathers the baby smoothly in her arms and slowly plants a kiss on his forehead, as the cameras click in unison. Seen by many as Britain’s most effective party leader, Ms. Sturgeon is not even running in the Dec. 12 general election because she sits in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not the British one at Westminster. But as leader of the buoyant pro-independence and anti-Brexit Scottish National Party, she is the face of its campaign for Scotland’s 59 parliamentary seats in Westminster. The success of that campaign could determine whether Britain leaves the European Union in January — and, if it does, whether the United Kingdom survives the rupture. At a recent and well orchestrated visit to a charity in a gritty part of Glasgow, Ms. Sturgeon was everywhere, helping out at a numeracy class, performing a gym workout and, in the kitchen, ladling out bowls of thick lentil soup.  “This is definitely the most important general election we have had in Scotland in my lifetime because the future of our country is on the line,” she said once the food was served. “We are at a crossroads, and the outcome of this election will decide which path we go down and who decides our future.” According to opinion polls, the Scottish National Party, which already holds 35 of Scotland’s British parliamentary seats, is poised to gain even more. If it takes enough votes from the Conservative Party, which holds 13 seats there, it could deprive Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the majority he needs to pursue Brexit. If that were to happen, it could make Ms. Sturgeon a kingmaker, and her price for supporting a minority Labour government could be permission from that government to allow Scotland to hold another independence referendum. Scotland rejected independence in 2014, but Brexit has scrambled its politics since then. Not so long ago, Labour was a dominant force in Scotland. But Ms. Sturgeon, who became party leader in 2014, scored a dramatic victory in the 2015 general election, when her party won all but three Scottish parliamentary seats. Some were then lost in a snap election two years ago.  While she has faced criticism over the quality of Scottish health and education, Ms. Sturgeon’s success is a symbol of how Scotland is diverging politically from England. Mr. Johnson’s pledge to “get Brexit done” has struck a chord with many there but often falls flat north of the border. His shambling, confected upper-class English persona tends to go down badly with Scots, a majority of whom voted against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. And while Brexit is a critical political battleground in Scotland, for many it pales before the issue of Scottish independence. Scots seem to be losing faith in their centuries-old union with England, with one recent survey showing that less than half of those polled said they thought the United Kingdom would survive in its current form for the next five years, and less than a third expressed confidence that it would do so for the next decade. “The ties that bind us together have weakened,” said Henry McLeish, a former first minister of Scotland and Labour Party politician. “If we weren’t part of the U.K. right now, would we want to join? I don’t think so.”  To advance her cause, Ms. Sturgeon’s party must win seats like Stirling, a large constituency with affluent towns, working-class communities and villages, where the fate of Scotland was determined in earlier times: at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, when William Wallace routed the English, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when England’s Edward II was defeated.  So steeped is this place in history that the local Conservative Party’s motto is the old saying, “He who holds Stirling holds Scotland.” Yet the Tories’ grip on Stirling could scarcely be more tenuous: They took the seat from the Scottish National Party in 2017 by just 148 votes. Mr. Johnson’s machinations to achieve Brexit have not added to their popularity there, but the situation is fluid, given the political crosscurrents of Brexit and the independence issue. Knocking doors in Bannockburn, the Scottish National Party candidate, Alyn Smith, says his priority is to “stop Brexit and to focus on the things that matter to people here,” adding that Scots had lost faith in what they thought was a partnership of equals. “The Brexit vote has brought home to a number of people that the U.K. doesn’t work the way you thought it does,” Mr. Smith said, as he tried to persuade voters to open their doors on a dark, cold and rainy evening. One who did, Christopher Wilson, a taxi driver, welcomed Mr. Smith into his home. “I never voted for Brexit — I voted to stay in the E.U. and I feel that my voice is not being heard,” said Mr. Wilson, who also strongly favors Scottish independence. But what if you are part of the large group of people who dislike Brexit but also, with the Conservatives, oppose Scottish independence? On the scenic, undulating, golf course at Bridge of Allan, a well-heeled town north of Stirling, Fiona Darroch, who is retired, said she will definitely not support the Scottish National Party even though she is no Brexit enthusiast. “In Scotland a majority don’t want to go out of the United Kingdom,” she said, walking down to the green. “England is our neighbor and our family. I don’t want a border,” added Ms. Darroch, who said that she would normally vote Conservative but planned this time to switch to the pro-European Liberal Democrats. Such defections could be lethal for the Conservative candidate, Stephen Kerr, but the focus on independence has given the Tories a lifeline even after a setback when their popular former leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, stepped down.  Mr. Kerr’s strategy is to court opponents of independence, even if they dislike Mr. Johnson and his no-holds-barred battle for Brexit. And Mr. Kerr says he is winning over working-class folk who were “never going to be Conservative voters — never — but are voting Conservative on the basis of lending me their support in order to protect the union.” The Conservatives can be more confident of holding another seat that Ms. Sturgeon’s party is targeting, Banff and Buchan, a coastal area north of Aberdeen, where their majority is 3,693. Support for Brexit was significant there in 2016, partly because of hopes that the fishing industry could gain from leaving the European Union. Inside the big fish market in the port town of Peterhead, the majority opinion is pro-Brexit, although Andrew Charles, who supports the Scottish National Party, says that under Mr. Johnson’s plan the export part of his business would be uneconomical because of the added certification costs. Graeme Smart, whose fishing vessel, the Shaulora, was moored outside, was among the one million Scots who voted for Brexit, and though his faith has weakened somewhat, he will probably support Mr. Johnson. “He’s the U.K.’s Donald Trump,” Mr. Smart said as the Shaulora’s crew unloaded 65 boxes of prawns. “I wouldn’t believe a word the man says, but I would probably vote for him.”  Mr. Smart knows that leaving the European Union is only the prelude to negotiating a trade deal with the bloc, and that “the biggest problem is that once we get Brexit we need a close relationship with Europe to sell our fish.” But once again the conversation turns to the other big constitutional question. “The S.N.P. keeps saying that people want independence — the fishing industry doesn’t want independence,” Mr. Smart added, mindful that much of the fish landed here is consumed in England. Across Scotland, focus on these two constitutional issues has put a further squeeze on the opposition Labour Party. In 2005, Labour won 41 Scottish seats but, a decade later, held just one in the 2015 election, though that rose to seven in 2017. Labour is under pressure again, mainly because its relatively neutral policy on Brexit, and its grudging willingness to contemplate a second vote on Scottish independence, makes it sound fuzzy on the biggest two questions. According to Mr. McLeish, Labour in Scotland lost traction to the Scottish National Party by underestimating it. “We became massively complacent,” he said. In the final analysis, independence seems likely to rise on the Scottish agenda no matter who wins the election. If Labour deprives Mr. Johnson of a majority and needs the support of the Scottish National Party, that could open the way to a quick second independence referendum, while a Conservative sweep would lead to a Brexit that most Scots oppose. “If Johnson and the Tories at Westminster continue to behave as they are,” said Mr. McLeish, “there’s not going to be any great day when we wake up with 60 percent in favor of independence, but we are going to drift slowly towards that outcome.”']","The Scots could decide the outcome of Britain’s election next month, the future of Brexit and maybe even the survival of the United Kingdom.

Death of Colombian Teenager Drives Protesters Back to Streets,2019-11-27,By Alan Yuhas,"['Two days after a police projectile sent 18-year-old Dilan Cruz to the hospital, his sister spoke at his high school, pleading for peace in Colombia after five straight days of anti-government protests.  “What we want most right now is for him to recover,” his sister, Denis Cruz, said Monday. “We want what happened with Dilan not to be used for more riots, to create more violence.”  “The only thing we’re also asking for from my family,” she said, “is peace.”  But that night, Dilan died of the head injury, and protesters again flooded into the streets of Bogotá on Tuesday, calling the teenager a victim of police brutality. The death has fueled still more anger among the tens of thousands of people who have for days protested against corruption and the conservative policies of President Iván Duque.  Mr. Duque tried to quell the anger by meeting Tuesday with protest leaders for what he called a “great national dialogue.” But it was unclear what the meeting accomplished, other than having given protesters a forum to air grievances. For now, the crisis appears to have no end in sight. The protests began with a general strike last Thursday. More than 200,000 people took to the streets on the first day, the police estimated.  The strike was organized by students, unions and Indigenous people opposed to proposed changes to Colombia’s pension and labor laws. But as the days passed, thousands of other Colombians joined the marches to express anger about inequality, corruption and possible austerity measures. In recent months, wallet issues have also driven mass protests in Chile, Lebanon and other nations. Mr. Cruz was the fourth person to be killed in the demonstrations, which for the most part have been peaceful, though a few have deteriorated into riots and looting.  The protesters are also demonstrating against rising violence in the countryside, which has been linked to drug traffickers, rebel groups like the National Liberation Army and former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, who have returned to arms. Although Colombia and the FARC reached a peace agreement in September 2016, thousands of militants have resumed fighting, and at least 500 activists and community leaders have been killed. Mr. Duque’s government, which took over in August 2018, has been accused of being slow to put the terms of the agreement into action. Videos of the moments before and after Mr. Cruz was struck by a police projectile on Saturday showed riot police officers walking down a street, behind crowds of protesters. After a loud bang, Mr. Cruz can be seen collapsed on the street, with people rushing to help him. Mr. Cruz had a visible head injury. The police have not said what struck him, but some protesters say it was a tear-gas canister.  His death prompted an outpouring of grief and anger. Protesters marched late into the night, banging pots and pans and chanting, “Dilan didn’t die, Dilan was killed.” The president, police officials and the nation’s prosecutor general all expressed their condolences, and Mr. Duque said he had ordered “an urgent investigation to clarify quickly what happened and determine responsibility.” His critics have demanded greater accountability. Senator Iván Cepeda Castro called Mr. Cruz a “symbol of the policy of human rights violations” that the president has been pursuing. And José Miguel Vivanco, executive director for Human Rights Watch in the Americas, called for immediate measures from the attorney general and the Defense Ministry to ensure that there are no more fatalities.  “Besides condolences, we need justice,” he said. For protesters, Mr. Cruz’s name has become a rallying cry, and they have called for another national strike. One student association said he represented “a generation that was robbed of its rights but that will not be robbed of dignity.” Protest organizers planned more demonstrations in his memory on Wednesday.  Mr. Duque, Colombia’s president, met with a committee of protest leaders on Tuesday, but the talks appeared to end inconclusively after two hours.  The protesters have demanded talks outside of Mr. Duque’s “national dialogue,” but so far the president has insisted on meetings that include representatives from the courts, the business community and other sectors. Mr. Duque has denied supporting rumored changes to the pension system and labor laws, including a cut to the minimum wage for young people.']","Dilan Cruz, 18, died after being struck by a police projectile.

A Montreal Bagel War Unites Rival Kings,2019-11-26,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Irwin Shlafman, the owner of Fairmount Bagel, boasts that his bagels were the first in outer space, when his astronaut cousin brought them to the International Space Station.  He also says Fairmount, founded in 1919, is the oldest bagel joint in town.  Just don’t tell that to his arch-bagel-rival, Joe Morena, the jovial owner of nearby St-Viateur Bagel. He contends that his bagel place, opened in 1957, is Montreal’s longest continuously running bagel outfit, since Fairmount was closed for a time.  “His bagels went to the moon, yeah, sure,” Mr. Morena said. “But the oldest? Give me one iota of proof!” The two men are competitors in the business of Montreal bagels, which have a distinctive flavor from being boiled in honey-infused water before being baked in a wood-burning oven.  These days, however, Mr. Shlafman and Mr. Morena are united against a common threat — environmentalists who want to abolish the pollutant-producing ovens where the bagels are made.  The battle heated up late last year when rumors began to circulate that a City Hall official was planning to ban the ovens, which emit fine particles that can aggravate respiratory ailments like asthma. Angry neighbors had complained to the city and some were boycotting the vaunted bagel shops. Coming to the defense of the bagels were fans who treasure the carb-heavy snack as an essential part of the city’s Jewish history and social fabric. Montreal bagels have become a global culinary emblem of the city, alongside smoked meat and poutine, and are doughy unifiers in a majority French-speaking province buffeted by identity politics.  But choosing between Fairmount and St-Viateur has long been a fault line in Montreal, akin to a New Yorker choosing between the Yankees or the Mets.  The Montreal bagel has such a hold on the Canadian psyche that fears of its demise spurred a national outcry. “The Death of the Montreal Bagel?” asked a story last year in The Globe and Mail, a leading national newspaper. Joseph Rosen, a humanities professor from the area, said the issue was so polarizing that neighbors on either end of the bagel rift were no longer speaking.  “People were shockingly divided,” Mr. Rosen said. “The bagel is one of the few things that bring Montrealers together, like Leonard Cohen or the Montreal Canadiens hockey team.”  Sarah Hanneman, who lives next to Fairmount, said the smoke from its oven was so bad she couldn’t bear opening her window in the summer and had trouble breathing. She stressed she has nothing against bagels. “They should get rid of the wood-burning ovens and market their bagels as green bagels,” she said. “But every time the city suggests banning the ovens, people cry, ‘You can’t take away my bagels!’” Mr. Morena, at St-Viateur, dismissed what he called anti-bagel “radicals.” “Why are they picking on small mom-and-pop bagel shops?” he asked, standing under St-Viateur’s wall of fame showing local celebrity patrons like Celine Dion.  “I want to be able to say that my bagels are hand rolled and cooked in a wood burning oven,” he said. “That’s what makes a Montreal bagel.” He also says St-Viateur “bagels are like snowflakes,” each with a different shape, while Mr. Shlafman lauds his Fairmount bagels for their symmetry. Jenna LeBlanc, an environmental scientist who is a bagel supporter, put it this way: “Some things just bring you comfort and joy,” she said on a recent pilgrimage to Fairmount with her mother. For the moment, the bagel war is at an impasse. City Hall is considering a regulation that would require businesses with wood-burning ovens to install purifiers. Fairmount Bagel said it had already done so, while St-Viateur has installed a filter in one of its seven locations.  But the authorities in the area have banned new businesses from installing such ovens, causing alarm that the art of Montreal bagel-making could disappear.  Both outfits have their flagships in Mile End, a multicultural, hipster enclave where Hasidim wearing large black hats walk hurriedly down the same streets where young women with nose rings carry yoga mats. For Mr. Shlafman, whose grandfather Isadore founded Fairmount after he came to Montreal from Kyiv, Ukraine, keeping Montreal bagels alive is a family imperative.  “My father, Jack, used to talk about bagels as if they were people,” Mr. Shlafman, 63, said on a recent day as he rolled bagels at breakneck speed in Fairmount’s cramped kitchen in Mile End, the only outpost of the store. “Everyone knows the Shlafmans are the original bagelmen.”  And lest anyone think his bagels-in-space story is just family lore, it’s not: Gregory Chamitoff, his relative and a Canadian astronaut, carried 18 bagels aloft in 2008. Such is the pull of the Montreal bagel that a Japanese tourist once arrived in a limousine in front of Fairmount Bagel, holding a map with a line of dots leading from Osaka to the bagel shop. And St-Viateur once received an order for 20 dozen bagels for Prince Charles. Mr. Morena thought it was a joke until a British naval officer arrived to pick them up.  Messing with the Montreal bagel would come at too high a price, said Bill Brownstein, a veteran columnist for The Montreal Gazette, whose book about Schwartz’s, a venerable Montreal deli, was turned into a musical. He noted that, in a province that recently passed a law banning teachers, judges and police from wearing religious symbols like turbans or skullcaps while at work, the bagel had become a secular symbol of civic pride. That, he added, was helped by its manifest superiority to New York bagels. “New York bagels are like rolls with holes, they are tasteless,” he said. “Toronto’s are even worse, they taste like paperweights or hockey pucks. In the minds of Montrealers, every other bagel is ‘Meh.’” Some New Yorkers retort that Montreal bagels are sweeter, and therefore more like doughnuts than bagels, a criticism that Lesley Chesterman, a leading Montreal food critic, called “absurd.” (In fact, baking bagels Montreal-style now has New York adherents.) Mr. Morena began rolling bagels at 15, after his family emigrated from Salerno, Italy. He was given the Yiddish name “Yossel” by St-Viateur’s Jewish founder, Myer Lewkowicz, a Holocaust survivor.  Eventually, Mr. Morena took over the business. The bagel was a powerful example of immigrant success. “Look at me — I’m an Italian guy running a Jewish business,” he said. While the origin of the bagel is the subject of Talmudic-style debate, Mr. Shlafman of Fairmount traced it to a 17th-century Jewish baker who made bagels as a homage to a Polish king. But other experts say the bagel is a relative of the pretzel. Fairmount has had a few milestones. In 1952, Mr. Shlafman recalled, an elderly Jewish man came in with a bag of sesame seeds, complaining that poppy seeds got stuck in his dentures. Soon, the news spread among the close-knit Jewish community, and the sesame seed bagel became a Montreal fixture. Today, Fairmount, like bagel stores elsewhere, sells varieties like blueberry and muesli bagels. On a recent day, long lines snaked outside both shops, which are open 24/7. Fairmount Bagel’s front door doesn’t have a lock. And which bagels are better — St-Viateur’s or Fairmount’s?  “Who makes the better bagel,” said Montreal’s mayor, Valérie Plante, “is a question which Montrealers will forever debate.”']",A culinary symbol of Montreal has become ensnared in a battle pitting environmentalists against bagel-loving traditionalists.
Helicopter Crash in Mali Kills 13 French Troops,2019-11-26,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — A midair collision of two helicopters killed 13 French soldiers on Monday night in Mali, French officials announced Tuesday morning, the deadliest single incident for the French Army in nearly four decades. The soldiers were part of the 4,500-strong French force that has been in place in the Sahel region of West Africa since 2013 to combat the violent jihadism that has spread across the region, plaguing several countries. The two French Army helicopters were supporting a ground operation of French commandos that was battling a group of jihadists traveling across the desert scrub in pickup trucks and on motorcycles, military officials said. One of the helicopters had been deployed to “allow for the immediate exfiltration of elements on the ground,” an army news release stated. Flying at low altitude, the two helicopters crashed into each other. “It was very dark,” the French defense minister, Florence Parly, said at an afternoon news conference. “It was moonless.” The soldiers on the ground had already engaged the jihadists, Ms. Parly said, and they had asked for air support. She said the “combat and operational conditions are extremely demanding.” There were no survivors among the French soldiers, officials said. Those killed were commandos and “elite soldiers” of the ground army, Ms. Parly said. The crash occurred in what is currently the most sensitive and Islamist-plagued zone, Mali’s southeast, near the lawless border with Niger. The authority of the government in these border zones, far from the capital, is minimal. “These 13 heroes had just one goal: to protect us,” President Emmanuel Macron wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. French forces in the region are seen as essential support to weak local armies that have been struggling to contain the threat from Islamic State-affiliated extremists. Attacks are frequent and the armies in Mali and in Burkina Faso appear powerless either to head them off or to limit their own losses. Just a week ago, 24 Malian soldiers were killed in the same region when their patrol was attacked. The Malians said 17 jihadists had also been killed. At the beginning of November, jihadists associated with the Islamic State attacked the Malian military base of Indelimane, killing about 50 soldiers. Monday evening’s crash occurred about 17 miles south of Indelimane. French losses have been lighter — 38 killed since the French military first intervened to head off a jihadist advance in Mali almost seven years ago. But the continuing attacks, the acknowledged failure so far of French forces to bring the Sahel armies up to speed, and the impunity with which the jihadist bands operate have raised questions in France about the usefulness of Operation Barkhane, as the French deployment is called. On Tuesday, far-left representatives in the French Parliament called on the government to think about pulling out. But French military officials, in a recent briefing for journalists in Paris, gave no hint of any near-term pullout — on the contrary, they indicated that the French forces would be in the region indefinitely. Those officials confirmed the July statement of General François Lecointre, chief of the general staff, who told French television that without his country’s forces, the Sahel governments “would collapse on themselves.” The military officials said that jihadists in the region were not strong enough to mount attacks on national capitals and did not control any territory but that they had been effective in persistently sapping the resources and authority of the national governments. “They want to show that the states are weak,” said an officer at the briefing.']",The midair collision of two helicopters was the deadliest incident in decades for the French military. The troops were part of a French force combating Islamist extremists.
"3 Afghan Schools, 165 Accounts of Students Being Raped",2019-11-25,By David Zucchino and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The 14-year-old Afghan boy said his teacher had asked him for “a little favor” in return for not failing him on his final exams. Then the man took him to the school library, locked the door and raped him, the boy said.  At the same school, a 17-year-old boy reported similar treatment from the school’s principal. He said the man had threatened to kill him if he told anyone. But the boys did talk, giving their accounts to a child advocacy group in their province and repeating them later in interviews with The New York Times. The advocacy group discovered that those two boys were not the only victims. From just three schools in one area of Logar Province, south of the Afghan capital, the group said it had taken statements from 165 boys who said they had been sexually abused at their schools, or by local officials they went to for help.  Now, Afghanistan is again caught up in discussion of rampant sexual abuse of children, and of a deep reluctance by many officials to deal with the issue at all. After talking with the TOLO news channel about the investigation, the leader of the Logar advocacy group, Mohammad Musa, and a colleague, Ehsanullah Hamidi, were detained by Afghanistan’s national intelligence agency late last week, the group says. On Monday, former President Hamid Karzai said that if verified, the detention of Mr. Musa by the intelligence agency was “a very wrong thing.” A spokesman for the National Directorate of Security declined to comment Monday. Mr. Musa has not been reachable for comment since late Thursday.  Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state, said on Twitter that the United States was closely following the case and was “greatly concerned.” He called on the Afghan government “to take action to protect survivors and bring perpetrators to justice.” It is unclear whether the cases at the three schools are related. But the prevalence of systematic sexual abuse of boys in Afghanistan has been a problem for generations.  Bacha bazi — it means boy play — is common among men in powerful positions who keep boys as sex slaves. Bacha bazi boys are forced to dress as girls and to dance for men before being raped. Sometimes the boys are prostituted to the highest bidder. In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Musa said that his group — the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution — began intensively investigating after a troubling Facebook post in May that showed men with boys in sexual positions. One video provided by the group shows a teenage boy dancing barefoot for about two dozen men who stand or sit in a circle around him. The post came down quickly, Mr. Musa said, but the group was able to preserve many of the images. Some of the boys were recognizable, and had complained of sexual abuse before, he said.  The Logar group began methodically talking to students in the area, finding dozens who said they had been raped. Many of their accounts were confirmed by teachers or other people in the area, who along with four of the boys were also interviewed by The Times.  As the accounts unfolded, at least seven boys who said they had been raped were found dead, Mr. Musa said, most likely at the hands of their own families.  Mr. Musa said that the advocacy group took the boys’ statements to Logar provincial police, but that no action was taken. He said several boys who had agreed to be questioned by the police were subsequently raped by officers. Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar provincial police, said the accusations were false. “Nobody has come to the police for rape cases,” he said. “It’s just rumors.” The Logar provincial governor, Mohammad Anwar Ashaqzai, said officials were examining boys’ statements provided by the advocacy group. He said he was not aware of any rapes in the province’s schools. “If we find these documents are incomplete and they are fake, then those who are involved will face the law and should be punished,” Mr. Ashaqzai said. Still, in response to the group’s accusations, the Ministry of Education in Kabul said on Nov. 14 that it was sending a delegation to the province to investigate. In Logar, Shafiullah Afghanzai, the executive officer of Hamid Karzai high school, where the 14-year-old and the 17-year-old said they had been raped, told The Times that the school’s headmaster had been transferred to another district earlier this year after he was accused of sexually assaulting a boy.  Mr. Afghanzai said boys had also been raped by teachers at two other schools in the province. He said three boys who had reported rapes were later killed by the Taliban, who condemn the sexual abuse as anti-Islamic. “If they get evidence that teachers were involved, they will hang them,” Mr. Afghanzai said of the militants. A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Hassibullah Stanikzai, the head of the Logar provincial council, said the bodies of several boys had been found in areas of Logar under Taliban control. But he said there was no evidence that their deaths were related to sexual assault. A teacher at one school in Logar, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Hamid, said he had spoken to 13 boys who said they had been raped by teachers there. He said the families of three of those boys had moved away to avoid the social stigma of rape, especially after images were posted on Facebook. “It’s a crisis,” Hamid said. “We want to do something to stop this mafia, but we don’t know what to do.” Mr. Musa, of the advocacy group, said 25 families abandoned their homes in shame after their sons said they had been raped. In some cases, he said, the boys’ faces had been visible in images on the anonymous Facebook page before it was taken down. In several cases, boys had been banished from home by their fathers, Mr. Musa said. “We don’t trust anyone, neither the Taliban nor the government,” Mr. Musa said. One school is in an area contested by the Taliban, and two are in government-controlled areas. Wakil Kaliwal, the head of the education department in Logar, said there were perhaps one or two cases of student rape in the province’s schools but no epidemic of sexual assault. He said the principal at Hamid Karzai high school had been transferred for beating a boy but also had been accused of raping another boy. Mr. Kaliwal added, referring to sexual assaults of boys: “It is an issue across the country and Logar isn’t exceptional.” Mohammad Qasim Sediqqi, a member of the Logar provincial council, said there was no evidence of widespread rape in schools. “Maybe there are one or two cases, because this is Afghanistan and crime exists everywhere,” he said. President Ashraf Ghani, who is from Logar, promised in 2015 to crack down on bacha bazi. But pederasty is still widely tolerated in Afghan culture, and prosecutions of men who sexually assault boys are rare. An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by the Afghan security forces or others in power, and that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a first sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. That article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction on the military’s reticence to confront the abuse.  Afghanistan made bacha bazi and related offenses violations of the national criminal code in May 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up to three years in prison — three to five years if the dancing is “a public event.” If a teacher, instructor or “superior in any way is involved,” the penalty is five years in prison.  But Charu Lata Hogg, executive director of All Survivors Project, a human rights group based in Liechtenstein, said the group interviewed 24 male rape victims in four Afghan provinces, not including Logar. “We found that sexual violence against boys and young men is pervasive and happens within communities, police checkpoints and in detention settings,” Ms. Hogg said. She said her group welcomed the 2017 laws, but she added that the authorities must “apply the law and hold perpetrators to account.” In a 2018 report, the United Nations documented 78 cases of sexual assault against boys in Afghanistan, adding, “Impunity for perpetrators remains a serious challenge.” Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, called on the authorities to investigate the Logar allegations and prosecute anyone involved. She asked government officials to protect members of the advocacy group and refrain from “the language of fear and intimidation.” Amnesty International warned that the two detained rights activists were at risk of torture “and other ill-treatment” as long as they remained in custody. Lyla Lynn Schwartz, who counsels victims of trauma in Afghanistan, including rape, said Afghan boys raped by men often suffer extreme emotional and psychological distress, often for the rest of their lives. The victims are often ostracized, or even attacked, by their family members over a perceived dishonor.  The 17-year-old from Hamid Karzai high school said in an interview that he was left homeless after his father banished him. He said he no longer attends school. “My father says if he sees me again,” he said, “he will kill me.”  Reporting was contributed by Farooq Jan Mangal from Khost, Afghanistan, and by a New York Times journalist from Logar Province.']","An advocacy group says it has documented systematic sexual abuse  by teachers, principals and other authorities of dozens of boys in one rural area."
Iraq Protesters Burn Down Iran Consulate in Night of Anger,2019-11-27,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Iraqi protesters in the southern city of Najaf burned down the Iranian Consulate there on Wednesday night in an outburst of anger at Iran, witnesses said.  Video showed sizable crowds outside the consulate shouting “Out, out Iran!” and waving Iraqi flags as the building burned.  Thirty-five protesters and 32 members of the Iraqi security forces were injured, according to the police in Najaf.  No Iranian diplomats were in the building at the time, according to witnesses and Iranian news media, and there were no reports of Iranian casualties. But the attack struck a significant symbolic blow against Iran, which places a high value on its outposts in the Shiite Muslim heartland of southern Iraq. Najaf houses important Shiite shrines, and Iran’s presence in the city demonstrates its ties to this ancient site. Iraqi secular and religious authorities condemned the violence but did not blame any particular group. The government imposed a curfew in Najaf until further notice.  [Update: Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said he would resign amid protests.] The attack on the consulate comes amid widespread antigovernment protests, which began nearly two months ago in Baghdad. The demonstrations started as a demand for jobs and better government services but have broadened into a call for a change in government, which the demonstrators see as corrupt and beholden to Iran.  Many of the political parties who dominate the Iraq’s Parliament have ties to Iran.  The attack on the consulate “sends a clear message that a segment of the Iraqi society rejects the Iranian political presence in the country and holds it accountable for bringing this government,” said Sheikh Fadhil al-Budayri, a senior cleric in Najaf.  This was the second attempt in a month by protesters to burn the Iranian consulate in Najaf. In the first attempt, Molotov cocktails were thrown over the consulate walls but the flames were put out and the damage was limited.  The demonstrators in Najaf are almost all Shiites, and Shiite religious authorities there have encouraged the protests, although they have insisted that they remain peaceful. The Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, has faced intense pressure to resolve the standoff between the protesters and the government. Although he usually tries to stay out of direct involvement in Iraqi politics, he has urged restraint by the government and admonished the protesters to refrain from violence. However, he has used increasingly strong language urging the government to make far-reaching changes in its election law, to crack down on corruption and to accommodate the demands of the “peaceful protesters.”  The majority of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but in Baghdad, the capital, and in the south, the security forces have shot unarmed demonstrators, killing more than 320 and wounding as many as 15,000 since the protests began, according to the United Nations office in Iraq.  In a number of places, protesters have set fire to the headquarters of political parties, damaged government buildings and engaged in revenge killings. Several analysts predicted that Iran would pressure the Iraqi government to have a tough response to the Najaf attack.  “For the Iranians having something like this happen in Najaf is highly symbolic, and they will retaliate either through the Iraqi government or through their tentacles inside Iraqi society,” said Abbas Kadhim, director of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council.  In addition to having allies in Iraq’s government, Iran has ties to several militias, known as popular mobilization forces. These militias have recently been incorporated into Iraq’s security forces, but there are fears that Iran might exert pressure on them to act in its interests. Within hours of the attack on the consulate, it appeared that Iran was preparing to strike back through these militias. The leader of those forces, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, framed the attack on the consulate as an attack on Ayatollah al-Sistani. “We will cut off the hand that attempts to get close to Marjaiyia Sayyid al-Sistani,” he said, using an honorific for the ayatollah. The statement appeared to be laying out a justification for future militia attacks on protesters by casting the response as a defense of Ayatollah al-Sistani. In a live report from Najaf, Iran’s state television reported Wednesday night that the consulate had been completely burned down and referred to the Iraqi protesters as “rioters and hooligans.” “The Iraqi forces just watched and did nothing,” the reporter said. “Hooligans entered the consulate in Najaf and completely burned it down.” Iran, which has faced its own protests over an increase in gas prices in recent weeks, did not hesitate to quash those demonstrations, killing and arresting hundreds of people. By contrast, the antigovernment protests in Iraq and neighboring Lebanon have continued for a couple of months and the two governments have largely tolerated them.  Conservative Iranian commentators saw a connection between the consulate attack and the Iranian protests, blaming foreign powers for both of them. “Saudi-imported thugs hit a brick wall inside Iran so they took out their frustration at Iran’s consulate in Najaf,” tweeted Farshad Mehdipour, founder of a hard-line newspaper. Iran has deep ties to Najaf. Millions of Iranian pilgrims worship at its Shiite shrines, and Iran has invested heavily in projects to refurbish and renovate the religious sites.  But Iran has also begun to send more of its own clerics to Najaf, pushing its branch of Shiism in which the chief religious leader is also the supreme political leader. Iraq has rejected that form of theocracy and has increasingly chafed against Iran’s interference in Iraq’s political life, which many Iraqis view as having encouraged corruption.  Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that the attack was mainly a symptom of the protesters’ frustrations with the Iraqi government, which has failed to make the changes being demanded. And the protesters see Iran’s influence as part of the problem.  “What we are seeing on the street is a revolt against the status quo — and the protector of the status quo is Tehran,” she said. Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting from New York, and Qassim al-Kaabi from Najaf.']","Antigovernment demonstrators, who have demanded an end to Iranian influence in Iraq, attacked the consulate in the city of Najaf."
Mexican Leader Draws Line on Trump Terrorist Plan: ‘Interventionism: No’,2019-11-27,By Kirk Semple and Lara Jakes,"['CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — A border wall. Mass deportations. Punishing tariffs. A halt to foreign aid. An end to a decades-old trade deal. For years, President Trump has pressured or wielded threats against Mexico, hoping to force a policy change, excite his political base, or both. This week, he did it again, announcing that he planned to designate Mexican drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations. Mr. Trump, who made the remarks in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, didn’t specify which of the mosaic of criminal groups he intended to slap with the label. But the reaction in Mexico has been swift — and negative — as the nation considered the implications. Mexican officials have suggested that the terrorist designations could challenge their nation’s sovereignty, and the foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, is seeking high-level talks with Trump administration officials about the matter. Some analysts raised the specter of armed drone strikes on Mexican soil, or other covert American actions against drug traffickers, potentially without the knowledge or consent of the Mexican government. Speaking on Wednesday, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador mostly demurred on the subject, but hinted that he did not welcome the prospect of secret American operations on Mexican territory. “Cooperation: yes,” he said of the relationship between Mexico and the United States. “Interventionism: no.” Mr. Trump said that he planned to designate Mexican drug “cartels” as foreign terrorist organizations because of the high number of Americans killed by their activities, and that he had been working on the listing for three months. In the exchange, posted on Mr. O’Reilly’s personal website, Mr. O’Reilly asked the president whether he was going to “start hitting them with drones.” The president replied, “I don’t want to say what I am going to do, but they will be designated.” Last March, Mr. Trump also openly floated the idea of the designation, saying in an interview with Breitbart News that he was thinking “very seriously” about it.  But a groundswell of support, mainly among conservatives, gained momentum in recent weeks after the killing of three mothers and six of their children, all dual Mexican and American citizens, who were part of a fundamentalist Mormon community in northern Mexico.  The State Department declined to comment on Wednesday, referring several questions to the White House about how many cartels Mr. Trump was looking to designate, or when a decision might be made. It is not new for the United States to consider listing drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Members of Congress have made similar requests during past presidential administrations, said Jason Blazakis, the former director of the State Department’s office of counterterror finance and designations. But, Mr. Blazakis said, the United States has largely resisted adding them to official terror organization lists out of concern that it would be a mostly symbolic step that eats up already-scarce resources and could do more damage to diplomacy than good. Other analysts warned that the designation could undermine or disrupt the carefully tuned relationship between the United States and Mexico, a complex arrangement developed over generations of administrations and covering a broad range of issues, including trade, crime-fighting, finance, migration, tourism and culture. Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington, warned that the Trump administration could use the terrorist designation to block loans to Mexico from international financial institutions and even restrict imports to the United States from Mexico. But some analysts said that Mr. Trump’s announcement could force the Mexican government to strengthen its fight against criminal groups and the corruption that allows them to prosper. Mr. López Obrador has struggled to define a coherent security strategy, and violence has continued to soar during his administration.  “This could also be beneficial for Mexico, since the United States can force Mexico to come up with a more serious security strategy,” said Guillermo Valdés, a former director of Mexico’s National Intelligence Center. It would not be the first time Mr. Trump has tried to exploit a weakness in Mr. López Obrador’s  policies to force change. This year, Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on Mexico pressured the López Obrador administration to crack down on illegal migration. “On one hand, there is the arbitrariness and aggression of the Trump administration,” Mr. Valdés said. “And on the other hand, it is also true that there is a lack of security strategy, and what has been tested so far has resulted in utter failure. So, we are at the junction of these two elements.” Mr. Trump could take a few avenues to listing the cartels. Entire criminal organizations could be added to the State Department’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, joining about 60, mostly Islamist, groups already on it. Cartels and their senior leaders could also be designated under an existing executive order that targets terrorist threats. Most of the more than 100 people and organizations currently on that list are also Islamist extremists. Either of those routes generally take between six months and a year, Mr. Blazakis said, and carry similar consequences. It is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly provide support for a designated foreign terrorist organization, its members are barred from entering the United States, and financial institutions are forbidden from doing business with it.  Mr. Trump has another option as well: He could issue a new executive order, related only to the cartels, to declare them a specific threat to the United States. Mr. Blazakis said that the Mexican drug cartels largely meet the legal definition of foreign groups that threaten or otherwise terrorize American interests. But he said that adding them to the list could open the door for many other groups to be added, potentially diluting the focus on global extremist threats that Congress sought after Sept. 11. “The question becomes, ‘If we’re adding these cartels, what other criminal organizations should be added to the list?’ You would really be opening up Pandora’s box,” said Mr. Blazakis, who left the Trump administration in August 2018 after 10 years overseeing the State Department’s terror designations. “So in a way, that terrorism list becomes less of a terrorism list.” The Treasury Department already targets drug kingpins and senior cartel officials on a separate list that carries many of the same penalties as the terrorist designations. If the firestorms on social media are any indication, many here in Mexico are also worried that the designation might open the door to some sort of military intervention by the United States. “Many people are concerned that it signals a counterterrorism approach to dealing with these groups,” said Brian J. Phillips, a former research professor at CIDE, a university in Mexico City. “The one thing that nearly unites Mexico is opposition to armed U.S. troops in Mexico territory.” But the label, he continued, is not equivalent to a declaration of war against the designated group. “It’s quite possible that there’s no change in the military approach to dealing with these groups,” he added. Mr. Sarukhán, the former ambassador, said that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both considered applying the foreign terrorist designation to Mexican drug trafficking groups, with the intention of using it to attract more resources to combat drug trafficking. “We pushed back,” said Mr. Sarukhán, Mexico’s ambassador to Washington during those administrations. “It was the wrong tool for the problem.” Kirk Semple reported from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Lara Jakes from Washington.

Sweden Investigates Iraq Defense Chief for War Crimes and Fraud,2019-11-26,By Alissa J. Rubin and Christina Anderson,"['BAGHDAD — Sweden has opened three investigations into Iraq’s defense minister, including looking into the possible commission of crimes against humanity.  The defense minister, Najah al-Shammari, a major general who was an officer under Saddam Hussein, holds dual citizenship in Iraq and Sweden, and the other investigations involve possible benefits fraud in Sweden and the breaking of Sweden’s registration laws, which require people to register where they live. “The accusations leveled at him are serious, and now the Swedish authorities are trying to bring clarity to them,” said Annika Soder, Sweden’s state secretary for foreign affairs. Mr. al-Shammari, 52, who has been serving in his current job since June, denied the allegations in a statement released earlier this week.  He blamed a conspiracy perpetrated by unnamed “sides” — a term often used in Iraq to denote other countries or political blocs. His statement did not discuss either the investigation into possible benefits fraud or registration fraud, but rejected claims that he had committed crimes against humanity. A Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, said there had been complaints from a Swedish woman with Iraqi roots that, in his position as defense minister, Mr. al-Shammari was responsible for the killing and wounding of Iraqi protesters in the continuing demonstrations in Iraq.  More than 330 protesters have been killed and about 15,000 wounded since the protests began on Oct. 1.  In his statement rebutting the allegations, Mr. al-Shammari took pains to assert that he was not responsible for either the use or the purchase of the 40-millimeter tear gas canisters that have been shot directly at protesters as if they were bullets and in some cases lodged in their heads, causing a slow death.  He also said he supported the right of Iraqis to express themselves. “The defense minister stands with the demonstrators and their legitimate demands and their constitutional right in demonstrating and protesting,” he wrote in his statement.  During the initial week of protests, Defense Ministry soldiers were responsible for killing a number of the approximately 100 people who died. But since then, the military is thought to have been mostly restrained and appeared to be trying to avoid the use of lethal force.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi removed a number of senior security force commanders over their handling of those initial demonstrations and referred them to the courts. But no ministers were censured for their handling of the protests.  [Update: Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said he would resign amid protests.] While the Iraqi military played an important role in the early days of the protests, it was certainly not the only branch of the security forces responsible for using excessive force.  Both during the initial days of the protests and since there have been multiple other security forces involved in the sometimes violent responses. The Interior Ministry, as well as special forces responsible for protecting the Green Zone in Baghdad, have also been involved in some of the more aggressive tactics. Regardless of what role Mr. al-Shammari played in the response to the protests, he could only be tried for crimes against humanity if he returned to Sweden, and he would have to do so voluntarily because there is no bilateral extradition treaty between the two countries, according to Pal Wrange, an international law expert at Stockholm University.  As for the other possible charges against Mr. al-Shammari in Sweden, the Swedish authorities have said little about them.  Jan Granqvist, who works in the fraud division of the Stockholm Police, on Monday told SVT, Sweden’s public broadcaster, that Mr. al-Shammari is being investigated for possibly committing benefits fraud.  Benefits fraud could include any of a number of different social welfare benefits given to Swedish citizens, like a $130 monthly allowance for each child and disability payments. If Mr. al-Shammari broke the rules for receiving such benefits, he would be responsible for paying back the Swedish government.  Mr. al-Shammari is also being investigated for breaking the national registration law, Mr. Granqvist said. He could run afoul of Swedish rules if he told the Swedish Tax Authority that he was living at an address in Sweden when he was mostly working in Iraq. Like a number of Iraqis, Mr. al-Shammari immigrated to Sweden with his family, first applying for residency in 2009 and becoming a permanent resident about two years later. He was given a Swedish passport in 2015.  Alissa J. Rubin reported from Baghdad, and Christina Anderson from Stockholm. Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.']",Iraq’s defense minister is under investigation for crimes against humanity and for claiming Swedish social benefits while he was living in Iraq.
New Zealand Is Tackling Hot-Button Liberal Issues in One Swoop,2019-11-26,By Charlotte Graham-McLay,"['WELLINGTON, New Zealand — While conservative populism is now ascendant in some of the world’s leading democracies, New Zealand is rushing in the opposite direction, taking on several liberal social issues all at once. Next year, the country will hold public referendums to decide whether to legalize assisted suicide and recreational marijuana. Separately, lawmakers are considering a bill that would decriminalize abortion. Those votes will come after New Zealand’s Parliament voted 119 to 1 this month to enshrine in law an ambitious set of targets to reduce the country’s carbon emissions.  This burst of democratic action is in contrast to the legislative gridlock that has gripped countries like the United States and Britain. But it also threatens to push a generally conflict-averse New Zealand into uncomfortable territory, and it could overwhelm an election next year that will determine whether Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern remains in office.  New Zealand is a socially liberal country, though it is not clear where New Zealanders will fall when the three issues come up for consideration in the months ahead. Tackling them simultaneously could “foster an already growing culture war in New Zealand,” said Bryce Edwards, a political commentator and lecturer at Victoria University in Wellington, the capital. “Next year’s election could end up being one revolving less around economic issues and more about social and moral ones,” he added. That would be a shift in New Zealand, where election campaigns have long ceased being the province of personal morality debates. While Ms. Ardern has built a global reputation for her brand of cordial, inclusive liberalism, the leader of the opposition center-right National Party, Simon Bridges, has seized on the increasingly fractured tone of the public debate.  In railing against “political correctness, woke politics and identity politics,” Mr. Edwards said, Mr. Bridges is “trying to mobilize the so-called shy Tory voter who feels uncomfortable with some of the progressive changes in New Zealand society.” Mr. Bridges’s party has maintained a lead over Ms. Ardern’s Labour Party in major polls.  The government’s concerns about the quality of the looming public debate are evident. It is acutely aware of the online misinformation campaigns that have been generated when other countries have put polarizing topics to public votes, such as Britain’s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. In New Zealand, a team has been set up in the Ministry of Justice to combat manipulation of the public debate in the lead-up to the referendums, Radio New Zealand reported last month. Ministry officials will work to verify “that if someone claims to have a highly authoritative piece of research, it is that, not some sort of highly partisan, highly skeptical or dubious piece of information,” Andrew Little, the justice minister, told Radio New Zealand. He added that it would be a “very difficult balancing act” for the monitors — public servants who must remain neutral — to avoid being drawn into the debate. That debate is taking New Zealand onto new ground. While recreational marijuana and euthanasia have been legalized by legislatures in a small number of countries, New Zealand is believed to be the first to put either issue to a public referendum. Both votes will be held at the same time as the election in late 2020.  Support for legalizing cannabis has eroded since the referendum was announced, with a June poll by 1 News showing 52 percent of New Zealanders against it. In another 1 News poll in July, 72 percent of those surveyed supported legalizing euthanasia, but that was before the public learned that it would have to decide the matter itself. Decriminalization of abortion, the issue that may be decided in Parliament, is narrowly favored by the public. Although abortion is technically illegal in New Zealand, it is widely available to those who obtain the approval of two doctors. The reason for the double referendum is a quirk of New Zealand politics. Euthanasia and recreational cannabis were forced to a public vote by two minor parties that give Ms. Ardern’s Labour Party the majority she needs to govern.  The left-leaning Green Party insisted that marijuana be put to a public vote as part of its agreement to support Ms. Ardern, while New Zealand First, a populist group that holds the balance of power in Parliament, said it would support the passage of the euthanasia bill only if it also faced a referendum.  Mark Patterson, a New Zealand First lawmaker, told Parliament during a debate on the euthanasia law that it was “one of our founding principles” that conscience votes “go to the people of New Zealand” to decide. A referendum can help make sure that lawmakers do not forge too far ahead of the public on social matters. Paul Moon, a history professor at Auckland University of Technology, said New Zealand’s Parliament had in the past passed progressive bills that did not have full public backing. “Parliament plays this process of setting the social agenda and then public opinion eventually catches up to it,” he said.  But one member of Parliament said she was appalled that her colleagues had shunted the euthanasia decision to the public. “We’re actually empowered, 120 of us, to make decisions every day about laws that pass through our Parliament,” said the lawmaker, Louisa Wall, a member of the Labour Party. Ms. Wall said she worried that pressure groups — particularly religious ones — might find more influence ahead of a public vote than they would if lawmakers were deciding the matter. New Zealanders are often wary of religion. The 2018 census revealed that those who said they had no religion — 49 percent of the population — had overtaken Christians, at 38 percent, for the first time.  In a debate this year on the abortion bill, none of the 23 lawmakers who cast an initial vote against the act mentioned their faith, the church or God in their speeches opposing it, although some are known to be religious privately. Church leaders, who do not wield influence in mainstream New Zealand, could nonetheless do well at mobilizing their members ahead of the referendums. Ms. Wall said that she had closely followed debates about same-sex marriage in Australia and Ireland ahead of public votes there, and that the euthanasia referendum encouraged people to use “whatever mechanism they can” to promote their particular views.  It led, she said, to the “demonization” of minorities and “the validity of their lives being debated.”']","The country will decide whether to legalize assisted suicide and recreational marijuana, and whether to decriminalize abortion.

Dresden Museum Partly Reopens After Jewelry Heist,2019-11-27,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The Royal Palace museum in Dresden, Germany, reopened to the public on Wednesday, except for the rooms known as the Green Vault, where the police continued to hunt for evidence to help them track down the thieves who broke in two days earlier, making off with 11 rare Baroque jewels. The police said evidence indicated that four thieves had carried out the robbery early Monday, spraying a fire extinguisher in their wake to erase their tracks. The thieves broke an iron gate and a window to enter a room in the Green Vault on the ground floor of the museum. Among the treasures in the Green Vault — founded by August the Strong, prince-elector of Saxony and King of Poland — were several sets of royal jewels. The thieves used an ax to break the security glass and steal three of them — the “Diamond Rose,” “Diamond” and “Queens’ Jewelry” sets — taking a total of 11 entire pieces, parts of two other pieces and several buttons, Dirk Syndram, the director of the Green Vault, said on Wednesday. “These three sets included diamonds in various cuts that date largely from the time of August the Strong and August III,” Mr. Syndram said in a statement. “They were set between 1782 and 1789.” Among the items stolen were a sword with a diamond-encrusted handle, several shoe buckles and buttons made of diamonds, as well as brooches, a hair clip shaped like the sun and parts of a diamond necklace belonging to Queen Amalie Auguste from 1824. The police have appealed to the public for tips but have so far found no trace of the thieves. One piece from the “Diamond” set, a hat clip with a flawless 41-carat gem known as the Dresden Green Diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for an exhibition. Even when in Dresden, the diamond is displayed separately from the rest of the set on another floor of the museum. The theft has raised concerns about security at museums around Germany.  Marion Ackermann, the director of the Dresden State Art Collection, a consortium of museums that holds the treasures of the former royal house of Saxony, has repeatedly defended the collection’s security.  But Germany’s culture minister and the German Museum Association said they would discuss how better to protect the treasures in the country’s museums, while still keeping them accessible to the public.  Eckart Köhne, the association’s president, said in a statement, “The break-in at the Green Vault gives us a reason to re-examine whether the threat level has changed in recent years.” “For this, the museums need assistance from their sponsors, as well as police and security specialists,” he added. A surveillance video released by the police shows two figures, one carrying a flashlight, approaching a display case enclosed in glass. One then bends down, pulls an ax from a bag and repeatedly slams it into a panel of glass, which fragments and gives way. “The case looks like a battlefield,” Mr. Syndram said. The stolen jewels were not insured, and Ms. Ackermann and her team would not give a figure for their value, insisting that their worth lies in their historical and cultural significance as part of an intact set of royal jewels.  Because they are unique, they could not be sold on the open market, she said.  That has led to fears that the pieces will be broken down, the gems re-cut and the gold melted to render them sellable.  “Of course, if the pieces remained intact, the entire world is looking for them and they are not going to find much of a market,” said Chris Marinello, an expert with Art Recovery International, which specializes in finding and recovering stolen art. “Every hour that goes by increases the likelihood that these are going to be broken up and destroyed,” he said, adding that he hoped the authorities would promise a reward for the return of the intact pieces. Art historians and museum directors across the globe have joined in the outrage at the loss from a collection that was hidden to survive the Allied bombing of Dresden at the end of World War II. The treasures were later taken by the Soviet Union, but were returned to the former East Germany in the 1950s. “They bear with them that history,” said Shira Brisman, an assistant professor in art history at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in art produced in German-speaking regions from the period. The objects in the Green Vault collection are signs of power, Ms. Brisman said, artworks that could show off Saxony’s mining wealth, including tin, silver, copper and precious stone, and the skills of its artisans.  “On the one hand, they reflect wealth,” she said. “On the other hand, they reflect alliances.” After its return to East Germany, the collection languished in relative obscurity behind the Iron Curtain for decades, despite their status as the biggest surviving princely art collection in Europe.  The Green Vault was partly destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt after German reunification and opened in 2006. Alan Yuhas contributed reporting from New York.

"Amid Death and Debris From Earthquake, Albania Clings to Hope",2019-11-27,By Marc Santora and Elian Peltier,"['DURRES, Albania — The first tremors hit Monday night, just as the nine members of the Lala family were getting ready for bed. A few hours later, the ground shook again, waking neighbors but doing little damage. Then, shortly before 4 a.m., the big one hit. In 30 seconds of unstoppable violence, the earth’s crust shifted and the Lalas’ four-story concrete home collapsed on itself like a pancake. By the end of the next day, the rubble had produced just a single survivor, a 17-year-old boy. For the rescued teenager, mere feet had made the difference between life and death, a story replicated through a region of Albania devastated by the biggest earthquake to hit the country in decades. At least 31 people have been reported dead. At the remains of the Lala house on Wednesday, Italian search teams with rescue dogs sifted through the rubble, finding the bodies of four other family members, including two children. The fate of the remaining four occupants remained unknown. The drama, much of it playing out on live television, struck a chord in a nation still reeling from the quake and desperate for hope. The country’s prime minister, Edi Rama, seemed to touch on that during a visit to a hospital in Tirana, the capital, where victims were being treated. “We have lost human lives,” he told reporters. “We have also saved a lot of lives.” With whole sections of towns reduced to rubble and emergency workers arriving from around Europe to provide assistance, Albanians were still trying to grasp the scale of the devastation. Apart from the dead, hundreds were injured and thousands were left homeless by the 6.4-magnitude quake. In small villages not yet reached by emergency crews, residents issued desperate pleas for water and other supplies. Even as some 300 aftershocks rattled already-damaged buildings — and survivors’ nerves — police officers, soldiers, firefighters and residents turned to whatever tools were at hand to reach people still trapped under debris. The coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane were among the hardest hit by the quake. Some buildings broke apart or collapsed entirely. Others were damaged badly enough that people were wary of staying in them. Even some whose houses seemed intact stayed outdoors.  “We were afraid to go home and that there would be another big earthquake,” said Burim Ajdini, 29. “Tonight I’m not going to sleep at home.” The government sought to reassure people whose homes were destroyed or uninhabitable that it would find them accommodations. All of them will have temporary shelter soon, and new homes next year, the prime minister said. But on Wednesday, at least, many Albanians woke up in tents, cars and a soccer stadium.  “Thousands of families spent last night out under the sky, and we can’t let them pass the winter in tents,” Mr. Rama said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure that all of them spend Christmas with a roof.” It was an ambitious promise for one of the poorest countries in Europe, one still struggling to fathom the extent of the destruction. Mr. Rama renewed calls to European Union members and Middle East nations to provide assistance. “It’s too big of a disaster and a challenge to deal with for our little country and our limited resources,” he said. The Albanian government has begun an online donation page to help with relocation and reconstruction for hundreds — possibly thousands — of families. Destructive earthquakes are fairly common in the Balkan region, near where two of the earth’s major tectonic plates, the Eurasian and African meet. That instability was underscored by a 5.4-magnitude quake that struck Bosnia and Herzegovina just hours after the tremor in Albania, and a 6.0-magnitude quake that rattled the island of Crete, in Greece, on Wednesday. Later on Wednesday, a 5.3-magnitude aftershock in Albania sent people running out of their homes and offices. The quake on Tuesday, centered near Durres, on the Adriatic coast, came just two months after a temblor in the same area injured dozens and damaged hundreds of homes. “The first earthquake was terrible, but now we realize how small this was compared to this one,” Mr. Rama said. Durres, the country’s second-largest city, is home to more than 175,000 people, and lies close to where the quake and a swarm of aftershocks were centered. Residents whose homes were destroyed or damaged spent the night outside, covered in blankets and sitting on mattresses, as workers from the Red Cross distributed food and army officers set up white tents in the city’s stadium.  There was no way to know how many people might still be buried in the rubble. By late afternoon, firefighters and emergency search teams had pulled 49 survivors from under the debris, sometimes in harrowing hourslong rescue missions.  Italian rescue workers on the scene said they would continue to dig because people have been found alive, against all odds, after much longer periods trapped in earthquake wreckage. Xhuliano Palku, the manager of the seven-story hotel Vila Palma in Durres, said that for 20 hours on Tuesday, he had participated in a risky operation to rescue a young man who had been sleeping on the third floor when the building collapsed.  The man, the hotel owner’s son, was taken to a hospital after being pulled from the rubble. The three-star Vila Palma was one of the many buildings in the city to fall, and among the four people who had been sleeping there, Mr. Palku said, one was found dead. “It was a mess, it was a total mess,” he said. But Mr. Palku, too, saw reason for hope. “When I see the hotel, I think it’s a miracle,” he said. “I didn’t think someone could survive in that catastrophic scene.” Countries including Italy, Montenegro and Serbia responded to Albania’s call for assistance. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, visited Durres as 40 Greek emergency workers and a sniffer dog joined the search and rescue effort, according to news reports. “We too have been through this,” Mr. Dendias told reporters on Tuesday, “and we are standing by the Albanian people and its government.” As a cold rain began to fall late in the day, the hundreds of people who had taken shelter in a hastily erected tent camp outside the Niko Dovana stadium in downtown Durres got word Wednesday that they were on the move again.  Soldiers made their way through the encampment, encouraging people to leave while Beldi Klosi, the minister of tourism and environment, announced that the camp would soon close. Buses were waiting to take the displaced residents to hotels and other shelters. But not everyone wanted to go, fearing that the buildings might be compromised. A 35-year-old man named Dashimir said he and his family had fled a seventh-floor apartment during the quake and were not ready to be indoors. “We do not want to go to a hotel,” he said. “The hotels are near the coast, and another quake could go off anytime.” As volunteers brought blankets and food to families debating what to do next, the buses slowly started to fill up and the tents began to be folded and cleared away.']",The death toll rose to 31 a day after the Balkan country was struck by one of the strongest tremors there in decades.
Violence Rises in Iraq’s South Amid Crackdowns on Protests and Press,2019-11-28,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Iraqi security officers opened fire on protesters in southern Iraq on Thursday, killing at least 35, as the government sought to quell violence that started with an attack on the Iranian Consulate in the city of Najaf, but then spread to other areas in the country’s south.  During the day, the violence centered on the southern city of Nasiriya, where on Wednesday the government had sent additional security forces to try to halt what had become daily violence there.  But on Thursday, instead of using tear gas or sound bombs, the hard-line reinforcements from the Interior Ministry’s Quick Reaction Forces opened fire on mostly unarmed protesters in the early morning hours as they held a sit-in, killing at least 25 and wounding 160, according to a report from the Dhi Qar governor’s office and the Iraqi security forces’ Joint Operational Command.  Later in the day, violence resulting in at least 10 more deaths resumed in Najaf and Karbala, where the country’s two most venerated Shiite Muslim shrines are. Najaf, the seat of the most senior Shiite clergy, was where protesters the day before had set upon the Iranian Consulate, throwing gasoline bombs and chanting anti-Iranian slogans.  On Thursday, the protesters attacked one of the city’s most significant shrines, and the riot forces and popular mobilization forces defending the site drove the demonstrators back using live fire, according to eyewitnesses.  In Karbala, there were clashes in the evening, and demonstrators hurled at least two grenades at the Iraqi security forces, injuring 19, according to a statement from the police in Karbala.  The attacks and unrest are part of a series of anti-government protests and riots that have broken out in recent weeks in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.  In all three countries, the protesters have targeted government institutions or military figures viewed as connected to Iran. These are all countries where Shiite Iran has sought to extend its influence in the years since the United States-led invasion of Iraq severely diminished the power of Sunni governments and factions. The onslaught in Nasiriya against unarmed protesters infuriated many people, inciting them to join the protests and causing an outcry among both local political figures and, more significantly, tribal leaders.  [Update: Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said he would resign amid protests.] Some armed tribal leaders joined the protesters on Thursday. The tribes represent a formidable force but so far have mostly refrained from entering the fray. But if they did rally in force to the side of the protesters, the government could have trouble maintaining control.  The governor of Dhi Qar Province, of which Nasiriya is the capital, asked Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi to withdraw the Interior Ministry forces and their commander, Lt. Gen. Jamil al-Shammari. He was the one who ordered the troops to remove protesters from the bridges over the Euphrates River that they had blocked, and he had overseen the shooting.  “The ongoing campaign, with its bloody incidents since dawn, has obstructed efforts to calm down the situation, especially after our joint decision with the police command to withdraw the anti-riot forces outside the limits of Nasiriya city and not to clash with the demonstrators,” the governor, Adil al-Dikhili, wrote to Mr. Mehdi.  The governor was referring to his strategy during the past two weeks to try to accommodate the protesters who had set up tents blocking two of the bridges over the Euphrates River and to avoid clashes by having the Quick Reaction Forces withdraw rather than stay in the center city. On Thursday at 3 a.m. the reinforcements for the Quick Reaction Forces from Baghdad, and their new commander, came with bulldozers to knock down the tents and force out the protesters. When the protesters resisted, the forces opened fire, killing at least 25 people and leaving many bleeding and injured on the ground.  The Quick Reaction Forces have previously drawn criticism for firing live ammunition and shooting tear gas canisters directly at Baghdad protesters, often giving them lethal head injuries.  By late Thursday, the military commander in charge of the forces in Nasiriya, who had been sent there just a few days earlier to rein in the protesters, had been recalled to Baghdad. The Dhi Qar provincial governor, Mr. al-Dikhili, had resigned. “It is a dishonor to be part of this system that kills the people of my own country,” he said in announcing his resignation. In a separate action, the Iraqi government shut down Dijlah Television in Baghdad almost immediately after the channel broadcast a report about allegedly corrupt practices by the director of the Communication and Media Commission, Ali al-Khuwayldi, accusing him of accepting an apartment in London in exchange for blocking competition in communications licensing.  Dijlah has been particularly assiduous about reporting on the protests, traveling to provincial capitals and interviewing scores of demonstrators. This week one of its cameramen filming the protests was beaten by a member of the Iraqi security forces in Al Muthanna Province and was filmed by a colleague as he bled on the sidewalk after the assault.  The Communication and Media Commission, which has power over all broadcasters in Iraq, had been threatening to shut down nine channels, all headquartered outside the country, and many of which had been reporting critically on the government. The agency is controlled by the Dawa Party, a Shiite political party that has had ties to Iran.  “The CMC is supposed to be independent but it is not, and all of the CMC members are from the ruling parties,” said Ziad al-Ajili, the head of the Journalistic Freedom Observatory.  Noting that the CMC had accused Dijlah and other channels of instigating violence, Mr. Ajili asked, “Is it instigation of violence when a journalist shows killing or reports about the numbers of those killed? Is that a violation of the codes of broadcasting?”  Mr. Ajili added: “When journalists criticize violence against protesters, is that a violation of our humanitarian responsibility? Of course not, the violation of the law is killing unarmed youths.”  The United States Embassy condemned the commission’s actions, saying that they “threatened freedom of speech.”  The Communications Commission responded, “We do not take orders from a foreign embassy.”  It defended its decision to close the channels based on the “observation of the rhetoric of these channels and the determination that there were catastrophic violations in the media rules” relating to speech that incites violence and disturbs public order.

"Apple, Bowing to Russian Pressure, Recognizes Crimea Annexation on Map",2019-11-28,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Since it grabbed Crimea from Ukraine five years ago, Russia has made no headway in getting the United States or the European Union to recognize the annexed Black Sea peninsula as Russian. But Russia’s Parliament is now rejoicing at getting at least Apple to fall partly into line. When viewed from inside Russia, Apple apps show Crimea as part of the Russian Federation and separated from Ukraine by an international border. This means that Apple has joined Google, Yandex and some other technology companies in redrawing Ukraine’s borders to satisfy Moscow’s territorial claims, at least for customers viewing their maps on devices inside Russia. Viewed on devices outside Russia, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. Unlike printed maps, online cartography can shift, providing alternative realities to comfort the likely political leanings of the viewer and the policies of his or her government. This means that borders over which armies and diplomats have battled for centuries are no longer entirely static but often follow a course that exists only in the eye of the beholder. “Our situation with Apple has now been resolved,” Vasily Piskaryov, the chairman of the security and anticorruption committee of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of Parliament, said on Wednesday. “We see that everything has happened the way we wanted it.”  Mr. Piskaryov told the Interfax news agency that his committee would continue to monitor Apple apps to ensure “there is no going back” to previous maps that showed Crimea as part of Ukraine or as a territory belonging to neither Russia nor Ukraine. Leonid Levin, the head of the Duma’s Information Policy Committee, told the news agency that Apple “has demonstrated a wish to preserve and develop its position on the Russia market.” He added that the company’s decision “to bring the state of its cartographic services into compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Russia can only be welcomed.” Ukraine protested Apple’s cave-in to Russia, with its foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, writing on Twitter that the company should “stick to high-tech and entertainment” and stay out of politics. “Global politics is not your strong side,” he said.  The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington also voiced dismay that Apple had accepted Russian claims. In a post on Twitter, the embassy said that occupation did not confer sovereignty and noted that Ukrainians were “not giving any thanks to @Apple this #Thanksgiving.” The United States and the European Union  imposed sanctions on Russia over its seizure of Crimea, and both still view the peninsula as part of Ukraine.  Crimea is mainly Russian-speaking and inhabited mostly by ethnic Russians, but it was recognized by Moscow — and all other capitals — as belonging to Ukraine until Russia changed its mind in 2014. After sending “little green men” — Russian special forces in uniforms stripped of identifying insignia — to seize Crimean government buildings, it held a referendum that endorsed the change. Russia hailed the vote as an act of democracy, but the West viewed it as window-dressing for an unacceptable military aggression.  Apple had been negotiating with Duma representatives since May over what the Russian Parliament had denounced as its “inaccurate” maps of Crimea. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on the Crimea decision. Ukraine has struggled, with considerable success, since the 2014 annexation of Crimea to prevent the appearance of maps in foreign print publication that suggest the peninsula belongs to Russia. But it has had far less success online, where frontiers often change depending on where they are being viewed from. And Russia is not the only country that has raised such a fuss over cartography. China has for years waged much the same battle over Taiwan, insisting that the self-governing island be shown as part of the People’s Republic of China. A growing number of American companies have in recent months tried to appease Beijing by recognizing its claims over Taiwan. Last year, the clothing retailer Gap issued an apology to China after a map on a T-shirt sold in North America did not depict Taiwan as part of China. China has also been successful in getting Apple to tailor the iPhone ecosystem to suit Beijing’s demands. Apple regularly removes apps that run afoul of Chinese laws. These sometimes include apps that connect users to gambling or pornography, but also include the apps of foreign news outlets like The New York Times and even Apple’s own news app. Apple has also removed apps that would let users leapfrog the country’s censorship controls. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at a conference two years ago that he disagreed with some Chinese policies but that Apple must comply with the law wherever it operates. “Each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations, and so your choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?” he said. “You get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline.”']","The tech giant, following Google and others, has bowed to Russian demands that its apps not show Crimea as belonging to Ukraine on digital maps seen in Russia."
"In Albania, a Race to Save Lives on Ground That Keeps Shaking",2019-11-28,By Marc Santora,"['DURRES, Albania — With each piece of rubble pulled off the twisted pile of steel and concrete that used to be a four-story home, Luca Martino and his rescue dog, Foglia, were called into action. “If there is room for air to come to the outside, the dog can smell it,” Mr. Martino, a rescue worker from Italy, said during a break on Thursday. “If someone is alive, Foglia will bark.” On this day, the dog had not barked. It was slow, arduous work, repeated at numerous sites in Albania in the aftermath of a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck on Tuesday, leaving at least 47 people dead. And in this Adriatic coast city, where many buildings were leveled and many more were dangerously damaged, the rescuers knew that hopes were fading. “There is still time,” Mr. Martino said. Nine members of the Lala family had been in the home when it collapsed. Four had died, one had already been rescued, but four remained beneath the rubble.  But as precious minutes ticked by, the work came to a sudden halt. The earth was shaking again. The site needed to be cleared. Across the city, people poured out of their homes and businesses — again.  Officially, this time it was a 5.1-magnitude quake, but in a city where nerves are already frayed and poorly constructed buildings pose a threat even when the earth is not moving, the number hardly mattered. The helpless feeling was the same. Later that day, the rescuers working with Mr. Martino pulled one more body out of the wreckage, leaving three still missing beneath the rubble. At the city’s main hospital, engineers urgently looked over structural blueprints and rushed visitors out of the administration headquarters, saying it was not safe. When the earth shook around noon, people in the emergency room briefly fled to wait out the shaking. Jadranka Mihaljevic, head of engineering at the seismology department of Montenegro’s Institute for Hydrometeorology and Seismology, said the magnitude of the aftershocks was not unexpected. “This is a big earthquake, and it’s not surprising, at least not in our region,” she said.  Driving through the city, which was founded in the seventh century B.C. but where many buildings were hastily thrown up during the country’s wild and often lawless transition to democracy in the 1990s, felt like touring an urban battlefield. The buildings bore deep cracks and homes were flattened. On corner after corner, red-and-white tape marked a place that was deemed unsafe to walk or stay. The official death toll climbed as the authorities slowly shifted from rescue operations to recovery efforts. Officials said 680 people had sought medical attention, including 35 who remained hospitalized, and one who was airlifted to Italy. Several thousand people whose homes were destroyed were being sheltered in hotels and other locations. But tens of thousands more were living in places that might be structurally unsound. “Nothing is safe,” said Haki Kaja, 73, who had been standing a block from where a newer six-story apartment complex had collapsed, killing several people. “What we fear the most are these buildings that were constructed in the 1990s without proper engineers.” Beyond immediate survival, the government is focused on finding lodging for people left homeless, but Endri Fuga, a spokesman for Prime Minister Edi Rama, said he understood the concerns of those who worried about the safety of their buildings. “This is something we have never dealt with before,” he said, adding that when the last major quake hit in 1979, there was only a fraction of the current development. The government has too few people to inspect all the damaged buildings, he said, and is asking for international help. “And what we are getting is tremor after tremor, making it even more difficult,” he said. In one of Europe’s poorest countries, where corruption and organized crime remain endemic, the earthquake comes at a politically volatile moment. Since February, protesters have taken to the streets in often violent demonstrations, calling for the resignation of Mr. Rama’s government. In May, several thousand demonstrators converged on the main government building in Tirana, the capital, and hurled gasoline bombs and fireworks. Police responded with tear gas. At the same time, the country’s future has been clouded by the recent decision by the European Union to delay any discussion on the country’s admission to the bloc of nations. Mr. Rama has warned that the delay threatened to upend stability in the Balkans, especially if Albanian nationalists see it as a moment to push for the country to form a union with Kosovo, whose 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia is not recognized by Serbia. But for the moment, the earthquake seems to have brought unity to a region better known for fragmentation. Serbia and Greece, two countries with historic political differences with Albania, were among the first to send rescue crews, followed quickly by other neighboring nations. Those teams, joined with Albanian emergency workers who were going on three days of working with little rest, rescued 48 people trapped in the debris, most of them in the first 24 hours. Their heroic efforts, however, did not change the suffering of those who lost everything. The scene at Tirana’s main trauma hospital was one of agony. Relatives pleaded for their loved ones to be airlifted out of the country for treatment, even as some of those recovering from injuries remained unaware of the extent of their loss. “My sister thinks her daughter and her husband are in the hospital,” said Drita Cakoni. “She is asking to see her daughter. But her daughter is dead. So is her husband. She has lost everything.” Because her sister’s heart is weak, the doctors asked Ms. Cakoni not to say anything for at least a few weeks. On the radio, there were appeals from frightened citizens who feared that their homes could collapse. One elderly woman described how her family had been spending their nights in their car, afraid that the complex in the small town of Golem, in Kavaja municipality, would not stand much longer. “There have been no inspections,” she told a broadcaster. Along with very real concerns and the ongoing danger brought by aftershocks, the government was also contending with false stories stirring fear on social media. Mr. Rama issued a warning to those spreading lies on social media. “I will be forced to intervene to close them down up until the end of this emergency situation if they continue to publish fake news causing panic,” he said.  After an earlier earthquake in September, a Facebook page posted a false warning that another quake was imminent, sending tens of thousands of people in the capital into a frenzy, causing them to leave their homes and drive to open spaces. People hardly needed fake news to be put on edge. The past three days have done the job. Most people here are familiar with a slogan from Communist times: “The earthquakes rocked the mountains but not the Albanian heart.” Thursday marked the anniversary of Albania’s independence from Ottoman rule in 1912, but the flags strung up on the streets of Durres for the celebration were lowered to half-staff and the day was declared one of mourning. But even as hopes of finding more survivors dimmed, at least one family got some good news along with the bad.  Altin Celshima, 40, escaped his home with his family, but when he got to a hotel where his nephew and his nephew’s grandparents were staying, he found the seven-story building had collapsed. “It was terrible, like a living hell,” he said. The grandparents were located within six hours — the grandmother still alive, the grandfather struck dead by a falling beam. But it wasn’t until some panicked 20 hours after the quake, with help from Albanian and Greek rescuers, that the nephew was finally pulled out, alive. “It was a miracle he survived,” Mr. Celshima said. Elian Peltier contributed reporting.']","With time running out to find survivors under the wreckage of a devastating earthquake, crews keep searching, while thousands of people search for shelter."
Japan’s Support for Gay Marriage Is Soaring. But Can It Become Law?,2019-11-27,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — Ikuo Sato stood in front of a Tokyo court in April and told the world he was gay.  To a packed room, he described the anxiety he had felt as a young man, struggling to express his sexuality in Japan’s restrictive society. If the law is changed to allow same-sex marriage, he said, perhaps “we’ll make a society where the next generation doesn’t have to feel that way.” Somewhere in the courtroom, his partner sat silently watching, hoping to go unnoticed. His family and co-workers do not know he is gay, and he hopes — at least for now — to keep it that way, fearing discrimination in his workplace. The couple’s story epitomizes the contradictions that shape the lives of gay people across Japan.  In many ways, there has been dramatic change. Lawsuits filed this year by Mr. Sato, his partner and five other couples seeking recognition of same-sex marriage are the first of their kind in Japan. Public support for same-sex marriage has surged in the last few years, making it seem suddenly within reach. Local governments are increasingly recognizing same-sex partnerships, and even Japan’s famously rigid companies have begun coming out in favor of them. Yet in other ways, the gains remain abstract. Gay people face overwhelming pressure to conform to the silent, stifling norms of a society in which many parents and workers are still uncomfortable with the idea of their own children and colleagues being gay. And the conservative politicians who run the country and extol its sometimes inflexible culture refuse to touch the issue.  “The Japanese people think we should recognize same-sex marriage,” said Taiga Ishikawa, who in July became the first openly gay man elected to the country’s Parliament. But, he said, some politicians in the governing party “still have outdated views on this,” adding that there is a mistaken belief “that same-sex relationships are a ‘hobby’ or will add to the declining birthrate.”  A recent poll reflected the dichotomy. The survey, by the advertising giant Dentsu, found that more than half of gay men and lesbians in Japan were concerned about coming out. Yet it also showed that almost 80 percent of people 60 and under now support same-sex marriage. That widespread backing, a jump of 20 or more points in just a few years, comes as Japan has caught up with patterns in other developed countries and has experienced what many describe as a “boom” in L.G.B.T. awareness.  Advocates see the groundswell in support as an opening.  Haru Ono, an illustrator and rights activist, and her partner, Asami Nishikawa, who are in their 40s and live together in a Tokyo suburb, have long thought it was unfair that they could not marry. But they kept their activism quiet, fearing that making their relationship public could expose their children — who are now grown — to bullying at school. A run-in with a hospital changed all that. When Ms. Nishikawa brought one of Ms. Ono’s children in for a procedure, the staff refused to allow her to check the boy in, saying that he needed to be accompanied by a member of his “real family.” The experience “haunted me for a long time,” Ms. Ono said. Her anxiety only grew when she learned she had breast cancer and began to fear that her partner might not be allowed to be with her as she underwent treatment. For years, Ms. Ono said, lawyers had told the couple that “the time wasn’t right” to sue the government for the right to marry. Then, suddenly, it was. In February, they joined the 12 other couples across Japan in filing lawsuits. Others have since followed. A galvanizing moment had come the previous summer. In an interview with Shincho 45, a conservative magazine, a lawmaker, Mio Sugita, dismissed gay men and lesbians as “unproductive” members of society who would not bear children. Ms. Sugita speculated that recognizing same-sex marriage could cause Japan to collapse as it faces a growing population crisis. The remarks were widely publicized, raising awareness of discrimination against gay people, said Alexander Dmitrenko, a Canadian lawyer and resident of Tokyo who has been a prominent advocate of same-sex marriage. “It was like Japan’s Stonewall,” he said, referring to the 1969 police raid and following protests that set off the gay rights movement in the United States.  When Taiwan approved Asia’s first same-sex marriage law this May, he said, it was a further prod for many Japanese, who have long prided themselves on being the leading democracy in the region. Noting the country’s L.G.B.T. “boom,” Kazuya Kawaguchi, a sociology professor at Hiroshima Shudo University, pointed to two television dramas featuring the lives of gay men — “Ossan’s Love” and “What Did You Eat Yesterday?” — that became surprise hits this summer. Four episodes of “Queer Eye” were also set in Japan. The television dramas “improved people’s impressions of gay couples,” Mr. Kawaguchi said, adding that “the way they were shot, the language, were easy to understand.” At the same time, attitudes have been changing among Japanese companies as they have embraced gay consumers and steadily increased their support for gay employees.  Still, many of them have stopped short of becoming involved in the politics of same-sex marriage. In September 2018, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan issued a position paper arguing that legalizing same-sex marriage would make the country more attractive for talent from abroad. Sixty-seven organizations have signed on to the statement, but so far only a handful have been Japanese firms, including Panasonic and the building materials manufacturer Lixil. While domestic media coverage of changing norms abroad has “contributed to a huge amount of discussion here, very few people in the Japanese corporate workplace or in family situations feel comfortable coming out,” said Laurence Bates, 63, who became one of the few openly gay directors of a major Japanese company last year when he was appointed to Panasonic’s board.  The mixed feelings are evident in statistics from the 26 localities that recognize same-sex partnerships. As of October, only 617 couples had registered their partnerships, according to Nijiiro Diversity, a nonprofit that fights discrimination against gay people in the workplace. Advocates note, however, that the process involves considerable red tape and delivers few concrete benefits.  On the national level, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has refused to deliberate a bill proposed by opposition parties that would change Japan’s civil code to recognize same-sex marriages.  The party insists that legalizing the unions would require changing the country’s Constitution: Article 24 of the document says that “marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes,” language that conservative lawmakers have interpreted as requiring the participation of one man and one woman. That argument, however, has already begun to show weaknesses. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations has rejected the position, and in September, a local court became the first in Japan to recognize two people of the same sex as being in a common-law marriage. In the ruling, in which a woman whose female partner had an affair was awarded damages, the judge said that Article 24’s wording did not prohibit unions between same-sex partners. The lawyers fighting on behalf of Mr. Sato, Ms. Ono and the other couples hope that their lawsuits will make it even harder for the government to continue making its claim. It could be several years, though, before the courts issue a judgment, said Makiko Terahara, the lead lawyer on the case and a director of Marriage for All Japan, a nonprofit organization.  “It’s an important tool, but of course it’s better if the Diet were to make same-sex marriage a reality by changing civil law first,” she said, referring to the national Parliament. For the couples, a change in the law cannot come soon enough. “The No. 1 reason I thought I had to participate in this lawsuit was that I wanted to show my children that it’s O.K. that we’re a family,” Ms. Ono said. “When we’re at home, we’re very naturally a family, but when we go out, there are times when we are treated as though we aren’t,” she added. Mr. Sato, who works at a nonprofit promoting H.I.V. education, does not know if he will be around to see the change. He is H.I.V.-positive and has diabetes and high blood pressure. “I hope it happens while I’m still alive,” he said.  He expects that legalization of same-sex marriage will encourage his partner to express his sexuality beyond the gay community and open up to his family and colleagues. “There would be no greater happiness,” he told the court, “than legally marrying my partner and becoming a couple in the real sense before I die.”']",The country is being pulled in two directions as it experiences a “boom” in L.G.B.T. awareness but also remains committed to a sometimes inflexible traditional culture.
"Suddenly, the Chinese Threat to Australia Seems Very Real",2019-11-29,By Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay,"['CANBERRA, Australia — A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing. A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities. For a country that just wants calm commerce with China — the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth — the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt.  Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing’s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present. “It’s become the inescapable issue,” said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. “We’ve underestimated how quickly China’s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.” American officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others.  In public and in private, they’ve pushed Australia’s leaders to confront China more directly — pressure that may only grow after President Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong. Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia’s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom, a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need.   As a result, the country’s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China. In the most troubling recent case, first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, the Australian authorities have confirmed that they are investigating accusations made by Nick Zhao, an Australian businessman who told intelligence officials that he had been the target of a plot to install him in Parliament as a Chinese agent. Mr. Zhao, a 32-year-old luxury car dealer, was a member of his local Liberal Party branch. He was a “perfect target for cultivation,” according to Andrew Hastie, a federal lawmaker and tough critic of Beijing who was briefed on the case.  He told The Age that Mr. Zhao was “a bit of a high-roller in Melbourne, living beyond his means.” Another businessman with ties to the Chinese government, Mr. Zhao said, offered to provide a million Australian dollars ($677,000) to finance his election campaign for Parliament. But a few months later, in March, Mr. Zhao was found dead in a hotel room. The state’s coroner is investigating the cause of death. In a rare statement, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia’s domestic spy agency, said on Monday that his organization was aware of Mr. Zhao’s case and was taking it very seriously. The Chinese government, however, called the accusations a sign of Australian hysteria. “Stories like ‘Chinese espionage’ or ‘China’s infiltration in Australia,’ with however bizarre plots and eye-catching details, are nothing but lies,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a regular news briefing on Monday. Beijing has similarly dismissed the case that emerged last week, which involves a young asylum seeker named Wang Liqiang. Mr. Wang presented himself to the Australian authorities as an important intelligence asset — an assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who Mr. Wang says is responsible for spying, propaganda and disinformation campaigns aimed at quashing dissent in Hong Kong and undermining democracy in Taiwan. China asserts that he is simply a convicted swindler. On Thursday, a Communist Party tabloid, The Global Times, released video of what it said was Mr. Wang’s 2016 trial on fraud charges, where a young man confessed to bilking someone out of $17,000. Xiang Xin, the man Mr. Wang identified as his former boss, has denied having anything to do with him, or even knowing him. The challenge of the case is just beginning. While some analysts have raised doubts about Mr. Wang’s assertions, elements in the detailed 17-page account that he gave to the authorities as part of an asylum application are being taken seriously by law enforcement agencies worldwide.  Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice detained Mr. Xiang and another executive with the company Mr. Wang said he worked for, China Innovation Investment Limited. Investigators in Taiwan are looking into assertions that their business acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies. Other details in Mr. Wang’s account — about the kidnapping of booksellers in Hong Kong, spying on Hong Kong university students, and the theft of military technology from the United States — are still being examined by Australian officials. “Australia’s peak intelligence agencies are being put to the test,” said John Fitzgerald, a China specialist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. “It’s a tough call, and they cannot afford to get it wrong.” What’s clear, though, is that they are helping to push the public away from supporting cozy relations. Polls showed a hardening of Australian attitudes about China even before the past week.  Now Mr. Hastie, the China hawk and Liberal Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament’s joint intelligence committee, says his office has been overwhelmed by people across the country who have emailed, called and even sent handwritten letters expressing outrage and anxiety about China’s actions in Australia. Questions of loyalty continue to swirl around another Liberal Party member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, who fumbled responses to questions in September about her membership in various groups linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The espionage cases also follow several months of rising tensions at Australian universities, where protests by students from Hong Kong have been disrupted, sometimes with violence, by opponents from the Chinese mainland. Several student activists have told the authorities that they have been followed or photographed by people who appear to be associated with the Chinese Consulate. It has even happened to at least one high-profile former official, John Garnaut. A longtime journalist who produced a classified report on Chinese interference for former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, he recently acknowledged publicly that he had been stalked by people who appeared to be Chinese agents — in some cases when he was with his family. These actions of apparent aggression point to a version of China that Australians hardly know. For decades, Australia has based its relations with Beijing on a simple idea: Let’s get rich together. And the mining companies that are especially close to Mr. Morrison’s conservative government have been the biggest winners.  But now more than ever, the country is seeing that for the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, it’s no longer just about wealth and trade. “The transactions aren’t satisfying them enough; they want more,” said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University. “They want to gain influence over decisions about the further involvement of the United States, about further protestations to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, in the South Pacific, in Taiwan.” Mr. Blaxland, along with American officials, often points out that Australia’s biggest export to China, iron ore, is hard to obtain elsewhere reliably and at the prices Australia’s companies charge. That suggests that the country has more leverage than its leaders might think.  Mr. Hastie, who was recently denied a visa to travel to China as part of a study group that included other members of Parliament, agreed. In an interview, he said the recent revelations were “the first time the Australian public has a concrete example of what we are facing.”  Now, he added, it’s time to adapt. ']","After a businessman said Chinese agents sought to implant him in Parliament, that revelation and other espionage cases have finally signaled the end of a “let’s get rich together” era."
Bangladesh Sentences 7 to Death Over 2016 Bakery Attack,2019-11-27,By Julfikar Ali Manik and Kai Schultz,"['DHAKA, Bangladesh — Seven militants linked to the Islamic State were sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi court on Wednesday for their role in planning a gruesome 2016 attack at an upscale bakery in Dhaka, one of the worst such attacks the country has suffered. The attack, which left 24 people dead and was initially claimed by the Islamic State, at the time represented one of the clearest indications that the group had made inroads in South Asia. And after their sentence was handed down on Wednesday, the convicted men vowed to carry out an even bloodier attack.  The violence took place in July 2016 in a diplomatic enclave of Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country. Militants armed with machetes, grenades and rifles stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery, sorted foreigners from Bangladeshis, and then slaughtered hostages during an 11-hour standoff with the military.  The gunmen complained to the restaurant’s staff that foreigners, with their revealing clothing and ease consuming alcohol, were a threat to Islam. Eventually, they ordered patrons to cite verses from the Quran and killed those who could not.  At one point, according to survivors, the attackers asked the restaurant’s staff to turn on the Wi-Fi network and then posted images of the carnage online.  The seven convicted men belonged to the banned militant group Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh.  Abdullah Abu, a public prosecutor on the case, said that 21 people were implicated in plotting the attack, including five militants who were killed when soldiers rushed the bakery. Eight other people were killed in subsequent security raids. Mr. Abu said the remaining men were involved in supplying arms, money and training to the attackers, who came mostly from educated, cosmopolitan backgrounds. One person was acquitted for lack of evidence. On Wednesday, the convicted men did not appear to show remorse for their actions, the prosecutor said. “The attackers’ ultimate goal was to implement their plan of jihad,” he said. “The judge said this terror attack was horrifying and had spread shock waves inside and outside the country.” Among the dead were nine Italians, seven Bangladeshis, seven Japanese, one American and one Indian.  For months after the attack, Dhaka’s diplomatic area was eerily quiet. Restaurants were empty for days, and foreigners did not leave their compounds. When the Holey Artisan Bakery reopened in 2017, visitors burst into tears and hugged staff members. The attack encouraged Islamist militants in Bangladesh, where Western intelligence officers had worried that the Islamic State and other extremist groups could find fertile ground to spread their message. Until 2016, local militants had carried out only isolated killings, mostly of religious minorities and bloggers critical of hard-line Islam.  Mohammad Delwar Hossain, a lawyer representing four of the convicted men, said they planned to appeal the sentence.  He also expressed surprise that some of the convicted men had worn caps bearing an Islamic State-like emblem to the hearing. “They were produced before the court through special security,” he said. “So this is also my question: How and from where did they get this cap?” As the men were taken back to prison in a caged police van, they screamed at journalists huddled on the roadside. Among their cries: “We are soldiers of God! We are not scared of death sentences! We are the winners! We will carry out an even bigger incident than this one.” Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.']","The militants were found guilty in violence that killed two dozen people at an upscale bakery, one of the worst such attacks in the country."
"Center-Right Candidate Wins in Uruguay, Ending 15 Years of Liberal Rule",2019-11-28,By Daniel Politi,"['The presidential candidate of the center-left coalition that has governed Uruguay for 15 years conceded defeat on Thursday, four days after a close and contentious runoff election, as the nation joined others in the region in shifting rightward. The concession ushers in Luis Lacalle Pou of the center-right National Party as the country’s new leader. It also spells an end to the tenure of the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist and center-left parties that oversaw the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and the sale of marijuana. Mr. Lacalle Pou’s rival, Daniel Martínez of the Broad Front, conceded even as the vote count continued on Thursday. Mr. Martínez acknowledged on Twitter that the counting of provisional ballots would “not modify the trend” and said he would meet with Mr. Lacalle Pou on Friday. Brazil, Chile, Bolivia and Colombia have also moved rightward to varying degrees, though Argentina recently elected a center-left president. Venezuela’s leftist government is hanging on despite political and economic turmoil.  Mr. Lacalle Pou, 46, the son of a former president, has vowed to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after the tight vote, a sentiment conveyed in his Twitter message thanking Mr. Martínez. After the polls closed on Sunday, Mr. Lacalle Pou expressed confidence he would come out victorious but vowed to wait for the final tally to call himself president-elect. “Almost half voted for one candidate, and the other half plus a little bit for another candidate,” Mr. Lacalle Pou said. “Today’s result confirms that the next government can’t change one half of the country for another. We must unite society. We must unite Uruguayans.” That language marked a change in approach for Mr. Lacalle Pou, said Mariana Pomiés, executive director of Cifra, a local polling firm. “That was about recognizing that there is a large group of people who voted for the other side,” Ms. Pomiés said. “It was a recognition that there is an important group of people who see reality in a different way.” Mr. Lacalle Pou did suggest Thursday that he would pursue a change in the country’s foreign policy, exchanging a friendly message on Twitter with Juan Guaidó, Venezuela’s opposition leader, who has proclaimed himself the country’s rightful leader. Uruguay had been one of the few countries in the region that did not recognize Mr. Guaidó over the embattled Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro. Mr. Lacalle Pou vowed to change that during his campaign, and on Thursday he responded to a congratulatory message from Mr. Guaidó by vowing to defend “democracies and human rights.” Mr. Lacalle Pou won in the runoff election by drawing support from candidates who did not make it to the second round. He will now face the challenge of keeping them united despite their disparate ideologies, at a time when several countries in the region are mired in protests and economic malaise.

Roadside Bomb Kills 13 People on Their Way to Afghan Wedding,2019-11-28,By Fahim Abed and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 13 people, most of them members of the same family, were killed this week when their car struck a roadside bomb on the way to a wedding party in northern Afghanistan, officials said. The bombing Wednesday in Kunduz Province was the latest reminder of how short the distance between joy and grief can be in Afghan life. With the 18-year war having long lost any sense of clear front-lines, carnage can strike anywhere from a mosque to a wedding hall to a country road. The family of Aziz Rahman, 40, had been on their way to the wedding of one of his cousins in Taliban-controlled territory when their car struck the roadside bomb on Wednesday afternoon. Of the 16 people, mostly young children, who had been in the Toyota wagon, only Mr. Rahman and two others survived.  His mother, his wife, a sister and five of his children were killed, along with two young nephews and three other relatives. A daughter survived.  “I had bought new clothes for all of them, for my kids and for their mom. But now they will all be buried in the earth,” Mr. Rahman said on Thursday, weeping as he spoke.  “I am dead, I am finished, I am destroyed.” As the war spirals on, more and more Afghan civilians have been killed by roadside bombs planted by the Taliban, as well as by American and Afghan airstrikes, which have been on the rise. A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the militants were investigating the bombing Wednesday.  Improvised explosives have become one of the leading causes of civilian casualties, killing roughly 400 civilians in 2018, according to United Nations data. The bombs are hidden to avoid detection, and many demining agencies in Afghanistan have been largely unable to find and defuse them.  Last Saturday, at least 10 civilians were killed and five others were wounded in what was thought to be an American airstrike in the Pushtiroud district in the western province of Farah, according to Abdul Hakim Rasooli, head of the provincial hospital. On Thursday, Afghanistan’s human rights commission called for an investigation into the airstrike to hold those responsible to account. Mr. Rahman’s relatives had been straddling the line between government and Taliban control to make the wedding ceremony happen. The house of the groom, Mr. Rahman’s cousin, is in the Imam Saheb district, which is largely controlled by the Taliban. The bride lives in the government-controlled city of Kunduz, as does Mr. Rahman.  Mr. Rahman remembered his family excitedly piling into the rented Toyota wagon in their new clothes to drive to his cousin’s home. A hired driver was at the wheel. Mr. Rahman said he noticed a branch in the road, which apparently covered the hole dug to plant the bomb, just before the blast ripped through the vehicle. “I lost consciousness after the explosion,” he said. “When I gained it back, I was stuck in the vehicle, my daughter was crying.”  Mr. Rahman was only slightly injured, and his daughter was unhurt. He was brought to a pharmacy for treatment, while others who gathered at the scene took his daughter to a nearby house.  When he returned to the scene, Mr. Rahman saw people gathering body parts. Some of the dead had been covered with shawls.  Mr. Rahman’s brother, Samiullah, said preparations for a festive night had been underway when the news of the explosion came. A daf, a large frame drum, was going to be played — an instrument that the Taliban allows at wedding parties, though they otherwise ban all forms of music in areas under their control. The bride and groom will now wait at least 40 days, the traditional period of mourning, before getting married. Even then, the ceremony is sure to be shadowed by what happened on Wednesday.  “We were planning to have lots of fun in the wedding,” Mr. Samiullah said. “They would have arrived in 10 minutes to the groom’s house, and our happiness would have continued. But the driver took a wrong turn — he turned right instead of left, and the car was blown up.” He added, “If only they had turned left, there wouldn’t be any problem.” Fahim Abed reported from Kabul and Najim Rahim from Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan.

"Shmoo Cake, Persians and Spudnuts: Touring Canada’s Regional Cuisine",2019-11-29,By Ian Austen,"['Dan Bilefsky, my colleague who is based in his hometown, Montreal, looked into a existential threat that has united, sort of, two of the city’s greatest rivals: Fairmount Bagel and St-Viateur Bagel. The threat is the prospect that the city might ban the wood-burning ovens that are a key component of what makes Montreal bagels, at least to their proponents, the world champions of bagels. Those of you who are unfamiliar with Montreal bagels can learn about what distinguishes them from other bagels, the St-Viateur-Fairmount rivalry and the debate over which shop’s doughy circles are the finest by reading Dan’s entertaining story. [Read: A Montreal Bagel War Unites Rival Kings] But I have to share one quotation from the article to give you a sense of the limits of the current collaboration between the shops: “His bagels went to the moon, yeah, sure,” the owner of St-Viateur said of his competitor’s shop. “But the oldest? Give me one iota of proof!” Montreal bagels are just one of many foods associated with a city, province or region. Of course, Montreal and Quebec can also add smoked meat, steamies, sugar pie and poutine to their lists. Some local favorites have made their way across the country. Montreal-style bagels are pulled out of a wood-burning oven 24 hours a day just a few blocks from my house in Ottawa. And a couple of weeks ago when I was out running in Calgary, I passed a shop with signs boasting about its similarly authentic Montreal bagels. But many other food oddities remain stubbornly local. Here, by city or province, is my unquestionably incomplete list of regional dishes. Newfoundland: The most recent newcomer to the confederation is up there with Quebec when it comes to having its own cuisine. Seal flipper pie — think of a chicken potpie but with seal meat — is perhaps the only one from the province that attracts both admirers and critics from animal rights groups. A jiggs’ dinner, a largely boiled meal based around salted beef, offers a more substantial alternative. Many delights from The Rock also rely on the fishery, like fried cod tongues (not actually tongues) and scrunchions (fried salt pork). But Newfoundlanders have also developed a whole school of cooking around waxed bologna, or “the big stick.” Halifax: Once its bars close, Nova Scotia’s capital meets the early morning nutritional needs of its large student population with the donair: spiced ground beef roasted on a spit, sliced and served with a distinctive sauce on a pita. Like Montreal and bagels, which shop produces the finest or most authentic donair is a subject of debate. There also appears to be some questioning of whether a donair is actually different than shawarma or a gyro.  New Brunswick: Fiddleheads, the curly shoots of ostrich ferns, are free for the picking each spring. The province’s tourism authority offers this description of their flavor: “similar to asparagus or artichokes … kind of.” Prince Edward Island: Islanders, please help me out. There appears to be no end to various fish, potato and lobster dishes, but none appear to be obviously of P.E.I. Perhaps potato fish cakes fit the bill, but their popularity and place in its cooking history are unclear. Thunder Bay, Ontario: Bisected by both transcontinental train lines and the Trans-Canada Highway, and also the last port on the Great Lakes, Thunder Bay attracted immigrants from around the world who brought their cooking with them. They included my maternal grandfather, Mike Holavec. Originally from Ukraine, he came to Thunder Bay from Manitoba to work as a logger. Two dishes have emerged from that history. First the dense, egg-rich Finnish pancake. As I wrote in 2015, it really isn’t from Finland but is most likely a variation of something that was served to my grandfather in lumber camps. It is on the menu at several places around town, but Finnish pancakes are most closely associated with the Hoito, a Finnish restaurant that started as a cooperative catering to lumberjacks. Thunder Bay’s other contribution to Canadian cooking is the Persian, an oddly named variation of the cinnamon bun topped with lurid pink icing. Winnipeg: Bannock, of course, is found in Indigenous communities throughout North America. But I associate the ritual of the flatbread served with tea with Manitoba’s capital city and the surrounding area into northwestern Ontario. Winnipeg has at least two dessert obsessions. Imperial cookies are two vanilla biscuits, joined by jam and topped with icing. As with Montreal’s bagels, there are varying opinions about which Winnipeg bakery makes the best ones.  Shmoo, or Schmoo, is Winnipeg’s tall torte based on angel food cake, layered up with whipped cream, caramel and pecans.  Saskatchewan: Even in a Canada that is increasingly divided by region, we can all probably agree that anything made using Saskatoon berries is a treat. While it’s not really a dish, I’ve been in restaurants in Saskatchewan, as well as in Alberta, that offer pirogi as a breakfast side-order option. Lethbridge, Alberta: This one may be more of a food obituary. The Crazy Cakes Bakery claimed to be the last shop in Canada still producing spudnuts: doughnuts made with potato flour. But about a month ago, it shut down. Vancouver: The city of sushi is the home of the B.C. roll, which contains barbecue salmon skin and a sweet sauce or mayonnaise. And there’s an Indian pizza scene in Vancouver that involves toppings like butter chicken and chili chicken tikka. Of course, a short ferry trip from Vancouver can take visitors to Nanaimo, British Columbia, home of that no-bake, namesake wonder dessert, the Nanaimo bar. In the interest of not offending anyone from that city, I will not go into the old joke about what’s in a Nanaimo bar. As mentioned, this list is woefully incomplete. Neither I nor several friends or relatives could come up with anything specifically associated with Toronto, for example, despite the city’s proliferation of restaurants.

Iraq Prime Minister Says He Will Resign Amid Protests,2019-11-29,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['The announcement comes after demonstrators set fire to the Iranian Consulate and hundreds died in antigovernment unrest. By Alissa J. Rubin BAGHDAD — Pressured by an expanding protest movement and a rising death toll, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said Friday that he would submit his resignation to Parliament, taking the country into greater uncertainty and possibly months of turmoil ahead.  Mr. Mahdi’s resignation would make him another prominent political casualty in a wave of recent antigovernment unrest that has swept the region.  Deep-seated anger over corruption and Iran’s influence in Iraqi politics are the major drivers of the protests across Iraq. In Lebanon, citizen rage over that country’s dysfunctional government pushed its prime minister to announce his resignation in October. And in Iran itself, the authorities scrambled to crush protests and riots in 100 cities set off a few weeks ago by an abrupt increase in fuel prices — the deadliest unrest to hit Iran in years. The prime minister’s announcement was a particularly bitter blow for Iran, which had handpicked Mr. Mahdi and on Wednesday suffered an attack on its consulate in the southern city of Najaf. The building was severely damaged by firebombs thrown by protesters. Iran has repeatedly sought to prop up Mr. Mahdi since he became prime minister in 2018, according to leaked Iranian intelligence reports obtained by The Intercept and shared with The New York Times. Mr. Mahdi worked closely with Iran while Saddam Hussein was in power, and for years he served as a member of a large Shiite party tied to Iran. He became an independent in 2017, but the leaked cables suggest he kept close ties to Iran in recent years. Mr. Mahdi’s announcement on Friday initially prompted jubilant celebrations at the main protest site, Tahrir Square in Baghdad, but the happiness faded quickly, tempered by mourning for people killed in the protests and an acknowledgment there will be little immediate change.  “This is the first step,” said Hiatt Mehdi, 60, a widow with seven children, including a son who has been demonstrating for the last 35 days without coming home. She had come to Tahrir Square to congratulate her son that his efforts seemed to have been rewarded by Mr. Mahdi’s announcement.   “But it’s really not enough.” she said.  Mr. Mahdi’s decision was announced a day after at least 40 protesters were killed in a violent crackdown following the attack on the Iranian Consulate that fanned demonstrations across Iraq’s Shiite south.  At least 354 have been killed since antigovernment protests began at the start of October and more than 8,000 have been wounded, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights said. Its most recent report notes “the actual total is likely to be higher.” Many of those killed, like one boy, Hussein Abid, 16, who was shot Thursday near Al Ahrar bridge in Baghdad, look even younger than their age; they are largely unarmed and come from poor families. He came from Sadr City, a vast Shiite slum in eastern Baghdad.   The protests and accompanying violence have occurred almost entirely in Baghdad and the Shiite south of Iraq, where mostly young people and poorer people have taken to the streets demanding sweeping changes in the political system. They want to see an end to the political parties, which demand kickbacks for licenses, contracts and jobs.  Even young people applying for low-level positions like security guards or elementary schoolteachers who are not affiliated with the correct party might be asked to pay $5,000 for a state job, a large sum for most Iraqis. In Iraq, government positions are viewed as the only secure jobs and the private sector remains small.  Many of the parties that dominate Parliament are close to Iran and it is an open secret that Iranian officials helped to set up the current government last year, brokering an agreement that brought in Mr. Mahdi, President Barham Salih and the house speaker, Mohammed Al-Halbousi.  Earlier this month Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force, Iran’s elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, brokered an agreement to keep Mr. Mahdi in office for at least six weeks, but the protests and criticism from Shiite religious leaders in Najaf cut short Mr. Mahdi’s reprieve.  In Iran, where officials were already furious over the Najaf consulate destruction, Mr. Mahdi’s announcement only added fuel to their suspicions that Iran’s enemies in the Middle East were behind it. The recent turmoil in both Iraq and Iran was part of a “coordinated regional plot to destroy the relationship between our two countries,” said Iran’s ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi, a former Quds Force commander. “Iranians should know that this is by no means what the Iraqi government, politicians or officials want,” Mr. Masjedi told Iranian state television. “It’s not what the Iraqi people want.” In a statement issued by his office on Friday, Mr. Mahdi said he was stepping down so that the government could “reconsider its options” and “preserve the blood of its people, and avoid slipping into a cycle of violence, chaos and devastation.” Pressure has been building for some time on the prime minister, who was also facing the growing threat of a humiliating parliamentary no-confidence petition. He said his decision was prompted after Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, on Friday urged the parliament to “reconsider its options” and to stop procrastinating, or “the country will pay a high price and everyone will regret it.” Washington had wanted Mr. Mahdi to remain in power, fearing that if he were swept away — as some protesters have wanted — it would lead to chaos, more extensive bloodshed or even a renewed civil war. The United States is interested in maintaining Iraqi stability as a bulwark against Islamist extremists.  Still, the United States is seeking changes in the Iraqi political system to root out corruption and create an electoral system less dominated by sectarian political parties. Those parties have tended to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people. By offering his resignation, Mr. Mahdi would be taking the first step to prompt a change in the government. But the potential loomed for protracted delays in forming a new government. Mr. Mahdi, who a month ago expressed a willingness to step down but held off, has not yet submitted his resignation, though he is expected to follow through this time.  The Parliament could accept Mr. Mahdi’s resignation as soon as Sunday, when it meets after the Muslim weekend. That would leave Mr. Mahdi and his ministers in a caretaker government until a new prime minister is named by President Salih.  Under the Iraqi constitution that should take place quickly but in the past agreeing on a prime minister has proved to be a tortuous process of balancing competing political factions that, in Mr. Mahdi’s case, took a year.  The prospect of delay helps explain why the initial euphoria on the street Friday was diminished by the acknowledgment among the protesters that without far broader changes, Mr. Mahdi’s resignation would contribute little to their long-term goal of transforming the Iraqi state.  “Adil Mehdi’s resignation means nothing,” said Abdul Mutalib, 26, a pharmacist.  “This is just like a drug, an injection to anesthetize the people,” Mr. Mutalib said. “It doesn’t bring any change.” The protesters have called for a complete overhaul of the system that would push many of the parties out of the Parliament, depriving them of lucrative ministries. But it remains to be seen if they can persuade lawmakers to vote to disband a system that has served their interests.  President Salih is pushing for an election law that would achieve those goals. But the version he sent to Parliament has already been amended into something that seems likely to perpetuate the current system, legal experts say.  For many of the protesters, who have already spent weeks on the street, the events on Friday were just one stop on what they expect to be a long road, said Abu Mohammad, 45, a construction worker and father of six.  “We don’t know who Adel Abdul Mahdi is, he did not come through elections,” he said. “We want all of the government to resign, we don’t want parties, so this step of Adil means nothing, they are trying to fool us and then they will replace him with someone worse.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.']",
Espionage and Interference? Australia Grapples With Its China Relationship,2019-11-29,By Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay,"[' The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue begins with an excerpt from a news analysis by Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay. A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing. A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities. For a country that just wants calm commerce with China — the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth — the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt. Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing’s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present. “It’s become the inescapable issue,” said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. “We’ve underestimated how quickly China’s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.” American officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others. In public and in private, they’ve pushed Australia’s leaders to confront China more directly — pressure that may only grow after President Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong. Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia’s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom — a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need. As a result, the country’s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China.

"North Korea Launches 2 Rockets, South Says",2019-11-28,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched two rockets from its east coast on Thursday, days after firing artillery near a disputed sea border, South Korean defense officials said. The rockets were launched from the town of Yonpo, the South Korean military said in a statement. It said the two short-range projectiles were launched from what North Korea calls a “super-large multiple rocket launcher,” a new weapon used in some of the North’s recent  tests. The rockets flew up to 236 miles before landing in waters between North Korea and Japan, the military said.  It was the first weapons test by the North since its leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered troops to fire artillery during a visit Saturday to a front-line military unit near a disputed western sea border between the two Koreas. The North Korean state media revealed that test on Monday, drawing a protest from South Korea, which accused the North of violating an agreement not to conduct military drills near the border. The launches Thursday were the latest in a series carried out by the North since its talks with the Trump administration over its nuclear weapons have stalled.  North Korea announced an end to its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in April 2018, two months before Mr. Kim’s first summit meeting with President Trump in Singapore. At those talks, Mr. Kim committed to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for better relations and security guarantees from Washington. But subsequent talks on how to implement the broadly worded deal have since collapsed, and North Korea has resumed a series of mostly short-range rocket or ballistic missile tests. On Oct. 31, it launched two projectiles, also from a “super-large” rocket launcher.” Such tests have largely been seen as demonstrations of growing impatience on Mr. Kim’s part. North Korea has repeatedly urged Washington to return to the negotiating table with a more flexible proposal by the end of this year. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.']","The short-range projectiles were launched off the North’s east coast, days after Kim Jong-un ordered artillery fire near a disputed sea border."
"In Afghanistan, Trump Creates Confusion Over U.S. Policy on Taliban",2019-11-29,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — After abruptly axing nearly a year of delicate peace talks with the Taliban in September, President Trump put the negotiations back on the front-burner this week in a similarly jolting fashion by seeming to demand a cease-fire that his negotiators had long concluded was overly ambitious. Despite a sense of relief at the prospect of resuming talks to end the 18-year conflict, Western diplomats and Taliban leaders were scrambling to figure out whether Mr. Trump had suddenly moved the goal posts for negotiations.  They were particularly confused by his remarks, made during an unannounced Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan, that the United States was once again meeting with the Taliban to discuss a deal, but that “we’re saying it has to be a cease-fire.”  Demanding a cease-fire would amount to a big shift in the American position and require a significant new concession from the Taliban — one that the Americans have little leverage to extract. For much of the yearlong talks, the Taliban and the United States were fundamentally on the same page: The Taliban wanted the Americans out of Afghanistan, and Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to end what he has called America’s unending wars. But agreeing upon the details of a deal proved complicated.  In the agreement the two sides were on the verge of finalizing before Mr. Trump pulled the plug, the best the American negotiators could get the Taliban to consent to was some  reduction in violence. Discussions on a comprehensive cease-fire were relegated to future talks between the Taliban and Afghan leaders — only after the United States had pledged, and begun, to withdraw its troops. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested the Taliban position had shifted. “They didn’t want to do a cease-fire, but now they do want to do a cease-fire, I believe,” he said. “And it will probably work out that way. And we’ll see what happens.” The Taliban seemed surprised by Mr. Trump’s declaration. While the group’s negotiators have held informal meetings with United States diplomats in recent weeks about ways to go back to the table, on Friday their leaders said their original position on a cease-fire had not changed. “The Americans walked away from the negotiating table, and now the ball is on their side — it is up to them to come back if they want to solve this and get the document to signing and to the stage of implementation,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban’s negotiation team, said in an interview. “Our positions remain the same.” It’s unclear how American negotiators could get the Taliban to agree to a cease-fire now, when they were not able to do so earlier. The American military has already begun scaling back its presence in the country, giving negotiators even less leverage than they had before. Last month, the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, said the number of troops had been reduced by 2,000 over the past year.  Mr. Trump, on Thursday, said he was “bringing down the number of troops substantially.” For the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, Mr. Trump’s statements were welcome. For months, Mr. Ghani had unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Americans not to give away an American troop withdrawal without a cease-fire because that would leave his government even more vulnerable.  The government has already been weakened by being excluded from the talks so far because the Taliban refuse to engage before an American troop withdrawal. Now, suddenly, the American president gave Mr. Ghani’s position a boost at a difficult time for him, when he is stuck in a bitter fight over his re-election in a disputed vote, which is tipping the country to crisis.  Mr. Ghani met with Mr. Trump at the Bagram Air Field on the eve of large protests by supporters of his rival, Abdullah Abdullah. Much of the Afghan capital was under a lockdown by security forces on Friday morning as thousands marched to a roundabout behind the presidential palace demanding fraudulent votes be thrown out.  Mr. Abdullah accuses the country’s election commission of including 300,000 questionable votes in favor of Mr. Ghani. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah are partners in a coalition government brokered by the United States when a similar disputed election between the two went to a stalemate in 2014. The current power dispute dividing the country has added to the complications of resuming the peace efforts. The hope is that peace talks would eventually lead to direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan leaders over the political future of the country after the United States commits to withdrawing its remaining troops, currently about 13,000 or fewer. Keeping the peace process alive after Mr. Trump canceled talks in September has required quiet, delicate diplomacy, including work that resulted in a prisoner swap and some reduction in violence. Mr. Trump’s latest interjection in what has been a tedious diplomatic balancing act will once again have his negotiators scrambling to try to pull off what many Western officials have described as an unrealistic goal. The Taliban see a cease-fire before the signing of a deal for the end of the American military presence as an existential issue. They believe they will not be able to rally their forces again if they ask their fighters to stop fighting and then the deal breaks down. But the government of Mr. Ghani has said negotiating the future cannot happen under the barrel of a gun, demanding a cease-fire as a precondition to any talks. When Mr. Trump called off the talks, the Taliban realized they had pushed their hand too far by continuing to launch attacks just days before what was expected to be a signing of the deal. In recent weeks, American diplomats persuaded the group to reduce large attacks in the Afghan capital significantly as part of the prisoner swap that saw the release of an American and Australian hostage in return for senior Taliban leaders.  But delivering a comprehensive, declared cease-fire is always going to be difficult internally for a movement that is trying to maintain unity as it negotiates potentially divisive issues. One Western official aware of the latest peace developments said he had not seen a tangible shift in the Taliban’s position on a cease-fire during the period the talks were called off. The official expressed concern that if the Taliban were forced to reject Mr. Trump’s apparent demand of a cease-fire to keep their own ranks united, that could further complicate the formal resumption of the negotiations. “There’s probably now some work for U.S. diplomats to do to clarify to the Taliban what did the imprecise words actually mean, and whether or not there is a change in position,” said Laurel Miller, a former United States diplomat who is now the Asia director of the think tank International Crisis Group.  “The U.S. has been looking for something in the realm of the reduction in violence,” she added, “but the idea that the U.S. is on the same page with Ghani on cease-fire being a precondition — I don’t see that at all.” Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.']",The president said stalled talks with the militant group were back on and called for a cease-fire — something his negotiators had deemed unrealistic. 
The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in December,2019-11-29,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for December, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Marriage Story’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 One of the best films of the year — and perhaps the best film of Noah Baumbach’s career — “Marriage Story” may be a tear-jerker about the excruciating process of divorce, but there’s a warmth and humanity to it that suggests a light at the end of the tunnel. Adam Driver gives a searing performance as a New York theater director who is caught flat-footed when his wife (Scarlett Johansson), an accomplished actress, hires a tough attorney (Laura Dern) and threatens to resettle with their eight-year-old son in Los Angeles. As he counters with attorneys of his own, the two enter into a protracted battle that drains them of money and emotional stability. ‘6 Underground’ Starts streaming: Dec. 13 Netflix has loaded up November and December with serious awards contenders like “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story” and “The Two Popes,” but it’s also willing to burn through a nine-figure budget for “6 Underground,” a blockbuster-sized movie piped straight into your living room. Directed by Michael Bay, whose name is associated with sleek-but-stupid commercial action hits like the “Bad Boys” and “Transformers” franchises, the film stars Ryan Reynolds as the leader of a vigilante squad composed of men and women who have faked their own deaths to stay off the grid. That freedom from the law and accountability allows them to take down the world’s worst criminals without having to follow the rules. ‘The Two Popes’ Starts streaming: Dec. 20 Reminiscent of the historical two-handers “Frost/Nixon,” this thoughtful and surprisingly funny drama imagines a series of conversations between the arch-conservative Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Argentine reformer who would become Pope Francis. As Benedict and Francis, respectively, Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce have a feisty chemistry as they argue in earnest over how best to address the issues and scandals that face the Catholic Church in the 21st century. But the two develop a fascinating bond despite their contentiousness, particularly over a shared passion for soccer. The script by Anthony McCarten (“Darkest Hour”) can seem contrived and reductive at times, but it gives maximum latitude to the actors, who are a riveting study in contrasts. ‘All the Money in the World’ Starts streaming: Dec. 25 Due for release less than two months after Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct, “All the Money in the World” got the bulk of its notoriety for Ridley Scott reshooting all of Spacey’s scenes with Christopher Plummer in the role and still hitting a Christmas release date. Plummer’s presence as J. Paul Getty winds up dominating the film, which recounts the 1973 kidnapping of Getty’s 16-year-old grandson and the tragedy that inevitably resulted when the miserly entrepreneur refused to pay the ransom. Michelle Williams is also good as the boy’s mother, who does everything she can to plead with Getty to do the right thing. ‘Home For Christmas’ Starts streaming: Dec. 5 There’s no shortage of holiday options on Netflix every December, but settling on the right ones for family viewing is always a challenge. While “A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby” will likely draw the most attention this month, it might be better to take a chance on international fare like “Home For Christmas,” a six-episode series from Norway that looks to add a little substance to the usual Yuletide rom-com fare. Ida Elise Broch stars as a 30-year-old who’s so tired of being pressured into finding a boyfriend that she lies to her family about having one. That puts her in the predicament of having to find someone to bring home to meet them in 24 days. ‘V Wars’ Starts streaming: Dec. 5 Based on Jonathan Maberry’s comic book series, “V Wars” offers a scenario that sounds like the vampire equivalent of the “Sudden Departure” in “The Leftovers,” only instead of a small fraction of the population disappearing, about five percent of humans turn into vampires. Ian Somerhalder of “The Vampire Diaries” returns to the subgenre as a doctor who investigates a fast-spreading virus that triggers a long-dormant gene in humans. As he works to reverse the virus and save a friend who’s been afflicted by it, the vampire community grows in power and ambition, setting up a global conflict between vampires and humans. ‘The Confession Killer’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 Henry Lee Lucas was by far the most prolific serial killer in history …  according to Henry Lee Lucas. Convicted of murdering 11 people, Lucas gained notoriety for confessing to hundreds more, incentivized by special privileges like steak dinners, strawberry milkshakes and other treats for helping investigators close unsolved cases. The true-crime series “The Confession Killer” digs into the scandal that erupted when Lucas was exposed as a fabulist and the families of victims were seized by anger and newfound uncertainty. The case would transform procedural awareness of false confessions, but at a scandalous cost. ‘Glow Up’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 There seems to be a reality competition show for every trade imaginable — the addictive glassblowing series “Blown Away,” for example, premiered on Netflix last summer — so the BBC One import “Glow Up,” about makeup artists, seems like an inevitability. Much like “The Great British Baking Show,” the tone of “Glow Up” is more about camaraderie than friction, emphasizing the artistry of well-intentioned contestants who try their hand at a variety of looks. They apply makeup from the subtle to the avant-garde, proving they can do original red-carpet looks as well as the prosthetic transformations of science fiction. ‘Triad Princess’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 It’s a common romantic scenario for a young person to buck up against the demands of his or her powerful family, but the Taiwanese series “Triad Princess” brings martial arts and mob violence into the picture. Eugenie Liu stars as the daughter of a triad boss whose fighting skills land a job as a bodyguard for a famous actress, but bring her into conflict with her father, especially when she meets a dashing suitor from that world. By defying his wishes, she threatens to bring mob business out of the shadows and into the open, where the intense scrutiny of the press and fans await. ‘Michelle Wolf: Joke Show’ Starts streaming: Dec. 10 After working as a writer and occasional performer on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” and “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Michelle Wolf had a dramatic breakout year in 2018, when she delivered a notoriously scabrous performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and hosted the fitfully brilliant but short-lived Netflix talk show “The Break with Michelle Wolf.” Now Wolf returns to Netflix with an hourlong comedy special that focuses on gender inequality, the excesses of “woke” culture and the indelicate mating habits of wild animals. ‘Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer’ Starts streaming: Dec. 18 In late 2014, Luka Magnotta, a murderer from Scarborough, Ontario, was convicted of killing Lin Jun, a Chinese international student, and mailing his hands and feet to elementary schools and political offices in Vancouver. The conviction followed a two-year manhunt that finally led to his arrest at an internet café in Berlin, where he was reading news about himself. But as the documentary series “Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer” reveals, the search for Magnotta was aided by animal activists enraged by videos he posted of himself torturing animals. It’s an immensely disturbing story, but also a fascinating example of crowdsourced justice. ‘Soundtrack’ Starts streaming: Dec. 18 To date, producer Megan Ellison and her Annapurna Pictures have been known more for developing audacious movies by directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and Kathryn Bigelow, but the company is putting its prestigious name behind this new musical series from “Quantico” creator Joshua Safran. Nothing much is known about the story, which brings together a disparate group of lonely-hearts in modern-day Los Angeles, but the musical element gives it novelty on television, which hasn’t often found success with the genre. It also has a terrific cast, packed with veterans who haven’t gotten enough screen time lately, including Madeleine Stowe, Campbell Scott and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. ‘The Witcher’ Starts streaming: Dec. 20 Looking to fill the large-scale fantasy vacuum left by the end of “Game of Thrones,” Netflix has invested heavily in at least two seasons of this adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s best-selling book series. Henry Cavill stars as Garalt of Rivia, a hulking loner who was raised as a monster hunter and who’s determined to slash his way through the kingdom without aligning himself with other human beings. His plans change when he joins forces with Princess Ciri (Freya Allan), a Chosen One type who requires his protection from treacherous evil, but proves a quick study in learning his “witcher” techniques and gaining power of her own. ‘John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch’ Starts streaming: Dec. 24 Following his uproarious comedy special from last year, “Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,” John Mulaney is debuting a Christmas Eve special that attempts, in his words, “to recapture the magic of that bygone television era when children sang songs about their feelings with celebrity guests on funky outdoor sets.” Mulaney and two of his collaborators on the nonfiction parody series “Documentary Now,” director Rhys Thomas and composer Eli Bolin, are evoking television’s wholesome variety-show past with “John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch,” which cycles through sketches and original musical numbers with children ages 8 to 13 and hip celebrity guests like David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne and Jake Gyllenhaal. ‘Lost in Space: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Dec. 24 The revived “Lost in Space” premiered to great hype and muted reviews in early 2018, despite an excellent cast and a promising initiative to dial down the campiness and turn the Robinsons’ adventures into a “Lost”-like story of interplanetary intrigue. But the bones of a good show are still present, with Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as would-be Alpha Centauri colonists Maureen and John Robinson, and Parker Posey as the diabolical June Harris, who actively sabotages the Robinsons and other colonists after their ship is breached and they try to survive on a mysterious planet. The second season opens with the Robinsons stranded on an ocean planet without their Robot for help. Also of interest: “Dead Kids” (Dec. 1), “The Shape of Water” (Dec. 1), “Tiffany Haddish: Black Mitzvah” (Dec. 3), “About a Boy” (Dec. 4), “A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby” (Dec. 5), “Astronomy Club: The Sketch Show” (Dec. 6), “Virgin River” (Dec. 6), “Pet Sematary” (Dec. 20), “Terrace House: Tokyo 2019-2020: Part 2” (Dec. 24), “Kevin Hart: Don’t F**k This Up” (Dec. 27).']","New additions include “Marriage Story,” “All the Money in the World"" and “The Witcher.”"
‘99 Problems but My ABCs Ain’t One’: Jay-Z Sues Over Children’s Book,2019-11-28,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — When the children’s alphabet book “A B to Jay-Z” was released by a small Australian online retailer more than two years ago, the company said it sold out within days. But it also drew criticism on social media as a particularly cringe-worthy example of cultural appropriation.  The book, the creation of a company calling itself the Little Homie, featured likenesses of hip-hop artists in the hope of inspiring, as the retailer put it, “the next generation of hood rats.” And it borrowed from famous lyrics, including one of Jay-Z’s: “If you’re having alphabet problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but my ABCs ain’t one.” The Little Homie says this was all in celebration of hip-hop. Jay-Z, who has spoken out about black identity and equality, says it was theft. Jay-Z has now sued the company, alleging trademark and copyright infringement. The use of his name, likeness and references to “99 problems” in the book and other Little Homie products is “a deliberate and knowing attempt to trade off the reputation and good will” of the rapper, and uses his intellectual property “for their own commercial gain,” according to his complaint. Since 2017, the artist’s lawyers have sent several cease-and-desist letters to the Little Homie, according to the complaint. It also alleges that the company had made a “false and misleading representation” that Jay-Z had approved and was affiliated with the book.   The Little Homie said on Thursday it had done nothing wrong and intended to fight the case. “We are unbelievably disappointed to find ourselves caught in a legal battle with someone whose music we love and adore,” Jessica Chiha, the company’s owner, said in a statement.  The book and others she has produced have included other hip-hop artists who have not raised objections, she added. Having “someone like Jay-Z file legal proceedings is daunting beyond belief and hugely dispiriting,” Ms. Chiha said. The artist is the first hip-hop billionaire, according to Forbes. A lawyer for Jay-Z, Jordan W. Siev, declined to comment because the litigation is pending. “A B to Jay-Z” is one of dozens of hip-hop-themed products offered by the Little Homie. Other titles include “First 50 Words With 50 Cent” and “1 2 3 With the Notorious B.I.G.” “A B to Jay-Z” is the result of a successful crowdfunding effort that raised more than 8,500 Australian dollars, or about $5,700, according to a Kickstarter page. Ms. Chiha, at least in her online persona, seems to have fervently adopted African-American culture. She refers to herself as “J-Pain” and has called her child a “ghetto little superstar” and her husband, Danny, a “baby daddy.” While Australia is heavily influenced by American culture, there is less mainstream awareness of issues like cultural appropriation and racist stereotypes. Some of those who have criticized Ms. Chiha and her company have pointed to photographs, apparently from her husband’s Facebook account, that showed people in blackface at a party.  An online petition against Ms. Chiha’s books mentioned the blackface photos and her “J-Pain” nickname, and asked supporters to alert the artists’ legal teams that their likenesses were being used. “At the very least, they should be paying these artist royalties,” it said. Ms. Chiha did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims of cultural appropriation. “A B to Jay-Z” remains for sale on the Little Homie website for 17.48 Australian dollars, or about $11.80. It is also available on Amazon.  ']","The Little Homie, a small Australian online retailer, says it is celebrating hip-hop.

NATO Offers Trump a Budget Bonbon as Summit Nears,2019-11-28,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — In another gesture to President Trump, NATO announced on Thursday that it had agreed to reduce the United States’ contribution to the alliance’s relatively small central budget, a move aimed at ensuring a calm leaders’ meeting next week in London. The military alliance’s own budget, which covers its headquarters and staff and some small joint military operations, is about $2.5 billion a year, compared with more than $700 billion for the Pentagon. At a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that its members had agreed to redistribute some costs. “The U.S. will pay less, Germany will pay more, so now the U.S. and Germany will pay the same,” he said, with each contributing about 16 percent of NATO’s central budget. Previously the United States paid about 22 percent. The changes become effective in 2021, according to a NATO diplomat. The NATO budget is separate from the 2 percent of gross domestic product that each NATO member has agreed as their goal for defense spending by 2024. Mr. Trump regularly complains about defense spending by other NATO members, but other countries in the alliance have increased their military spending since the Russian annexation of Crimea five years ago by about $130 billion, a NATO diplomat said, a figure that Mr. Stoltenberg is expected to announce next week. Even so, only eight of the 29 member countries meet the 2 percent goal. NATO leaders are trying to keep Mr. Trump from disrupting this meeting, a short one to celebrate the alliance’s 70th anniversary, as he did the last Brussels summit meeting in July 2018. Mr. Stoltenberg in particular has tried to keep close ties to the Trump administration, given the importance of the American commitment to NATO. At a news conference with Mr. Stoltenberg after their meeting in Paris, Mr. Macron defended his own criticism about NATO. The French leader, in an interview with the magazine The Economist, said that the alliance was approaching “brain death” because of a lack of coordination. He was particularly irked that Mr. Trump had told President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey that he would pull American troops out of Syria without having spoken to other NATO members. “A wake-up call was necessary,” Mr. Macron insisted after much criticism of his language. “I’m glad it was delivered, and I’m glad everyone now thinks we should rather think about our strategic goals.” Too much emphasis was put on military spending, Mr. Macron added, and not enough on strategy. France, a nuclear power, is among the NATO members not meeting the alliance’s target for military spending.']","The United States and Germany will now pay the same amount into the military alliance’s relatively small central funding pot, its secretary general said.

"Sri Lankan Critics Fear a Crackdown Is Underway, and Some Flee",2019-11-27,By Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir,"['Fears of a potential crackdown on critics of the newly returned Rajapaksa political dynasty in Sri Lanka are rising just days after the election, as officials and journalists who investigated the Rajapaksas for human rights abuses and corruption began trying to flee the country, officials said. In a case that raised particular alarm, a Sri Lankan employee of the Swiss Embassy in Colombo was abducted on Monday by unidentified men and forced to hand over sensitive embassy information, Switzerland’s foreign ministry said. Officials in Colombo said the men forced her to unlock her cellphone data, which contained information about Sri Lankans who have recently sought asylum in Switzerland, and the names of Sri Lankans who aided them as they fled the country because they feared for their safety after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the presidency in elections this month.  On the same day, Mr. Rajapaksa imposed a blanket travel ban on more than 700 members of the Sri Lankan police unit that had been investigating the family. And other police officers raided a news outlet critical of the Rajapaksas and forced several journalists to hand their computers over for analysis, in what the police said was an investigation into accusations of hate speech. On Wednesday, a spokesman for President Rajapaksa at first denied the abduction of the Swiss Embassy employee, and then hours later said that “defense authorities have decided to look into those allegations to ascertain the truth.” More broadly, government officials said there was no intent to quash investigations of the Rajapaksas.  In the abduction case, the diplomatic officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the men held the embassy employee for several hours and then, before releasing her, threatened to kill her if she told anyone.  The officials said the men appeared to be focused on finding information about a Sri Lankan detective who had been investigating Mr. Rajapaksa. The detective fled to Switzerland with his family on Sunday. It was not clear whether the men were connected to Mr. Rajapaksa or were acting of their own accord as supporters of the popular leader and his political dynasty.  A spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, Pierre-Alain Eltschinger, told The New York Times, “We can confirm that a local employee of the embassy was detained against her will on the street and threatened at length by unidentified men in order to force her to disclose embassy-related information.”  “Switzerland regards this incident as a very serious and unacceptable attack,” he said, adding that the Swiss government was “demanding an immediate and complete investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.” The Rajapaksa family had held power for a decade until 2015, when they were voted out of office. Their last few years in government were marked by frequent abductions of opponents, who were often bundled away into vans by men in civilian clothing, never to be seen again.  But after a devastating terrorist attack by Islamist extremists killed hundreds of people in April, security concerns were thrust to the forefront of public consciousness, creating an opening for Mr. Rajapaksa and his family to gain in the elections.  Gotabaya Rajapaksa was defense secretary and his brother Mahinda was president during the crucial final phase of Sri Lanka’s long and deadly civil war. The Rajapaksas received wide credit within Sri Lanka for bringing the war to close. But the brutality of those years also led to a accusations against the brothers of war crimes and other abuses. Shortly after his election victory, President Rajapaksa appointed Mahinda as prime minister, keeping the country’s two most powerful political posts within the family. In a separate development that has worried Sri Lankan journalists, the police and plainclothes officers on Monday raided the offices of a news outlet, News Hub, known for its criticism of the Rajapaksa family. Several journalists said they were forced to unlock their computers for them to be examined. An associate of the News Hub website, Dhanushka Ramanayake, said in a news conference after the raid that he feared this was the beginning of a dark period for Sri Lanka. “This is a sign of emerging repression and a clear effort to instill fear,” said Mr. Ramanayake, who is also an opposition activist.  Ruwan Gunasekera, a police spokesman, said that the news outlet had been raided based on a complaint that it was propagating hate speech but that nothing incriminating was found. That raid unfolded as the police conducted a separate eight-hour interrogation of a journalist at a different news outlet who is known for his fierce criticism of the Rajapaksa family. Many diplomats had thought that Mr. Rajapaksa, who had handily won at the polls, would try to reconcile with his opponents. In a statement shortly after his victory, Mr. Rajapaksa had urged peace and unity. “We thought there would be a period of demonstrating benign intent,” said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, the executive director of the Colombo-based advocacy group, the Centre for Policy Alternatives. “But this is a situation in which anyone who stands in their way, anyone who is critical of the government or the president, will be seen as the enemy. We are in slow descent into something very frightening.”  The Rajapaksa family appears focused on unraveling several investigations into accusations of human rights abuses and corruption from their time in power. Those inquiries have gained traction in recent years. On Sunday, the president raged against the investigations of him, his family and their allies, dismissing them as politically motivated. The investigations’ “focus was to put those who fought the war, the former navy commander, intelligence officials and me in prison,” he said in a speech to Buddhist monks. “They forced officers to say my name and implicate me in investigations.” “That is not justice,” he added. “That is not the rule of law.” One case that may implicate Mr. Gotabaya had been set to begin on Wednesday, but was postponed until next month. It involves the 2010 disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, a journalist and critic of the Rajapaksas. Government investigators said that a military intelligence unit abducted and likely killed him, and an army lieutenant colonel and six others who served under President Rajapaksa’s command when he was defense secretary have been indicted. Mr. Eknaligoda’s wife, Sandya Eknaligoda, believes the trial will not go forward, and fears for her safety after a decade of accusing the Rajapaksas of abducting her husband. The infrastructure that had been built to support the investigations into the Rajapaksas and their allies has swiftly been unraveled over the last week. The Criminal Investigations Department, or C.I.D., which has been spearheading the inquiries, has been gutted, and its powers limited. The head of the C.I.D. was reassigned last week to a junior position away from the capital, Colombo, officials said. And the lead detective on many of the cases, Nishantha Silva, fled to Switzerland on Sunday. National television channels on Tuesday displayed the photos of other detectives involved in the investigations, accusing them of corruption and treason, after they were stripped of their personal security. A spokesman for the National Police Commission of Sri Lanka said they would decide in the next few weeks whether the investigations would continue. Mr. Silva was the lead detective in several investigations into Sri Lanka’s military, when President Rajapaska served as defense secretary. “Now he will not be there to give evidence at trial,” Ms. Eknaligoda said. “These vengeful actions against senior C.I.D. officials who led these investigations will cripple the entire department — they will all be afraid to act now.” On Monday, Mr. Rajapaksa ordered a blanket ban on travel out of the country for all 704 C.I.D. officials, a move seen as an attempt to prevent other police officers from fleeing. Some diplomats said Mr. Rajapaksa may be trying to take stock of the government he just took over. But, they added, they would be watching closely whether the travel ban is eventually lifted or whether the ban leads to the ranks of C.I.D. being purged. Kamal Gunaratne, Sri Lanka’s newly appointed defense secretary, said Mr. Silva had broken the rules by not seeking approval from the government before leaving to Switzerland. He denied accusations that the new government intended to derail the cases against the Rajapaksas and their associates. “We are not going against anybody or any officer of the C.I.D. We are just following the rule of law,” Mr. Gunaratne said in a telephone interview. “This is a democratic country. It is not a military rule, where dissent will be crushed.”  During the civil war, Mr. Gunaratne led a military unit that the United Nations accused of conducting summary executions of detained rebels. Mr. Gunaratne has denied the accusations.']",A Swiss Embassy employee was abducted and asked about asylum applications and investigators were banned from leaving just days after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected.
Where the Nurse Prescribes Heroin,2019-11-27,By Anna Schaverien and Allison McCann,"['LONDON — Homeless drug users in Scotland will be allowed to inject pharmaceutical-grade heroin twice a day under the supervision of medical officials as part of a new program intended to reduce drug deaths and H.I.V. infection. From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week, a $1.5 million facility in Glasgow that opened on Tuesday will allow a handful of drug users to receive doses of the drug alongside other treatment for their physical and psychological health, according to Glasgow City Council. The pilot project, known as heroin-assisted treatment, is the first such licensed operation in Scotland, a country that has been called the “drug death capital of the world.” It has struggled to cope with high rates of fatal drug overdoses and its worst H.I.V. outbreak in decades.  The program will target those with the “most severe, longstanding and complex addiction issues,” the City Council said.  It aims to reduce the risk of overdoses and the spread of viruses such as H.I.V. by prescribing diamorphine — the clinical name for pharmaceutical-grade heroin — for patients to inject in a secure clinical room under the supervision of trained medics. The clinic opened in Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, after Britain’s Home Office granted it a license, and follows a similar initiative that began in Middlesbrough, England, last month. Up to 20 patients are expected to take part in the first year of Glasgow’s program, with the number set to double in the second year. “Heroin-assisted treatment is a much more clinical service aimed at getting people stable,” Andrew McAuley, a senior research fellow on substance use at Glasgow Caledonian University, said in an interview on Wednesday. “The program is a significant step forward, albeit for a very small number of people.”  The program, called the Enhanced Drug Treatment Service, is intended for those who have exhausted other treatment options such as residential rehabilitation, methadone and community addiction services. It is available only to drug users already involved with the city’s team fighting addiction among homeless people.  The program is not intended to be long-term, with research suggesting that clinical benefits can be seen after six weeks of treatment.  It requires patients to visit the city clinic twice a day, seven days a week, a demand that may be too much for those not used to such a routine, Mr. McAuley said. “It’s a large commitment,” he said. Glasgow has ambitious plans to support its residents with drug-addiction issues, but Scottish officials say it has been hindered by Britain’s 1971 drug law.  Glasgow officials have pushed for years to establish consumption spaces in the city where drug users could inject their own drugs in a safe, clean environment, but their efforts have been rebuffed by the British government.  Britain’s Misuse of Drugs Act, the 1971 law, stipulates that anyone “concerned in the management of any premises” or any occupier who knowingly allows drugs to be prepared there can face prosecution.  “It is still illegal to have safe consumption sites, which puts us out of sync with most Western countries,” said Mr. McAuley, whose research group will evaluate the Glasgow program. “Glasgow is arguably the most compelling case for a drug consumption site.” Austin Smith, a policy officer at Scottish Drugs Forum, a national resource of expertise on drug use issues, said, “This part of the law was to stop people opening up opium dens and was never intended to stop safe services, but that is what it does.” More than 100 supervised consumption services have been established in countries like Australia, Canada, France, Switzerland and Germany, according to the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based organization that campaigns to end America’s “war on drugs.”  A report on Scotland’s drug problem that was released this month by the British Parliament’s Scottish Affairs Committee endorsed the treatment method.  “Safe drug-consumption facilities are proven to reduce the number of drug-related deaths and can act as a gateway to further treatment,” said Pete Wishart, the committee’s chairman. “Every drug death is preventable, and these centers could play a vital role in addressing Scotland’s drug crisis.” Scotland’s drug problem has worsened in recent years, and official statistics indicate that drug-related deaths there are at a record high. Fatal drug overdoses have been highest among older users. The number of deaths directly caused by drugs has risen in Scotland almost year on year since records began in the mid-1990s. And the number has climbed drastically: to 1,187 drug-related deaths last year from 244 in 1996, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Scotland’s drug death rate is nearly three times that of Britain as a whole and is the highest in the European Union. By some measures, Scotland has even surpassed — by a small margin — the United States’ rate of 217 drug-related deaths per million of the population.  The number of homeless drug users with H.I.V. in Glasgow also increased in recent years, which one study attributed to the sharing of needles and other equipment. City health workers say the outbreak has still not been contained. “This challenging social issue demands innovative treatments,” the chairwoman of Glasgow’s Alcohol and Drug Partnership, Susanne Millar, said in a statement on Tuesday. “People might question why health services are spending money providing heroin for people with addictions,” she said. “The answer is we can’t afford not to.” ']",A new program in Glasgow will give drug users pharmaceutical-grade heroin twice daily in a bid to reduce drug-related deaths. 
"14,600 Sheep Trapped on a Capsized Ship. ‘We Have Saved 254.’",2019-11-29,By Kit Gillet,"['BUCHAREST, Romania — After five frantic days of searching, there are no more living animals. The president of a Romanian animal welfare organization made the grim announcement on Friday, ending an effort to rescue more than 14,000 sheep trapped on a cargo ship that overturned after leaving port, an episode that has raised fresh questions about transporting live animals by sea. The sheep had been destined for a buyer in Saudi Arabia when the vessel, the Queen Hind, partly capsized on Sunday. The ship’s crew of 21 was quickly rescued, but thousands of animals remained on board. For days, rescue workers searched for surviving sheep. On Sunday, they were able to pull 33 living animals from the waters. Over the following days, as they searched the vessel, more were found alive among piles of sodden carcasses. “It was kind of a nightmare, but otherwise we didn’t have any chance to reach the live animals,” said Kuki Barbuceanu, the president of the animal welfare organization, known as ARCA.  “We’ve checked all of the ship, and unfortunately there are no more,” Mr. Barbuceanu concluded Friday, saying the rescue operation had saved 254 sheep out of 14,600 aboard. The General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations confirmed the end of the rescue effort. The operation had been made difficult by the unstable conditions onboard, officials said, and by the fact that the animals, which can weigh upward of 130 pounds, had to be brought out of the ship, one by one, through a single point. On Tuesday, rescuers started cutting holes in the sides of the vessel to reach less accessible areas after receiving permission from the vessel’s owner. This allowed the crew to find more animals, but the number of rescues dwindled as the days wore on. On Thursday, just 24 were found alive. Rescuers halted their efforts on Thursday evening, but the search resumed on Friday after officials decided to go ahead with a dangerous cut into a compartment. “The rescue mission wasn’t a simple one, or a risk-free one,” said Raed Arafat, head of the Department of Emergency Situations under the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs. He said that more than 100 people a day were involved in the operation, including members of the water rescue agency. The cause of the ship’s capsizing is still a mystery. On Monday, Romania’s transport minister, Lucian Bode, ordered an investigation, saying “we cannot allow such events to be repeated.” The ship is registered in Palau, and news reports have said it was managed by a Romanian company, but officials have not confirmed the ownership. The disaster has raised fresh questions about transporting live animals by sea. An estimated two million sheep and one million cattle are transported each year from European Union member states to the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. Romania is one of the main exporters.  Animal rights advocates say that the journeys are often too long, regulations aren’t up to scratch and the rules are often flouted. “The vast majority of journeys, despite what the European Commission says, involve breaches of the law,” said Peter Stevenson, a veteran lawyer and chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming, an animal welfare organization based in Britain. “Enforcement of regulations is terrible,” Mr. Stevenson said, adding that he had written to the Romanian agricultural minister asking for details about the pre-loading inspection of the ship. “That a ship should capsize quite near to the port suggests that the inspection was not carried out properly,” he added. Francesca Porta, the farm animals program officer at the advocacy group Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels, said that one of the main problems was that vessels were often not built for the journey. “They are old vessels that are converted to transport animals,” Ms. Porta said. The Queen Hind, she added, had been built in 1980 and reauthorized by Romanian officials in March. The vessel had suffered engine failure in the Sea of Marmara near Turkey in 2018, news reports said. Days before Sunday’s accident, Eurogroup issued a report laying out a strategy to reduce and replace the transportation of live animals with a meat-and-carcass-only trade.  “In the end, we believe that this trade must be stopped,” the group’s director, Reineke Hameleers, said on Thursday. Romania clashed with Brussels once this year on the issue of live animal transportation. In July, the European commissioner in charge of health and food safety called on Romania to halt the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because of concerns that high temperatures could cause the animals to suffer in transit.  Romania allowed the export to proceed, nonetheless. “Utter disasters like we saw a few days ago are not common, but just the day-to-day suffering of animals being transported these long distances is huge,” said Mr. Stevenson, the lawyer with Compassion in World Farming. Now that rescue attempts on the Queen Hind have concluded, the next issue will be righting the ship so that crews can remove the carcasses and incinerate them, Mr. Arafat said.  “This will be a very hard operation, to clean the ship of thousands of dead sheep inside that drowned and have started to decay,” he said. There is also the question of the surviving animals, which had been destined for the dining table. Mr. Barbuceanu, of the animal welfare organization, said its officials had contacted the Saudi buyer to ask him to donate the sheep to an animal welfare organization, but have not received a reply.  He envisions the few hundred remaining sheep spending the rest of their lives on a farm.  “They deserve that,” he said. “It is the least they deserve.” ']","On Friday, officials ended a search-and-rescue operation off the coast of Romania.

‘Evo Morales Is Like a Father to Us’,2019-11-27,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Federico Rios,"['VILLA TUNARI, Bolivia — The road to Evo Morales’s political stronghold, in the heart of Bolivia’s coca farming region, is nearly impassable these days.  First, tires and wooden crates block the way, forcing travelers to stop and negotiate with supporters of Mr. Morales, the ousted Bolivian president, who have cut off access to the region. Farther ahead, the road is obstructed by tree trunks and barbed wire, and then by towering mounds of stones and earth.  At each of the nearly 100 barricades along the way, suspicious guards — sometimes several hundred of them — wield sticks and nail boards, turning away anyone without a permit or medical emergency.  Finally, after traveling 100 miles through the seemingly endless debris, the tropical town of Villa Tunari emerges in a lush river valley in the Andean foothills. This is where Mr. Morales, the country’s first Indigenous president, started and ended his political career — and where he is still treated with almost superhuman reverence.  It’s also where the headquarters of resistance to Bolivia’s new interim government is found. Thousands of coca farmers — including children — are camped around the town’s strategic river bridge, obstructing Bolivia’s main highway and paralyzing its national economy. With no movement of goods, there are food and fuel shortages in major cities. “Evo Morales is like a father to us,” said Antonietta Ledezi, a coca farmer who traveled 30 miles to Villa Tunari to join the blockade two weeks ago. “If he doesn’t return, there won’t be peace.” Bolivia this week began to move toward resolving the vicious political crisis that led to Mr. Morales’s resignation from office earlier this month after 14 years as president. His downfall came after violent protests over a disputed election that he claimed to win, and after he had lost the backing of the military and the police.  New elections — in which Mr. Morales is barred from running — are planned. But farmers here in Villa Tunari, which I reached on a reporting trip in recent days, are determined to fight on for the return of their exiled leader. For the 50,000 local coca farming families, the ousting of Mr. Morales represents more than the end of a government that gave them a political voice and vast improvements in infrastructure, education and health. It is a threat to the peace that Mr. Morales, called Evo by everyone here, brought to this stigmatized and violent region. A mere mention of Evo can unleash uncontrolled wailing at the barricades. Many remember him personally as a fellow coca farmer who rose to become the president of the confederation of local coca unions, a title he nominally holds to this day. “He was the only president we have ever seen,” said Gregorio Choque, a coca farmer. “He was in the fields with us.” Farmers began to converge on Villa Tunari on Nov. 10, the day Mr. Morales announced his resignation from the country’s presidency at the nearby headquarters of the coca confederation, an act that turned this gentrifying tourism hot spot into a war camp.  The next day, Mr. Morales fled the country to seek asylum in Mexico, departing from an airport in the coca region. Soon after, sprawling assemblies of makeshift tents, hastily constructed out of tree trunks and branches, covered the highway, as groups of farmers took shifts reinforcing the barricades, cooking communal meals or trying to rest on bare asphalt in the sweltering heat. They competed for status by decorating their sections of the barricades with placards calling for the resignation of the country’s interim president, Jeanine Añez, and justice for about 30 pro-Evo protesters killed in clashes with security forces. “We don’t recognize this new illegal government,” said Andronico Rodríguez, Evo’s deputy in the local labor movement, who is seen by many here as the former president’s successor. “Our objective is to allow Evo to finish out his term.” “In less than 24 hours, we can mobilize 100,000 farmers,” added Mr. Rodríguez. The swift rise of Mr. Rodríguez, 30, reflects Evo’s social investments in the region.  Mr. Rodríguez began attending his local union meetings after school with his mother when he was 9, reading out the meeting minutes to the mostly illiterate members. Now, he has the unenviable challenge of aligning the coca farmers’ eternal loyalty to Evo with the country’s evolving political landscape. This week, he traveled to La Paz to join negotiations over the country’s looming elections. The coca farmers’ discipline, self-sufficiency in food and strategic location in the center of the country give them an ability to keep up the blockade for months, if their demands are not met, he said. Many barricades hang effigies of Ms. Añez, as well as conservative opposition leaders and the former military chief, Gen. Williams Kaliman, who refused to deploy soldiers to save Evo’s government. The neat, usually flawless, wording of the placards was itself a sign of pride in the huge advances in literacy that Evo brought to the region.  After checking my credentials and luggage on the trip I took to the area, the guards at nearly every barricade on the way to the town insisted that I get out of the car so they could speak with a reporter. They wanted to document their political grievances, another legacy of the self-worth instilled by Evo in the local residents, whom many Bolivians write off as rabble-rousing pawns in the global drug trade. “They call us drug traffickers, terrorists, vandals who are not worth anything,” said one farmer, Hironimo Tosico, breaking into tears. “I’m a producer of banana, plantain, citruses, watermelons. I’m not a troublemaker. I’m a good citizen.” Bolivia’s Indigenous people have used coca plants for centuries to fight fatigue and hunger, but the plant is also the raw material for cocaine. On coming to power, Mr. Morales legalized coca production for traditional use, but put in place strict output limits. Under his rule, coca production in the region, Chapare, fell despite a large increase in the farming population and global cocaine demand, according to the United Nations. Local unions today regulate the planting area to protect prices and prevent excess crops going to cocaine labs. These policies brought economic stability that allowed farmers to diversify into other crops. They also brought social peace after decades of territorial infighting and repression by the military’s coca eradication squads. Mr. Morales’s party got 90 percent of the vote in Chapare in the last elections in October. But not everyone here supports the blockade. The tension is largely generational. Many of the region’s older coca farmers have since invested in shops, small hotels and restaurants in Villa Tunari, becoming the town’s new middle class and helping to convert it into an outdoor tourism hub.  Now, as the blockade grinds into its third week, the town’s shuttered hotels are already looking worn down, with jungle vegetation growing freely around abandoned swimming pools. Empty restaurants are cooking one meal a day with firewood. Locals without land have also been hard hit. Nora Choque, who works in a motel, last week began walking with her two small children to the closest city, Cochabamba, 100 miles up the mountains, because she said she had run out of food. “There’s nothing left for us here,” she said, as she trudged through Villa Tunari in the afternoon heat. The blockade has also swept up unexpected bystanders.  Groups of Chinese road builders sat gloomily by their isolated campsites on the blockaded highway. Families of Haitian labor migrants heading on foot to Chile sat stranded in a tollbooth. A lone European backpacker scoured for food amid the barricades near Villa Tunari’s hostel. The barricades fully come to life at dusk.  With a reprieve from the heat, the blocked-off road becomes a bustling human sea. Street sellers appear out of nowhere with steaming pots of giant corn kernels, freeze-dried baby potatoes, yucca and spicy peanut sauce for those with a couple spare dollars. Those less fortunate chew on the coca leaf to beat the hunger. After dinner, the union members gather for a roll call and a discussion, usually in the local Quechua language, of the day’s political news from La Paz, before setting down to rest on the asphalt or bare earth under skimpy tarps or tree branches. The silence of the road at night is occasionally broken by the screeching of buses carrying reinforcements to the protest’s front line, outside Cochabamba. “It’s tough being here, while our crops rot in the fields,” said Serafino Oliveros, a coca farmer, while perched under a six-foot wet tarp with four union companions. “But we understand that this is a necessary sacrifice so that our children have the same rights we had under Evo.” Norman Chinchilla contributed reporting from Cochabamba, Bolivia, and Cesar Del Castillo from La Paz.']","In the coca-growing region where the former Bolivian president got his political start, farmers are loyal to him — and demanding his return."
Police Commander Not Guilty in Hillsborough Soccer Disaster,2019-11-28,By Richard Pérez-Peña,"['LONDON — A retired British police commander was not guilty of manslaughter, a jury decided on Thursday, 30 years after a crowd crush at a soccer match that killed 96 people, the worst disaster in modern British sports history. David Duckenfield, 75, a former South Yorkshire police chief superintendent, faced charges of “gross negligence manslaughter” that could have sent him to prison for life. Official investigations over the years have concluded that the deaths resulted from the mistakes of the police and other officials responsible for controlling the flow of fans into the stadium. The April 15, 1989, disaster at Hillsborough Stadium, in Sheffield, was a watershed moment, a psychological scar for a generation of soccer fans, challenging longstanding crowd-control practices and public trust in the police. In the weeks after the deadly crush, South Yorkshire Police officials blamed Liverpool fans, falsely citing drunkenness, hooliganism and late arrivals. That version of events was amplified by some news outlets, particularly the tabloid newspaper The Sun, which reported that fans had urinated on police officers and picked the pockets of fallen victims. “Who is accountable for 96 unlawfully killed?” asked Margaret Aspinall, who leads the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and whose 18-year-old son, James, was one of the dead. “What a disgrace this has been today.” The police narrative and the media coverage enraged many of the survivors and victims’ relatives, who saw it as classism and victim-blaming. And when the initial coroners’ inquests called the deaths accidental, family members protested and spent years demanding that officials be prosecuted. More than two decades passed before subsequent government investigations put the primary blame on the police for failed crowd control practices. They found that officials had lied to the news media about the fans’ behavior and that investigators had edited witness statements to remove anything critical of the police. Many victims’ family members, like Ms. Aspinall — many of them appearing with her at a tearful news conference — reacted to the verdict with anger and surprise. “These families, I look at their faces. Please God, give them some peace,” she said. “They deserve it.” The BBC reported that in the courtroom, Chrissie Burke, whose father, Henry, died at Hillsborough, stood in the public gallery and said to the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw: “I would like to know who is responsible for my father’s death, because someone is.” Rob Beckley, the assistant police commissioner who led the most recent investigation into the case, did not find fault with the outcome, saying “it is right” that there was a thorough investigation and a trial. “What is wrong is that it has taken 30 years to get to this point,” he said. Supporters of the two teams that were to play that day, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, were segregated in separate parts of the stadium to prevent conflicts — a standard practice, then and now. Many of the fans did not have assigned seats, but had bought tickets for fenced areas, or terraces, where they would watch the game while standing. That configuration, also standard at the time, was prohibited in the upper echelons of British soccer after the Hillsborough tragedy. More than 10,000 Liverpool fans had bought tickets for a set of standing terraces that could be reached through just seven turnstiles, so entry was slow, and a growing and restless crowd formed outside the stadium, waiting to get in. The deadly crush took place when police commanders decided to open an exit gate rather than make people go through the turnstiles, and then failed to order officers inside the stadium to steer people away from areas that were already full. Thousands rushed forward at once, crushing those already in the crowded pens. In one section, “the pressure became so severe that the faces of fans at the front were pressed into the perimeter fencing, distorted by the mesh,” an official investigative panel reported in 2012. “As fans lost consciousness, some slipped to the ground under the feet of others unable to move. Survivors recall the gradual compression on their chests preventing them from breathing.” The initial death toll was 95 people. One person who was left in a vegetative state died four years later — too long after the disaster for a homicide charge. In 2016, a second set of coroner’s inquests found that the victims had been “unlawfully killed.” It put particular responsibility on Mr. Duckenfield, but also found fault with other police officials, the ambulance service, and stadium management.

"Godfrey Gao, ‘Mortal Instruments’ Actor, Dies While Filming TV Show",2019-11-27,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — “Chase Me,” a Chinese television show, is famous for pushing its contestants to the limits. Participants scale tall buildings, skid down obstacle courses and hang from tightropes, often to the delight of screaming fans. But on Wednesday, the show came under national scrutiny in China after a 35-year-old actor and model, Godfrey Gao, died suddenly while filming an episode in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. Mr. Gao collapsed while running, apparently from a heart problem, according to a statement on Wednesday by the “Chase Me” production team. The death of Mr. Gao, who was born in Taiwan and raised in Canada, set off a wave of anger on the Chinese internet, with millions of people criticizing the entertainment industry as focused on ratings at the expense of safety.  By Wednesday evening, the death of Mr. Gao was one of the most widely discussed topics on Weibo, a popular microblogging site, and hashtags about it had garnered hundreds of millions of views. “You don’t have a heart,” wrote one Weibo user, addressing the show’s producers. Some people called for a boycott of Zhejiang Television, the state-owned channel that aired the show. Others argued that the government should regulate reality television shows, including game shows like “Chase Me,” more strictly, noting other cases of injury and death in the industry. “The show’s awareness of safety precautions is too poor,” Xu Zheng, a prominent actor and director, wrote on Weibo. “It must be held responsible!” Reality television shows have become very popular in China in recent years, especially online. A news article last year by Xinhua, the state news agency, said that the number of reality shows on streaming platforms had doubled last year from 2017, reaching 385. Even by the standards of such shows, “Chase Me,” which is in its first season, has pushed boundaries. The show invites actors as well as ordinary people to compete in variety of sports challenges, often to the point of exhaustion. Adrenaline-pumping moments are a staple, often filmed at night in a downtown stretch of Ningbo. In one recent episode, a professional boxer fell into a ball pit and struggled to emerge as his teammates watched on. Early on Wednesday, Mr. Gao was filming a guest appearance on the ninth episode of “Chase Me” when he collapsed, according to the statement by the show’s producers. The show’s medical staff tried to revive him, but when they could not, Mr. Gao was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead, the producers said. “We feel very grieved and extremely sad!” the statement said. Zhejiang Television issued a statement late Wednesday saying it deeply regretted Mr. Gao’s death and would take “corresponding responsibility.” The channel promised to improve safety at the network. Mr. Gao was known for his work as a model for Louis Vuitton, as well as his roles on several television shows and movies. He was the voice of Ken, opposite Barbie, in the Mandarin-language version of the 2010 movie “Toy Story 3” for its release in Taiwan. He also drew a following for his role as the high warlock of Brooklyn in the 2013 action film “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.” With more than 5.7 million followers on Weibo, Mr. Gao had a loyal following in mainland China, where he was known for playing a disabled architect on a Chinese soap opera, “Remembering Lichuan.” There he often went by his Chinese name, Gao Yixiang. Mr. Gao’s agency, JetStar Entertainment, confirmed his death on Wednesday. “He has unfortunately left us,” the agency said in a statement on Weibo. “It is shocking and terribly sorrowful to us. We cannot accept it even now!” On his Instagram account, Mr. Gao recently posted about taking part in a charity dinner and playing tennis with the actor Adam Sandler. “Everyone can make a difference,” he wrote in a post in July, “one small step at a time.” Wang Yiwei, Claire Fu and Albee Zhang contributed research.']","When the 35-year-old performer and model collapsed with an apparent heart attack during filming for a strenuous, stunt-filled series, it set off a wave of anger on Chinese social media."
Hong Kong Police End 2-Week Campus Siege,2019-11-29,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The police returned control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s campus to school officials on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most intense periods of conflict since protests began to engulf the city earlier this year.  The police, who arrested hundreds of people during their two-week siege of the campus, said they found no protesters there during a final search on Friday morning. Investigators found nearly 4,000 firebombs on the campus over the past two days, as well as other explosive items and bottles of corrosive liquids, the police said. The siege, which was punctuated by days of clashes between the police and protesters, ended quietly as university officials resumed control of the shattered campus on the southeastern side of the Kowloon Peninsula. There will not be “any ceremony or event to shake hands or stuff like that,” Chow Yat-ming, an assistant police commissioner, said Friday morning before officers left the campus. The protests began in June over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. It has continued over other issues, including calls for expanded elections and an investigation into the police’s use of force. Hong Kong universities became the centers of especially large protests this month after the death of a student, Chow Tsz-lok, who fell from a parking garage during a police operation. The Chinese University of Hong Kong was occupied by protesters for five days in mid-November, and several other schools saw large demonstrations. Many campuses cut their semesters short because of the unrest. At Polytechnic University, students who took up their protest there on Nov. 11 were later joined by militant demonstrators who were determined to keep the police out, fortifying their position with firebombs, bricks and large slingshots. On Nov. 17, the police threatened to use lethal force against the demonstrators and warned that those caught could be charged with rioting, which can carry a lengthy prison sentence. Protesters also set fire to tollbooths near the campus, leading to the two-week closure of a major tunnel linking the Kowloon Peninsula with Hong Kong Island. Polytechnic University and the streets around it saw large-scale clashes between riot police officers and protesters who were trying to help others flee the besieged campus. The police fired more than 1,400 tear gas rounds on Nov. 18 alone, as large numbers of protesters tried to break through the police cordon around the school. Protesters hurled bricks and firebombs at the police, and at one point an armored police vehicle was engulfed in flames. One officer was hit in the leg with an arrow. Some protesters managed to escape the campus by jumping fences when the police were not watching. In one dramatic moment, a few rappelled onto a roadway and were taken away by people on motorcycles. Others tried but failed to escape through sewers. “I felt anxious and powerless back then, because some of my friends were stuck inside and I didn’t how I could help those detained there,” Ernest Ho, a 24-year-old student at City University of Hong Kong, said Friday. “We also didn’t know what would happen inside, as we couldn’t contact them very easily.  “I felt depressed when they tried to escape,” he said. “They fled as if they were refugees. However, they are Hong Kong people.” University officials said Friday that the campus was still unsafe, despite the removal of dangerous materials, and that it would remain closed until further notice. A police spokesman, Kwok Ka-chuen, said 1,377 people had been arrested during the siege of the campus. Citywide, more than 5,800 people have been arrested in connection with the protests since early June, according to the police. The protests quieted dramatically in the days before Sunday, when elections were held for district councils across the city. Pro-democracy candidates dominated the vote, which had been seen as a referendum on the protest movement, taking 87 percent of the seats.  On Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that authorized sanctions on officials deemed responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong. Demonstrators in Hong Kong celebrated that legislation with a peaceful gathering Thursday night. In the Central district, where in recent weeks office workers and others have held lunch-hour demonstrations in support of the protest movement, hundreds of people gathered around midday Friday and spilled onto the roads. Police officers fired pepper spray and arrested one man, the public broadcaster RTHK reported. Ezra Cheung and Elaine Yu contributed reporting.']","The police found no protesters during a final search of Polytechnic University, the site of some of the most violent clashes the city has seen this year."
Two K-Pop Stars Sentenced to Prison for Rape,2019-11-29,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Two K-pop stars were sentenced to prison on Friday for raping women who were too drunk to consent to sex, and one of the men was also convicted of making videos of the assaults and sharing them with friends online.  The Seoul Central District Court sentenced the singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young, who recorded and shared the videos, to six years in prison. His friend Choi Jong-hoon, a former boy band member, was sentenced to five years.  “The accused perpetrated sexual crimes against multiple women, degrading women and treating them as mere tools of sexual pleasure,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said in his verdict\u200b on Friday\u200b. “It’s hard to fathom the pain the victims must have\u200b suffered.” During their trial, Mr. Jung and Mr. Choi\u200b, both 30,\u200b said that the sex acts, which took place in 2016, had been consensual. But the court ruled that the women had been drunk and unable to resist. The court has not said how many victims there were. Both men broke into tears as they were escorted back to jail after the sentencing, the news agency Yonhap reported. They have a week to appeal. The police began investigating the matter early this year, after it was reported that Mr. Jung, along with other members of an online chat group, had bragged about drugging and raping women\u200b and had shared \u200bsurreptitiously recorded videos of assaults.  The police have not said who originally came forward with the information, citing regulations meant to protect whistle-blowers. But South Korean news outlets have reported that it was a worker at a shop where Mr. Jung sent his smartphone in hopes of retrieving lost data. K-pop, a major South Korean cultural export, has recently been plagued by scandals. Lee Seung-hyun, a former member of the K-pop group Big Bang who is better known by the stage name Seungri, is being tried on charges of providing prostitutes for foreign businessmen\u200b in a nightclub. Two female K-pop stars, Sulli and Goo Hara, have killed themselves in the past two months. Both had been victims of cyberbullying.']","The two men raped women who were too drunk to resist, and one of them shared videos of the assaults, a court found. "
Iran Strengthens Response to Protests,2019-11-27,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['The authorities in Iran strengthened their reprisals on Tuesday over the protests that engulfed the country last week, arresting “six main elements” accused of rioting in Tehran and penalizing Iranian journalists overseas who publicized the mayhem. Although internet service that had been suspended in Iran after the protests erupted has been partly restored, it may be curtailed indefinitely, government officials warned. Mobile phone access to the internet remains blocked. The intensified response to the protests, reported in official Iranian media, came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States government had received nearly 20,000 messages, videos, photographs and notes from Iranians after his call last week for evidence that the protests had been violently suppressed during the internet blackout. Mr. Pompeo, whose appeal to Iranians has enraged the Tehran leadership, did not specify what the received materials showed but said, “I hope they will continue to be sent to us.” The protests began peacefully over the government’s abrupt announcement on Nov. 15 that it was raising gasoline prices by as much as 200 percent and imposing a rationing system, with the proceeds from the higher prices going, it said, to needy Iranians in the form of cash subsidies. The changes took many people in Iran by surprise and their protests soon turned into violent demonstrations about a litany of grievances in the country of 80 million, where unemployment and inflation have been growing worse.  Many Iranians blame their government for the country’s economic travails, although at least some of the problems are linked to sanctions imposed by the United States. Iran’s leaders have accused a mix of enemies, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel, monarchists and seditionists, of exploiting the anger over the gasoline prices to stoke riots in dozens of cities and towns that were crushed by force within a few days.  Despite the internet shutdown that cut off much of the country, many videos and photos were posted that painted an anecdotal picture of widespread street clashes, burning buildings and shootings of unarmed demonstrators, presumably by members of the security forces.  The government has yet to report figures on casualties and arrests, but there are strong indications that the protests were the deadliest in the country since the election unrest that convulsed Iran a decade ago.  Amnesty International has said more than 140 people were killed, mostly by firearms — a figure that officials have criticized as speculative. Two journalists contacted inside the country, speaking on condition of anonymity because of concern for their safety, said they believed that the death toll was at least 218, based on coroners’ reports, with more than 1,900 people injured and at least 7,000 arrested. The government said last week that about 100 “ringleaders and masterminds” had been rounded up nationwide, and it indicated that more arrests were forthcoming. The police commander in Tehran, Mohsen Khancherli, said Tuesday that the authorities had “arrested six main elements behind violent riots that recently hit Tehran,” and that “the suspects had confessed to their acts of sabotage.” Officials also moved to punish Iranian journalists abroad who had reported on the protests remotely. The Judiciary announced “legal and judicial restrictions” on assets owned by Iranian reporters at Iran International, a Britain-based broadcaster that Iran’s state-owned PressTV news website described as a “Saudi-Zionist television channel.”  “The broadcaster was at work to disrupt Iran’s security, fan the flames of riots and organize acts of terror, subversion and secession across the country,” PressTV quoted the Judiciary announcement as saying. The government has warned Iranian journalists inside the country to strictly limit their accounts of the unrest. Last Friday Iranian intelligence agents were reported to have arrested Mohammad Mosaed, an independent economics reporter, at his home in Tehran after he had found a way to bypass the internet shutdown to post “Hello Free World!” on social media.  Iranians reached by telephone on Tuesday also said new anger was brewing over who would qualify for the cash subsidies created by increased gasoline prices.  Originally officials said 60 million Iranians — three-quarters of the population — would be eligible. But Mohammad Shariatmadari, the minister of labor and welfare, told Iranian state television that the government would have to examine the assets, bank accounts and trips abroad of all Iranians to ensure that only the neediest received the benefit. Some experts said that likely meant only about 20 million Iranians would be eligible. The increased cost of gasoline has already affected prices of everyday goods and transportation. Several Iranians reached in Tehran and other cities said the price of basic goods — rice, oil, bread and dairy — had increased between 5 percent and 10 percent. Iran’s official news agency reported that the costs of public transportation, messenger services and moving goods had spiked by nearly 50 percent. Lara Jakes contributed reporting.

"In Scotland, Brexit Is on the Line. So Is the Future of the U.K.",2019-11-27,By Stephen Castle,"['GLASGOW — Pushing purposefully through the crowd, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, stops abruptly, her path blocked by a well-wisher cradling a photogenic 5-month-old. Without hesitation, Ms. Sturgeon gathers the baby smoothly in her arms and slowly plants a kiss on his forehead, as the cameras click in unison. Seen by many as Britain’s most effective party leader, Ms. Sturgeon is not even running in the Dec. 12 general election because she sits in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not the British one at Westminster. But as leader of the buoyant pro-independence and anti-Brexit Scottish National Party, she is the face of its campaign for Scotland’s 59 parliamentary seats in Westminster. The success of that campaign could determine whether Britain leaves the European Union in January — and, if it does, whether the United Kingdom survives the rupture. At a recent and well orchestrated visit to a charity in a gritty part of Glasgow, Ms. Sturgeon was everywhere, helping out at a numeracy class, performing a gym workout and, in the kitchen, ladling out bowls of thick lentil soup.  “This is definitely the most important general election we have had in Scotland in my lifetime because the future of our country is on the line,” she said once the food was served. “We are at a crossroads, and the outcome of this election will decide which path we go down and who decides our future.” According to opinion polls, the Scottish National Party, which already holds 35 of Scotland’s British parliamentary seats, is poised to gain even more. If it takes enough votes from the Conservative Party, which holds 13 seats there, it could deprive Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the majority he needs to pursue Brexit. If that were to happen, it could make Ms. Sturgeon a kingmaker, and her price for supporting a minority Labour government could be permission from that government to allow Scotland to hold another independence referendum. Scotland rejected independence in 2014, but Brexit has scrambled its politics since then. Not so long ago, Labour was a dominant force in Scotland. But Ms. Sturgeon, who became party leader in 2014, scored a dramatic victory in the 2015 general election, when her party won all but three Scottish parliamentary seats. Some were then lost in a snap election two years ago.  While she has faced criticism over the quality of Scottish health and education, Ms. Sturgeon’s success is a symbol of how Scotland is diverging politically from England. Mr. Johnson’s pledge to “get Brexit done” has struck a chord with many there but often falls flat north of the border. His shambling, confected upper-class English persona tends to go down badly with Scots, a majority of whom voted against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. And while Brexit is a critical political battleground in Scotland, for many it pales before the issue of Scottish independence. Scots seem to be losing faith in their centuries-old union with England, with one recent survey showing that less than half of those polled said they thought the United Kingdom would survive in its current form for the next five years, and less than a third expressed confidence that it would do so for the next decade. “The ties that bind us together have weakened,” said Henry McLeish, a former first minister of Scotland and Labour Party politician. “If we weren’t part of the U.K. right now, would we want to join? I don’t think so.”  To advance her cause, Ms. Sturgeon’s party must win seats like Stirling, a large constituency with affluent towns, working-class communities and villages, where the fate of Scotland was determined in earlier times: at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, when William Wallace routed the English, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when England’s Edward II was defeated.  So steeped is this place in history that the local Conservative Party’s motto is the old saying, “He who holds Stirling holds Scotland.” Yet the Tories’ grip on Stirling could scarcely be more tenuous: They took the seat from the Scottish National Party in 2017 by just 148 votes. Mr. Johnson’s machinations to achieve Brexit have not added to their popularity there, but the situation is fluid, given the political crosscurrents of Brexit and the independence issue. Knocking doors in Bannockburn, the Scottish National Party candidate, Alyn Smith, says his priority is to “stop Brexit and to focus on the things that matter to people here,” adding that Scots had lost faith in what they thought was a partnership of equals. “The Brexit vote has brought home to a number of people that the U.K. doesn’t work the way you thought it does,” Mr. Smith said, as he tried to persuade voters to open their doors on a dark, cold and rainy evening. One who did, Christopher Wilson, a taxi driver, welcomed Mr. Smith into his home. “I never voted for Brexit — I voted to stay in the E.U. and I feel that my voice is not being heard,” said Mr. Wilson, who also strongly favors Scottish independence. But what if you are part of the large group of people who dislike Brexit but also, with the Conservatives, oppose Scottish independence? On the scenic, undulating, golf course at Bridge of Allan, a well-heeled town north of Stirling, Fiona Darroch, who is retired, said she will definitely not support the Scottish National Party even though she is no Brexit enthusiast. “In Scotland a majority don’t want to go out of the United Kingdom,” she said, walking down to the green. “England is our neighbor and our family. I don’t want a border,” added Ms. Darroch, who said that she would normally vote Conservative but planned this time to switch to the pro-European Liberal Democrats. Such defections could be lethal for the Conservative candidate, Stephen Kerr, but the focus on independence has given the Tories a lifeline even after a setback when their popular former leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, stepped down.  Mr. Kerr’s strategy is to court opponents of independence, even if they dislike Mr. Johnson and his no-holds-barred battle for Brexit. And Mr. Kerr says he is winning over working-class folk who were “never going to be Conservative voters — never — but are voting Conservative on the basis of lending me their support in order to protect the union.” The Conservatives can be more confident of holding another seat that Ms. Sturgeon’s party is targeting, Banff and Buchan, a coastal area north of Aberdeen, where their majority is 3,693. Support for Brexit was significant there in 2016, partly because of hopes that the fishing industry could gain from leaving the European Union. Inside the big fish market in the port town of Peterhead, the majority opinion is pro-Brexit, although Andrew Charles, who supports the Scottish National Party, says that under Mr. Johnson’s plan the export part of his business would be uneconomical because of the added certification costs. Graeme Smart, whose fishing vessel, the Shaulora, was moored outside, was among the one million Scots who voted for Brexit, and though his faith has weakened somewhat, he will probably support Mr. Johnson. “He’s the U.K.’s Donald Trump,” Mr. Smart said as the Shaulora’s crew unloaded 65 boxes of prawns. “I wouldn’t believe a word the man says, but I would probably vote for him.”  Mr. Smart knows that leaving the European Union is only the prelude to negotiating a trade deal with the bloc, and that “the biggest problem is that once we get Brexit we need a close relationship with Europe to sell our fish.” But once again the conversation turns to the other big constitutional question. “The S.N.P. keeps saying that people want independence — the fishing industry doesn’t want independence,” Mr. Smart added, mindful that much of the fish landed here is consumed in England. Across Scotland, focus on these two constitutional issues has put a further squeeze on the opposition Labour Party. In 2005, Labour won 41 Scottish seats but, a decade later, held just one in the 2015 election, though that rose to seven in 2017. Labour is under pressure again, mainly because its relatively neutral policy on Brexit, and its grudging willingness to contemplate a second vote on Scottish independence, makes it sound fuzzy on the biggest two questions. According to Mr. McLeish, Labour in Scotland lost traction to the Scottish National Party by underestimating it. “We became massively complacent,” he said. In the final analysis, independence seems likely to rise on the Scottish agenda no matter who wins the election. If Labour deprives Mr. Johnson of a majority and needs the support of the Scottish National Party, that could open the way to a quick second independence referendum, while a Conservative sweep would lead to a Brexit that most Scots oppose. “If Johnson and the Tories at Westminster continue to behave as they are,” said Mr. McLeish, “there’s not going to be any great day when we wake up with 60 percent in favor of independence, but we are going to drift slowly towards that outcome.”']","The Scots could decide the outcome of Britain’s election next month, the future of Brexit and maybe even the survival of the United Kingdom.

"Less Plastic With ‘Bags for Life’? Try Again, Campaign Groups Say",2019-11-28,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — When the British government introduced a 5-pence levy on plastic bags four years ago, it encouraged shoppers to help reduce environmental damage by bringing their own reusable “bags for life.”  But the bags —\xa0which are sturdier than traditional single-use plastic bags —\xa0have instead become a significant factor in the country’s largest supermarkets’ “plastic footprint,” according to a report published on Thursday by Greenpeace and Britain’s Environment Investigation Agency. This year, the 10 companies representing most of Britain’s grocery retail market have sold over 1.5 billion “bags for life,” the report found —\xa0which amounts to 54 bags per household. That was on top of the 959 million “bags for life” sold in the country’s main supermarkets last year. “We have replaced one problem with another,” said Fiona Nicholls, a Greenpeace U.K. campaigner who is one of the report’s authors. “Bags for life have become bags for a week.” One company alone, the frozen-food chain Iceland, reported a tenfold increase in sales of “bags for life” this year, the report found — 34 million bags, up from 3.5 million last year. In promoting the sturdier bags in 2015, the government said, “Typically, you pay for these once and can return them for a free replacement when they wear out.”  Yet four years later, the campaigners’ report, titled “Checking Out on Plastic II,” found that the “bags for life” sold by the largest supermarkets this year amounted to nearly 50,000 tons of plastic, in addition to over 3,330 tons of plastic from their single-use bags this year. Over all, total plastic packaging in Britain’s main supermarkets amounted to 995,000 tons last year, the report found, although some supermarkets were experimenting with selling more loose produce rather than relying largely on fruit and vegetables wrapped in plastic. After its introduction, the plastic bag levy was credited with a more than 80 percent reduction in the number of bags given out by the largest retailers. The extent to which increased “bag for life” sales have countered this effect was unclear. Shoppers in Britain have widely debated plastic pollution for years, with public awareness significantly increasing after millions watched the hit BBC documentary series “Blue Planet II” in 2017.  Its renowned narrator, David Attenborough, later urged people to reduce their plastic footprint, as government officials said they had been “haunted” by the documentary’s images of the damage that plastic has done to the world’s oceans.  Nearly nine million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, according to Ocean Conservancy, a United States-based nonprofit environmental group. In 2018, the country’s largest supermarket chains, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, joined an industrywide initiative to “tackle the scourge of plastic waste.”  The initiative, known as U.K. Plastics Pact, included a pledge to replace traditional plastic packaging with reusable, recyclable or compostable material, although campaign groups say that such a move is unlikely to reduce the companies’ plastic footprint. Yet despite the British public’s increased knowledge of environmental issues around plastic, Ms. Nicholls said that supermarkets and retail companies were performing poorly in lessening their plastic footprint.  “After all this public awareness, we’d expect plastic consumption to drop in supermarkets, but it’s actually increasing,” she said. To encourage shoppers to reuse bags, the report urges British supermarkets to raise the price of “bags for life” —\xa0which currently sell for 20 pence (26 cents) in Sainsbury’s — to at least 70 pence, “or ideally to remove them altogether.” Sales of “bags for life” fell 90 percent in neighboring Ireland when supermarkets significantly raised the price of the bags, according to the report. That kind of nudge aims to raise the likelihood that people will take their own bags when visiting a supermarket. “When we go shopping,” Ms. Nicholls said, “we should remember our bags like we remember our phones.” ']","A surge in sales of thicker reusable plastic bags in British supermarkets is worsening their “plastic footprint,” a report says."
Death of Colombian Teenager Drives Protesters Back to Streets,2019-11-27,By Alan Yuhas,"['Two days after a police projectile sent 18-year-old Dilan Cruz to the hospital, his sister spoke at his high school, pleading for peace in Colombia after five straight days of anti-government protests.  “What we want most right now is for him to recover,” his sister, Denis Cruz, said Monday. “We want what happened with Dilan not to be used for more riots, to create more violence.”  “The only thing we’re also asking for from my family,” she said, “is peace.”  But that night, Dilan died of the head injury, and protesters again flooded into the streets of Bogotá on Tuesday, calling the teenager a victim of police brutality. The death has fueled still more anger among the tens of thousands of people who have for days protested against corruption and the conservative policies of President Iván Duque.  Mr. Duque tried to quell the anger by meeting Tuesday with protest leaders for what he called a “great national dialogue.” But it was unclear what the meeting accomplished, other than having given protesters a forum to air grievances. For now, the crisis appears to have no end in sight. The protests began with a general strike last Thursday. More than 200,000 people took to the streets on the first day, the police estimated.  The strike was organized by students, unions and Indigenous people opposed to proposed changes to Colombia’s pension and labor laws. But as the days passed, thousands of other Colombians joined the marches to express anger about inequality, corruption and possible austerity measures. In recent months, wallet issues have also driven mass protests in Chile, Lebanon and other nations. Mr. Cruz was the fourth person to be killed in the demonstrations, which for the most part have been peaceful, though a few have deteriorated into riots and looting.  The protesters are also demonstrating against rising violence in the countryside, which has been linked to drug traffickers, rebel groups like the National Liberation Army and former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, who have returned to arms. Although Colombia and the FARC reached a peace agreement in September 2016, thousands of militants have resumed fighting, and at least 500 activists and community leaders have been killed. Mr. Duque’s government, which took over in August 2018, has been accused of being slow to put the terms of the agreement into action. Videos of the moments before and after Mr. Cruz was struck by a police projectile on Saturday showed riot police officers walking down a street, behind crowds of protesters. After a loud bang, Mr. Cruz can be seen collapsed on the street, with people rushing to help him. Mr. Cruz had a visible head injury. The police have not said what struck him, but some protesters say it was a tear-gas canister.  His death prompted an outpouring of grief and anger. Protesters marched late into the night, banging pots and pans and chanting, “Dilan didn’t die, Dilan was killed.” The president, police officials and the nation’s prosecutor general all expressed their condolences, and Mr. Duque said he had ordered “an urgent investigation to clarify quickly what happened and determine responsibility.” His critics have demanded greater accountability. Senator Iván Cepeda Castro called Mr. Cruz a “symbol of the policy of human rights violations” that the president has been pursuing. And José Miguel Vivanco, executive director for Human Rights Watch in the Americas, called for immediate measures from the attorney general and the Defense Ministry to ensure that there are no more fatalities.  “Besides condolences, we need justice,” he said. For protesters, Mr. Cruz’s name has become a rallying cry, and they have called for another national strike. One student association said he represented “a generation that was robbed of its rights but that will not be robbed of dignity.” Protest organizers planned more demonstrations in his memory on Wednesday.  Mr. Duque, Colombia’s president, met with a committee of protest leaders on Tuesday, but the talks appeared to end inconclusively after two hours.  The protesters have demanded talks outside of Mr. Duque’s “national dialogue,” but so far the president has insisted on meetings that include representatives from the courts, the business community and other sectors. Mr. Duque has denied supporting rumored changes to the pension system and labor laws, including a cut to the minimum wage for young people.']","Dilan Cruz, 18, died after being struck by a police projectile.

"German Catholic Church Debates Sexuality, Celibacy and Women’s Roles",2019-11-29,By Liam Stack,"['BERLIN — The Roman Catholic Church in Germany has a split identity. At home, attendance is falling and many Germans say they regard the church’s teaching on social issues as hopelessly out of touch. But globally, the German church is one of the most powerful — and liberal — regions of the Catholic world, a player whose wealth and theological influence are now creating a challenge for the entire church. On Dec. 1, the German church’s international influence will be on display when its bishops begin a two-year-long series of meetings with lay leaders that will allow debate on hot-button issues that in many other corners of the church would be off limits, such as whether to accept homosexuality, end clerical celibacy and ordain women as priests. The meetings carry no authority to actually change church doctrine. Nevertheless, the Vatican and conservative Catholics in Germany and elsewhere have repeatedly warned that the dialogue process — which the German church calls “the synodal path” — could lead to schism. Germany, of course, was where Martin Luther helped begin the Protestant Reformation with his 95 theses condemning the Catholic church.  Some critics “feel that the Germans brought on the Reformation 500 years ago and divided the Catholic Church, and now the Germans are again up to no good trying to change the church,” said the Rev. Godehard Brüntrup, a spokesman for the Jesuit religious order in Germany and vice president of the Munich School of Philosophy.  Organizers of the dialogue say schism is not their goal. The dialogue grew out of the response to the clergy sexual abuse scandal in Germany, and Catholic leaders say it is meant to bridge the cultural divide between the church and many of its followers, and to explore whether church teachings set the stage for abuse. Priests are set to read a letter to parishioners at Mass this Sunday acknowledging that the church’s message “has been obscured and even terribly damaged” by the sexual abuse scandal, and calling the dialogue a process of “change and renewal.” The dialogue has nonetheless become a proxy war in the conflict between conservatives and liberals that has consumed much of Pope Francis’ tenure. And it strikes at core questions facing the church: What caused the abuse crisis and how should Catholics respond to it? Tensions over the dialogue can be seen in the divide between Germany’s cardinals: Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki, archbishop of Cologne, a critic of the process, and Cardinal Reinhard Marx, the archbishop of Munich and Freising, who has called for opening the church to “new thinking.”  Cardinal Woelki, whose Cologne archdiocese is one of the world’s wealthiest, has warned  bishops against stumbling into creating a “German national church,” distinct from the unified Catholic “universal church.” “I do not want to support a special ‘German Way,’ nor should we as Germans pretend to know better than the rest of the church,” the cardinal said in an interview.  Cardinal Marx has championed the dialogue as head of the German Bishops Conference, and has spoken in the past of an openness to reconsidering issues like mandatory celibacy for priests. The cardinal is a particularly influential figure in the global church: He is a member of Francis’ small advisory council and leads the same archdiocese once led by Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI (now pope emeritus). “Faith can only grow and deepen,” Cardinal Marx said at a meeting of the bishop’s conference in March, “if one faces up to the free and open debate, and develops the ability to take new positions and to go new ways.”  For traditionalists, like Cardinal Woelki, the challenges facing the church require a recommitment to church teaching, not an effort to align the church with public opinion on sexual issues. “Throughout history Christians have never been in sync with the world,” said the cardinal, who leads a diocese where fewer than 8 percent of parishioners regularly attend Mass, slightly lower than the 9.3 percent of Germany’s 23 million registered Catholics who regularly go.  But the “synodal path” is based on the opposite view, articulated by a study commissioned by the bishops conference that said church teachings and practices should be examined because they had set the stage for abuse.  Those factors include “the management of power, the priestly ways of life, sexual morals detached from reality and, finally, the role of women in the church,” Thomas Sternberg, president of the Central Committee of German Catholics, a lay group that has collaborated with the bishop’s conference on the dialogue, wrote in an email. “We also have to find new models for priestly forms of life,” he said, suggesting “significantly more participation of women, including in leadership functions and liturgical workings.” Statements like that have caused a stir at the Vatican. In a letter in June, Francis encouraged the German church to focus on evangelization and “walk together” with the larger church so as to avoid “increasing and perpetuating the evils it sought to to solve.” If regional churches “find themselves separated” from the universal Catholic Church, the pope wrote, “they weaken, rot and die.” The Vatican delivered an even more forceful message in September, reminding the German bishops in a letter that they do not determine church policy, and rebuking them for partnering as equals with laypeople.  Cardinal Woelki echoed that concern, saying in an email that the dialogue’s design, which gives bishops and lay leaders equal say in decision-making, “could easily lead to the misconception that we can ‘democratize’ the church.’” “Bishops — the successors of the Apostles — are called to teach and defend the faith,” the cardinal said. “The democratization of the faith would be the end of the church by turning divine revelation into an endless political power struggle.”  The German church’s occupying a position of both great strength and weakness can be seen in two sets of numbers released in July in its annual report: The church has lost an average of 100,000 members a year since 1990, with more than 216,000 leaving in 2018. But the bishops conference also said it had brought in over $6.5 billion in net revenue each year since 2016, thanks to a tithe on registered Catholics of up to 9 percent collected by the German government as a “church tax.” Since the 19th century, Germany has collected the tax from registered members of established religions, including both Catholics and Protestants, and then distributed the revenue back to the churches.  The German church sends hundreds of millions of dollars each year to Catholic charities and church projects around the world. German Catholics are also major funders of the Vatican; the bishops conference sends almost $7 million a year, and each of Germany’s 27 dioceses sends its own contributions, said Matthias Kopp, a spokesman for the bishops conference. “The German church is very influential because of its financial might,” said Father Brüntrup, the Jesuit spokesman. “But it also has had a great influence on the intellectual life of the church, because German theology was and still is a leading force intellectually.”  He described talk of a schism as “a politically motivated exaggeration,” but said conservative Catholics might still be troubled by the possible long-term impact of the bishops’ plan. “What they want to start is a process of dialogue, listening to what the people and the experts and the laypeople have to say, so that the hierarchy gets from a mode of teaching to a mode of listening,” Father Brüntrup said. “And then this process might lead 10, 20 or 30 years down the road to a universal council in which maybe a few things change.” Stuck in the middle of the debate are sexual abuse survivors, who say the dialogue is both a victory and a source of worry.  The sex abuse crisis exploded in Germany in 2010 when alumni of a Berlin high school, Canisius College, said teachers abused them in the 1970s and 1980s. The crisis deepened in 2016 when an investigator said more than 200 boys in a choir led by the brother of Benedict XVI were abused over almost four decades. Abuse survivors say the church has never before shown such high-level interest in their concerns. But embedding their demands in a thicket of culture war conflicts could make the road to justice tougher, said Matthias Katsch, a Canisius alumnus who in 2010 told of his abuse.  “I’m afraid that the church is starting this conversation and this dialogue about the reform of the church and they forget that first they have to deal with the survivors,” Mr. Katsch said. ']","With the German church’s global influence, a meeting of bishops and laypeople to take up hot-button topics has led to warnings of a new schism, originating in the home of the Protestant Reformation."
Iraq Protesters Burn Down Iran Consulate in Night of Anger,2019-11-27,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Iraqi protesters in the southern city of Najaf burned down the Iranian Consulate there on Wednesday night in an outburst of anger at Iran, witnesses said.  Video showed sizable crowds outside the consulate shouting “Out, out Iran!” and waving Iraqi flags as the building burned.  Thirty-five protesters and 32 members of the Iraqi security forces were injured, according to the police in Najaf.  No Iranian diplomats were in the building at the time, according to witnesses and Iranian news media, and there were no reports of Iranian casualties. But the attack struck a significant symbolic blow against Iran, which places a high value on its outposts in the Shiite Muslim heartland of southern Iraq. Najaf houses important Shiite shrines, and Iran’s presence in the city demonstrates its ties to this ancient site. Iraqi secular and religious authorities condemned the violence but did not blame any particular group. The government imposed a curfew in Najaf until further notice.  [Update: Iraq’s Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said he would resign amid protests.] The attack on the consulate comes amid widespread antigovernment protests, which began nearly two months ago in Baghdad. The demonstrations started as a demand for jobs and better government services but have broadened into a call for a change in government, which the demonstrators see as corrupt and beholden to Iran.  Many of the political parties who dominate the Iraq’s Parliament have ties to Iran.  The attack on the consulate “sends a clear message that a segment of the Iraqi society rejects the Iranian political presence in the country and holds it accountable for bringing this government,” said Sheikh Fadhil al-Budayri, a senior cleric in Najaf.  This was the second attempt in a month by protesters to burn the Iranian consulate in Najaf. In the first attempt, Molotov cocktails were thrown over the consulate walls but the flames were put out and the damage was limited.  The demonstrators in Najaf are almost all Shiites, and Shiite religious authorities there have encouraged the protests, although they have insisted that they remain peaceful. The Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, has faced intense pressure to resolve the standoff between the protesters and the government. Although he usually tries to stay out of direct involvement in Iraqi politics, he has urged restraint by the government and admonished the protesters to refrain from violence. However, he has used increasingly strong language urging the government to make far-reaching changes in its election law, to crack down on corruption and to accommodate the demands of the “peaceful protesters.”  The majority of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but in Baghdad, the capital, and in the south, the security forces have shot unarmed demonstrators, killing more than 320 and wounding as many as 15,000 since the protests began, according to the United Nations office in Iraq.  In a number of places, protesters have set fire to the headquarters of political parties, damaged government buildings and engaged in revenge killings. Several analysts predicted that Iran would pressure the Iraqi government to have a tough response to the Najaf attack.  “For the Iranians having something like this happen in Najaf is highly symbolic, and they will retaliate either through the Iraqi government or through their tentacles inside Iraqi society,” said Abbas Kadhim, director of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council.  In addition to having allies in Iraq’s government, Iran has ties to several militias, known as popular mobilization forces. These militias have recently been incorporated into Iraq’s security forces, but there are fears that Iran might exert pressure on them to act in its interests. Within hours of the attack on the consulate, it appeared that Iran was preparing to strike back through these militias. The leader of those forces, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, framed the attack on the consulate as an attack on Ayatollah al-Sistani. “We will cut off the hand that attempts to get close to Marjaiyia Sayyid al-Sistani,” he said, using an honorific for the ayatollah. The statement appeared to be laying out a justification for future militia attacks on protesters by casting the response as a defense of Ayatollah al-Sistani. In a live report from Najaf, Iran’s state television reported Wednesday night that the consulate had been completely burned down and referred to the Iraqi protesters as “rioters and hooligans.” “The Iraqi forces just watched and did nothing,” the reporter said. “Hooligans entered the consulate in Najaf and completely burned it down.” Iran, which has faced its own protests over an increase in gas prices in recent weeks, did not hesitate to quash those demonstrations, killing and arresting hundreds of people. By contrast, the antigovernment protests in Iraq and neighboring Lebanon have continued for a couple of months and the two governments have largely tolerated them.  Conservative Iranian commentators saw a connection between the consulate attack and the Iranian protests, blaming foreign powers for both of them. “Saudi-imported thugs hit a brick wall inside Iran so they took out their frustration at Iran’s consulate in Najaf,” tweeted Farshad Mehdipour, founder of a hard-line newspaper. Iran has deep ties to Najaf. Millions of Iranian pilgrims worship at its Shiite shrines, and Iran has invested heavily in projects to refurbish and renovate the religious sites.  But Iran has also begun to send more of its own clerics to Najaf, pushing its branch of Shiism in which the chief religious leader is also the supreme political leader. Iraq has rejected that form of theocracy and has increasingly chafed against Iran’s interference in Iraq’s political life, which many Iraqis view as having encouraged corruption.  Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that the attack was mainly a symptom of the protesters’ frustrations with the Iraqi government, which has failed to make the changes being demanded. And the protesters see Iran’s influence as part of the problem.  “What we are seeing on the street is a revolt against the status quo — and the protector of the status quo is Tehran,” she said. Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting from New York, and Qassim al-Kaabi from Najaf.']","Antigovernment demonstrators, who have demanded an end to Iranian influence in Iraq, attacked the consulate in the city of Najaf."
Mexican Leader Draws Line on Trump Terrorist Plan: ‘Interventionism: No’,2019-11-27,By Kirk Semple and Lara Jakes,"['CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — A border wall. Mass deportations. Punishing tariffs. A halt to foreign aid. An end to a decades-old trade deal. For years, President Trump has pressured or wielded threats against Mexico, hoping to force a policy change, excite his political base, or both. This week, he did it again, announcing that he planned to designate Mexican drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations. Mr. Trump, who made the remarks in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, didn’t specify which of the mosaic of criminal groups he intended to slap with the label. But the reaction in Mexico has been swift — and negative — as the nation considered the implications. Mexican officials have suggested that the terrorist designations could challenge their nation’s sovereignty, and the foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, is seeking high-level talks with Trump administration officials about the matter. Some analysts raised the specter of armed drone strikes on Mexican soil, or other covert American actions against drug traffickers, potentially without the knowledge or consent of the Mexican government. Speaking on Wednesday, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador mostly demurred on the subject, but hinted that he did not welcome the prospect of secret American operations on Mexican territory. “Cooperation: yes,” he said of the relationship between Mexico and the United States. “Interventionism: no.” Mr. Trump said that he planned to designate Mexican drug “cartels” as foreign terrorist organizations because of the high number of Americans killed by their activities, and that he had been working on the listing for three months. In the exchange, posted on Mr. O’Reilly’s personal website, Mr. O’Reilly asked the president whether he was going to “start hitting them with drones.” The president replied, “I don’t want to say what I am going to do, but they will be designated.” Last March, Mr. Trump also openly floated the idea of the designation, saying in an interview with Breitbart News that he was thinking “very seriously” about it.  But a groundswell of support, mainly among conservatives, gained momentum in recent weeks after the killing of three mothers and six of their children, all dual Mexican and American citizens, who were part of a fundamentalist Mormon community in northern Mexico.  The State Department declined to comment on Wednesday, referring several questions to the White House about how many cartels Mr. Trump was looking to designate, or when a decision might be made. It is not new for the United States to consider listing drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Members of Congress have made similar requests during past presidential administrations, said Jason Blazakis, the former director of the State Department’s office of counterterror finance and designations. But, Mr. Blazakis said, the United States has largely resisted adding them to official terror organization lists out of concern that it would be a mostly symbolic step that eats up already-scarce resources and could do more damage to diplomacy than good. Other analysts warned that the designation could undermine or disrupt the carefully tuned relationship between the United States and Mexico, a complex arrangement developed over generations of administrations and covering a broad range of issues, including trade, crime-fighting, finance, migration, tourism and culture. Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington, warned that the Trump administration could use the terrorist designation to block loans to Mexico from international financial institutions and even restrict imports to the United States from Mexico. But some analysts said that Mr. Trump’s announcement could force the Mexican government to strengthen its fight against criminal groups and the corruption that allows them to prosper. Mr. López Obrador has struggled to define a coherent security strategy, and violence has continued to soar during his administration.  “This could also be beneficial for Mexico, since the United States can force Mexico to come up with a more serious security strategy,” said Guillermo Valdés, a former director of Mexico’s National Intelligence Center. It would not be the first time Mr. Trump has tried to exploit a weakness in Mr. López Obrador’s  policies to force change. This year, Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on Mexico pressured the López Obrador administration to crack down on illegal migration. “On one hand, there is the arbitrariness and aggression of the Trump administration,” Mr. Valdés said. “And on the other hand, it is also true that there is a lack of security strategy, and what has been tested so far has resulted in utter failure. So, we are at the junction of these two elements.” Mr. Trump could take a few avenues to listing the cartels. Entire criminal organizations could be added to the State Department’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, joining about 60, mostly Islamist, groups already on it. Cartels and their senior leaders could also be designated under an existing executive order that targets terrorist threats. Most of the more than 100 people and organizations currently on that list are also Islamist extremists. Either of those routes generally take between six months and a year, Mr. Blazakis said, and carry similar consequences. It is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly provide support for a designated foreign terrorist organization, its members are barred from entering the United States, and financial institutions are forbidden from doing business with it.  Mr. Trump has another option as well: He could issue a new executive order, related only to the cartels, to declare them a specific threat to the United States. Mr. Blazakis said that the Mexican drug cartels largely meet the legal definition of foreign groups that threaten or otherwise terrorize American interests. But he said that adding them to the list could open the door for many other groups to be added, potentially diluting the focus on global extremist threats that Congress sought after Sept. 11. “The question becomes, ‘If we’re adding these cartels, what other criminal organizations should be added to the list?’ You would really be opening up Pandora’s box,” said Mr. Blazakis, who left the Trump administration in August 2018 after 10 years overseeing the State Department’s terror designations. “So in a way, that terrorism list becomes less of a terrorism list.” The Treasury Department already targets drug kingpins and senior cartel officials on a separate list that carries many of the same penalties as the terrorist designations. If the firestorms on social media are any indication, many here in Mexico are also worried that the designation might open the door to some sort of military intervention by the United States. “Many people are concerned that it signals a counterterrorism approach to dealing with these groups,” said Brian J. Phillips, a former research professor at CIDE, a university in Mexico City. “The one thing that nearly unites Mexico is opposition to armed U.S. troops in Mexico territory.” But the label, he continued, is not equivalent to a declaration of war against the designated group. “It’s quite possible that there’s no change in the military approach to dealing with these groups,” he added. Mr. Sarukhán, the former ambassador, said that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both considered applying the foreign terrorist designation to Mexican drug trafficking groups, with the intention of using it to attract more resources to combat drug trafficking. “We pushed back,” said Mr. Sarukhán, Mexico’s ambassador to Washington during those administrations. “It was the wrong tool for the problem.” Kirk Semple reported from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Lara Jakes from Washington.

"Brad Gobright, Renowned Rock Climber, Is Dead After Fall in Mexico",2019-11-29,By Elian Peltier,"['Brad Gobright, an acclaimed American free solo climber, has died after falling nearly 1,000 feet while rappelling a well-known route in Mexico with a rope, the authorities said. Mr. Gobright, 31, fell to his death on Wednesday from a rock known as El Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path, in the Potrero Chico national park in northern Mexico, the Mexican civil defense authorities said in a statement on Thursday. Mr. Gobright, a native of California, was hailed as one of the world’s best free solo climbers, a technique that uses no ropes. He set a speed record in 2017 — 2 hours 19 minutes 44 seconds — at the popular climbing route called the Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. It has since been surpassed. On Wednesday, he was not free soloing when he fell, but was rappelling using a rope with a climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson survived the fall but sustained several injuries. “It was basically a blur,” Mr. Jacobson, 26, told Outside Magazine. “He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.” A civil responder who participated in the rescue effort and posted Facebook pictures of Mr. Jacobson in an ambulance said the climber had injured his right ankle. Practitioners of free solo climbing say it is a risky yet exhilarating experience, one that comes with a calm acceptance of death.  “The risk in free soloing is always to fall off and fall to your death,” the renowned free solo climber Alex Honnold told The New York Times in 2018. “I mean, that’s pretty straightforward.” In a message posted on Instagram on Thursday, Mr. Honnold praised Mr. Gobright’s “insanely strong fingers” and said the climbing world had “lost a true light.” Other styles of climbing have had their share of tragedy. In 2017, Ueli Steck, a renowned mountain climber known as “the Swiss Machine” for his rapid ascents of imposing peaks, died in an accident at a camp near Mount Everest. In 2015, Dean Potter, a top rock climber, was killed along with another man in a BASE-jumping accident at Yosemite National Park in California. A college dropout, Mr. Gobright had dedicated his life to climbing, touring in the United States and living in a Honda Civic.  “I enrolled Brad in soccer when he was 5,” his mother, Pamela Gobright, told Rock and Ice Magazine in a 2015 profile of the climber. “But he just climbed the goal posts instead of following the ball.” In the 2017 documentary “Safety Third,” he says of free soloing: “I know it’s not safe. I’m not saying it’s safe, but it’s fun, you know?” In his last Instagram post, posted this month after a climbing trip in Utah, Mr. Gobright wrote, “At times things got very chaotic, but at other times it was calm and silent as I stared off into the vast openness.”']","The American free solo climber, one of the world’s best, fell nearly 1,000 feet on Wednesday while using a rope.

"3 Young People Stabbed on Busy Hague Street, Setting Off Alarm in Dutch City",2019-11-29,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['The police in the Dutch city of The Hague said three young people were injured in a “stabbing incident” on Friday evening on Grote Markt Street, a central thoroughfare teeming with Black Friday shoppers. The deputy mayor, Boudewijn Revis, described the victims as children and called the episode “a terrible thing to happen on a night on which so many people are shopping in one of our busiest streets.” The victims were treated at hospitals and released, the police said.  The police said late Friday that they were still searching for a suspect and investigating a potential motive. The Dutch newspaper AD said that investigators had found a knife in the area. Photos posted on social media showed the neighborhood cordoned off on Friday night with helicopters circling above and emergency vehicles stationed all about.  The dramatic police response reflected heightened fears on the Continent after a burst of violence in London earlier Friday was declared a “terrorist incident” by the British police. In a chaotic altercation on London Bridge, several people tackled a man wearing a fake bomb, whom the police shot dead at the scene. Two people were stabbed to death. The busy holiday season — targeted for attacks around Europe in recent years — may also have put the Dutch authorities on edge. Last month, Amsterdam’s international airport was briefly paralyzed as security forces responded to a false alarm of a hijacking; this week, the Dutch police arrested two men accused of plotting a terrorist attack. But unlike in France, Belgium and Germany, there have been no major organized terrorist attacks on Dutch soil in recent years.  In most of the country, the police presence tends to be subdued and heavy automatic rifles are rarely seen in the hands of law enforcement. Exceptions are at Schiphol, the country’s biggest airport, and at Parliament, about 400 yards from the stabbing site, which are guarded by the well-armed military police, the royal Marechaussee. Earlier this year in Utrecht, about 45 miles east of The Hague, a gunman opened fire in a tram, killing three and injuring five. SWAT teams responded as authorities scrambled to deal with what was believed to be a terrorist attack. The shooter, who at the time of the killings faced rape charges, told police he had acted alone.

"Time Is Running Out for Trump’s North Korean Diplomacy, Analysts Say",2019-11-28,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The clock is ticking. Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, has said that the United States has until the end of the year to make a new proposal to create a breakthrough in stalled negotiations on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The looming deadline — which North Korea has issued repeated warnings about — carries the implicit threat that the country could return to its alarming behavior of the past by ending its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear tests and launching long-range missiles capable of hitting American cities. On Thursday, it launched two short-range rockets, its 13th rocket or missile test since May.  “Today, we sit on top of a live volcano,” said Robert L. Carlin, a former nuclear negotiator at the State Department and longtime North Korea observer, describing a rapidly deteriorating situation on the peninsula during a lecture this month at Yonsei University in Seoul, the South Korean capital. “We don’t have a lot of time to back away.” In the past month, North Korea has warned that the Trump administration should not even “dream of” discussing denuclearization without first ending its “hostile” policies, including smothering economic sanctions. It swore “shocking punishment” if Washington were to ignore the year-end deadline.  Senior American diplomats do not appear to share that urgency. To them, it’s just posturing. “I don’t remember a time limit being set. Is this the North Koreans?” David R. Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told reporters in Tokyo last month, admitting to being unaware of the deadline. “But I would say that the North Koreans do one thing a lot, and that’s bluff.” When Washington has addressed the January deadline, it has called it an “artificial” time limit. And that leaves analysts fearing the outbreak of another crisis on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has not been explicit about what might happen after Dec. 31, except that Mr. Kim has warned of finding a “new way” if Washington persists with sanctions and tries to force an unpalatable denuclearization deal. Some analysts say the deadline shows how badly Mr. Kim wants a deal so that he can finally deliver on a promise to his people to lift sanctions and rebuild \u200bthe country’s ailing economy. North Korea’s increasingly urgent statements in recent weeks are designed to pressure Washington to return to the negotiating table with a more flexible proposal, they say. “The North Koreans are telling the United States: ‘We will have to do something very bad unless you do something for us by the end of the year, so please help us stop ourselves,’” Kim Hyung-ki, a former vice unification minister of South Korea, said during a forum in Seoul last month. Mr. Kim’s “new way” could mean resuming tests of nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, analysts say. Mr. Trump has often bragged about the testing moratorium, citing it as his biggest achievement in his on-off diplomacy with Mr. Kim. Recently, the United States and South Korea decided to postpone a joint air force exercise that has alarmed the North. If North Korea launches another long-range missile, it will set off more United Nations sanctions. It would also invite harsh reaction from Washington, perhaps even a return to the type of “fire and fury” threats Mr. Trump once used as the United States and North Korea appeared to be hurtling to the brink of war. With its increasingly strident demands in recent weeks, North Korea is playing a delicate game in denying itself an escape hatch from Mr. Kim’s year-end deadline. And it comes as Washington is consumed by the impeachment hearings, which limit Mr. Trump’s room for diplomacy with the North. That combination makes the situation volatile, escalating the risk that either side could miscalculate, officials and analysts worry. “We could see a possibility of going back to some of the more provocative steps that preceded the start of this diplomacy,” Stephen E. Biegun, Washington’s special representative for North Korea, said last week during a confirmation hearing on his nomination as deputy secretary of state. “I think that would be a huge mistake and a missed opportunity by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.” Other analysts say Mr. Kim would most likely first take actions that do not breach the moratorium on nuclear or long-range missile tests but would still deliver a strong message to Washington. That could include restarting plutonium-producing nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, or launching short- or medium-range missiles. A nuclear or ICBM test would also provoke China at a time when Mr. Kim needs its help more than ever to blunt the pain of international sanctions. Last year, 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited North Korea, a 50 percent increase from 2017, providing badly needed cash for Pyongyang, according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, citing Chinese customs data. If Mr. Kim ends his diplomacy with Mr. Trump, he could, at least in the short term, “muddle through with the help of China,” said Lee Jung-chul, a North Korea expert at Soongsil University in Seoul. “It will be difficult for the North to attempt a provocation, given the importance of its relations with China.” North Korea has not specified what it seeks in demanding that Washington drop its “hostile policy.” It has long indicated that it wants international sanctions lifted and an end to joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. In the past, it has also called for the United States to end its military presence in and around South Korea. But in recent statements, North Korea has only hardened its demands, further dimming the prospects for dialogue. It said it had already taken enough confidence-building steps, such as the test moratorium, the shutting down of its underground nuclear test site and its return of American remains from the Korean War. It said Mr. Trump should expect no more gifts “he can boast of” and that he should instead keep the promises he made in his Singapore summit meeting last year with Mr. Kim, like ending regular joint military exercises with South Korea that the North sees as war preparations. Analysts worry that with talks having stalled, North Korea will continue to produce more nuclear fuel and warheads. As its nuclear arsenal increases, the cost of denuclearization continues to rise.  “You might argue, how can we reward a bad guy like North Korea?” said Jun Bong-geun, acting president of the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. “But sanctions and pressure alone have never worked on North Korea. You also have to offer incentives.”']",Analysts fear a looming crisis as North Korea warns of a Dec. 31 deadline for a new proposal from the United States on denuclearization.
"Love Conquers All in Italy’s Parliament, at Least for One Day",2019-11-28,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Chamber of Deputies in Italy’s Parliament, the arena where lawmakers berate each other, betray alliances and sometimes brawl, is not where Italians usually go to find affection for their fellow citizens. That changed at least for a moment on Thursday, with an unusual proposal put forward by a lawmaker: Flavio Di Muro, a member of the League party, asked his girlfriend to marry him.  As he took a microphone to address the chamber, Mr. Di Muro spoke about the busy lifestyle led by many lawmakers, and the punishing toll it took on their personal lives. Behind him, Massimiliano Panizzut, another League lawmaker, was so absorbed in his phone that he barely raised an eyebrow during the speech.  “We neglect the true values, we neglect the people who care for us, we neglect those we love,” Mr. Di Muro said, before asking the assembly for respect, because “today is a special day for me.” Then he ducked under his desk for a few seconds, emerging with an open jewelry box containing a ring, which he raised toward his girlfriend, Elisa De Leo, in the spectator’s gallery above. “Elisa, would you marry me?” he asked, blushing. League lawmakers at his sides leapt to their feet, applauding and hugging Mr. Di Muro. “You’re great, you’re great,” colleagues called out. (Mr. Panizzut, still seated, eventually put down his phone to clap.) “Deputato Di Muro,” intervened Roberto Fico, the speaker of the chamber and a member of the Five Star Movement, using the Italian term for congressman. He chided Mr. Di Muro for using lawmakers’ time for personal matters ahead of an important order of business: a vote on measures to assist central Italian regions struck by earthquakes in 2016. He called for order in the hall, primly ringing a silver bell on his desk.  But Stefania Pezzopane, a member of the Democratic Party and the sponsor of the earthquake bill, asked for the floor to congratulate the couple — out of sight from the Parliament’s cameras, Ms. De Leo had said yes. “When it’s love, love unites,” Ms. Pezzopane said, to applause in the chamber.  Mr. Fico cut her short: “I understand everything, but let’s press on,” he said. (At one point amid his calls for quiet, he appeared to be suppressing a smile.) Mr. Di Muro, 33, said in an interview that he had taken advantage of his girlfriend’s three-day visit to Rome to surprise Ms. De Leo — and his fellow lawmakers — with the proposal. The couple has been together for six years, and lived together in Ventimiglia, in northwestern Italy, before he was elected to the lower house in March 2018. Proposing in Parliament made sense, he said, because “she’s close to me personally, and politically, and she’s been with me throughout my political career.” A date for the wedding has not been set, Mr. Di Muro said. Incidentally, the earthquake recovery measures that the speaker insisted on passed with 281 votes in favor, and none against — an unusual show of solidarity among Italy’s quarrelsome lawmakers, who have felled more than one government.  In the interview, Mr. Di Muro alluded to those divisions by noting their absence, however brief. “What I liked best was that the applause today was unanimous,” he said.

Stabbings Around London Bridge Kill 2 in ‘Terrorist Incident’,2019-11-29,By Mark Landler and Megan Specia,"['LONDON — The police shot and killed a man wearing a fake bomb on London Bridge on Friday, after two people were fatally stabbed in what the police called a terrorist incident, jolting Britain’s capital two weeks before a general election and three days before world leaders were to gather here for a NATO summit meeting. The chaotic eruption of violence drew in several police officers and civilians, sent scores of panicked pedestrians fleeing from the bridge and nearby streets on both sides of the Thames, and evoked memories of an eerily similar terrorist attack on the same bridge in 2017 that killed eight people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who halted his campaign to rush back to 10 Downing Street, declared “this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack.” He paid tribute to the bravery of the passers-by who he said intervened to prevent further bloodshed. Dramatic video posted on social media showed a crowd surrounding a man, whom they appeared to have tackled. As they wrestled with and held the man to the ground, at least three police officers responded with their guns drawn.  The police pulled the other people away from the man on the ground, and then an officer appeared to fire at least one shot, hitting the man and prompting screams from bystanders. The man died at the scene, the police said. Government officials said the man had previously been convicted of an Islamist terrorism-related offense. He had been in prison and was released on condition that he wear an electronic tag, according to several reports. Early Saturday, the police identified the suspect as Usman Khan, 28, and said that no other suspect was being sought. “It has been declared a terrorist incident,” said Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. “I must stress, however, that we retain an open mind as to any motive.” There had been reports that the man was wearing an explosive device, Mr. Basu said, but the police determined that it was “a hoax explosive device” strapped to his body.  “What’s remarkable about the images we’ve seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them,” said Mayor Sadiq Khan of London. It was not clear if the passers-by saw the phony device and decided to tackle the man anyway.  On Friday evening, the police reported that two people died after being stabbed, and that three others had been injured.  The Metropolitan Police said that around 2 p.m., they responded to reports of a knife attack in Fishmongers’ Hall, a grand Greek Revival building that sits just at the north end of London Bridge and is often used for events. On Friday, a criminal justice group whose members are former Cambridge University academics was meeting there. “The circumstances, as we currently understand them, are that the attacker attended an event earlier on Friday afternoon at Fishmonger’s Hall called ‘Learning Together,’” said Mr. Basu, the assistant police commissioner, in a statement early Saturday morning. “We believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge, where he was detained and subsequently confronted and shot by armed officers.” A woman who said she was in the hall described an almost surreal scene, posting on Twitter that after the attack began, another man grabbed a five-foot-long narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to confront the attacker.  Later, on the bridge, as the crowd was trying to subdue the assailant, bystanders captured images of a man standing with a long white pole, which the woman in the hall, Amy Coop, said was the narwhal tusk.  Video captured by bystanders also showed another man, in a suit and tie, appearing to grab a knife and retreat as the police approached.  The police have made no further arrests, and it has been widely reported that the man who picked up the knife was involved in trying to end the attack.  Police vehicles blocked both sides of the roadway on London Bridge, which is one of the city’s busiest arteries and a popular crossing for tourists and other pedestrians.  As the police cordoned off the area, empty buses and abandoned vehicles remained parked on the bridge. In the nearby Borough Market, a food and drink space popular with tourists, visitors were told to shelter in place, before eventually being evacuated.  Mr. Johnson, speaking before an emergency security meeting on Friday night, said it was a “mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early and it is very important that we get out of that habit and that we enforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists.” Earlier this month, the British government downgraded the national terrorism threat level to substantial from severe for the first time since 2014. A substantial threat still means that authorities regard an attack as likely, but that decision may come under fresh scrutiny in the context of an election campaign. The episode bore a disquieting similarity to the 2017 attack on the bridge, in which a van careered onto the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians, before three attackers leaped from the vehicle and struck people with knives. They killed eight people before being killed by the police. Those men were also wearing fake suicide vests. Earlier that year, a car plowed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge. Six people, including the attacker, were killed. The 2017 London Bridge attack, which was carried out by three assailants inspired by the Islamic State, came in the final weeks of Britain’s last election, and it rapidly became a political issue. The Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the prime minister at the time, Theresa May, of cutting the number of police officers in Britain.  Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, which had begun the campaign with a robust lead in the polls, saw its edge steadily evaporate, and Mrs. May ended up losing her parliamentary majority.  London has long experience of terrorist attacks, and its residents pride themselves on keeping their cool. On Friday evening, pubs across the city filled up with their usual after-work crowds. But the attack left the city uneasy because so many details about the assailant remain unknown.  It also came only days before President Trump and other leaders are scheduled to visit the city for a NATO summit meeting. On Tuesday, Queen Elizabeth II plans to hold a reception marking the alliance’s 70th anniversary at Buckingham Palace. After the 2017 attack, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Khan for what the president falsely claimed was the mayor’s lackadaisical response. Mr. Khan called on the government to cancel Mr. Trump’s state visit later that year. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Khan said, “We must — and we will — stay resolute in our determination to stand strong and united in the face of terror. Those who seek to attack us and divide us will never succeed.” The attack, which happened on a sunny Friday afternoon, unfolded with an air of unreality.  John McManus, a BBC reporter who was crossing the bridge at the time of the incident, told the news outlet he had seen a group of men involved in a fight with another man on the bridge. The police then arrived, and “a number of shots were fired at this man.” Matthew Marchand, 37, whose office faces the bridge, said it was “scary to think that this happens on your doorstep somehow.” “It puts you back on edge,” Mr. Marchand said. “Every single attack makes you feel a little worse about safety.” He said he was surprised that such an episode could happen despite the safety measures put in place after previous terrorist attacks. “But it must have unfolded so quickly. What can you do about it?” he said. Mr. Johnson issued a statement thanking the police and emergency services for their “immediate response” and said he was being kept updated. He told the BBC he had suspended his campaigning on Friday and would decide over the next few hours when to return to the trail. Mr. Corbyn also halted his campaign. “We must remain united across all our communities and we cannot let our democratic process be derailed by acts of terror,” he said in a statement. Those in the area around London Bridge described the panic in the moments after the attack. Noa Bodner, who was stuck in a restaurant near London Bridge, told BBC News that those sheltering inside had been told to keep away from the windows.  “There was a rush of people coming in, and everybody basically dived under the tables,” she said. The manager ran to lock the doors, and employees told people to move away from the front of the restaurant. Susan Vinn, 57, said that she had been outside her office shortly after 2 p.m., when she saw people running across the bridge and into her office lobby. “It’s horrible,” she said of the attacks that have rattled London in recent years. “We know it’s going to happen again, we just don’t know when, so that keeps us worried for sure.”  Elian Peltier contributed reporting from London and Michael Dailey from New York.']","The authorities said that several people were stabbed, two fatally, and that the police shot and killed a man who appeared to have been wearing “a hoax explosive device.”"
Ice Sculpture Steals Show at U.K. Climate Debate That Boris Johnson Skips,2019-11-28,By Alan Yuhas,"['Five leaders of British political parties called for dramatic action to confront climate change in a televised debate on Thursday, just two weeks before the country’s general election. A melting ice sculpture stole the show. The sculpture stood in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the leader of the Conservatives and the figure who seems to loom over all of British politics. His absence fueled criticism that he has sought to avoid both the public and tough questions from the press during the election campaign. The ice sculpture infuriated Conservatives, some of whom accused the host network, Channel 4, of partisan bias. Mr. Johnson did send an emissary in his stead: Michael Gove, a cabinet member who formerly served as the environment minister, but Channel 4 said the debate was for party leaders only.  Nigel Farage, the leader of the right-wing Brexit Party, also declined to participate. Channel 4 erected an ice sculpture for each of the two missing candidates, flanking the five politicians who attended. The channel said the ice sculptures — one marked “Conservatives” the other “Brexit Party” — “represent the emergency on planet Earth.” Before the debate, the opposition Labour Party had accused Mr. Johnson, who leads in the polls ahead of the Dec. 12 election, of being afraid to face the press. Mr. Johnson and the BBC have yet to confirm that the prime minister will sit down for an interview with Andrew Neil, who grilled the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, this week. Conservatives threatened to review Channel 4’s broadcasting license after the election, according to BuzzFeed News and The Guardian. Channel 4’s editor, Ben de Pear, referred to the license threat on Twitter, writing: “Put your leader Boris Johnson alongside the other leaders and stop playing games.” He added, “All the parties complain about us, but they’re here.” Mr. Gove blamed the other party leaders for refusing him entry onstage, saying they “wouldn’t accept a Conservative voice.” He added: “I think that’s a denial of debate. I think that’s a denial of democracy.” He later answered questions from the public on Facebook. Mr. Johnson did not explain his absence. In a video that Mr. Gove tweeted of himself arriving at Channel 4, he said that Mr. Johnson could not attend “at the moment.” Asked if the prime minister was “otherwise committed,” Mr. Gove replied, “indeed.” At the debate itself, Mr. Corbyn and the leaders of the Green Party, the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, or the Party of Wales, argued over courses of action Britain could take to combat climate change. Among the topics discussed: insulating and retrofitting homes; moving to solar and wind energy; planting millions of trees; eating less meat; and saving British wildlife like the hedgehog. Though the leaders emphasized different priorities, all agreed on the urgency of addressing climate change and outlined ambitious proposals, like “a green industrial revolution,” promised by Mr. Corbyn. In June, the Conservative government of Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050. The other issue that has loomed over the election, Brexit, also made a brief appearance. Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, called Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union “a climate crime,” saying, “it’s morally wrong to give up our seat at the table.”']","A melting block of sculpted ice stood in for a missing prime minister at a televised debate, infuriating Conservatives.

Beloved Berlin Currywurst Stand Delivers a Bite of History,2019-11-29,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — The night the Berlin Wall fell, 30 years ago this month, Waltraud Ziervogel’s husband, Kurt, came home with the news and urged his wife to join him in the joyous celebrations and a stroll through West Berlin, suddenly accessible to them for the first time in nearly three decades. “I said, ‘Are you crazy?’ and I went to bed because I had the early shift,” said Ms. Ziervogel.  It may have been lost on her just then, but the world changed that night. When she pulled up the metal blinds of her sausage snack business at 4:30 a.m., the usually busy corner — just 400 yards from the wall — was even busier. “It was like a big party. Everyone was up and happy and partying, and many wanted to buy a sausage — but I wasn’t allowed to take West money,” she said. Three decades, tens of thousands of pork sausages and boatloads of curry-flavored ketchup later, Konnopke’s, the sausage stand under a subway overpass in the heart of Prenzlauer Berg that started its life in 1930 is still there, a monument to a working-class Berlin that has been all but priced out of existence — the all-night bars replaced by banks, upscale kitchen stores and vegan restaurants. Like many other citizens of East Germany who found themselves facing the challenges of a capitalist system with little preparation, Ms. Ziervogel, who was 53 when the wall fell, was forced to adapt. But unlike most, she was already a successful businesswoman responsible for more than a dozen employees when the wall fell. Still, the transition was hard. Her supply chain collapsed overnight, there were new taxes and new city regulations, and the changing tastes of her clientele. When the city rebuilt the subway viaduct that towers over the stand in 2010, officials tried to get her to change locations permanently. She resisted. “I like to call it the golden West,” Ms. Ziervogel said sarcastically during an interview in her garden, where in the early years she grew tomatoes for ketchup that was unavailable in the communist state. After a long fight with city officials, she managed to get permission to rebuild her stand completely in 2010 and reopened it early the next year. In the entire neighborhood, only a handful of retail businesses have survived the last three decades. As the international lineup of hungry customers on most days (Konnopke’s is closed on Sunday) can attest, Ms. Ziervogel has not only survived but thrived. Although it is hard to tell now, Prenzlauer Berg was a working-class district home to communists even before World War II. In the 1970s and ’80s, as the often war-damaged housing stock became increasingly decrepit and people moved away, the neighborhood became virtually the only place in East Germany where bohemian, gay and party scenes could take hold. Many leaders of the 1989 peaceful revolution lived there. “Even East Berlin, which was such an overly controlled, horrible space, did allow these little pockets of tolerance,” said Alexandra Richie, an Oxford-trained historian who has written a history of Berlin. Konnopke’s, which sits on a 50-foot median at the intersection of three major roads, remains the heart of the neighborhood. Celebrities, politicians and tourists regularly make the pilgrimage there. On its round birthdays (next year it will be its 90th), the company throws big street parties that are attended by local dignitaries, neighbors and longtime customers. Before the wall fell, the stand’s 4:30 a.m. opening was timed to catch not early risers, but late-night revelers coming from the Schoppenstube, the iconic East Berlin gay bar. “It was an exception — most of the rest of East Berlin had a curfew,” said Harald Hauswald, a street photographer who lived close to Konnopke’s in the 1980s and knew the neighborhood well. But the staff had to work quickly. Before long, another bar, the Lolott, whose clientele was prone to fighting, would close, and they had to make sure the two very different crowds would not meet. “We didn’t want anyone to get attacked,” said Heike Bucholz, 52, who has been working at Konnopke’s since 1984. “When I hear someone call me Waltraud, I know its one of my old night customers,” said Ms. Ziervogel. When Max Konnopke, Ms. Ziervogel’s father, started the business in 1930, he struggled at first. But one day he decided to load up his mobile kitchen into a trailer and haul it behind his motorcycle nearly 300 miles to Nuremberg, where he heard that the Nazi party was holding a big meeting. As described in an official history published by Ms. Ziervogel and her daughter, Dagmar Konnopke (who took her mother’s maiden name after a divorce), her father was mistrustful of the Nazis, but the Nuremberg rally proved a boon for his business, giving him the means to expand. Ms. Ziervogel married her husband, Kurt, who is now deceased, in 1957. They had two children: Dagmar, now 53, and Mario, now 56. Ms. Ziervogel formally took over in Prenzlauer Berg in 1976 (a second outlet in Weissensee was given to her brother and later sold), when her father retired. He died at 84, three years before the wall fell.  But the biggest challenge came in 1990 with the reunification of East and West Germany. Not just because of a new set of suppliers, taxes and rules, but because a new universe of customers expected a different set of offerings.  Konnopke’s started selling French fries. The currywurst, which used to be served with a bun and a hot mug of broth, is now cut up and served on a paper plate. (A tiny plastic fork is provided.)  Wedding parties can now reserve tables in a roofed-over pavilion, which was opened in 2011, after the last major renovation, and seats 35. “I put out tablecloths and little bouquets,” said Ms. Ziervogel. And there are now vegan currywursts. “Frau Ziervogel fought like a bull to keep this place,” said Dieter Kohl, a regular customer from before the fall of the wall, who on a recent autumn day shared a currywurst meal with his wife. Mr. Kohl left the neighborhood years ago but still makes the occasional trek to Konnopke’s.  He’s not the only longtime Berliner who keeps coming back.  On the outside wall of the gold-colored-metal shop hangs a black-and-white postcard picture featuring a much smaller stand in the 1960s (before two rebuilds, in 1983 and 2010).

The tabloids titled the affair the “Currywurst War.”  After six decades on her feet, Ms. Ziervogel prefers worrying about the books and the laws, leaving the day-to-day grind of running the business to her daughter. “We have the fire brigade down the street, so we get those big fire truck sirens blasting by us at least eight times a day,” Ms. Konnopke said. “And then the subways right overhead, the trams, the traffic and the heat. It is physically exhausting.”']","For 43 years, Waltraud Ziervogel has presided over Konnopke’s, the iconic sausage business that her father started in 1930 in what became East Berlin."
Dresden Museum Partly Reopens After Jewelry Heist,2019-11-27,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The Royal Palace museum in Dresden, Germany, reopened to the public on Wednesday, except for the rooms known as the Green Vault, where the police continued to hunt for evidence to help them track down the thieves who broke in two days earlier, making off with 11 rare Baroque jewels. The police said evidence indicated that four thieves had carried out the robbery early Monday, spraying a fire extinguisher in their wake to erase their tracks. The thieves broke an iron gate and a window to enter a room in the Green Vault on the ground floor of the museum. Among the treasures in the Green Vault — founded by August the Strong, prince-elector of Saxony and King of Poland — were several sets of royal jewels. The thieves used an ax to break the security glass and steal three of them — the “Diamond Rose,” “Diamond” and “Queens’ Jewelry” sets — taking a total of 11 entire pieces, parts of two other pieces and several buttons, Dirk Syndram, the director of the Green Vault, said on Wednesday. “These three sets included diamonds in various cuts that date largely from the time of August the Strong and August III,” Mr. Syndram said in a statement. “They were set between 1782 and 1789.” Among the items stolen were a sword with a diamond-encrusted handle, several shoe buckles and buttons made of diamonds, as well as brooches, a hair clip shaped like the sun and parts of a diamond necklace belonging to Queen Amalie Auguste from 1824. The police have appealed to the public for tips but have so far found no trace of the thieves. One piece from the “Diamond” set, a hat clip with a flawless 41-carat gem known as the Dresden Green Diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for an exhibition. Even when in Dresden, the diamond is displayed separately from the rest of the set on another floor of the museum. The theft has raised concerns about security at museums around Germany.  Marion Ackermann, the director of the Dresden State Art Collection, a consortium of museums that holds the treasures of the former royal house of Saxony, has repeatedly defended the collection’s security.  But Germany’s culture minister and the German Museum Association said they would discuss how better to protect the treasures in the country’s museums, while still keeping them accessible to the public.  Eckart Köhne, the association’s president, said in a statement, “The break-in at the Green Vault gives us a reason to re-examine whether the threat level has changed in recent years.” “For this, the museums need assistance from their sponsors, as well as police and security specialists,” he added. A surveillance video released by the police shows two figures, one carrying a flashlight, approaching a display case enclosed in glass. One then bends down, pulls an ax from a bag and repeatedly slams it into a panel of glass, which fragments and gives way. “The case looks like a battlefield,” Mr. Syndram said. The stolen jewels were not insured, and Ms. Ackermann and her team would not give a figure for their value, insisting that their worth lies in their historical and cultural significance as part of an intact set of royal jewels.  Because they are unique, they could not be sold on the open market, she said.  That has led to fears that the pieces will be broken down, the gems re-cut and the gold melted to render them sellable.  “Of course, if the pieces remained intact, the entire world is looking for them and they are not going to find much of a market,” said Chris Marinello, an expert with Art Recovery International, which specializes in finding and recovering stolen art. “Every hour that goes by increases the likelihood that these are going to be broken up and destroyed,” he said, adding that he hoped the authorities would promise a reward for the return of the intact pieces. Art historians and museum directors across the globe have joined in the outrage at the loss from a collection that was hidden to survive the Allied bombing of Dresden at the end of World War II. The treasures were later taken by the Soviet Union, but were returned to the former East Germany in the 1950s. “They bear with them that history,” said Shira Brisman, an assistant professor in art history at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in art produced in German-speaking regions from the period. The objects in the Green Vault collection are signs of power, Ms. Brisman said, artworks that could show off Saxony’s mining wealth, including tin, silver, copper and precious stone, and the skills of its artisans.  “On the one hand, they reflect wealth,” she said. “On the other hand, they reflect alliances.” After its return to East Germany, the collection languished in relative obscurity behind the Iron Curtain for decades, despite their status as the biggest surviving princely art collection in Europe.  The Green Vault was partly destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt after German reunification and opened in 2006. Alan Yuhas contributed reporting from New York.

Suspects in Mormon Family’s Killing Are Arrested in Mexico,2019-12-01,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — The Mexican authorities on Sunday detained several suspects implicated in the massacre of nine members of a Mormon sect in northern Mexico in early November, according to the office of the nation’s attorney general. The detentions came during a joint operation by members of the Mexican armed forces and intelligence agents and followed the detention last month of another suspect living in Mexico City, the attorney general’s office said in a statement, providing no further information about the suspects’ identities, their connection to the murders or the circumstances of their arrests. In his first year in office, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has struggled to articulate a coherent crime-fighting strategy, and to curb spiraling violence and the immense power of organized crime groups. The failure was highlighted by this harrowing incident, which rose above the usual drumbeat of news about bloodshed in Mexico, in part because the victims were women and children and dual American and Mexican citizens. Mr. López Obrador took office last year vowing to remove the military from the streets in the fight against drug trafficking organizations and end his predecessors’ war on drugs. Instead, he promised, he would address the roots of crime by tackling poverty through social development programs and investment — a strategy he refers to as “hugs, not bullets.” On Sunday, speaking at Mexico City’s central square during a celebration of his first anniversary in office, Mr. Lopez Obrador defended his approach. “The federal executive has undertaken a paradigm shift in security,” he declared. Highlighting the challenges he faces, at least 21 people were killed during clashes over the weekend between the Mexican police and gunmen in a town in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. The dead included four police officers, officials said. On Sunday, demonstrators marched through central Mexico City demanding better security and justice for Mexicans. Members of the Mormon family torn apart by the massacre last month participated in the event, local media reported. “We have to work together to find a way to stop the violence,” said Julián LeBarón, a relative of the victims, according to The Associated Press. “If we’re not capable of defending life in our country, we will never be a civilized country much less a free country.” The López Obrador administration is desperate to show gains in its investigation into the killing of the Mormons — three women and six of their children who were members of a fundamentalist Mormon community that took root decades ago in northern Mexico. The group, traveling in three cars, were ambushed on Nov. 4 as they drove through the state of Sonora. In the days after the attack, the authorities floated the idea that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and said they were exploring the possibility that it was related to a conflict between two criminal groups fighting for control of that region of the country. After the massacre, President Trump declared on Twitter that it was time “for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” Last week, Mr. Trump said he planned to designate Mexican drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations, suggesting that he was motivated in part by the number of American deaths attributable to their activities. Some members of the Mormon communities of northern Mexico have also pressed for the designation. Mexican officials — and, broadly, the Mexican people — have bristled at the announcement, with many worrying that it would somehow open the door to American military incursions into Mexico. Mr. López Obrador addressed this concern at his anniversary celebration on Sunday, saying: “We won’t accept any kind of intervention. We’re a free and sovereign country.”']",The announcement did not include details on the suspects’ identities or their connection to the murders. The López Obrador administration is under pressure to curb spiraling violence.
"Suddenly, the Chinese Threat to Australia Seems Very Real",2019-11-29,By Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay,"['CANBERRA, Australia — A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing. A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities. For a country that just wants calm commerce with China — the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth — the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt.  Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing’s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present. “It’s become the inescapable issue,” said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. “We’ve underestimated how quickly China’s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.” American officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others.  In public and in private, they’ve pushed Australia’s leaders to confront China more directly — pressure that may only grow after President Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong. Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia’s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom, a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need.   As a result, the country’s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China. In the most troubling recent case, first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, the Australian authorities have confirmed that they are investigating accusations made by Nick Zhao, an Australian businessman who told intelligence officials that he had been the target of a plot to install him in Parliament as a Chinese agent. Mr. Zhao, a 32-year-old luxury car dealer, was a member of his local Liberal Party branch. He was a “perfect target for cultivation,” according to Andrew Hastie, a federal lawmaker and tough critic of Beijing who was briefed on the case.  He told The Age that Mr. Zhao was “a bit of a high-roller in Melbourne, living beyond his means.” Another businessman with ties to the Chinese government, Mr. Zhao said, offered to provide a million Australian dollars ($677,000) to finance his election campaign for Parliament. But a few months later, in March, Mr. Zhao was found dead in a hotel room. The state’s coroner is investigating the cause of death. In a rare statement, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia’s domestic spy agency, said on Monday that his organization was aware of Mr. Zhao’s case and was taking it very seriously. The Chinese government, however, called the accusations a sign of Australian hysteria. “Stories like ‘Chinese espionage’ or ‘China’s infiltration in Australia,’ with however bizarre plots and eye-catching details, are nothing but lies,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a regular news briefing on Monday. Beijing has similarly dismissed the case that emerged last week, which involves a young asylum seeker named Wang Liqiang. Mr. Wang presented himself to the Australian authorities as an important intelligence asset — an assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who Mr. Wang says is responsible for spying, propaganda and disinformation campaigns aimed at quashing dissent in Hong Kong and undermining democracy in Taiwan. China asserts that he is simply a convicted swindler. On Thursday, a Communist Party tabloid, The Global Times, released video of what it said was Mr. Wang’s 2016 trial on fraud charges, where a young man confessed to bilking someone out of $17,000. Xiang Xin, the man Mr. Wang identified as his former boss, has denied having anything to do with him, or even knowing him. The challenge of the case is just beginning. While some analysts have raised doubts about Mr. Wang’s assertions, elements in the detailed 17-page account that he gave to the authorities as part of an asylum application are being taken seriously by law enforcement agencies worldwide.  Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice detained Mr. Xiang and another executive with the company Mr. Wang said he worked for, China Innovation Investment Limited. Investigators in Taiwan are looking into assertions that their business acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies. Other details in Mr. Wang’s account — about the kidnapping of booksellers in Hong Kong, spying on Hong Kong university students, and the theft of military technology from the United States — are still being examined by Australian officials. “Australia’s peak intelligence agencies are being put to the test,” said John Fitzgerald, a China specialist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. “It’s a tough call, and they cannot afford to get it wrong.” What’s clear, though, is that they are helping to push the public away from supporting cozy relations. Polls showed a hardening of Australian attitudes about China even before the past week.  Now Mr. Hastie, the China hawk and Liberal Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament’s joint intelligence committee, says his office has been overwhelmed by people across the country who have emailed, called and even sent handwritten letters expressing outrage and anxiety about China’s actions in Australia. Questions of loyalty continue to swirl around another Liberal Party member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, who fumbled responses to questions in September about her membership in various groups linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The espionage cases also follow several months of rising tensions at Australian universities, where protests by students from Hong Kong have been disrupted, sometimes with violence, by opponents from the Chinese mainland. Several student activists have told the authorities that they have been followed or photographed by people who appear to be associated with the Chinese Consulate. It has even happened to at least one high-profile former official, John Garnaut. A longtime journalist who produced a classified report on Chinese interference for former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, he recently acknowledged publicly that he had been stalked by people who appeared to be Chinese agents — in some cases when he was with his family. These actions of apparent aggression point to a version of China that Australians hardly know. For decades, Australia has based its relations with Beijing on a simple idea: Let’s get rich together. And the mining companies that are especially close to Mr. Morrison’s conservative government have been the biggest winners.  But now more than ever, the country is seeing that for the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, it’s no longer just about wealth and trade. “The transactions aren’t satisfying them enough; they want more,” said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University. “They want to gain influence over decisions about the further involvement of the United States, about further protestations to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, in the South Pacific, in Taiwan.” Mr. Blaxland, along with American officials, often points out that Australia’s biggest export to China, iron ore, is hard to obtain elsewhere reliably and at the prices Australia’s companies charge. That suggests that the country has more leverage than its leaders might think.  Mr. Hastie, who was recently denied a visa to travel to China as part of a study group that included other members of Parliament, agreed. In an interview, he said the recent revelations were “the first time the Australian public has a concrete example of what we are facing.”  Now, he added, it’s time to adapt. ']","After a businessman said Chinese agents sought to implant him in Parliament, that revelation and other espionage cases have finally signaled the end of a “let’s get rich together” era."
"Shmoo Cake, Persians and Spudnuts: Touring Canada’s Regional Cuisine",2019-11-29,By Ian Austen,"['Dan Bilefsky, my colleague who is based in his hometown, Montreal, looked into a existential threat that has united, sort of, two of the city’s greatest rivals: Fairmount Bagel and St-Viateur Bagel. The threat is the prospect that the city might ban the wood-burning ovens that are a key component of what makes Montreal bagels, at least to their proponents, the world champions of bagels. Those of you who are unfamiliar with Montreal bagels can learn about what distinguishes them from other bagels, the St-Viateur-Fairmount rivalry and the debate over which shop’s doughy circles are the finest by reading Dan’s entertaining story. [Read: A Montreal Bagel War Unites Rival Kings] But I have to share one quotation from the article to give you a sense of the limits of the current collaboration between the shops: “His bagels went to the moon, yeah, sure,” the owner of St-Viateur said of his competitor’s shop. “But the oldest? Give me one iota of proof!” Montreal bagels are just one of many foods associated with a city, province or region. Of course, Montreal and Quebec can also add smoked meat, steamies, sugar pie and poutine to their lists. Some local favorites have made their way across the country. Montreal-style bagels are pulled out of a wood-burning oven 24 hours a day just a few blocks from my house in Ottawa. And a couple of weeks ago when I was out running in Calgary, I passed a shop with signs boasting about its similarly authentic Montreal bagels. But many other food oddities remain stubbornly local. Here, by city or province, is my unquestionably incomplete list of regional dishes. Newfoundland: The most recent newcomer to the confederation is up there with Quebec when it comes to having its own cuisine. Seal flipper pie — think of a chicken potpie but with seal meat — is perhaps the only one from the province that attracts both admirers and critics from animal rights groups. A jiggs’ dinner, a largely boiled meal based around salted beef, offers a more substantial alternative. Many delights from The Rock also rely on the fishery, like fried cod tongues (not actually tongues) and scrunchions (fried salt pork). But Newfoundlanders have also developed a whole school of cooking around waxed bologna, or “the big stick.” Halifax: Once its bars close, Nova Scotia’s capital meets the early morning nutritional needs of its large student population with the donair: spiced ground beef roasted on a spit, sliced and served with a distinctive sauce on a pita. Like Montreal and bagels, which shop produces the finest or most authentic donair is a subject of debate. There also appears to be some questioning of whether a donair is actually different than shawarma or a gyro.  New Brunswick: Fiddleheads, the curly shoots of ostrich ferns, are free for the picking each spring. The province’s tourism authority offers this description of their flavor: “similar to asparagus or artichokes … kind of.” Prince Edward Island: Islanders, please help me out. There appears to be no end to various fish, potato and lobster dishes, but none appear to be obviously of P.E.I. Perhaps potato fish cakes fit the bill, but their popularity and place in its cooking history are unclear. Thunder Bay, Ontario: Bisected by both transcontinental train lines and the Trans-Canada Highway, and also the last port on the Great Lakes, Thunder Bay attracted immigrants from around the world who brought their cooking with them. They included my maternal grandfather, Mike Holavec. Originally from Ukraine, he came to Thunder Bay from Manitoba to work as a logger. Two dishes have emerged from that history. First the dense, egg-rich Finnish pancake. As I wrote in 2015, it really isn’t from Finland but is most likely a variation of something that was served to my grandfather in lumber camps. It is on the menu at several places around town, but Finnish pancakes are most closely associated with the Hoito, a Finnish restaurant that started as a cooperative catering to lumberjacks. Thunder Bay’s other contribution to Canadian cooking is the Persian, an oddly named variation of the cinnamon bun topped with lurid pink icing. Winnipeg: Bannock, of course, is found in Indigenous communities throughout North America. But I associate the ritual of the flatbread served with tea with Manitoba’s capital city and the surrounding area into northwestern Ontario. Winnipeg has at least two dessert obsessions. Imperial cookies are two vanilla biscuits, joined by jam and topped with icing. As with Montreal’s bagels, there are varying opinions about which Winnipeg bakery makes the best ones.  Shmoo, or Schmoo, is Winnipeg’s tall torte based on angel food cake, layered up with whipped cream, caramel and pecans.  Saskatchewan: Even in a Canada that is increasingly divided by region, we can all probably agree that anything made using Saskatoon berries is a treat. While it’s not really a dish, I’ve been in restaurants in Saskatchewan, as well as in Alberta, that offer pirogi as a breakfast side-order option. Lethbridge, Alberta: This one may be more of a food obituary. The Crazy Cakes Bakery claimed to be the last shop in Canada still producing spudnuts: doughnuts made with potato flour. But about a month ago, it shut down. Vancouver: The city of sushi is the home of the B.C. roll, which contains barbecue salmon skin and a sweet sauce or mayonnaise. And there’s an Indian pizza scene in Vancouver that involves toppings like butter chicken and chili chicken tikka. Of course, a short ferry trip from Vancouver can take visitors to Nanaimo, British Columbia, home of that no-bake, namesake wonder dessert, the Nanaimo bar. In the interest of not offending anyone from that city, I will not go into the old joke about what’s in a Nanaimo bar. As mentioned, this list is woefully incomplete. Neither I nor several friends or relatives could come up with anything specifically associated with Toronto, for example, despite the city’s proliferation of restaurants.

Iraqi Prime Minister Resigns in Deepening Political Crisis,2019-11-30,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['NAJAF, Iraq — Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq formally submitted his resignation to Parliament on Saturday and asked lawmakers in a televised national address to quickly agree on a successor. But Mr. Mahdi’s resignation may not spell the end of the turmoil that has racked the nation over the past two months. Parliament, which met on Sunday and voted to accept his resignation, has yet to agree on an alternative. “The resignation of the government is a method of peaceful handover of power in democratic systems,” Mr. Mahdi said in his brief speech, adding that the government had tried to meet the demands of the country’s widening protest movement. Protests driven by anger over political corruption and Iran’s influence over Iraqi politics — coupled with the government’s violent response — had put Mr. Mahdi under intense pressure to step down. At least 400 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the United Nations and hospital sources.  The formation of a new government could go quickly, but it will more likely take weeks, if not months. That realization quickly dissolved protesters’ initial jubilation over Mr. Mahdi’s announcement on Friday that he would step down.  Mr. Mahdi and his ministers would still serve in a caretaker government until President Barham Salih requests that the largest bloc in Parliament name a new prime minister and that person’s ministers are then approved by a majority. History shows that agreeing on a prime minister can be a long, arduous process of balancing competing political factions.  It became so protracted in 2018 that Iranian officials helped set up the current government, brokering an agreement that brought in Mr. Mahdi and Mr. Salih as well as the Parliament speaker, Mohammed al-Halbousi.  One significant question is whether Iran will play the same role this time around. Since Iraqis are now openly expressing resentment toward Tehran, its direct involvement might be a liability.  Across the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq, as well as in the capital Baghdad, the chant “Out, Out Iran, Baghdad Remains Free” is part of the daily protests. If one thing is clear, the fact that Iraq is majority Shiite and so is Iran does not mean that Iraqi and Iranian Shiites have shared views.  In Najaf, a city that hosts several million Iranian pilgrims annually at its shrines and where Iranian clerical students train in its religious universities, the resentment of Tehran’s insertion into Iraqi affairs is running so high that protesters burned the Iranian Consulate there on Wednesday night.  Three days later, the walls of one office in the complex were still faintly warm from the flames. A wall of file cabinets had been burned to a shell and the papers that had been inside were little more than a pile of ashes. The door had been ripped off a safe.  In the courtyard, the smell of burned wires and rubber drifted in the air as half-blackened documents blew in the autumn breeze and a single, charred sandal lay on its side. A carton of lemons, most of them covered with ash, rolled about on the tiles.  The complex’s metal-frame buildings were so warped by the heat and looked so ruined that while they had not burned to the ground, their reconstruction would be a major undertaking.  No one was inside when the complex was set afire because the only two Iranian employees left through the back door when security guards realized they would not be able to hold off the protesters, said Abu Rusol, one of the guards.  Just a few hundred feet away, the shrine of Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, a cleric assassinated in 2003, was a scene of tension on Saturday, with protesters facing off against Shiite militiamen protecting the site. Mr. al-Hakim, although an Iraqi, spent years in exile in Iran and was part of the opposition to Saddam Hussein. Now his links to Iran  have made his shrine a target of demonstrators.  Skirmishes continued at the shrine late Saturday afternoon. Protesters, who were largely unarmed, were coming into emergency treatment tents with gunshot wounds, said Muahin Yasseen, a fifth-year medical school student who had volunteered to help.  The United States — though it has sought political reforms in Iraq, especially on corruption — had wanted Mr. Mahdi to remain in office, worried that his departure could lead to even more extensive bloodshed. Mr. Mahdi, however, has been unable to control the violence and the pressure on him to step down has built for some time. He resisted until the latest spate of killings and a looming threat of a no-confidence vote in Parliament.  On Friday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, urged Parliament to stop procrastinating or “the country will pay a high price, and everyone will regret it.” It was in the hours after Mr. Sistani’s message that Mr. Mahdi announced his intention to resign. ']","Anger over corruption and Iran’s influence on the country has driven weeks of unrest in Iraq’s streets. But choosing a successor may be a long, arduous task. "
Iraq Prime Minister Says He Will Resign Amid Protests,2019-11-29,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['The announcement comes after demonstrators set fire to the Iranian Consulate and hundreds died in antigovernment unrest. By Alissa J. Rubin BAGHDAD — Pressured by an expanding protest movement and a rising death toll, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said Friday that he would submit his resignation to Parliament, taking the country into greater uncertainty and possibly months of turmoil ahead.  Mr. Mahdi’s resignation would make him another prominent political casualty in a wave of recent antigovernment unrest that has swept the region.  Deep-seated anger over corruption and Iran’s influence in Iraqi politics are the major drivers of the protests across Iraq. In Lebanon, citizen rage over that country’s dysfunctional government pushed its prime minister to announce his resignation in October. And in Iran itself, the authorities scrambled to crush protests and riots in 100 cities set off a few weeks ago by an abrupt increase in fuel prices — the deadliest unrest to hit Iran in years. The prime minister’s announcement was a particularly bitter blow for Iran, which had handpicked Mr. Mahdi and on Wednesday suffered an attack on its consulate in the southern city of Najaf. The building was severely damaged by firebombs thrown by protesters. Iran has repeatedly sought to prop up Mr. Mahdi since he became prime minister in 2018, according to leaked Iranian intelligence reports obtained by The Intercept and shared with The New York Times. Mr. Mahdi worked closely with Iran while Saddam Hussein was in power, and for years he served as a member of a large Shiite party tied to Iran. He became an independent in 2017, but the leaked cables suggest he kept close ties to Iran in recent years. Mr. Mahdi’s announcement on Friday initially prompted jubilant celebrations at the main protest site, Tahrir Square in Baghdad, but the happiness faded quickly, tempered by mourning for people killed in the protests and an acknowledgment there will be little immediate change.  “This is the first step,” said Hiatt Mehdi, 60, a widow with seven children, including a son who has been demonstrating for the last 35 days without coming home. She had come to Tahrir Square to congratulate her son that his efforts seemed to have been rewarded by Mr. Mahdi’s announcement.   “But it’s really not enough.” she said.  Mr. Mahdi’s decision was announced a day after at least 40 protesters were killed in a violent crackdown following the attack on the Iranian Consulate that fanned demonstrations across Iraq’s Shiite south.  At least 354 have been killed since antigovernment protests began at the start of October and more than 8,000 have been wounded, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights said. Its most recent report notes “the actual total is likely to be higher.” Many of those killed, like one boy, Hussein Abid, 16, who was shot Thursday near Al Ahrar bridge in Baghdad, look even younger than their age; they are largely unarmed and come from poor families. He came from Sadr City, a vast Shiite slum in eastern Baghdad.   The protests and accompanying violence have occurred almost entirely in Baghdad and the Shiite south of Iraq, where mostly young people and poorer people have taken to the streets demanding sweeping changes in the political system. They want to see an end to the political parties, which demand kickbacks for licenses, contracts and jobs.  Even young people applying for low-level positions like security guards or elementary schoolteachers who are not affiliated with the correct party might be asked to pay $5,000 for a state job, a large sum for most Iraqis. In Iraq, government positions are viewed as the only secure jobs and the private sector remains small.  Many of the parties that dominate Parliament are close to Iran and it is an open secret that Iranian officials helped to set up the current government last year, brokering an agreement that brought in Mr. Mahdi, President Barham Salih and the house speaker, Mohammed Al-Halbousi.  Earlier this month Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force, Iran’s elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, brokered an agreement to keep Mr. Mahdi in office for at least six weeks, but the protests and criticism from Shiite religious leaders in Najaf cut short Mr. Mahdi’s reprieve.  In Iran, where officials were already furious over the Najaf consulate destruction, Mr. Mahdi’s announcement only added fuel to their suspicions that Iran’s enemies in the Middle East were behind it. The recent turmoil in both Iraq and Iran was part of a “coordinated regional plot to destroy the relationship between our two countries,” said Iran’s ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi, a former Quds Force commander. “Iranians should know that this is by no means what the Iraqi government, politicians or officials want,” Mr. Masjedi told Iranian state television. “It’s not what the Iraqi people want.” In a statement issued by his office on Friday, Mr. Mahdi said he was stepping down so that the government could “reconsider its options” and “preserve the blood of its people, and avoid slipping into a cycle of violence, chaos and devastation.” Pressure has been building for some time on the prime minister, who was also facing the growing threat of a humiliating parliamentary no-confidence petition. He said his decision was prompted after Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, on Friday urged the parliament to “reconsider its options” and to stop procrastinating, or “the country will pay a high price and everyone will regret it.” Washington had wanted Mr. Mahdi to remain in power, fearing that if he were swept away — as some protesters have wanted — it would lead to chaos, more extensive bloodshed or even a renewed civil war. The United States is interested in maintaining Iraqi stability as a bulwark against Islamist extremists.  Still, the United States is seeking changes in the Iraqi political system to root out corruption and create an electoral system less dominated by sectarian political parties. Those parties have tended to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people. By offering his resignation, Mr. Mahdi would be taking the first step to prompt a change in the government. But the potential loomed for protracted delays in forming a new government. Mr. Mahdi, who a month ago expressed a willingness to step down but held off, has not yet submitted his resignation, though he is expected to follow through this time.  The Parliament could accept Mr. Mahdi’s resignation as soon as Sunday, when it meets after the Muslim weekend. That would leave Mr. Mahdi and his ministers in a caretaker government until a new prime minister is named by President Salih.  Under the Iraqi constitution that should take place quickly but in the past agreeing on a prime minister has proved to be a tortuous process of balancing competing political factions that, in Mr. Mahdi’s case, took a year.  The prospect of delay helps explain why the initial euphoria on the street Friday was diminished by the acknowledgment among the protesters that without far broader changes, Mr. Mahdi’s resignation would contribute little to their long-term goal of transforming the Iraqi state.  “Adil Mehdi’s resignation means nothing,” said Abdul Mutalib, 26, a pharmacist.  “This is just like a drug, an injection to anesthetize the people,” Mr. Mutalib said. “It doesn’t bring any change.” The protesters have called for a complete overhaul of the system that would push many of the parties out of the Parliament, depriving them of lucrative ministries. But it remains to be seen if they can persuade lawmakers to vote to disband a system that has served their interests.  President Salih is pushing for an election law that would achieve those goals. But the version he sent to Parliament has already been amended into something that seems likely to perpetuate the current system, legal experts say.  For many of the protesters, who have already spent weeks on the street, the events on Friday were just one stop on what they expect to be a long road, said Abu Mohammad, 45, a construction worker and father of six.  “We don’t know who Adel Abdul Mahdi is, he did not come through elections,” he said. “We want all of the government to resign, we don’t want parties, so this step of Adil means nothing, they are trying to fool us and then they will replace him with someone worse.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.']",
Espionage and Interference? Australia Grapples With Its China Relationship,2019-11-29,By Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay,"[' The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue begins with an excerpt from a news analysis by Damien Cave and Jamie Tarabay. A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing. A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities. For a country that just wants calm commerce with China — the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth — the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt. Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing’s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present. “It’s become the inescapable issue,” said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. “We’ve underestimated how quickly China’s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.” American officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others. In public and in private, they’ve pushed Australia’s leaders to confront China more directly — pressure that may only grow after President Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong. Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia’s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom — a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need. As a result, the country’s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China.

"In Afghanistan, Trump Creates Confusion Over U.S. Policy on Taliban",2019-11-29,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — After abruptly axing nearly a year of delicate peace talks with the Taliban in September, President Trump put the negotiations back on the front-burner this week in a similarly jolting fashion by seeming to demand a cease-fire that his negotiators had long concluded was overly ambitious. Despite a sense of relief at the prospect of resuming talks to end the 18-year conflict, Western diplomats and Taliban leaders were scrambling to figure out whether Mr. Trump had suddenly moved the goal posts for negotiations.  They were particularly confused by his remarks, made during an unannounced Thanksgiving visit to Afghanistan, that the United States was once again meeting with the Taliban to discuss a deal, but that “we’re saying it has to be a cease-fire.”  Demanding a cease-fire would amount to a big shift in the American position and require a significant new concession from the Taliban — one that the Americans have little leverage to extract. For much of the yearlong talks, the Taliban and the United States were fundamentally on the same page: The Taliban wanted the Americans out of Afghanistan, and Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to end what he has called America’s unending wars. But agreeing upon the details of a deal proved complicated.  In the agreement the two sides were on the verge of finalizing before Mr. Trump pulled the plug, the best the American negotiators could get the Taliban to consent to was some  reduction in violence. Discussions on a comprehensive cease-fire were relegated to future talks between the Taliban and Afghan leaders — only after the United States had pledged, and begun, to withdraw its troops. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested the Taliban position had shifted. “They didn’t want to do a cease-fire, but now they do want to do a cease-fire, I believe,” he said. “And it will probably work out that way. And we’ll see what happens.” The Taliban seemed surprised by Mr. Trump’s declaration. While the group’s negotiators have held informal meetings with United States diplomats in recent weeks about ways to go back to the table, on Friday their leaders said their original position on a cease-fire had not changed. “The Americans walked away from the negotiating table, and now the ball is on their side — it is up to them to come back if they want to solve this and get the document to signing and to the stage of implementation,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban’s negotiation team, said in an interview. “Our positions remain the same.” It’s unclear how American negotiators could get the Taliban to agree to a cease-fire now, when they were not able to do so earlier. The American military has already begun scaling back its presence in the country, giving negotiators even less leverage than they had before. Last month, the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, said the number of troops had been reduced by 2,000 over the past year.  Mr. Trump, on Thursday, said he was “bringing down the number of troops substantially.” For the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, Mr. Trump’s statements were welcome. For months, Mr. Ghani had unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Americans not to give away an American troop withdrawal without a cease-fire because that would leave his government even more vulnerable.  The government has already been weakened by being excluded from the talks so far because the Taliban refuse to engage before an American troop withdrawal. Now, suddenly, the American president gave Mr. Ghani’s position a boost at a difficult time for him, when he is stuck in a bitter fight over his re-election in a disputed vote, which is tipping the country to crisis.  Mr. Ghani met with Mr. Trump at the Bagram Air Field on the eve of large protests by supporters of his rival, Abdullah Abdullah. Much of the Afghan capital was under a lockdown by security forces on Friday morning as thousands marched to a roundabout behind the presidential palace demanding fraudulent votes be thrown out.  Mr. Abdullah accuses the country’s election commission of including 300,000 questionable votes in favor of Mr. Ghani. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah are partners in a coalition government brokered by the United States when a similar disputed election between the two went to a stalemate in 2014. The current power dispute dividing the country has added to the complications of resuming the peace efforts. The hope is that peace talks would eventually lead to direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan leaders over the political future of the country after the United States commits to withdrawing its remaining troops, currently about 13,000 or fewer. Keeping the peace process alive after Mr. Trump canceled talks in September has required quiet, delicate diplomacy, including work that resulted in a prisoner swap and some reduction in violence. Mr. Trump’s latest interjection in what has been a tedious diplomatic balancing act will once again have his negotiators scrambling to try to pull off what many Western officials have described as an unrealistic goal. The Taliban see a cease-fire before the signing of a deal for the end of the American military presence as an existential issue. They believe they will not be able to rally their forces again if they ask their fighters to stop fighting and then the deal breaks down. But the government of Mr. Ghani has said negotiating the future cannot happen under the barrel of a gun, demanding a cease-fire as a precondition to any talks. When Mr. Trump called off the talks, the Taliban realized they had pushed their hand too far by continuing to launch attacks just days before what was expected to be a signing of the deal. In recent weeks, American diplomats persuaded the group to reduce large attacks in the Afghan capital significantly as part of the prisoner swap that saw the release of an American and Australian hostage in return for senior Taliban leaders.  But delivering a comprehensive, declared cease-fire is always going to be difficult internally for a movement that is trying to maintain unity as it negotiates potentially divisive issues. One Western official aware of the latest peace developments said he had not seen a tangible shift in the Taliban’s position on a cease-fire during the period the talks were called off. The official expressed concern that if the Taliban were forced to reject Mr. Trump’s apparent demand of a cease-fire to keep their own ranks united, that could further complicate the formal resumption of the negotiations. “There’s probably now some work for U.S. diplomats to do to clarify to the Taliban what did the imprecise words actually mean, and whether or not there is a change in position,” said Laurel Miller, a former United States diplomat who is now the Asia director of the think tank International Crisis Group.  “The U.S. has been looking for something in the realm of the reduction in violence,” she added, “but the idea that the U.S. is on the same page with Ghani on cease-fire being a precondition — I don’t see that at all.” Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.']",The president said stalled talks with the militant group were back on and called for a cease-fire — something his negotiators had deemed unrealistic. 
China Cracks Down on Fentanyl. But Is It Enough to End the U.S. Epidemic?,2019-12-01,By Steven Lee Myers,"['When things go wrong, those in power often promise to make it right. But do they? In this series, The Times investigates to see if those promises were kept. XINGTAI, China — An online pharmacy advertising itself as a seller of “high purity, real pure” fentanyl still responds right away to potential customers. “Which products do you want to buy,” a salesperson replied within a minute to an inquiry in English on WhatsApp, the encrypted messaging service. But when contacted from an American telephone number and asked about the availability of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid fueling an epidemic killing tens of thousands of Americans a year, the seller demurred.  “I don’t sell any more.” Until recently, much of the illicit fentanyl that found its way to the United States came like this: easily ordered online from a source in China and seamlessly shipped by international delivery companies, including the United States Postal Service.  Fentanyl sourced from China accounted for 97 percent of the drug seized from international mail services by United States law enforcement in both the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now, China’s Communist government is taking steps to stop the flood, as the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, promised President Trump he would do. After the two leaders met in Buenos Aires at the Group of 20 summit at the end of last year, the White House released a statement saying that “President Xi, in a wonderful humanitarian gesture, has agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance.” What We Found Some six months later, China did exactly that. As a result, the large, freewheeling and mostly unregulated fentanyl industry that had operated in a gray area of Chinese law appears to have stopped selling the drug for export — or at least as openly as hundreds of suppliers once did. Some of the distributors, who still can be easily found in online searches, claimed to be complying with the new rules banning the overseas sale of synthetic opioids.  Others appeared to have shut down their operations, disconnecting numbers which had previously reached salespeople offering to mail the drugs to the United States — no questions asked.  China’s new focus on shutting down the trade has meant shipments of fentanyl to the United States have declined significantly in the last year, according to Chinese officials, citing figures from the United States Customs and Border Protection agency. The American agency did not dispute that drop. “China’s control over fentanyl substances is becoming stricter and stricter,” said Yu Haibin, the deputy director of the country’s National Narcotics Control Commission. Following a tightening of drug controls that took effect May 1, the government put 91 manufacturers and 234 individual distributors under “strict supervision,” warning them not to export fentanyl or related drugs, like carfentanil, according to a government report released in September. It claimed to have increased inspections and arrests in 13 cities and regions where pharmaceutical companies have proliferated. One of them is Xingtai, an industrial city about 250 miles south of Beijing, where a court earlier this month convicted nine people of smuggling fentanyl into the United States. The convictions capped an investigation that began in 2017 with a tip from American drug-enforcement agents. The accused ringleader received a suspended death sentence; two others were sentenced to life in prison. The case was one of three investigations in which the Chinese authorities have been cooperating with American law enforcement, Chinese officials said. The investigations have come after a torrent of criticism that Chinese officials were lax toward — or even complicit in — a major supply chain fueling the fentanyl crisis in America.  China’s harshest critics have even accused the country of deliberately flooding the market as revenge for the Opium Wars of the 19th century, though there is no evidence of that. As recently as August, Mr. Trump had chastised the Chinese leader on Twitter for not keeping his promises to get tough on fentanyl. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy called the recent convictions “a positive step.” Experts and officials in the United States warned, however, that it was far too soon to declare a victory in China’s fight against fentanyl.  The market for the drug — which the Chinese like to point out has always been largely American — appears insatiable. For a sense of how the crisis has exploded: In the 2019 fiscal year that ended in October, American customs agents seized 1,154 kilograms of fentanyl, or 2,545 pounds, compared with 31 kilograms, or 70 pounds, in 2015. Fentanyl is cheap, easily synthesized in a lab and more addictive than heroin. That means the financial rewards will remain high enough to entice those willing to break the law, especially in a large and poorly regulated chemical industry like China’s. So manufacturers and distributors that had operated in the open may simply shift their operations underground. “The scale of China’s under-regulated industries allows for minimally trained technicians with access to the proper inputs to follow simple synthesis steps while avoiding oversight,” the authors of a new report on fentanyl by the RAND Corporation wrote. “China’s pharmaceutical and industrial chemical industries are large and beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement.” What We Found Even so, the steps China has taken to reduce the flow of fentanyl are real, according to experts and officials on both sides of the Pacific. China has some of the strictest drug laws in the world, allowing capital punishment against major producers and traffickers. Until recently, however, loopholes in legislation and enforcement allowed the production of synthetic opioids like fentanyl to skirt the attention of the authorities. In China, as in the United States, fentanyl can be legally prescribed and is used as an anesthetic in surgery and for severe pain relief. Because of its potency, its production is strictly controlled by law. Until this year, however, China’s laws did not cover new, chemical variants of fentanyl that were constantly being produced to sidestep existing legal restrictions. Manufacturers could simply adjust the chemical structure slightly and create a new analogue of the drug, not yet banned. In this gray area of the law, production in China soared. “It’s just like water: They’re finding the gaps and the cracks,” Bryce Pardo, an associate policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and a lead author on the organization’s report, said in an interview. In April, the Chinese government moved to plug those legal holes. It announced it would place all variants of fentanyl — as a class — on the list of controlled substances, rather than individually adding each new version of the drug to the banned list after it had hit the streets. With the export controls that are applied to drugs on the list, the fentanyl variants that had fallen into the legal gray area before were now explicitly banned from being sold abroad. Tang Jianbin, a lawyer in Beijing who specializes in criminal drug cases, said the move was a significant concession to American demands. The country even had to pass a new law allowing it to designate the entire class of synthetic opioids as controlled substances. “This legal adjustment is an innovation in our country,” Mr. Tang said.   China made this move in the middle of its protracted trade war with the United States, and it may have been done to help resolve the acrimonious — and continuing — dispute. Drugs entering China from the West have a dark historical resonance in the country, which is still bitter over the forced importation of opium by the British in the 19th century, the cause of two wars and the ceding of Hong Kong. And Chinese officials have long bristled at any criticism they were negligent on the law enforcement front and were always quick to point out that fentanyl was a uniquely American problem. Opioid use — and abuse — is far higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world, and there are plenty of other sources of the drug beyond China. Mr. Yu, the narcotics agency deputy director, cited statistics from the United States Customs and Border Protection showing that of the 536.8 kilograms of fentanyl seized between October 2018 and March 2019, only 5.87 kilograms, or just over 1 percent, was shipped from China.  “From these statistics it is clear that China is not the main source of fentanyl substances in the United States,” Mr. Yu said at a news conference in Xingtai following the verdict against the nine fentanyl dealers. What We Found American officials acknowledge a decline in shipments from China, but like Mr. Trump, keep pressing the country to do more. “While it appears that the direct shipment of fentanyl-related substances from China to the United States has declined in recent months, this is only one of many measures that the United States looks to for indicators of progress,” the customs bureau wrote in a statement responding to questions about the Chinese claims. “The most important measure of progress is the reduction of American lives lost to these drugs.” One area where American officials would like to see more action is in pursuing manufacturers and distributors that detectives and prosecutors have linked directly to overdoses in the United States, often after painstaking investigations tracing the trail of fentanyl to its origin. In 2018, the Justice Department announced an indictment of a father and son, Zheng Guanghua and Zheng Fujing, who had operated a company called Qinsheng Pharmaceutical in Shanghai. The company appears to have closed — or gone underground — but the two men are believed to be at large.   It was not clear if the American case against them was one of the other two cases where officials said Chinese and American investigators are cooperating. Mr. Yu, when asked, declined to discuss those cases. There is still plenty of fentanyl in the United States that was shipped from China before the new law took effect.  This summer, the authorities in Virginia seized 30 kilograms of fentanyl, enough “to kill over 14 million people,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The fentanyl was ordered from a vendor in Shanghai in April of last year. While China’s crackdown has put significant restraints on what had been an unbridled export environment, the murky and still under-regulated nature of the chemical industry makes it difficult to shut down illicit production entirely without a more sustained effort by the Chinese authorities, according to Mr. Pardo of the RAND Corporation. “They’re not doing everything they can,” he said, “but they’re making an effort on some level.”  The Takeaway: A promise kept, but a devastating drug problem persists.

The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in December,2019-11-29,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for December, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Marriage Story’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 One of the best films of the year — and perhaps the best film of Noah Baumbach’s career — “Marriage Story” may be a tear-jerker about the excruciating process of divorce, but there’s a warmth and humanity to it that suggests a light at the end of the tunnel. Adam Driver gives a searing performance as a New York theater director who is caught flat-footed when his wife (Scarlett Johansson), an accomplished actress, hires a tough attorney (Laura Dern) and threatens to resettle with their eight-year-old son in Los Angeles. As he counters with attorneys of his own, the two enter into a protracted battle that drains them of money and emotional stability. ‘6 Underground’ Starts streaming: Dec. 13 Netflix has loaded up November and December with serious awards contenders like “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story” and “The Two Popes,” but it’s also willing to burn through a nine-figure budget for “6 Underground,” a blockbuster-sized movie piped straight into your living room. Directed by Michael Bay, whose name is associated with sleek-but-stupid commercial action hits like the “Bad Boys” and “Transformers” franchises, the film stars Ryan Reynolds as the leader of a vigilante squad composed of men and women who have faked their own deaths to stay off the grid. That freedom from the law and accountability allows them to take down the world’s worst criminals without having to follow the rules. ‘The Two Popes’ Starts streaming: Dec. 20 Reminiscent of the historical two-handers “Frost/Nixon,” this thoughtful and surprisingly funny drama imagines a series of conversations between the arch-conservative Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Argentine reformer who would become Pope Francis. As Benedict and Francis, respectively, Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce have a feisty chemistry as they argue in earnest over how best to address the issues and scandals that face the Catholic Church in the 21st century. But the two develop a fascinating bond despite their contentiousness, particularly over a shared passion for soccer. The script by Anthony McCarten (“Darkest Hour”) can seem contrived and reductive at times, but it gives maximum latitude to the actors, who are a riveting study in contrasts. ‘All the Money in the World’ Starts streaming: Dec. 25 Due for release less than two months after Kevin Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct, “All the Money in the World” got the bulk of its notoriety for Ridley Scott reshooting all of Spacey’s scenes with Christopher Plummer in the role and still hitting a Christmas release date. Plummer’s presence as J. Paul Getty winds up dominating the film, which recounts the 1973 kidnapping of Getty’s 16-year-old grandson and the tragedy that inevitably resulted when the miserly entrepreneur refused to pay the ransom. Michelle Williams is also good as the boy’s mother, who does everything she can to plead with Getty to do the right thing. ‘Home For Christmas’ Starts streaming: Dec. 5 There’s no shortage of holiday options on Netflix every December, but settling on the right ones for family viewing is always a challenge. While “A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby” will likely draw the most attention this month, it might be better to take a chance on international fare like “Home For Christmas,” a six-episode series from Norway that looks to add a little substance to the usual Yuletide rom-com fare. Ida Elise Broch stars as a 30-year-old who’s so tired of being pressured into finding a boyfriend that she lies to her family about having one. That puts her in the predicament of having to find someone to bring home to meet them in 24 days. ‘V Wars’ Starts streaming: Dec. 5 Based on Jonathan Maberry’s comic book series, “V Wars” offers a scenario that sounds like the vampire equivalent of the “Sudden Departure” in “The Leftovers,” only instead of a small fraction of the population disappearing, about five percent of humans turn into vampires. Ian Somerhalder of “The Vampire Diaries” returns to the subgenre as a doctor who investigates a fast-spreading virus that triggers a long-dormant gene in humans. As he works to reverse the virus and save a friend who’s been afflicted by it, the vampire community grows in power and ambition, setting up a global conflict between vampires and humans. ‘The Confession Killer’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 Henry Lee Lucas was by far the most prolific serial killer in history …  according to Henry Lee Lucas. Convicted of murdering 11 people, Lucas gained notoriety for confessing to hundreds more, incentivized by special privileges like steak dinners, strawberry milkshakes and other treats for helping investigators close unsolved cases. The true-crime series “The Confession Killer” digs into the scandal that erupted when Lucas was exposed as a fabulist and the families of victims were seized by anger and newfound uncertainty. The case would transform procedural awareness of false confessions, but at a scandalous cost. ‘Glow Up’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 There seems to be a reality competition show for every trade imaginable — the addictive glassblowing series “Blown Away,” for example, premiered on Netflix last summer — so the BBC One import “Glow Up,” about makeup artists, seems like an inevitability. Much like “The Great British Baking Show,” the tone of “Glow Up” is more about camaraderie than friction, emphasizing the artistry of well-intentioned contestants who try their hand at a variety of looks. They apply makeup from the subtle to the avant-garde, proving they can do original red-carpet looks as well as the prosthetic transformations of science fiction. ‘Triad Princess’ Starts streaming: Dec. 6 It’s a common romantic scenario for a young person to buck up against the demands of his or her powerful family, but the Taiwanese series “Triad Princess” brings martial arts and mob violence into the picture. Eugenie Liu stars as the daughter of a triad boss whose fighting skills land a job as a bodyguard for a famous actress, but bring her into conflict with her father, especially when she meets a dashing suitor from that world. By defying his wishes, she threatens to bring mob business out of the shadows and into the open, where the intense scrutiny of the press and fans await. ‘Michelle Wolf: Joke Show’ Starts streaming: Dec. 10 After working as a writer and occasional performer on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” and “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Michelle Wolf had a dramatic breakout year in 2018, when she delivered a notoriously scabrous performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner and hosted the fitfully brilliant but short-lived Netflix talk show “The Break with Michelle Wolf.” Now Wolf returns to Netflix with an hourlong comedy special that focuses on gender inequality, the excesses of “woke” culture and the indelicate mating habits of wild animals. ‘Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer’ Starts streaming: Dec. 18 In late 2014, Luka Magnotta, a murderer from Scarborough, Ontario, was convicted of killing Lin Jun, a Chinese international student, and mailing his hands and feet to elementary schools and political offices in Vancouver. The conviction followed a two-year manhunt that finally led to his arrest at an internet café in Berlin, where he was reading news about himself. But as the documentary series “Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer” reveals, the search for Magnotta was aided by animal activists enraged by videos he posted of himself torturing animals. It’s an immensely disturbing story, but also a fascinating example of crowdsourced justice. ‘Soundtrack’ Starts streaming: Dec. 18 To date, producer Megan Ellison and her Annapurna Pictures have been known more for developing audacious movies by directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and Kathryn Bigelow, but the company is putting its prestigious name behind this new musical series from “Quantico” creator Joshua Safran. Nothing much is known about the story, which brings together a disparate group of lonely-hearts in modern-day Los Angeles, but the musical element gives it novelty on television, which hasn’t often found success with the genre. It also has a terrific cast, packed with veterans who haven’t gotten enough screen time lately, including Madeleine Stowe, Campbell Scott and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. ‘The Witcher’ Starts streaming: Dec. 20 Looking to fill the large-scale fantasy vacuum left by the end of “Game of Thrones,” Netflix has invested heavily in at least two seasons of this adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s best-selling book series. Henry Cavill stars as Garalt of Rivia, a hulking loner who was raised as a monster hunter and who’s determined to slash his way through the kingdom without aligning himself with other human beings. His plans change when he joins forces with Princess Ciri (Freya Allan), a Chosen One type who requires his protection from treacherous evil, but proves a quick study in learning his “witcher” techniques and gaining power of her own. ‘John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch’ Starts streaming: Dec. 24 Following his uproarious comedy special from last year, “Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,” John Mulaney is debuting a Christmas Eve special that attempts, in his words, “to recapture the magic of that bygone television era when children sang songs about their feelings with celebrity guests on funky outdoor sets.” Mulaney and two of his collaborators on the nonfiction parody series “Documentary Now,” director Rhys Thomas and composer Eli Bolin, are evoking television’s wholesome variety-show past with “John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch,” which cycles through sketches and original musical numbers with children ages 8 to 13 and hip celebrity guests like David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne and Jake Gyllenhaal. ‘Lost in Space: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Dec. 24 The revived “Lost in Space” premiered to great hype and muted reviews in early 2018, despite an excellent cast and a promising initiative to dial down the campiness and turn the Robinsons’ adventures into a “Lost”-like story of interplanetary intrigue. But the bones of a good show are still present, with Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as would-be Alpha Centauri colonists Maureen and John Robinson, and Parker Posey as the diabolical June Harris, who actively sabotages the Robinsons and other colonists after their ship is breached and they try to survive on a mysterious planet. The second season opens with the Robinsons stranded on an ocean planet without their Robot for help.

London Attack Spurs Heroism and Questions About a Prisoner’s Release,2019-11-30,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — It was midafternoon when Mike Finnerty, who sells cheese at his Borough Market shop just south of London Bridge, realized that something was wrong. An unusual flow of people had suddenly gathered in front of his stall, he said, and they seemed “alarmed.” What he did not know was that a man dressed in black and armed with knives had gone on a murderous rampage in a grand meeting venue called Fishmongers’ Hall on the opposite side of the bridge, just north of the Thames River. But Mr. Finnerty sensed the danger on Friday, he would later tell the BBC and write on Twitter. So he and another employee rushed some customers — a couple from Vancouver and a young American man — into a cheese refrigerator and locked the door. Then he called the police. The “operator said it was an attack and not to move,” he wrote. He said he could hear shouting outside the door, but he and the group huddled together in “pretty close quarters.” Susan Vinn, 57, was smoking outside her office adjacent to Fishmongers’ Hall about 2 p.m. when she saw people running over the bridge. And Craig Heathcote, a filmmaker, was walking there when, he told the British broadcaster Sky News, someone said:  “Get out of the way. Someone’s got a knife.”  On Saturday, Britain grappled with the aftermath of another terrorist attack in the heart of London just as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, claimed responsibility. Two people were killed and at least three were wounded in Friday’s assault.  In a statement, ISIS said the assailant had carried out the attack in its name and added that he had done so “in response to calls to target coalition countries.” The phrasing indicates that the attacker was inspired by the group’s ideology and refers to a speech by a former spokesman, who urged followers to carry out attacks in any way they could, including stabbing. This attack, the police said, had been carried out by a man wearing a fake bomb vest, a former prisoner who had been convicted of terrorism offenses in 2012. The authorities identified the suspect as Usman Khan, 28, of Stafford, England, who was released from prison last year, apparently after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. He was part of a gang that plotted in 2010 to plant explosives in the toilets of the London Stock Exchange, the authorities said, and possibly attack other British landmarks and prominent figures like Boris Johnson, then the mayor of London. The rampage on Friday, near the same bridge where a terrorist attack by a group men in June 2017 left eight people dead and dozens injured, raised questions about the efficacy of Britain’s prison rehabilitation system and about the early release from prison of Mr. Khan, despite warnings from the judge at his trial about the threats he still posed. In his judgment, Lord Justice Brian Leveson said there was “no doubt that anyone convicted of this type of offense could legitimately be considered dangerous.” In February 2012, Mr. Khan was given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum term of eight years, but the Court of Appeal replaced it in 2013 with a 16-year fixed-term sentence. He was released in half the time. The attack occurred two weeks before a pivotal general election, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, is under pressure. He told reporters on Saturday that he wanted to “toughen up” sentences. “I have long argued that it is a mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early,” Mr. Johnson said.  On Saturday, the Parole Board, which carries out risk assessments on prisoners to determine whether they can be safely released, said in a statement that it had not reviewed his case. Mr. Khan appeared to have been released automatically, “on license” — meaning under certain conditions — “without ever being referred to the board,” it said. On Sunday, the Ministry of Justice said it had began an urgent review of the license conditions of convicted terrorists released from prison. Along with questions about the case came praise for the bystanders who had charged the suspect as he made his way along the bridge. One man wielded a fire extinguisher, video footage on social media showed. Another brandished an ornamental whale tusk that had been torn from the wall of Fishmongers’ Hall, according to local reports.  The assailant was wrestled to the ground in the street outside the grand hall. A man wearing a suit and tie can be seen removing a  knife and walking away from the suspect. He was later identified as an off-duty member of the transport police. Thomas Gray, a tour company manager, told reporters that he saw one of the knives taped to Mr. Khan’s hands. “I stamped on his left wrist while someone else smacked his hand on the ground and then kicked one of the knives away,” Mr. Gray told Sky News. “I went to pick up the knife when I heard a cop say, ‘He has got a bomb.’” The bomb turned out to be fake. Footage showed officers, guns drawn, pulling bystanders off Mr. Khan. Then, Mr. Khan was shot and killed by the police.  The trauma of the encounter, which played out as workers looked down from huge office windows and as onlookers shared video of the chaos, led Ms. Vinn to ask: “Why London Bridge anyway? It’s horrible, I don’t get it.” She said that for a country that has experienced terrorist attack after terrorist attack since 2017: “It’s become ambient. It makes you worried about your safety on a day-to-day basis, especially here, around London Bridge.”  Mayor Sadiq Khan of London praised the bravery of bystanders. “What’s remarkable about the images we’ve seen,” he said, “is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them.”  The assault threw into stark relief the risks in attempting to rehabilitate those convicted or suspected of terrorism. On Saturday, Chris Phillips, a former head of the country’s National Counter Terrorism Security Office, said Britain was releasing people while they were still radicalized. “We’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalized jihadi criminals walk about our streets,” he told the Press Association news agency. David Videcette, a former antiterrorism detective and author, added that Britain must “look at sentencing and rehabilitation, as we have a huge problem with terrorist prisoners that are being released, and with those that want to come back from Syria.” Usman Khan was attending an event at Fishmongers’ Hall for former prisoners and their mentors in a prison education program, Learning Together, set up by Cambridge University. He was believed to have been invited to share his experiences as a former prisoner.  “We believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge,” said Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.  One of those who rushed to aid victims, according to news reports, was a man convicted of murder who had been on day release. Among those killed, according to the BBC and the news site Cambridge Live, was a Cambridge graduate, Jack Merritt, the course coordinator of Learning Together. The police did not immediately confirm his identity. But a man who said he was Mr. Merritt’s father, David, posted the news on Twitter before deleting it. “My son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily,” the post read. “R.I.P. Jack: you were a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog.” On Saturday, three people remained hospitalized, and one person who been critically wounded was in stable condition, the National Health Service said in a statement. The attack came only weeks after the British government lowered its terror threat warning level to substantial from severe as Britons had begun growing cautiously accustomed to a life less frequently disrupted by deadly episodes. In 2017, when London Bridge and the nearby Borough Market were the subject of an attack, there was also a suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena, an attack on Westminster Bridge and at the gates of Parliament, and an assault at a north London mosque. For a government seeking re-election in two weeks’ time, the issue is sensitive. Before the 2017 general election, the opposition Labour Party had linked terror attacks to police cuts made by a Conservative-led government. On Saturday, Brandon Lewis, the security minister, did not say whether he considered the attack to be a failure by the authorities, but he sought to rebut suggestions that cuts to the police had played a role. He told Sky News that both funding and the number of officers devoted to counterterrorism had “consistently increased since 2015.”  Mr. Videcette, the former antiterrorism detective, said that many lower-level offenders were now up for release, and to monitor them, the authorities had to keep close watch on those with whom they associate. The problem, he said, was “if they don’t reconnect with the individuals we expect them to” and  opt instead for a low-tech, lone attack. “There is a real danger,” he said, “with those who have not reached the pinnacle of what they are going to be but aspire to be a well-known terrorist, or perhaps aspire to be martyred by a police officer in a terror attack” Elian Peltier contributed reporting from London, and Rukimini Callimachi from Bucharest, Romania.']",The deadly attack near London Bridge has put the efficacy of Britain’s prison rehabilitation system under scrutiny.
"14,600 Sheep Trapped on a Capsized Ship. ‘We Have Saved 254.’",2019-11-29,By Kit Gillet,"['BUCHAREST, Romania — After five frantic days of searching, there are no more living animals. The president of a Romanian animal welfare organization made the grim announcement on Friday, ending an effort to rescue more than 14,000 sheep trapped on a cargo ship that overturned after leaving port, an episode that has raised fresh questions about transporting live animals by sea. The sheep had been destined for a buyer in Saudi Arabia when the vessel, the Queen Hind, partly capsized on Sunday. The ship’s crew of 21 was quickly rescued, but thousands of animals remained on board. For days, rescue workers searched for surviving sheep. On Sunday, they were able to pull 33 living animals from the waters. Over the following days, as they searched the vessel, more were found alive among piles of sodden carcasses. “It was kind of a nightmare, but otherwise we didn’t have any chance to reach the live animals,” said Kuki Barbuceanu, the president of the animal welfare organization, known as ARCA.  “We’ve checked all of the ship, and unfortunately there are no more,” Mr. Barbuceanu concluded Friday, saying the rescue operation had saved 254 sheep out of 14,600 aboard. The General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations confirmed the end of the rescue effort. The operation had been made difficult by the unstable conditions onboard, officials said, and by the fact that the animals, which can weigh upward of 130 pounds, had to be brought out of the ship, one by one, through a single point. On Tuesday, rescuers started cutting holes in the sides of the vessel to reach less accessible areas after receiving permission from the vessel’s owner. This allowed the crew to find more animals, but the number of rescues dwindled as the days wore on. On Thursday, just 24 were found alive. Rescuers halted their efforts on Thursday evening, but the search resumed on Friday after officials decided to go ahead with a dangerous cut into a compartment. “The rescue mission wasn’t a simple one, or a risk-free one,” said Raed Arafat, head of the Department of Emergency Situations under the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs. He said that more than 100 people a day were involved in the operation, including members of the water rescue agency. The cause of the ship’s capsizing is still a mystery. On Monday, Romania’s transport minister, Lucian Bode, ordered an investigation, saying “we cannot allow such events to be repeated.” The ship is registered in Palau, and news reports have said it was managed by a Romanian company, but officials have not confirmed the ownership. The disaster has raised fresh questions about transporting live animals by sea. An estimated two million sheep and one million cattle are transported each year from European Union member states to the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. Romania is one of the main exporters.  Animal rights advocates say that the journeys are often too long, regulations aren’t up to scratch and the rules are often flouted. “The vast majority of journeys, despite what the European Commission says, involve breaches of the law,” said Peter Stevenson, a veteran lawyer and chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming, an animal welfare organization based in Britain. “Enforcement of regulations is terrible,” Mr. Stevenson said, adding that he had written to the Romanian agricultural minister asking for details about the pre-loading inspection of the ship. “That a ship should capsize quite near to the port suggests that the inspection was not carried out properly,” he added. Francesca Porta, the farm animals program officer at the advocacy group Eurogroup for Animals in Brussels, said that one of the main problems was that vessels were often not built for the journey. “They are old vessels that are converted to transport animals,” Ms. Porta said. The Queen Hind, she added, had been built in 1980 and reauthorized by Romanian officials in March. The vessel had suffered engine failure in the Sea of Marmara near Turkey in 2018, news reports said. Days before Sunday’s accident, Eurogroup issued a report laying out a strategy to reduce and replace the transportation of live animals with a meat-and-carcass-only trade.  “In the end, we believe that this trade must be stopped,” the group’s director, Reineke Hameleers, said on Thursday. Romania clashed with Brussels once this year on the issue of live animal transportation. In July, the European commissioner in charge of health and food safety called on Romania to halt the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because of concerns that high temperatures could cause the animals to suffer in transit.  Romania allowed the export to proceed, nonetheless. “Utter disasters like we saw a few days ago are not common, but just the day-to-day suffering of animals being transported these long distances is huge,” said Mr. Stevenson, the lawyer with Compassion in World Farming. Now that rescue attempts on the Queen Hind have concluded, the next issue will be righting the ship so that crews can remove the carcasses and incinerate them, Mr. Arafat said.  “This will be a very hard operation, to clean the ship of thousands of dead sheep inside that drowned and have started to decay,” he said. There is also the question of the surviving animals, which had been destined for the dining table. Mr. Barbuceanu, of the animal welfare organization, said its officials had contacted the Saudi buyer to ask him to donate the sheep to an animal welfare organization, but have not received a reply.  He envisions the few hundred remaining sheep spending the rest of their lives on a farm.  “They deserve that,” he said. “It is the least they deserve.” ']","On Friday, officials ended a search-and-rescue operation off the coast of Romania. Crews are preparing to remove thousands of carcasses from the vessel."
Irish Ex-Soldier Who Married ISIS Fighter Is Arrested,2019-12-01,By Ed O'Loughlin,"['DUBLIN — A former Irish soldier who converted to Islam, traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State and married a British jihadi fighter, was arrested at Dublin Airport on Sunday for questioning about possible terrorism crimes, having been deported from Turkey. The former soldier, Lisa Smith, 38, was deported with her 2-year-old daughter on a Turkish Airlines flight with the cooperation of the Irish government, after she had been detained by Turkish forces during their recent incursion into Syria.  A small number of Irish diplomatic personnel and a contingent from the Irish Army’s elite Ranger Wing flew to Turkey to escort Ms. Smith and her daughter home. They were met at the steps of the plane by detectives from the police section that is responsible for internal security affairs in Ireland. Photographs showed a woman descending the steps, her face hidden by a pink blanket. Ms. Smith was questioned at a police station in the south of Dublin, according to the authorities. Several European governments have resisted the repatriation of citizens who joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, because of the potential security risk. But Dublin has said it accepted the right of Ms. Smith and her daughter — an Irish citizen by virtue of her mother’s nationality — to return to Ireland. Around 30 Irish citizens traveled to the Middle East as jihadis, Irish newspapers reported, and most of those are believed to have been killed or have moved elsewhere. Ms. Smith and her daughter were discovered living in the Ain Issa refugee camp this year. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday that all Irish citizens who were in distress or danger overseas were entitled to consular help. “We first became aware in March of the presence of Lisa Smith and her child in a detention camp in Syria, where the conditions were extremely poor,” the department said. “UNICEF warned governments that conditions for children there were dire, with an extremely worrying child mortality rate.” “Of primary concern to the government in this case was the welfare of a young child who was caught in the middle of a war zone,” the department added. Ms. Smith joined the Irish Defense Forces as a young infantry recruit and transferred five years later to the air corps, where she worked for another five years as a flight attendant on the official government jet, assisting government ministers including Bertie Ahern, then the prime minister.  She converted to Islam in 2011 while still serving in the Irish Defense Forces. She resigned that year, shortly after giving a newspaper interview about her decision to convert, saying she had become disillusioned with a lifestyle of drink, drugs and partying. She is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2015, despite being on a police watch list as a potential Islamist radical. She married a British jihadi and conceived their daughter. The father is believed to have been killed in the fighting in Syria. Her daughter is now in the care of Ms. Smith’s relatives in her native town, Dundalk. After she traveled to Syria, she reappeared this year with her infant daughter at a Kurdish-controlled displacement camp for wives and children of Islamic State fighters. Interviewed there by a BBC journalist, she said that she wanted to return to Ireland and denied having used her weapons training on behalf of ISIS or having been involved in any acts of violence or terrorism. “If you asked me am I going to hurt anyone? No,” she said. “Have I any intentions to do anything? No. I’m just interested in trying to bring my daughter up and get her educated. I don’t even think I’m radicalized. All I know is I just came to an Islamic State and I failed.” Under Irish law, citizens can, in principle, be prosecuted for terror offenses committed abroad, but strong evidence would have to be produced linking the defendant to specific crimes. In the BBC interview, she denied a report that she had trained girls to become ISIS fighters, saying she never picked up a gun while in Syria. “Even if I wanted to go fighting, I tried to go fighting, they wouldn’t let me,” she said. The Irish police said in a statement said that Ms. Smith had been arrested under a catchall provision that is generally used to hold and question people suspected of internal subversion or terrorist activity. In contrast to Ireland, Britain has taken a harder stance on returning ISIS fighters or adult relatives. It has stripped the citizenship of Shamima Begum, 20, who ran away at the age of 15 to join ISIS in Syria and had three children — all of whom died. The government said she would never be allowed to return to Britain. But last month, Britain allowed several unaccompanied children of Britons to be repatriated from former Islamic State territory in Syria. Last month, a federal judge in the United States ruled that Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State in 2014, is not an American citizen, blocking her wish to return home to her family in Alabama.']","Lisa Smith, 38, and her 2-year-old daughter were deported by Turkey from a Syrian displacement camp and landed in Dublin on Sunday."
"U.S. Drone Killed Afghan Civilians, Officials Say",2019-12-01,By Farooq Jan Mangal and Fahim Abed,"['KHOST, Afghanistan — An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims.  Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home. The United States military command in Afghanistan confirmed a strike in Khost, saying that three Taliban fighters had been killed. But the military said the strike occurred on Thursday, Nov. 28. “We are aware of the allegations of civilian casualties and working with local authorities to determine the veracity of these claims,” Col. Sonny Leggett, a military spokesman, said. Gulmir Jan, a local tribal leader, said that hours after Malana had given birth, her health took a turn for the worse and her in-laws rushed her to the clinic.  (Like most Afghans, the woman used one name.) A sister-in-law was among those in the car with her.  “Their vehicle was completely destroyed,” Mr. Jan said. Claims of civilian casualties by American or Afghan strikes often come from parts of the country that are hard to gain access to, and accounts are difficult to verify. In September, officials and residents in southern Helmand Province said airstrikes had targeted a wedding convoy, killing 40 people. But military officials disputed that account and days later released information that said a senior leader of Al Qaeda had been killed in the strikes. Civilian casualties reached a record in the third quarter of 2019, according to the United Nations, with 1,174 civilians killed and 3,139 others wounded. In its latest report, the United Nations said most of the casualties had been caused by the Taliban and other militants, but earlier in the year, it blamed Afghan and coalition forces for far more casualties than the Taliban. President Trump, during an unannounced visit with American troops in Afghanistan last week, said that he had reopened peace negotiations with the Taliban, though the declaration appeared to have caught the militants by surprise. He expressed the demand of the Afghan government for a cease-fire as a condition for peace talks, a major shift in American policy. In the deal they were near finalizing in September, before Mr. Trump abruptly called off talks, United States diplomats had concluded that the chances of achieving a cease-fire before signing a withdrawal agreement was unrealistic.  The Taliban have continuously rejected calls for a cease-fire before a deal with the Americans, saying that they would discuss the possibility only in talks with the Afghan side that would begin after any agreement with Americans. The strike in Khost came at a time of widespread violence across the country, with the deadliest attacks occurring in the north and south. In northern Kunduz Province, the Taliban attacked security outposts on the highway connecting Kunduz with Takhar Province on Sunday, killing 11 soldiers in several hours of fighting, said Safiullah Amiri, the deputy of the provincial council. The militants also pulled three police officers off a bus traveling from Kabul to northern Badakhshan Province, executing them on the road in Kunduz.  In Faryab Province, the Taliban captured a security outpost in the Ghorziwan District on Saturday, killing seven members of the security forces and wounding two others. In southern Helmand Province, a convoy of Afghan security forces was struck by a roadside bomb in the Marja District on Saturday, killing the commander of a border regiment, Gen. Zahir Gul Muqbil, and wounding a journalist, according to Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand. A group of journalists had been traveling with the regiment commander to cover a military operation to clear Marja, which has been under siege by the Taliban for several years. Farooq Jan Mangal reported from Khost, Afghanistan, and Fahim Abed from Kabul, Afghanistan. Mujib Mashal contributed reporting from Kabul.']","The strike on a car killed all five onboard, including a woman who had given birth hours before, relatives and officials said."
How an Anti-Brexit London District Could Help Boris Johnson Triumph,2019-11-30,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — The Labour Party canvassers gathered after dark outside a tube station in Pimlico, a pocket of central London that, by all appearances, should be fertile terrain. Nearly three-quarters of the surrounding district voted to stay in the European Union, among the strongest “Remain” votes in Britain, putting the pro-Brexit Conservatives at risk in a seat they had held since the district lines were drawn in 1950. But the district, the Cities of London and Westminster, with its rows of white stucco townhouses and crowded housing projects, may now become a parable on the left for why Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a commanding position less than two weeks before the election. Brexit has sent tremors through the British political system, shaking up the traditional left-right, class-based divisions. While the Conservatives have capitalized on the upheaval, building a coalition of pro-Brexit voters across regional and class lines, the left has so far struggled to win converts and overcome its own divisions. Mr. Johnson is on course for a 68-seat majority in Parliament, a major new polling analysis showed, with Labour hemorrhaging pro-Brexit seats in working-class sections of middle and northern England and a fractured left failing to win significant numbers of anti-Brexit seats in the south that seemed ripe for the taking. With Mr. Johnson still deeply unpopular, undecided voters may yet swing Labour’s way. Recent polls suggest the Conservative lead has begun to shrink, putting many seats with razor-thin margins potentially in play. But Labour’s leftist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has lately dug in against accusations of anti-Semitism in the party and criticisms that his Brexit policy was incoherent. Setting off from the tube station last week, the scores of Labour canvassers were quickly confronted with a treacherous political rip tide: Labourites turned off by Mr. Corbyn; die-hard Remainers who, fed up with Labour’s ever-evolving stance on Brexit, had decamped to the staunchly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats; and even former Remainers who now resignedly conceded that democracy demanded Brexit be done. “It’s desperate times — it’s very difficult to know how to vote,” Philip Rudge, 73, who lives in the east of the district, said a few days earlier. “I’ve been Labour all my life, but I’ve been dismayed to see the infighting and back-stabbing and so on. Corbyn’s not a leader. Labour will have to win an election against the leadership.” This London district, known informally as the Two Cities, is in many respects a mirror image of pro-Brexit, working-class Labour strongholds in northern England being targeted by the Conservatives. Stocked with bankers and lawyers who once made up the Conservative base, but who want to stay in the European Union, the Two Cities is precisely the kind of seat that Brexit could help deliver to a left-leaning party. But with Mr. Corbyn failing to ignite the enthusiasm he did in 2017, and some right-wing anti-Brexit voters drifting back into the Conservative fold, the widely prophesied new coalition of the left has not materialized. In the Two Cities, the left is also suffering from a second problem: the anti-Brexit vote being split between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, a smaller, more centrist party that has stormed back from obscurity by arguing for lawmakers to summarily reverse Brexit. Anti-Brexit activists are pleading with people to vote tactically — meaning to vote for whichever Remain party stands the best chance of winning a given seat — and polls suggest that Britons are doing so in greater numbers than before, for good reason. While there are roughly half a dozen parties in Britain’s Brexit-battered Parliament, only one can win any given seat: When supporters of a given cause split their votes between several candidates, they risk letting an opponent come through the middle. But disagreements on the economy and foreign policy still run deep on the left. And with the Liberal Democrats neck-and-neck with Labour in districts like the Two Cities, that has left even the most calculating anti-Brexit voters confused about what to do.  “I would say I’m a tactical voter normally, but it’s not clear at this stage what the tactic should be,” said Fern Watson, 36, who is opposed to Brexit, bracing against the cold in the Barbican, a brutalist estate on the eastern edge of the district. “I don’t really see either Labour or the Lib Dems as my natural political home, and I think a lot of people of my age and education level feel the same.” She had visited three different websites purporting to tell people how to vote in individual precincts to stop Brexit. One of them said Labour, and the other two the Liberal Democrats. Current polling suggests the Remain vote will split in the Two Cities, allowing a weakened Conservative candidate to hold the seat. Across the country, were only 120,000 more Remainers to vote tactically, one analysis showed, that would be enough to defeat Mr. Johnson on Dec. 12.  But for now, in crucial London districts, the race has become a battle of bar charts, as both Labour and the Liberal Democrats try to prove they are best positioned to win three-way fights for seats. Labour has printed reams of them showing how it cut into the Conservatives’ lead in the 2017 election, capitalizing on the same shifts that have turned American cities into progressive bulwarks. But the Liberal Democrats, relying on more recent polling, have distributed their own sheafs of charts with exactly the opposite message. Couple that with the hazy mechanics of how a left-wing coalition would actually try to stop Brexit, and Remain voters are stuck in a confusing predicament. “If you are a Leave voter, the route to your destination is now really clear and simple,” said Rob Ford, a politics professor and the editor of “Sex, Lies and Politics: The Secret Influences That Drive our Political Choices.” “Whereas if you’re on the Remain side, what’s the route to your desired destination? It’s as clear as the channel on a foggy day right now.” Remain voters are torn by Mr. Corbyn’s cautious, some would say muddled, Brexit policy, in which he would negotiate a new exit deal with Brussels and then put it beside Remain in a public vote in which he himself would stay neutral. One voter, Philip Jeremy, 60, asked about Labour’s Brexit policy, said bluntly: “Corbyn doesn’t have one.” So desperate is Mr. Jeremy not to see either major party steering the country that he said he wanted the election to deliver no clear signals at all. “I prefer a hung Parliament, just so none of them do anything too drastic,” Mr. Jeremy said.  Sitting as it does at the heart of London, the Two Cities district covers not only Buckingham Palace and Parliament but also the well-mannered homes of many senior lawmakers, making it a trophy scalp for the opposition. But it also has considerable areas of poverty, where allegiances to Labour are strong and its message should resonate: The party has focused heavily on health care, housing, climate change and income inequality. Those policies have drawn some pro-Brexit voters into the fold, like Jalil Abdul, 75, who has lived for four decades in Walden House, a public housing block in Pimlico that had been targeted for redevelopment by a 28-year-old billionaire. “This year, I like the Labour Party,” Mr. Abdul said, “because for the last three years the Conservative Party has failed at doing anything.” But polls suggest many anti-Brexit Conservatives are sticking by Mr. Johnson, not out of love and admiration for him as much as fear and loathing for his opponent, Mr. Corbyn. “We have a choice of one of two prime ministers, either Boris, or Jeremy Corbyn,” said Christopher Wyke, 64, a Conservative who lives and works in the City of London, the financial district, and who himself supports Brexit. “If you vote for anybody but the Conservatives, you risk getting Corbyn, so there’s no choice. Even people who are Remainers, they still don’t want Corbyn. He’d be infinitely more dangerous.” And the Liberal Democrats have alienated some voters who might otherwise be amenable to their centrist economic policies by taking a stark position on Brexit: revoking it altogether, without a public vote. Even anti-Brexit Labourites are no longer a shoo-in to vote against the Conservatives. Gordon Nardell, the Labour candidate, broke off from the party activists outside the tube station last week to knock on some doors alone. The first answer seemed to startle him: a middle-aged man who said he was a longtime Labour supporter and backed Remain in 2016, but now wanted Mr. Johnson to get Brexit done. “The vote was to leave, so you know, recognize the vote,” the man said. “To me, once you vote, that’s it — you either accept it, or if you don’t accept it, democracy means nothing.”']","With a big but divided pro-European vote, one of Labour’s most glamorous election targets risks becoming a symbol of opposition campaign failure.

Students Fainting From Hunger in Venezuela’s Failing School System,2019-11-30,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Isayen Herrera,"['BOCA DE UCHIRE, Venezuela — Hundreds of children filed into their school courtyard to hear a local Catholic bishop lead prayers for their education.  “We pray for the youths who are on the streets and can’t come to school,” said Bishop Jorge Quintero, addressing the Augusto D’Aubeterre Lyceum school in the beach town of Boca de Uchire on a steamy morning in October. “There are a lot of them.” By the end of the 15-minute ceremony, five children had fainted and two of them were whisked away in an ambulance. The faintings at the primary school have become a regular occurrence because so many students come to class without eating breakfast, or dinner the night before. In other schools, children want to know if there is any food before they decide whether to go at all.  “You can’t educate skeletal and hungry people,” said Maira Marín, a teacher and union leader in Boca de Uchire. Venezuela’s devastating six-year economic crisis is hollowing out the school system — once the pride of the oil-rich nation and, for decades, an engine that made the country one of the most upwardly mobile in the region. These schools in the past provided children even in remote areas with a solid shot at the country’s best universities, which in turn opened doors to top American schools and a place among Venezuela’s elite. [Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.] Hunger is just one of the many problems chipping away at them now. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country in recent years, depleting the ranks of students and teachers alike. Many of the educators who remain have been driven from the profession, their wages made nearly worthless by years of relentless hyperinflation. In some places, barely 100 students show up at schools that once taught thousands. The collapse of the education system in Venezuela is not only condemning an entire generation to poverty, but risks setting the country’s development back decades and severely stunting its growth potential, experts and teachers say.  “An entire generation is being left behind,” said Luis Bravo, an education researcher at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. “Today’s education system doesn’t allow children to become meaningful members of society.” The government stopped publishing education statistics in 2014. But visits to more than a dozen schools in five Venezuelan states and interviews with dozens of teachers and parents indicate that attendance has plummeted this year.  Many schools are shuttering in the once-wealthy nation as malnourished children and teachers who earn almost nothing abandon classrooms to scratch out a living on the streets or flee abroad. It is a major embarrassment for the self-proclaimed Socialist government, which has long preached social inclusion. The situation is in sharp contrast to countries that Venezuelan leaders have held up as role models — Cuba and Russia — both of which have managed to shelter the primary education system from the worst effects of a comparable downturn in the 1990s. Students began skipping school in Venezuela shortly after President Nicolas Maduro came to power in 2013. A fall in the price of the country’s main export, crude oil, combined with Mr. Maduro’s ill-timed effort to double down on price and currency controls sent the economy into a recession from which it has not yet emerged. Some Venezuelan children are staying home because many schools have stopped providing meals or because their parents can no longer afford uniforms, school utensils or bus fares. Others have joined parents in one of the world’s biggest displacement crises: About four million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, according to the United Nations. Thousands of the country’s 550,000 teachers did not show up to classes when schools reopened in September, according to the national teachers’ union, ditching their $8 a month wages to try their luck abroad or in Venezuela’s booming illegal gold mines. In Venezuela’s most-populous state of Zulia, up to 60 percent of about 65,000 teachers have deserted in recent years, according to estimates by Alexander Castro, head of the local teacher’s union. “They tell us that they prefer painting nails for a few dollars than work for a minimum wage,” Mr. Castro said. To keep schools going, the remaining teachers often teach all of the subjects or combine different school years in one classroom. Nearly all of the one dozen schools visited have slashed working hours; some open for only a day or two a week. In the village of Parmana in Venezuela’s central plains, only 4 out of 150 registered students attended school in October. The four students, of varying ages, sat in the same dilapidated classroom without electricity, practicing everything from the alphabet to algebra as the school’s sole remaining teacher tried to encourage them with a dejected smile. The rest of the village’s children have joined their parents in the fields and fishing boats to help feed their families. In the country’s second biggest city of Maracaibo, a sign outside a dilapidated school without electricity recently read: “Please come to classes, even without uniforms.” The children ask teachers at the entrance if there is food before deciding whether to come in. Maracaibo’s biggest school no longer has any functioning bathrooms. It was designed for 3,000 students; only 100 now show up. Half of the teachers didn’t return to work after the summer holidays to a school in the town of Santa Barbara outside the capital of Caracas, forcing the principal to enlist parent volunteers to keep the classes going. On the other side of the capital, in the town of Rio Chico, most of the rooms in a local school are boarded up for lack of students and teachers. When the remaining pupils arrive, they first ask the whereabouts of the school’s cook, the teachers said. Mr. Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez, made the expansion of public education one of the pillars of his popular “21st Century Socialism” campaign.  For a decade until 2013, the country made steady improvements in school enrollment thanks to generous school meals and handouts of food, utensils and cash to parents and children. Mr. Chavez built hundreds of new schools. Mr. Chavez’s populist policies, however, had focused more on the quantity of students in school rather than the quality of the education. Then, as the country’s coffers ran dry, his government’s educational progress unraveled. As attendance collapsed, Mr. Maduro continued to claim his government was focused on education spending despite the “brutal economic war” waged by his enemies. “In Venezuela, not one school has closed or will ever close, not one classroom,” the president said in a televised address in April. “We will never deny access to education.” To boost the ranks of teachers, Mr. Maduro in August promised to send thousands of the ruling party’s youth members to the classrooms. Education experts say few of these untrained activists will add any pedagogical value or even make it to schools. At the same time, Venezuela’s pool of real teachers is drying up. The number of graduates at Venezuela’s main teacher training center, the Libertador Experimental Pedagogical University, fell 70 percent from 2014 to 2018. Venezuelan teachers have been among the worst affected by the country’s economic collapse, as gross domestic product shrank by two thirds since 2013 and minimum wages fell to $8 a month.  Mr. Maduro’s de facto dollarization of the economy this year allowed many public employees in Venezuela to supplement their official salaries in nearly worthless local currency, by charging in dollars for their services.  His backdoor liberalization of Venezuela’s controlled economy, however, brought little benefit to public schoolteachers in poor communities, whose pupils’s families have little access to foreign currency. In Boca de Uchire, the Caruto family has stopped sending its nine children to a nearby school when the cafeteria doesn’t open. “I can’t send them to class hungry,” said José Luis Caruto, a 36-year-old unemployed father of two. His sister, Yuxi Caruto, 17, was the last in the family to drop out from school, discouraged by the unaffordable bus fare. She tried taking up studies again at a local community center, but its teachers stopped showing up after two weeks of classes. She now spends her time taking care of her 1-year-old son. “I want to learn to do the math and read and write rapidly. I’m scared that when my son grows and starts asking questions, I won’t know how to respond. But right now, we don’t even have enough to eat.” Sheyla Urdaneta contributed reporting from Maracaibo, Venezuela.']",
Hong Kong Police End 2-Week Campus Siege,2019-11-29,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The police returned control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s campus to school officials on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most intense periods of conflict since protests began to engulf the city earlier this year.  The police, who arrested hundreds of people during their two-week siege of the campus, said they found no protesters there during a final search on Friday morning. Investigators found nearly 4,000 firebombs on the campus over the past two days, as well as other explosive items and bottles of corrosive liquids, the police said. The siege, which was punctuated by days of clashes between the police and protesters, ended quietly as university officials resumed control of the shattered campus on the southeastern side of the Kowloon Peninsula. There will not be “any ceremony or event to shake hands or stuff like that,” Chow Yat-ming, an assistant police commissioner, said Friday morning before officers left the campus. The protests began in June over legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. It has continued over other issues, including calls for expanded elections and an investigation into the police’s use of force. Hong Kong universities became the centers of especially large protests this month after the death of a student, Chow Tsz-lok, who fell from a parking garage during a police operation. The Chinese University of Hong Kong was occupied by protesters for five days in mid-November, and several other schools saw large demonstrations. Many campuses cut their semesters short because of the unrest. At Polytechnic University, students who took up their protest there on Nov. 11 were later joined by militant demonstrators who were determined to keep the police out, fortifying their position with firebombs, bricks and large slingshots. On Nov. 17, the police threatened to use lethal force against the demonstrators and warned that those caught could be charged with rioting, which can carry a lengthy prison sentence. Protesters also set fire to tollbooths near the campus, leading to the two-week closure of a major tunnel linking the Kowloon Peninsula with Hong Kong Island. Polytechnic University and the streets around it saw large-scale clashes between riot police officers and protesters who were trying to help others flee the besieged campus. The police fired more than 1,400 tear gas rounds on Nov. 18 alone, as large numbers of protesters tried to break through the police cordon around the school. Protesters hurled bricks and firebombs at the police, and at one point an armored police vehicle was engulfed in flames. One officer was hit in the leg with an arrow. Some protesters managed to escape the campus by jumping fences when the police were not watching. In one dramatic moment, a few rappelled onto a roadway and were taken away by people on motorcycles. Others tried but failed to escape through sewers. “I felt anxious and powerless back then, because some of my friends were stuck inside and I didn’t how I could help those detained there,” Ernest Ho, a 24-year-old student at City University of Hong Kong, said Friday. “We also didn’t know what would happen inside, as we couldn’t contact them very easily.  “I felt depressed when they tried to escape,” he said. “They fled as if they were refugees. However, they are Hong Kong people.” University officials said Friday that the campus was still unsafe, despite the removal of dangerous materials, and that it would remain closed until further notice. A police spokesman, Kwok Ka-chuen, said 1,377 people had been arrested during the siege of the campus. Citywide, more than 5,800 people have been arrested in connection with the protests since early June, according to the police. The protests quieted dramatically in the days before Sunday, when elections were held for district councils across the city. Pro-democracy candidates dominated the vote, which had been seen as a referendum on the protest movement, taking 87 percent of the seats.  On Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that authorized sanctions on officials deemed responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong. Demonstrators in Hong Kong celebrated that legislation with a peaceful gathering Thursday night. In the Central district, where in recent weeks office workers and others have held lunch-hour demonstrations in support of the protest movement, hundreds of people gathered around midday Friday and spilled onto the roads. Police officers fired pepper spray and arrested one man, the public broadcaster RTHK reported. Ezra Cheung and Elaine Yu contributed reporting.']","The police found no protesters during a final search of Polytechnic University, the site of some of the most violent clashes the city has seen this year."
Wealthy Businessman Charged in Murder Case That Rocked Malta,2019-11-30,By Andrew Higgins,"['VALLETTA, Malta — More than two years after a car bomb killed Malta’s best-known investigative journalist, prosecutors in the Mediterranean island nation on Saturday charged a wealthy Maltese businessman with complicity in her murder and other crimes. The arraignment of the businessman, Yorgen Fenech, a member of one of Malta’s most prominent and richest families, capped a tumultuous week in which a long-stalled investigation into the murder of the journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, suddenly picked up pace, ensnaring senior members of the government and Malta’s business elite. Mr. Fenech, 38, who is suspected of paying three contract killers to carry out the murder, pleaded not guilty. He was arrested on Nov. 19 while trying to flee Malta aboard his yacht. Maltese military personnel halted the vessel as it set out to sea from a marina built by Mr. Fenech’s family conglomerate, Tumus Group, and forced it to return to port. The killing in October 2017 caused outrage across Europe, putting a harsh spotlight on Malta, the smallest member of the European Union and a country denounced as a “mafia state” by Matthew Caruana Galizia, the journalist’s oldest son. Speaking after Mr. Fenech’s arraignment on Saturday evening, Mr. Caruana Galizia said it was “surreal and horrifying” to sit in court just a few feet from a man suspected of ordering and paying for the murder of his mother, who was 53 when she died. In a statement read outside the courthouse in Malta’s capital, Valletta, family members demanded the immediate resignation of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, saying that only his departure would allow a “free and full investigation.” Maltese news media outlets reported on Friday that Mr. Muscat planned to announce his resignation “imminently,” but by late Saturday night he had not done so despite widespread suspicions that some of his close associates in government may have been involved in the murder plot. Earlier on Saturday, protesters gathered in the capital for the latest in a series of small but noisy demonstrations demanding that the prime minister step down. They chanted, “Out, out, out!” and waved signs reading “Enough corruption” and “Blood is on your hands.” No evidence has come to light linking the prime minister to the plot against Ms. Caruana Galizia, who was a fierce critic of Mr. Muscat and his associates in the governing Labour Party. But police investigators have in recent days questioned his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and other associates regarding the case. Earlier this week, Mr. Fenech had offered to supply information linking them to the murder if he was pardoned. Mr. Schembri resigned on Tuesday, along with two ministers who are also suspected of possible involvement in, or knowledge, of the plot. None have been charged. At a hearing attended by Ms. Caruana Galizia’s parents, her three sons and her three sisters, Mr. Fenech stood impassively in a charcoal gray business suit as the charges were read: complicity in murder, membership of a criminal organization and a charge related to an illegal explosion. They carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. As recently as a few weeks ago, it appeared that the murder inquiry would never proceed beyond three professional criminals who were arrested in December 2017. They were accused of planting a bomb in the journalist’s car and then detonating it by cellphone as she drove away from her family’s home on a country road. The three men had no obvious reason to want Ms. Caruana Galizia dead, and answers to why she had been killed and who ordered the attack remained stubbornly elusive. All of that began to change recently when the police stumbled on a suspected middleman in the plot who was arrested in November in connection with a separate case. Fearing for his life, he gave information about Ms. Caruana Galizia’s murder in return for immunity and protection. He named Mr. Fenech as the paymaster and mastermind of the murder plot. Mr. Fenech is part owner of companies that received a 450 million euro concession — almost $500 million — to build a controversial power plant that Ms. Caruana Galizia had written about extensively. She also wrote about a mysterious company called 17 Black that she believed was a conduit for kickbacks. After her death, Mr. Fenech was revealed to be the company’s owner.']",
Two K-Pop Stars Sentenced to Prison for Rape,2019-11-29,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Two K-pop stars were sentenced to prison on Friday for raping women who were too drunk to consent to sex, and one of the men was also convicted of making videos of the assaults and sharing them with friends online.  The Seoul Central District Court sentenced the singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young, who recorded and shared the videos, to six years in prison. His friend Choi Jong-hoon, a former boy band member, was sentenced to five years.  “The accused perpetrated sexual crimes against multiple women, degrading women and treating them as mere tools of sexual pleasure,” Judge Kang Seong-soo said in his verdict\u200b on Friday\u200b. “It’s hard to fathom the pain the victims must have\u200b suffered.” During their trial, Mr. Jung and Mr. Choi\u200b, both 30,\u200b said that the sex acts, which took place in 2016, had been consensual. But the court ruled that the women had been drunk and unable to resist. The court has not said how many victims there were. Both men broke into tears as they were escorted back to jail after the sentencing, the news agency Yonhap reported. They have a week to appeal.

Spain’s Leftist Outsiders Are on the Verge of Getting Inside,2019-11-30,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Pablo Iglesias and his Podemos party burst onto the Spanish political scene in 2015 by winning more than one-fifth of the vote in their first national election, igniting dreams of overtaking the Socialists as the largest left-wing party and reshaping the government. Instead, after his meteoric rise, Mr. Iglesias faced internal party tensions and endured the same kind of criticism of his leadership and lifestyle that he had long thrown at a political establishment he called “the caste.” Support for his party has fallen sharply. Yet Mr. Iglesias, 41, now looks likely to get his first chance to at least share power, under a deal that would see him take the post of deputy prime minister and his party become the junior partner in a government headed by the more moderate Socialist leader, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. With sharp rivalries and policy differences, it is an uneasy alliance, and the road ahead for Mr. Iglesias could be every bit as rocky as the last few years have been. But if Mr. Sánchez can win parliamentary approval for his proposed coalition, it would make Spain one of the few European countries — and easily the largest — where far-left ministers form part of government. Podemos arrived in Parliament riding a wave of mass protests against austerity cuts brought about by the debt crisis that battered much of Europe. In its first national campaign, Podemos became the most successful third party since Spain returned to democracy in the 1970s. Another newcomer, Ciudadanos, placed fourth. Mr. Iglesias dismissed the traditional major parties as an entrenched, unresponsive and out-of-touch establishment. Podemos took as its model another far-left, anti-establishment party — Syriza — which surged to power in Greece in 2015 on an anti-austerity platform, and governed until it was ousted in elections this year. But once in Parliament, the pony-tailed Mr. Iglesias found it harder to cast himself as a critical outsider. He got entangled in unsuccessful negotiations on forming a government, and lost support even after merging Podemos with a smaller left-wing party. On Nov. 10, the rebranded Unidas Podemos party won just 35 of the 350 seats in the lower house of Parliament — half as many as it had taken in the 2015 and 2016 elections. It finished fourth, behind a far-right newcomer, Vox. Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, has led right-wing attacks against Mr. Sánchez, accusing him of “embracing Bolivarian Communism” — equating him with Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan leader who died in 2013 — by allowing Mr. Iglesias into his government. Mr. Sánchez and Mr. Iglesias signed their pact only two days after the Nov. 10 election, embracing for the cameras — a contrast to the acrimony that marked their previous months of fruitless negotiations, which had forced Spain into its fourth election in four years. But even combined, the two parties are short of a majority. And so, having come to terms with Mr. Iglesias, Mr. Sánchez must still win support from some smaller parties, probably including Catalan separatists, to allow him to form a new government.  His next challenge would then be to keep together his minority coalition government amid a European economic slowdown. If there were a recession, “Podemos could have every interest in showing a differentiating factor, to convince the electorate that whatever frustration builds up should not be attributable to them,” said Ignacio Jurado, a politics professor at Carlos III University in Madrid. The media-savvy Mr. Iglesias, who appeared regularly on television chat shows before entering politics, has sought to recast himself as a statesman rather than as a firebrand. During a televised campaign debate, he repeatedly read out articles from Spain’s Constitution, while reminding other candidates to respect the country’s laws. Before founding Podemos, he and some of his allies taught politics at universities and worked as political consultants in Latin America, including for the government of Mr. Chávez. Once the party gained traction, they faced news reports that Podemos had received undeclared money from Venezuela and Iran, a claim they have repeatedly denied. Mr. Iglesias argues that under the conservative government that lost power last year, his party long suffered from a state-backed media smear campaign, orchestrated by a high-ranking former police official, José Manuel Villarejo. Mr. Villarejo is in jail, awaiting trial on charges of bribery and money laundering. Prosecutors say he grew rich while working for years as a secret fixer for political and corporate clients, spying on and smearing their enemies, and even fabricating evidence. Conversations he secretly recorded have leaked, casting an unflattering light on Spain’s wealthy and powerful. Unidas Podemos contends that Mr. Villarejo was behind false claims about the party’s foreign financing, and that he eavesdropped illegally on party officials. Mr. Iglesias is a party to one of several court cases centering on Mr. Villarejo. “We can perhaps understand, without ever justifying, that a state uses illegal mechanisms to fight terrorists, but not to fight a political formation,” Mr. Iglesias said during a recent meeting with a group of foreign journalists. But even if the legal tangle around Mr. Villarejo vindicates Mr. Iglesias and Unidas Podemos, their problems will be far from solved. Polarization in Spain has deepened recently, with Vox finding a receptive audience for its anti-immigration and ultranationalist rhetoric, and political power is more fragmented than ever.  Mr. Iglesias has fallen out with some of his closest colleagues, and last year, he beat back an attempt to topple him as party leader. That challenge followed claims that he and his partner and fellow politician, Irene Montero, had violated the working-class principles of Unidas Podemos by buying a villa in Spain’s wealthiest municipality, outside Madrid. This year, Íñigo Errejón, a co-founder of Podemos, broke away and formed his own party to contest the recent elections, though it won only three seats. Once in government, Mr. Iglesias and his party may find working with the Socialists, who have a more cautious agenda, a frustrating experience. Unidas Podemos wants higher taxes on corporations and the rich, an increased minimum wage, a 34-hour workweek and caps on property rental prices. The party also wants banks to reimburse the government for the bailout money they received during Spain’s 2012 financial crisis, while keeping Bankia, the largest rescued lender, under state control. The Socialists have advocated more modest tax increases, and have not talked about squeezing the banks. They sharply increased Spain’s minimum wage this year, and have shown no interest in raising it again any time soon. But the main sticking point could be that Mr. Iglesias has argued that an independence referendum in Catalonia — with terms set by Madrid — could help end Spain’s simmering territorial conflict. Two years ago, the regional government held a referendum that the central government and the courts called illegal, plunging Catalonia into chaos. Before the election last month, Mr. Sánchez promised not another independence vote, but a stronger clampdown on Catalan separatists after several nights of violence on the streets of Barcelona and other cities. When Mr. Sánchez and Mr. Iglesias signed their pact, the Spanish stock market fell. Former prime ministers from the right and left had urged Mr. Sánchez to form a coalition with a party to his right, not one to his left.  But as long as Mr. Sánchez keeps Socialist ministers, and not those from Unidas Podemos, in charge of the economy, it seems unlikely that his coalition will cause major concerns among Spain’s European Union partners. “I think the European Union prefers a government with Podemos rather than more deadlock,” said Mr. Jurado, the politics professor. “If the European economy continues to slow down, it’s important to have at least somebody in charge and able to intervene in Spain.”']","Pablo Iglesias and his Unidas Podemos party, who are likely to join a governing coalition for the first time, have had a bumpy ride. What lies ahead could be just as rough."
"As Troubles Grow, Mexicans Keep the Faith With Their President",2019-12-01,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['PARAÍSO, Mexico — Every day before dawn, a knot of unemployed men gather at the gate of a construction site, hoping to land a job building a new oil refinery that Mexico’s president promises will bring riches to this forgotten corner of southeastern Mexico. They linger until noon before drifting off in the haze of the Gulf Coast sun. They will be back again the next day, trusting that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s bet on oil will pay off for them. “He is trying to do his best,” said one of the unemployed men, Geovanni Silván.  That patience suggests why Mr. López Obrador continues to enjoy vast approval, one year into his presidency, despite a flatlined economy and relentless violence. He ran on promises to make the state work for the people instead of for the elites that were favored by his predecessors. And many Mexicans feel that he has begun to do just that: pouring money into social programs, crisscrossing the country in commercial flights to speak directly to ordinary Mexicans, slashing government salaries and forgoing the pomp of past presidents. So while Mr. López Obrador has little to show for his efforts so far, many Mexicans remain hopeful, willing to give time to deliver the revolution he promised.  The support he enjoys personally outstrips Mexicans’ opinion of his governance, analysts say.  “The power of his leadership is that there is consistency in what he says and what he does,” said Edna Jaime, director of México Evalúa, a research group that analyzes government policies. In his first year, helped by a pliant majority in Congress, he has upended Mexican politics, dismantling the policies of his predecessors to chart a leftist course intended to correct the country’s yawning inequalities. He has raised the minimum wage, won a new labor law, cracked down on fuel theft and pushed Mexico to do more to produce its own food and energy. Even when his actions have largely followed those of his predecessors, his rhetoric has departed from theirs. With a new force called the National Guard, he has kept the military at the forefront of the fight against organized crime, and deported tens of thousands of Central American migrants — all while declaring migrants welcome and an end to the war on gangs. “The transformation that we are undertaking is within sight,” he said in a speech Sunday, adding that he needed another year to make those changes irreversible. “We are practicing politics in a new way,” he said. “Now we are guided by honesty, democracy and humanism.” Critics accuse him of trampling the country’s fragile institutions as he concentrates power. His response is to say that the institutions were created by “snobs” to serve neoliberal interests — and to fill them with loyalists. He has alienated rights groups with his handling of Mexico’s human rights commission. Economic analysts argue he has made erratic decisions, sapping investor confidence, and he has convinced no one that he has a strategy to deal with organized crime. That failure is made glaringly clear with each new spasm of violence, including the murder of three mothers and six children near the United States border last month. On Sunday, as Mr. López Obrador was declaring his commitment to protecting lives, the authorities said 21 people had died in a two-day battle between security forces gang gunmen in the northern state of Coahuila. But the discredited opposition makes an easy foil for his rhetorical attacks on corruption — the origin, he says, of Mexico’s ills. And his daily 7 a.m. news conferences allow him to frame the national discussion, blotting out his opponents and even his political allies.  “He is a formidable storyteller,” said Blanca Heredia, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university. “He has won people’s confidence and almost a kind of faith.” That belief holds strong in Paraíso, an oil port in Mr. López Obrador’s home state, Tabasco, that has become a laboratory for the president’s plans to develop Mexico’s poor southeast. “You can’t touch Andrés Manuel here,” said Ana Luisa Castellanos, a former supporter and a local member of the left-wing party the president led for years before he broke away.  Rivers and land merge in a giant delta of marshland and mangrove where Tabasco lies at the crook of the Gulf of Mexico. Like the rest of the region, Tabasco has sunk far behind Mexico’s central and northern states, where billions in factory investment has transformed the economy. One of Mr. López Obrador’s main promises was to correct that imbalance. The prize for Tabasco was the new Dos Bocas refinery, part of the president’s strategy to rescue the government’s indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex, and stem Mexico’s dependence on imports of gasoline. Mr. López Obrador also launched one of his signature social programs in Tabasco, an effort to revive the abandoned countryside and bolster domestic production by paying smallholders to grow fruits and vegetables and plant fruit and timber trees. Those who skip meetings or do not show up for chores at the program’s nurseries forfeit the monthly $230 subsidy. Critics argue that the program is little more than a handout, but for many who participate, it has been transformative. After disease wiped out her coconut trees, Romana Segura Ramón, 64, had abandoned her 2 ½ acres. Now, she and her husband grow beans, corn and other crops, and have planted mahogany trees. “We are dedicated to our land again,” she said. Elizabeth Genesta, 29, said the biggest advantage is what she has learned from longtime farmers. A biochemical engineer who left the oil industry to raise water buffalo, Ms. Genesta found that it was a “titanic job” to plant trees to restore her land, and sought help.  “It’s fantastic how we all benefit from each other,” she said. It is a sign of the president’s priorities that when Congress passed an austere budget last month, Pemex accounted for almost half of all infrastructure spending, and the welfare ministry received billions in new money. Without more government investment, though, Mexico’s private sector has halted its own plans and that uncertainty has contributed to the economy’s halt, said Ms. Jaime, the analyst.  “The president’s plan to reactivate the economies of the south won’t close the gaps,” on its own, she added. Whatever the results of the long-term strategy, there is early optimism in Tabasco. Last week, hotels were full and oil workers in neon-colored overalls seemed to be everywhere: crowding early morning buses and filing off the boats that returned them from offshore rigs. José Luis Delgado Burgos, 35, spent much of 2018 unemployed before he found a job as a human resources manager on an oil rig a year ago. He gives all the credit to the president. “They had shut down the rigs and thanks to him they opened them,” Mr. Delgado said. Industry analysts argue that building a new refinery is a mistake that will drain billions from Pemex — already the most indebted oil company in the world — and place additional strain on the government’s finances. Environmental groups warn that the site’s location at the edge of the sea makes it vulnerable to accidents. But in Paraíso, if there are doubts about the refinery, they pale beside the expectations that thousands of promised jobs will materialize when the pace of construction picks up.  “Everything that is development is a good project,” said Ciro Burelo Magaña, a local lawyer who opposes Mr. López Obrador. Then he added: “In a while the sea will swallow it up, because of climate change.”  The hope of new jobs does not obscure other problems. Paraíso’s residents fear that local criminal gangs are becoming bolder. Last week, the dismembered body of a local policeman was left outside the house of a former City Council member. And like everywhere in Mexico, there is no sign that authorities have the ability — or the will — to stem the violence. In June, Juan Luis Ligonia, 40, was returning with a load of fresh fish from Yucatán when armed men stopped him and stole his truck, ending his business supplying fish to Mexico City. When he went to the police with information about where the truck had been spotted, they told him he needed to pay a bribe if he wanted them to investigate. “I voted for him thinking that there would be a change,” Mr. Ligonia said of the president. Instead, he said, “There is no improvement.”']","One year into his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador faces a stagnant economy and spiraling violence, but Mexicans still place their hopes in him."
"With Brutal Crackdown, Iran Is Convulsed by Worst Unrest in 40 Years",2019-12-01,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran is experiencing its deadliest political unrest since the Islamic Revolution 40 years ago, with at least 180 people killed — and possibly hundreds more — as angry protests have been smothered in a government crackdown of unbridled force.  It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders.  In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. “The recent use of lethal force against people throughout the country is unprecedented, even for the Islamic Republic and its record of violence,” said Omid Memarian, the deputy director at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group. Altogether, from 180 to 450 people, and possibly more, were killed in four days of intense violence after the gasoline price increase was announced on Nov. 15, with at least 2,000 wounded and 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists.  The last enormous wave of protests in Iran — in 2009 after a contested election, which was also met with a deadly crackdown — left 72 people dead over a much longer period of about 10 months.  Only now, nearly two weeks after the protests were crushed — and largely obscured by an internet blackout in the country that was lifted recently — have details corroborating the scope of killings and destruction started to dribble out.  The latest outbursts not only revealed staggering levels of frustration with Iran’s leaders, but also underscored the serious economic and political challenges facing them, from the Trump administration’s onerous sanctions on the country to the growing resentment toward Iran by neighbors in an increasingly unstable Middle East.  The gas price increase, which was announced as most Iranians had gone to bed, came as Iran is struggling to fill a yawning budget gap. The Trump administration sanctions, most notably their tight restrictions on exports of Iran’s oil, are a big reason for the shortfall. The sanctions are meant to pressure Iran into renegotiating the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major world powers, which President Trump abandoned, calling it too weak.  Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. Many Iranians, stupefied and embittered, have directed their hostility directly at the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who called the crackdown a justified response to a plot by Iran’s enemies at home and abroad. The killings prompted a provocative warning from Mir Hussein Moussavi, an opposition leader and former presidential candidate whose 2009 election loss set off peaceful demonstrations that Ayatollah Khamenei also suppressed by force. In a statement posted Saturday on an opposition website, Mr. Moussavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011 and seldom speaks publicly, blamed the supreme leader for the killings. He compared them to an infamous 1978 massacre by government forces that led to the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi a year later, at the hands of the Islamic revolutionaries who now rule the country. “The killers of the year 1978 were the representatives of a nonreligious regime and the agents and shooters of November 2019 are the representatives of a religious government,” he said. “Then the commander in chief was the shah and today, here, the supreme leader with absolute authority.” The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country.  On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. Iran’s official media have reported that several members of the security forces were killed and injured during the clashes. The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said. The worst violence documented so far happened in the city of Mahshahr and its suburbs, with a population of 120,000 people in Iran’s southwest Khuzestan Province — a region with an ethnic Arab majority that has a long history of unrest and opposition to the central government. Mahshahr is adjacent to the nation’s largest industrial petrochemical complex and serves as a gateway to Bandar Imam, a major port. The New York Times interviewed six residents of the city, including a protest leader who had witnessed the violence; a reporter based in the city who works for Iranian media, and had investigated the violence but was banned from reporting it; and a nurse at the hospital where casualties were treated.  They each provided similar accounts of how the Revolutionary Guards deployed a large force to Mahshahr on Monday, Nov. 18, to crush the protests. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Guards.  For three days, according to these residents, protesters had successfully gained control of most of Mahshahr and its suburbs, blocking the main road to the city and the adjacent industrial petrochemical complex. Iran’s interior minister confirmed that the protesters had gotten control over Mahshahr and its roads in a televised interview last week, but the Iranian government did not respond to specific questions in recent days about the mass killings in the city. Local security forces and riot police officers had attempted to disperse the crowd and open the roads, but failed, residents said. Several clashes between protesters and security forces erupted between Saturday evening and Monday morning before the Guards were dispatched there. When the Guards arrived near the entrance to a suburb, Shahrak Chamran, populated by low-income members of Iran’s ethnic Arab minority, they immediately shot without warning at dozens of men blocking the intersection, killing several on the spot, according to the residents interviewed by phone. The residents said the other protesters scrambled to a nearby marsh, and that one of them, apparently armed with an AK-47, fired back. The Guards immediately encircled the men and responded with machine gun fire, killing as many as 100 people, the residents said.  The Guards piled the dead onto the back of a truck and departed, the residents said, and relatives of the wounded then transported them to Memko Hospital.  One of the residents, a 24-year-old unemployed college graduate in chemistry who had helped organize the protests blocking the roads, said he had been less than a mile away from the mass shooting and that his best friend, also 24, and a 32-year-old cousin were among the dead. He said they both had been shot in the chest and their bodies were returned to the families five days later, only after they had signed paperwork promising not to hold funerals or memorial services and not to give interviews to media. The young protest organizer said he, too, was shot in the ribs on Nov. 19, the day after the mass shooting, when the Guards stormed with tanks into his neighborhood, Shahrak Taleghani, among the poorest suburbs of Mahshahr.  He said a gun battle erupted for hours between the Guards and ethnic Arab residents, who traditionally keep guns for hunting at home. Iranian state media and witnesses reported that a senior Guards commander had been killed in a Mahshahr clash. Video on Twitter suggests tanks had been deployed there. A 32-year-old nurse in Mahshahr reached by the phone said she had tended to the wounded at the hospital and that most had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest. She described chaotic scenes at the hospital, with families rushing to bring in the casualties, including a 21-year-old who was to be married but could not be saved. “‘Give me back my son!,’” the nurse quoted his sobbing mother as saying. “‘It’s his wedding in two weeks!’” The nurse said security forces stationed at the hospital arrested some of the wounded protesters after their conditions had stabilized. She said some relatives, fearing arrest themselves, dropped wounded loved ones at the hospital and fled, covering their faces. On Nov. 25, a week after it happened, the city’s representative in Parliament, Mohamad Golmordai, vented outrage in a blunt moment of searing antigovernment criticism that was broadcast on Iranian state television and captured in photos and videos uploaded to the internet.  “What have you done that the undignified Shah did not do?” Mr. Golmordai screamed from the Parliament floor, as a scuffle broke out between him and other lawmakers, including one who grabbed him by the throat. The local reporter in Mahshahr said the total number of people killed in three days of unrest in the area had reached 130, including those killed in the marsh. In other cities such as Shiraz and Shahriar, dozens were reported killed in the unrest by security forces who fired on unarmed protesters, according to rights groups and videos posted by witnesses. “This regime has pushed people toward violence,” said Yousef Alsarkhi, 29, a political activist from Khuzestan who migrated to the Netherlands four years ago. “The more they repress, the more aggressive and angry people get.” Political analysts said the protests appeared to have delivered a severe blow to President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate in Iran’s political spectrum, all but guaranteeing that hard-liners would win upcoming parliamentary elections and the presidency in two years.  The tough response to the protests also appeared to signal a hardening rift between Iran’s leaders and sizable segments of the population of 83 million. “The government’s response was uncompromising, brutal and rapid,” said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. Still, he said, the protests also had “demonstrated that many Iranians are not afraid to take to the streets.”   ']",What started as a protest over a surprise increase in gasoline prices turned into widespread demonstrations met with a systematic repression that left at least 180 people dead.
"German Catholic Church Debates Sexuality, Celibacy and Women’s Roles",2019-11-29,By Liam Stack,"['BERLIN — The Roman Catholic Church in Germany has a split identity. At home, attendance is falling and many Germans say they regard the church’s teaching on social issues as hopelessly out of touch. But globally, the German church is one of the most powerful — and liberal — regions of the Catholic world, a player whose wealth and theological influence are now creating a challenge for the entire church. On Dec. 1, the German church’s international influence will be on display when its bishops begin a two-year-long series of meetings with lay leaders that will allow debate on hot-button issues that in many other corners of the church would be off limits, such as whether to accept homosexuality, end clerical celibacy and ordain women as priests. The meetings carry no authority to actually change church doctrine. Nevertheless, the Vatican and conservative Catholics in Germany and elsewhere have repeatedly warned that the dialogue process — which the German church calls “the synodal path” — could lead to schism. Germany, of course, was where Martin Luther helped begin the Protestant Reformation with his 95 theses condemning the Catholic church.  Some critics “feel that the Germans brought on the Reformation 500 years ago and divided the Catholic Church, and now the Germans are again up to no good trying to change the church,” said the Rev. Godehard Brüntrup, a spokesman for the Jesuit religious order in Germany and vice president of the Munich School of Philosophy.  Organizers of the dialogue say schism is not their goal. The dialogue grew out of the response to the clergy sexual abuse scandal in Germany, and Catholic leaders say it is meant to bridge the cultural divide between the church and many of its followers, and to explore whether church teachings set the stage for abuse. Priests are set to read a letter to parishioners at Mass this Sunday acknowledging that the church’s message “has been obscured and even terribly damaged” by the sexual abuse scandal, and calling the dialogue a process of “change and renewal.” The dialogue has nonetheless become a proxy war in the conflict between conservatives and liberals that has consumed much of Pope Francis’ tenure. And it strikes at core questions facing the church: What caused the abuse crisis and how should Catholics respond to it? Tensions over the dialogue can be seen in the divide between Germany’s cardinals: Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki, archbishop of Cologne, a critic of the process, and Cardinal Reinhard Marx, the archbishop of Munich and Freising, who has called for opening the church to “new thinking.”  Cardinal Woelki, whose Cologne archdiocese is one of the world’s wealthiest, has warned  bishops against stumbling into creating a “German national church,” distinct from the unified Catholic “universal church.” “I do not want to support a special ‘German Way,’ nor should we as Germans pretend to know better than the rest of the church,” the cardinal said in an interview.  Cardinal Marx has championed the dialogue as head of the German Bishops Conference, and has spoken in the past of an openness to reconsidering issues like mandatory celibacy for priests. The cardinal is a particularly influential figure in the global church: He is a member of Francis’ small advisory council and leads the same archdiocese once led by Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI (now pope emeritus). “Faith can only grow and deepen,” Cardinal Marx said at a meeting of the bishop’s conference in March, “if one faces up to the free and open debate, and develops the ability to take new positions and to go new ways.”  For traditionalists, like Cardinal Woelki, the challenges facing the church require a recommitment to church teaching, not an effort to align the church with public opinion on sexual issues. “Throughout history Christians have never been in sync with the world,” said the cardinal, who leads a diocese where fewer than 8 percent of parishioners regularly attend Mass, slightly lower than the 9.3 percent of Germany’s 23 million registered Catholics who regularly go.  But the “synodal path” is based on the opposite view, articulated by a study commissioned by the bishops conference that said church teachings and practices should be examined because they had set the stage for abuse.  Those factors include “the management of power, the priestly ways of life, sexual morals detached from reality and, finally, the role of women in the church,” Thomas Sternberg, president of the Central Committee of German Catholics, a lay group that has collaborated with the bishop’s conference on the dialogue, wrote in an email. “We also have to find new models for priestly forms of life,” he said, suggesting “significantly more participation of women, including in leadership functions and liturgical workings.” Statements like that have caused a stir at the Vatican. In a letter in June, Francis encouraged the German church to focus on evangelization and “walk together” with the larger church so as to avoid “increasing and perpetuating the evils it sought to to solve.” If regional churches “find themselves separated” from the universal Catholic Church, the pope wrote, “they weaken, rot and die.” The Vatican delivered an even more forceful message in September, reminding the German bishops in a letter that they do not determine church policy, and rebuking them for partnering as equals with laypeople.  Cardinal Woelki echoed that concern, saying in an email that the dialogue’s design, which gives bishops and lay leaders equal say in decision-making, “could easily lead to the misconception that we can ‘democratize’ the church.’” “Bishops — the successors of the Apostles — are called to teach and defend the faith,” the cardinal said. “The democratization of the faith would be the end of the church by turning divine revelation into an endless political power struggle.”  The German church’s occupying a position of both great strength and weakness can be seen in two sets of numbers released in July in its annual report: The church has lost an average of 100,000 members a year since 1990, with more than 216,000 leaving in 2018. But the bishops conference also said it had brought in over $6.5 billion in net revenue each year since 2016, thanks to a tithe on registered Catholics of up to 9 percent collected by the German government as a “church tax.” Since the 19th century, Germany has collected the tax from registered members of established religions, including both Catholics and Protestants, and then distributed the revenue back to the churches.  The German church sends hundreds of millions of dollars each year to Catholic charities and church projects around the world. German Catholics are also major funders of the Vatican; the bishops conference sends almost $7 million a year, and each of Germany’s 27 dioceses sends its own contributions, said Matthias Kopp, a spokesman for the bishops conference. “The German church is very influential because of its financial might,” said Father Brüntrup, the Jesuit spokesman. “But it also has had a great influence on the intellectual life of the church, because German theology was and still is a leading force intellectually.”  He described talk of a schism as “a politically motivated exaggeration,” but said conservative Catholics might still be troubled by the possible long-term impact of the bishops’ plan. “What they want to start is a process of dialogue, listening to what the people and the experts and the laypeople have to say, so that the hierarchy gets from a mode of teaching to a mode of listening,” Father Brüntrup said. “And then this process might lead 10, 20 or 30 years down the road to a universal council in which maybe a few things change.” Stuck in the middle of the debate are sexual abuse survivors, who say the dialogue is both a victory and a source of worry.  The sex abuse crisis exploded in Germany in 2010 when alumni of a Berlin high school, Canisius College, said teachers abused them in the 1970s and 1980s. The crisis deepened in 2016 when an investigator said more than 200 boys in a choir led by the brother of Benedict XVI were abused over almost four decades. Abuse survivors say the church has never before shown such high-level interest in their concerns. But embedding their demands in a thicket of culture war conflicts could make the road to justice tougher, said Matthias Katsch, a Canisius alumnus who in 2010 told of his abuse.  “I’m afraid that the church is starting this conversation and this dialogue about the reform of the church and they forget that first they have to deal with the survivors,” Mr. Katsch said. ']","With the German church’s global influence, a meeting of bishops and laypeople to take up hot-button topics has led to warnings of a new schism, originating in the home of the Protestant Reformation."
The Lonely and Dangerous Life of the Filipino Seafarer,2019-11-30,By Aurora Almendral and Jes Aznar,"['ABOARD THE UBC CYPRUS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC — On his first ocean voyage seven years ago, Jun Russel Reunir was sent deep into the bowels of a cargo ship, where he shoveled iron ore until his muscles ached — then continued shoveling for a dozen hours more. “I cried in my cabin three times that month,” Mr. Reunir said. Filipinos like Mr. Reunir, now 27, have for decades powered the global shipping industry, helping to move 90 percent of global trade.  A few months ago, he and 18 other Filipino men crewed a cement carrier traveling from Japan to the Philippines. For a visitor along for the ride, the ocean voyage meant fresh sensations. The sound of the waves drowned out by the roar of the engines. The deck scattered with dead flying fish after a storm. The breeze filled with the smell of cheap bunker fuel. But for the seamen, perhaps the only thing worse than the repetitive drudgery of their harsh labor was the boredom that came when they were done, any romance with the sea long since faded.  Jayson Guanio, 29, the ship’s cook, recalled that once, on a two-month voyage carrying bauxite from Montenegro to China, he ran up to the bridge to peer through binoculars at the flat rise of a distant island, just for the chance to look at something other than the sea. Still, Arnulfo Abad, 51, the engine-room fitter, who has spent most of the last three decades on cargo ships, said he was grateful for the work. “The sea gave me my life,” he said. The men on the ship are the sons of fishermen, carpenters and rice farmers. To be an officer — which most men aspire to — requires a college degree. Some who graduated paid for those degrees on the earnings from backyard piggeries, or made their pocket money selling Popsicles on the street.  They left behind lives in provincial villages where they could expect to make $100 a month. They earn 10 times that amount, often more, at sea. They came home with thick, gold chains around their necks, built tall cement houses among their neighbors’ bamboo huts, provided for their parents and sent siblings, nieces and nephews to college. Marriage proposals poured in. The country’s dominance of the arduous but well-paid work on cargo ships began in the 1980s, when an organized campaign began to train Filipinos for careers at sea. Employment agencies marketed Filipino seafarers to international shipping companies. Government agencies stepped in to manage their deployment.  An industry of marine colleges emerged to serve the class of strivers seeking the jobs. In recent years, ships have been hiring more seamen from Vietnam, Myanmar and China. But about 400,000 of the world’s 1.6 million seafarers are Filipino. In 2018, these workers sent $6 billion back to their country in remittances. In the Philippines, songs are written about their heroic sacrifices, legendary exploits and Lothario lifestyles.  In a karaoke staple, a lover laments that “I endured everything because you’re a seaman,” but in the end, discovers that “you’re a seaman-loloko,” a play on the Filipino word for a womanizer. Aboard the UBC Cyprus, Filipino culture dominates, as it does on many ships.  Rodrigo Soyoso, the Filipino captain, started as an apprentice on a commercial fishing boat where three dozen men were allowed to bathe once a week, and he slept on deck, tied to a vent by the ankle to keep from sliding into the sea. He crewed rusting tugboats, a putrid livestock carrier and cruise ships, working his way up to officer rank. As captain, Mr. Soyoso ensures compliance with international maritime regulations, avoids collisions with other ships, and monitors cold fronts and monsoon winds. He tries to fend off corrupt customs officers, and stocks cartons of cigarettes for the ones he can’t. Both the ship’s food and free time remind the sailors of home.  One night, the men roasted a whole pig on a spit and broke open fresh coconuts. On the aft deck, there was a basketball hoop. Basketball is the unofficial national sport of the Philippines.  Another Filipino tradition carried on by seafarers are bolitas, metal bearings or bits of melted plastic shaped into balls, then implanted under the skin of the penis. Bolitas are meant to increase sexual pleasure for women, and the practice of implanting them is widespread enough among seafarers that they are required to declare how many bolitas they have at predeployment medical exams.  “They show them off,” said Mr. Guanio, the cook.  Aboard this ship, the crew was entirely male. About 1 percent of the world’s commercial seafarers are women. During Saturday night karaoke in the mess hall, the men sang songs of longing with lines like “How long will my heart wait, longing for you?”  The internet has made ship life a little less lonely, but the men are given a free allotment of only 50MB to download on the ship. “Open Facebook and it disappears,” Mr. Soyoso said. The internet is down on this voyage. The men set their alarms for when they passed an island. They gathered between coils of mooring rope and a life raft at the port-side rails to try to siphon enough signal to receive text messages. Before the internet, when seamen arrived at port, they elbowed each other to get to the phone booth first, trying to find out if a child had been baptized while shipmates banged on the plexiglass. Back then, they also had a custom known as “over-over.” Seamen called their wives and girlfriends over a radio channel, saying, “I love you, over.”  The ocean is a dangerous place to work. In the last 10 years, 1,036 ships have been lost at sea, including another cement carrier that capsized in bad weather near Scotland with no survivors. A mooring rope could snap with enough force to rip off a man’s head, or a falling grate could shear off fingers. A large swell breaking over the side could slam a man against pipes or wash him into the sea. There are electrocutions, burns and appendicitis. The nearest hospital could be hours, or days away, by rescue helicopter. The biggest challenge for seafarers, though, is enduring the mental strain of isolation, said Mr. Soyoso, the captain.  On a ship, with time to turn over your problems and no way to do anything about them, it’s easy to become despondent. Mr. Soyoso said he had seen men become too depressed to work, and others die by suicide. The months away from family exact a heavy toll.  In April, Mr. Reunir was at port when his pregnant wife called. She was in labor. It was a girl. “On her first birthday, I probably won’t be there either,” he said. Mr. Reunir said he had wanted to be a seaman since childhood. Since achieving his dream, he has relished the adventure of sailing pirated waters in the Gulf of Aden, accepted the risks of North Sea storms, and endured 10-month long stretches of separation from everyone he loved.  But since he left for the sea, the Philippine economy has grown, and there are more opportunities on land. After seven years onboard cargo ships, he’s now dreaming of buying some farmland and raising goats and pigs in the town where he grew up. In the meantime, he asks his wife to show his baby daughter photos of him, so she’ll know who he is, when they finally meet.']",
"China Is Aiming to ‘Break’ Detained Australian Writer, Lawyers Say",2019-12-01,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Chinese officials have cut off all contact between a detained Australian writer and democracy activist, Yang Hengjun, and his family, in what his lawyers described on Sunday as an effort to “break” Mr. Yang and force him to confess to being a spy. Mr. Yang, who was detained in January after arriving in Guangzhou, China, on a flight from New York, has consistently denied the charge.  Mr. Yang’s lawyers said they had confirmed that Chinese officials were conducting daily interrogations of him in isolation, shackling his ankles and wrists, refusing to allow access to any messages of support from relatives or friends and giving him at least nine pills a day for supposed health problems like high blood pressure and kidney complications. “We’re concerned because he went in as a fit and healthy man,” Sarah Condon, one of his lawyers  in Melbourne, Australia, said in an interview. “Now he has this purported diagnosis and is being fed a concoction of drugs.” Mr. Yang’s case has already complicated relations between Australia and China, but the latest accusations added yet another obstacle to easing any tensions. The Australian government is under pressure to respond more forcefully to Beijing after intelligence officials confirmed last week that they were investigating an alleged Chinese plot to install a spy in the Australian Parliament. It is not clear if the attention to Beijing’s covert efforts in Australia — which Chinese officials have denied as pure hysteria — have affected Mr. Yang’s treatment. The office of Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, who has been deeply engaged with the case, could not be reached Sunday night for comment. But what Mr. Yang’s lawyers described appeared to be an all-out attempt to persuade him to confess to a charge of espionage that has not been detailed or explained. The Chinese officials appear to be trying to make him believe that his case is hopeless and that Australia has forsaken him.  In August, Mr. Yang said that one of his Chinese interrogators had told him that Australia was small and would not care about him because he is not white and because the country was dependent on China for its trade and economy.  He rejected that assertion, according to his lawyers, in part because he knew of Australia’s efforts to help through the snippets of information passed on through official channels. Now those avenues appear to have been cut off. “There is a plain attempt to have Mr. Yang be subjected to interrogation in complete isolation, cut off entirely from his loved ones and supporters,” said Robert Stary, another of his defense lawyers. Mr. Yang is one of many writers and activists who over the years have run afoul of the Chinese authorities and disappeared into detention. He is one of a few people with foreign citizenship to be detained indefinitely over the past year or so. In December 2018, the Chinese police detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as officials in Beijing pressed Canada to free Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive held for possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges. The motivation for Mr. Yang’s arrest is harder to untangle.  He worked for the Chinese Foreign Ministry before setting out as a novelist and commentator, moving to Hong Kong, the United States and, finally, Australia, where he studied for a Ph.D. and became an Australian citizen in 2002. After migrating, he remained an influential voice in China, using his online presence to sell health supplements and to offer lectures, commentaries on current affairs and advice on migration to Western countries. While he has often stayed within the bounds of official Chinese acceptance, he has also issued barbed critiques in playful tones. “I’m like an old auntie jabbering on, always promoting democracy and repeating its benefits,” he wrote in a 2014 article.  Before his detention in January, he spent two years with his family in New York, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University.']","Yang Hengjun has been shackled, cut off from all contact with his family and interrogated daily to make him confess to being a spy, his representatives said."
Hong Kong Police Fire Tear Gas as Protesters Return in Force,2019-12-01,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — After a relative lull in the protests, thousands of pro-democracy activists turned out Sunday for three demonstrations a week after scoring a major victory in elections that were viewed as a broad endorsement of the movement’s goals. The vote last Sunday saw pro-democracy candidates win 87 percent of the seats in local district council races. The councils have little political power, but the vote — a rare form of popular elections in the semiautonomous city — was portrayed as reflecting widespread discontent with the government and backing for the protesters’ aims. The demonstrations on Sunday were all granted “letters of no objection,” unlike the many recent protests that had been banned by the police. Activists have denounced such bans as unnecessary restrictions on freedom of assembly. While the first two protests were peaceful, a later one saw several tense confrontations between demonstrators and the police.  The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The movement soon  expanded to include a broad range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy. On Sunday, thousands of protesters, many dressed in black and wearing face masks, descended on the harborfront district of Tsim Sha Tsui, chanting slogans such as “Five demands, not one less!” and “Hong Kongers, take revenge!” After the Beijing-backed establishment camp was dealt a blow in last Sunday’s elections, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, finally said the government was considering setting up a committee to look into the crisis. The move stopped short of addressing the protesters’ main demand of setting up an independent commission to examine how the police have handled the protests. “Never forget why you started,” read a large, black-and-white banner at the march. Not long after it started, the police fired pepper spray and later tear gas at some of the protesters after warning them they had veered from the approved route. The clashes continued into the evening, with officers firing rubber bullets and more tear gas, while protesters vandalized shops perceived to be friendly to Beijing.  There was at least one injury on Sunday, when a man who had been clearing roadblocks set up by protesters was struck “in the head by a hard object” wielded by another man, the police said in a statement. Graphic footage circulating online showed the man being bashed by a long object and collapsing onto a roadblock in Mong Kok as blood trickled down his face, though he appeared to be conscious after being hit.  The barriers set up by pro-democracy demonstrators to block police movements have become flash points between these protesters and supporters of the government, with scuffles often breaking out when people try to dismantle them. A Hospital Authority spokeswoman did not provide details of individual cases, but said two men who had been injured in the area were in stable condition. The city has been increasingly on edge in the wake of two deaths over last month: of a 70-year-old man who died after being struck in the head, possibly by a thrown brick; and of a student who died after falling from a building where the police clashed with protesters. But on Sunday many protesters were committed to showing a peaceful front to the authorities, and hundreds of parents brought their children to the march on Sunday morning against what many consider the indiscriminate use of tear gas by the police. The marchers waved yellow balloons — the color of the pro-democracy movement — while young children stuck their drawings and handwritten messages for the police outside the government headquarters. “Please don’t fire tear gas anymore, because besides making other people sick, tear gas will also make you sick and hurt animals,” one primary school student wrote on his note. Separately, protesters waving American flags marched to the United States Consulate to thank Washington for passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which authorizes sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses in the city.']","After a week of relative calm and a vote that boosted protesters’ cause, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and demonstrators attacked shops."
"Brad Gobright, Renowned Rock Climber, Is Dead After Fall in Mexico",2019-11-29,By Elian Peltier,"['Brad Gobright, an acclaimed American free solo climber, has died after falling nearly 1,000 feet while rappelling a well-known route in Mexico with a rope, the authorities said. Mr. Gobright, 31, fell to his death on Wednesday from a rock known as El Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path, in the Potrero Chico national park in northern Mexico, the Mexican civil defense authorities said in a statement on Thursday. Mr. Gobright, a native of California, was hailed as one of the world’s best free solo climbers, a technique that uses no ropes. He set a speed record in 2017 — 2 hours 19 minutes 44 seconds — at the popular climbing route called the Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. It has since been surpassed. On Wednesday, he was not free soloing when he fell, but was rappelling using a rope with a climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson survived the fall but sustained several injuries. “It was basically a blur,” Mr. Jacobson, 26, told Outside Magazine. “He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.” A civil responder who participated in the rescue effort and posted Facebook pictures of Mr. Jacobson in an ambulance said the climber had injured his right ankle. Practitioners of free solo climbing say it is a risky yet exhilarating experience, one that comes with a calm acceptance of death.  “The risk in free soloing is always to fall off and fall to your death,” the renowned free solo climber Alex Honnold told The New York Times in 2018. “I mean, that’s pretty straightforward.” In a message posted on Instagram on Thursday, Mr. Honnold praised Mr. Gobright’s “insanely strong fingers” and said the climbing world had “lost a true light.” Other styles of climbing have had their share of tragedy. In 2017, Ueli Steck, a renowned mountain climber known as “the Swiss Machine” for his rapid ascents of imposing peaks, died in an accident at a camp near Mount Everest. In 2015, Dean Potter, a top rock climber, was killed along with another man in a BASE-jumping accident at Yosemite National Park in California. A college dropout, Mr. Gobright had dedicated his life to climbing, touring in the United States and living in a Honda Civic.  “I enrolled Brad in soccer when he was 5,” his mother, Pamela Gobright, told Rock and Ice Magazine in a 2015 profile of the climber. “But he just climbed the goal posts instead of following the ball.” In the 2017 documentary “Safety Third,” he says of free soloing: “I know it’s not safe. I’m not saying it’s safe, but it’s fun, you know?” In his last Instagram post, posted this month after a climbing trip in Utah, Mr. Gobright wrote, “At times things got very chaotic, but at other times it was calm and silent as I stared off into the vast openness.”']","The American free solo climber, one of the world’s best, fell nearly 1,000 feet on Wednesday while using a rope.

"In Prince Andrew Scandal, Prince Charles Emerges as Monarch-in-Waiting",2019-12-01,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II welcomes President Trump and other world leaders to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday to mark the 70th anniversary of NATO, it will be another testament to her extraordinary longevity: She acceded to the throne only three years after the alliance was formed. Yet it will also showcase the House of Windsor at a wistful turning point, with the 93-year-old queen fading into history as her 71-year-old son and heir, Prince Charles, moves aggressively to assert his control, most conspicuously in trying to mop up the recent scandal that engulfed his younger brother Prince Andrew. The fierce backlash over Prince Andrew’s television interview about his friendship with the disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has thrown a harsh spotlight on the queen’s management of the Firm, as insiders often refer to the royal family. More significantly, it has also dramatized how Prince Charles has effectively assumed the role of monarch-in-waiting. In the aftermath of Prince Andrew’s disastrous BBC interview, in which he showed no empathy for the teenage victims of Mr. Epstein and offered dubious defenses of his own conduct, Prince Charles called his mother from New Zealand to press her to strip his brother of his public duties. The Prince of Wales was said to be worried that the scandal had spiraled so rapidly that it was threatening to eclipse this month’s general election in Britain, The Times of London reported. Prince Charles has long pushed for a more streamlined royal family, with fewer members carrying out official duties, drawing from the public purse, or generating damaging publicity. But the Prince Andrew debacle is the most visible sign yet that the shift has begun to happen. Some British papers all but implored the heir to take de facto control. In an editorial under the headline “Shadow King,” the Times argued that the monarchy “needs a firmer grip at the center.” “This can only come from Prince Charles,” it said. “Although he has faced his own set of scandals, he has already taken on a greater role and can do more, in effect acting as king-in-waiting.” Valentine Low, who covers the royal family for that newspaper, said that under the aging queen, “there are all these different entities in the family, and they operate in silos.”  “Andrew is a minor silo,” he said. “But you occasionally get a crisis where you need leadership from the center.” The latest crisis erupted at a time when Britain’s political leaders, paralyzed by Brexit, are in little position to help. Far from steadying the crown, as Prime Minister Tony Blair did when the queen misjudged the public mood after the death of Princess Diana in 1997, today’s politicians are drawing her into their own frantic machinations. Critics accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of misleading the queen when he asked her to suspend Parliament for a period of weeks, rather than the customary few days, in an effort to curtail parliamentary discussion and action on Brexit. The decision was later declared illegal by Britain’s Supreme Court. When the queen presented Mr. Johnson’s legislative agenda just weeks before Mr. Johnson called an election, critics said she was being exploited to deliver a campaign manifesto dressed up as a queen’s speech. “Politics, as we see at the moment, are grubby, dishonest and chaotic,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “The monarchy is a rock of stability that has served this country well in times of crisis. But we’re coming to the end of a pretty troubled year, which adds to the woes of the family.” The interview with Prince Andrew raised a host of questions, not least whether the queen had signed off on her son’s decision to invite cameras into Buckingham Palace. The BBC journalist who conducted the interview, Emily Maitlis, said the queen had. But given the opacity of the palace, even she hedged slightly: Prince Andrew, she wrote in a behind-the-scenes essay published in the Times, told her team that “he must ‘seek approval from higher up.’ It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself. At 8 a.m. the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board.” All of this intrigue unfolded, palace watchers noted, while Prince Charles was preparing to leave on his royal tour of New Zealand and the Pacific. What happened afterward was less mysterious. After four days of brutal headlines, calls for Prince Andrew to testify under oath to the F.B.I. and a wholesale exodus of the prince’s charitable organizations, Prince Andrew issued a statement in which he declared that he had asked his mother to let him “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.” The episode laid bare a paradox: While Buckingham Palace has prepared meticulously for the death of the queen and the accession of Prince Charles, its handling of the Prince Andrew affair shows that the royal family is less prepared to handle the vexing problems that keep coming up in the twilight of her reign. Any overt move to sideline the queen would be extremely sensitive, given her beloved status. She remains a seemingly eternal presence in British life, logging nearly 300 public engagements last year and speaking for the nation, such as when she issued a statement after the terrorist attack on London Bridge, thanking “the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others.” But royal watchers said her grip on internal matters had weakened for several reasons. Her husband, Prince Philip, who functioned as the family disciplinarian, is 98 and lives in retirement at Sandringham, one of the royal estates. In January, after striking a car in his Land Rover, he claimed he had been blinded by the sun, in what proved a harbinger of a troubled year for the monarchy. The queen had lost another trusted counselor in 2017 when her longtime private secretary, Christopher Geidt, left after an internal power struggle. Mr. Geidt, people with ties to the palace said, had put himself on a collision course with Prince Andrew and Prince Charles by trying to centralize control under the queen. But they also credited Mr. Geidt with running a tight ship. A military scholar, he helped arbitrate the negotiations between David Cameron and Nick Clegg that resulted in a coalition government between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats after the elections in 2010. The queen’s current private secretary, Edward Young, is a less forceful presence, these people said. By contrast, the private secretary to Prince Charles, Clive Alderton, is a formidable former ambassador to Morocco who is expected to help the prince navigate his accession to the throne. However unsavory Prince Andrew’s history with Mr. Epstein, royal observers said it did not pose as dire a threat as had the unraveling of Prince Charles’s marriage to Diana. Except for potential legal exposure in a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein, Prince Andrew is likely to vanish into memory (though not before the BBC broadcasts another program about him and Mr. Epstein next Monday). “They’ve moved swiftly to sort it out in the coldblooded and ruthless way they have,” Mr. Low said. Simon Jenkins, a columnist and author, likened Prince Andrew’s travails to a scandal involving a Hollywood celebrity. He said it was “of absolutely no consequence” in a country that is going to the polls in two weeks in an election that will have profound consequences for its place in the world. In an election debate two weeks ago, Mr. Johnson and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, each tried, in their own way, to avoid making Prince Andrew a political issue when they were asked whether the monarchy was fit for purpose. “Needs a bit of improvement,” Mr. Corbyn replied. “The monarchy is beyond reproach,” said Mr. Johnson, who has faced questions about his own peccadilloes. What Buckingham Palace needs to worry more about, royal watchers said, is Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Reports of strain between him and his brother, Prince William, and of Meghan’s struggles to adapt to her new life, are more damaging because these young royals symbolize the House of Windsor’s future, not its messy past. “For them to be breaking away from the family,” Ms. Junor said, “does have implications for the future of the monarchy.”']","After a public-relations debacle stirred questions about the role of Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince of Wales is asserting a newfound authority in British royal affairs."
"3 Young People Stabbed on Busy Hague Street, Setting Off Alarm in Dutch City",2019-11-29,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['The police in the Dutch city of The Hague said three young people were injured in a “stabbing incident” on Friday evening on Grote Markt Street, a central thoroughfare teeming with Black Friday shoppers. The deputy mayor, Boudewijn Revis, described the victims as children and called the episode “a terrible thing to happen on a night on which so many people are shopping in one of our busiest streets.” The victims were treated at hospitals and released, the police said.  The police said late Friday that they were still searching for a suspect and investigating a potential motive. The Dutch newspaper AD said that investigators had found a knife in the area. Photos posted on social media showed the neighborhood cordoned off on Friday night with helicopters circling above and emergency vehicles stationed all about.  The dramatic police response reflected heightened fears on the Continent after a burst of violence in London earlier Friday was declared a “terrorist incident” by the British police. In a chaotic altercation on London Bridge, several people tackled a man wearing a fake bomb, whom the police shot dead at the scene. Two people were stabbed to death. The busy holiday season — targeted for attacks around Europe in recent years — may also have put the Dutch authorities on edge. Last month, Amsterdam’s international airport was briefly paralyzed as security forces responded to a false alarm of a hijacking; this week, the Dutch police arrested two men accused of plotting a terrorist attack. But unlike in France, Belgium and Germany, there have been no major organized terrorist attacks on Dutch soil in recent years.  In most of the country, the police presence tends to be subdued and heavy automatic rifles are rarely seen in the hands of law enforcement. Exceptions are at Schiphol, the country’s biggest airport, and at Parliament, about 400 yards from the stabbing site, which are guarded by the well-armed military police, the royal Marechaussee. Earlier this year in Utrecht, about 45 miles east of The Hague, a gunman opened fire in a tram, killing three and injuring five. SWAT teams responded as authorities scrambled to deal with what was believed to be a terrorist attack. The shooter, who at the time of the killings faced rape charges, told police he had acted alone. Claire Moses contributed reporting.']",The police were still searching for a suspect and a motive. The attack came just hours after a burst of violence in London. 
‘I Wanted to Die:’ Northern Ireland Confronts a Suicide Crisis,2019-12-01,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LURGAN, Northern Ireland — On a cold February night in 2001, as Joe Holbeach was jogging along the pebbled shores of Newcastle in Northern Ireland, he imagined being taken in by the vicious tide and drowning. Days later, he stood on the edge of the Giant’s Causeway cliff top and gazed down at the steep drop, trying to find the courage to jump. He didn’t, but like many other survivors of the paramilitary violence during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. And to this day he battles the demons that tell him to end his own life. Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement ended the Troubles, Northern Ireland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Experts point to numerous factors including poverty, underfunded mental health services and a recent uptick in paramilitary violence. But a leading cause, they say, is PTSD. Mr. Holbeach, who has received a diagnosis of PTSD, is among the thousands who were caught in the crossfire of Northern Ireland’s guerrilla war, in which bombings, shootings and maimings were enmeshed in daily life for nearly three decades. His PTSD manifests in the form of flashbacks, feelings of intense emotional stress, depression and anxiety, which leads to suicidal behavior. On some days his suicidal thoughts become so incessant that he struggles to see certain objects as anything but tools he could use to hang himself. In 2001, when he reached out to his local mental health hospital in the town of Lurgan, he says he was turned away because, as he admitted, he had been violent toward another patient during his last admission. He says the rejection pushed him over the edge. “I told them I was going to kill myself, but they still didn’t take me in,” he recalled on a recent day in his living room, where family pictures decorate the mantelpiece.  “I couldn’t take it,” he said. “I cracked and went straight to the deepest point of the Craigavon Lake and threw myself in. I can’t swim well, but I didn’t even try. I wanted to drown. I wanted to die.” Northern Ireland has the highest suicide rate in the United Kingdom, with 18.5 age standardized suicides per 100,000 people in 2017, a figure that puts it among the top 15 countries in the world, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency found. The rate for men is far higher, approaching 30. The rate in England was half that, at 9.2 per 100,000 people.  The Republic of Ireland has historically had a high suicide rate as well, though it has seen a steady decrease in recent years. Most striking is that the suicide rates in Northern Ireland have doubled since the region’s militant groups struck the peace deal more than two decades ago. A spike in the rate from 2004 to 2006 reflected a change in recording practices by the Coroner’s Service that synchronized Northern Ireland with the rest of Britain. In the following years, the numbers tracked generally higher, prompting mental health experts to carry out research that found a direct link between suicidal behavior and the traumatic events experienced by thousands during the conflict. In 2017, the highest number of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland occurred among men aged 35 to 44. They grew up in the shadow of the war, many of them experiencing daily violence, forced migrations, loss of jobs and deprivation. “For anxiety disorders and PTSD, 22 years was the average time between symptom onset and treatment, because people didn’t want to talk and ruminate over the terrible things they went through,” said Siobhan O’Neill, a professor at Ulster University who carried out a detailed study into mental health in Northern Ireland’s history. Of 28 countries and regions that participated in the World Mental Health Survey in 2017, Northern Ireland had the highest rate of PTSD. “During the Troubles, the suicide rates in Northern Ireland were actually lower than they are now,” Ms. O’Neill said. “It seems that the conflict gave those who may have otherwise been suicidal, a sense of purpose — to fight, to live.” “But when the Troubles ended,” she added, “many people struggled to make sense of what all that fighting was about and what had been achieved, and then the suicide rates went up.” The uncertainty over Brexit and the collapse of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing coalition have empowered dissident groups in recent years and threatened the region’s fragile peace. Paramilitary-style punishment shootings and beatings in dissident-run deprived areas — primarily to punish young people for things like petty crimes and drug dealing — rose 60 percent last year, an increase that experts say has contributed to the high suicide rate. Bernadette O’Rawe, an activist who provides support for the victims of paramilitary shootings in western Belfast, pulled out pictures of some of the worst casualties. A young boy with bloody bullet holes the size of golf balls under his kneecaps, another with a bulging ripped lip. Many of the victims are left crippled. Of the nine victims the couple helped, three took their own lives. “Suicide is like an epidemic here — there’s about one a week,” Ms. O’Rawe said. Mr. Holbeach was struggling and splashing in the Craigavon Lake when he was spotted by a fisherman, who swam out to him and pulled him back to the shore using an abandoned basketball hoop. As he was drowning, Mr. Holbeach had flashbacks to Nov. 8, 1987, the day he went to the parish town of Enniskillen to attend a memorial service for British soldiers and a bomb planted by Provisional I.R.A. militants exploded yards away from him. “Everyone had gathered — friends, family, children —\xa0and then suddenly there was a big bang,” he recalled, scrunching his face up tight as if reliving the moment. His hands started to shake. “I fell to the floor, and it was like asteroids coming at me from space. You’re dead, you’re dead — I believed I was dead.” The attack was among the deadliest of the conflict, killing 12 people and injuring more than 60. “I dug myself out of the rubble,” Mr. Holbeach recalled. “It was like I was in the middle of the desert in a sandstorm — stepping over bodies flat on the ground like cardboard, blood and broken limbs everywhere.” The Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi supplied Semtex to the Irish Republican Army paramilitary group during the conflict, and victims of the bombings have long campaigned for the British government to release more than $12 billion in frozen Libyan assets — currently being held in Britain — to compensate the victims. Mr. Holbeach says that beyond obtaining justice, he could use the money for private medical care after he was left injured by the bomb. About 5 percent of Northern Ireland’s health budget is spent on mental health, half of the 13 percent allocated in England. Last month, Northern Ireland’s Department of Health published a suicide prevention plan that aims to reduce the number of suicides 10 percent over the next five years, but experts worry that there is not enough funding to fully implement the strategy. A culture of silence around the conflict has also contributed to the issue, as many of the victims are reluctant to ask for help.  “It wasn’t safe to speak about so many things,” said Roisin Martin, who worked as a nurse during the conflict. “Even if you recognized that you needed to, you didn’t know who anyone really was or what their beliefs or involvement was in the paramilitary world.” Many people would not confide even in their families and friends or share details of the atrocities they witnessed on a daily basis. In some cases, experts found that parents could transmit their post-traumatic stress to their children, even if the child had never experienced a traumatic event.  Only now, 20 years later, are people starting to confront the emotions tied to their experiences. “I feel that we were so used to living with the effects of the stresses it was just part of who we were,” Ms. Martin said. Today, a similar silent and stoic response surrounds suicide, especially in Catholic communities where ending one’s own life is still widely considered a sin. After her 15-year-old daughter killed herself in 2005 in the rural county of Tyrone, Catherine McBennet started the Niamh Louise Foundation, a suicide support charity in her daughter’s name, which she says has made a big difference in raising awareness. “But we still have a long way to go, especially in rural Northern Ireland,” she said. Eamonn Baker, who works for a peace building foundation and who has dedicated more than three decades of his life to conflict resolution in the area, is still haunted by the events he experienced in his hometown, Derry, on Jan. 30, 1972 — Bloody Sunday, one of the most violent days of the conflict. Growing up, like many who lived through the conflict, he dealt with the trauma by turning to alcohol. But now he takes a positive approach by working to bring people from both sides of the conflict together to establish a dialogue. For many, the process of reconciliation has been cathartic, but the trauma of the conflict is still so deeply embedded in society that many still struggle with the emotions tied to their experiences. “The past sits like a weight on the present,” Mr. Baker said. “It’s a big challenge to live in the present.” Allison McCann contributed reporting.']","Haunted by a violent past, the territory has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

Stabbings Around London Bridge Kill 2 in ‘Terrorist Incident’,2019-11-29,By Mark Landler and Megan Specia,"['LONDON — The police shot and killed a man wearing a fake bomb on London Bridge on Friday, after two people were fatally stabbed in what the police called a terrorist incident, jolting Britain’s capital two weeks before a general election and three days before world leaders were to gather here for a NATO summit meeting. The chaotic eruption of violence drew in several police officers and civilians, sent scores of panicked pedestrians fleeing from the bridge and nearby streets on both sides of the Thames, and evoked memories of an eerily similar terrorist attack on the same bridge in 2017 that killed eight people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who halted his campaign to rush back to 10 Downing Street, declared “this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack.” He paid tribute to the bravery of the passers-by who he said intervened to prevent further bloodshed. Dramatic video posted on social media showed a crowd surrounding a man, whom they appeared to have tackled. As they wrestled with and held the man to the ground, at least three police officers responded with their guns drawn.  The police pulled the other people away from the man on the ground, and then an officer appeared to fire at least one shot, hitting the man and prompting screams from bystanders. The man died at the scene, the police said. Government officials said the man had previously been convicted of an Islamist terrorism-related offense. He had been in prison and was released on condition that he wear an electronic tag, according to several reports. Early Saturday, the police identified the suspect as Usman Khan, 28, and said that no other suspect was being sought. “It has been declared a terrorist incident,” said Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. “I must stress, however, that we retain an open mind as to any motive.” There had been reports that the man was wearing an explosive device, Mr. Basu said, but the police determined that it was “a hoax explosive device” strapped to his body.  “What’s remarkable about the images we’ve seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them,” said Mayor Sadiq Khan of London. It was not clear if the passers-by saw the phony device and decided to tackle the man anyway.  On Friday evening, the police reported that two people died after being stabbed, and that three others had been injured.  The Metropolitan Police said that around 2 p.m., they responded to reports of a knife attack in Fishmongers’ Hall, a grand Greek Revival building that sits just at the north end of London Bridge and is often used for events. On Friday, a criminal justice group whose members are former Cambridge University academics was meeting there. “The circumstances, as we currently understand them, are that the attacker attended an event earlier on Friday afternoon at Fishmonger’s Hall called ‘Learning Together,’” said Mr. Basu, the assistant police commissioner, in a statement early Saturday morning. “We believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge, where he was detained and subsequently confronted and shot by armed officers.” A woman who said she was in the hall described an almost surreal scene, posting on Twitter that after the attack began, another man grabbed a five-foot-long narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to confront the attacker.  Later, on the bridge, as the crowd was trying to subdue the assailant, bystanders captured images of a man standing with a long white pole, which the woman in the hall, Amy Coop, said was the narwhal tusk.  Video captured by bystanders also showed another man, in a suit and tie, appearing to grab a knife and retreat as the police approached.  The police have made no further arrests, and it has been widely reported that the man who picked up the knife was involved in trying to end the attack.  Police vehicles blocked both sides of the roadway on London Bridge, which is one of the city’s busiest arteries and a popular crossing for tourists and other pedestrians.  As the police cordoned off the area, empty buses and abandoned vehicles remained parked on the bridge. In the nearby Borough Market, a food and drink space popular with tourists, visitors were told to shelter in place, before eventually being evacuated.  Mr. Johnson, speaking before an emergency security meeting on Friday night, said it was a “mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early and it is very important that we get out of that habit and that we enforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists.” Earlier this month, the British government downgraded the national terrorism threat level to substantial from severe for the first time since 2014. A substantial threat still means that authorities regard an attack as likely, but that decision may come under fresh scrutiny in the context of an election campaign. The episode bore a disquieting similarity to the 2017 attack on the bridge, in which a van careered onto the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians, before three attackers leaped from the vehicle and struck people with knives. They killed eight people before being killed by the police. Those men were also wearing fake suicide vests. Earlier that year, a car plowed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge. Six people, including the attacker, were killed. The 2017 London Bridge attack, which was carried out by three assailants inspired by the Islamic State, came in the final weeks of Britain’s last election, and it rapidly became a political issue. The Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the prime minister at the time, Theresa May, of cutting the number of police officers in Britain.  Mrs. May’s Conservative Party, which had begun the campaign with a robust lead in the polls, saw its edge steadily evaporate, and Mrs. May ended up losing her parliamentary majority.  London has long experience of terrorist attacks, and its residents pride themselves on keeping their cool. On Friday evening, pubs across the city filled up with their usual after-work crowds. But the attack left the city uneasy because so many details about the assailant remain unknown.  It also came only days before President Trump and other leaders are scheduled to visit the city for a NATO summit meeting. On Tuesday, Queen Elizabeth II plans to hold a reception marking the alliance’s 70th anniversary at Buckingham Palace. After the 2017 attack, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Khan for what the president falsely claimed was the mayor’s lackadaisical response. Mr. Khan called on the government to cancel Mr. Trump’s state visit later that year. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Khan said, “We must — and we will — stay resolute in our determination to stand strong and united in the face of terror. Those who seek to attack us and divide us will never succeed.” The attack, which happened on a sunny Friday afternoon, unfolded with an air of unreality.  John McManus, a BBC reporter who was crossing the bridge at the time of the incident, told the news outlet he had seen a group of men involved in a fight with another man on the bridge. The police then arrived, and “a number of shots were fired at this man.” Matthew Marchand, 37, whose office faces the bridge, said it was “scary to think that this happens on your doorstep somehow.” “It puts you back on edge,” Mr. Marchand said. “Every single attack makes you feel a little worse about safety.” He said he was surprised that such an episode could happen despite the safety measures put in place after previous terrorist attacks. “But it must have unfolded so quickly. What can you do about it?” he said. Mr. Johnson issued a statement thanking the police and emergency services for their “immediate response” and said he was being kept updated. He told the BBC he had suspended his campaigning on Friday and would decide over the next few hours when to return to the trail. Mr. Corbyn also halted his campaign. “We must remain united across all our communities and we cannot let our democratic process be derailed by acts of terror,” he said in a statement. Those in the area around London Bridge described the panic in the moments after the attack. Noa Bodner, who was stuck in a restaurant near London Bridge, told BBC News that those sheltering inside had been told to keep away from the windows.  “There was a rush of people coming in, and everybody basically dived under the tables,” she said. The manager ran to lock the doors, and employees told people to move away from the front of the restaurant. Susan Vinn, 57, said that she had been outside her office shortly after 2 p.m., when she saw people running across the bridge and into her office lobby. “It’s horrible,” she said of the attacks that have rattled London in recent years. “We know it’s going to happen again, we just don’t know when, so that keeps us worried for sure.”  Elian Peltier contributed reporting from London and Michael Dailey from New York.']","The authorities said that several people were stabbed, two fatally, and that the police shot and killed a man who appeared to have been wearing “a hoax explosive device.”"
Assange to Testify on Being Recorded in Embassy in London,2019-12-01,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — This much has become clear in recent weeks: When Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was living in Ecuador’s embassy in London, someone was spying on him, recording his private conversations. The question is: Who ordered the surveillance? Mr. Assange — in jail in Britain and facing prosecution in the United States — is scheduled to testify remotely later this month before a Spanish judge in a criminal case accusing a Spanish security company of eavesdropping on him illegally. The Spanish court case has revealed a new set of secrets in the international saga of Mr. Assange, 48, showing that his claims of being spied on were not just paranoia or a publicity stunt. But as with all things related to someone who has been labeled a villain and a hero, a prophet and a crank, the revelations are subject to conflicting interpretations. In Spain’s National Court, a public prosecutor and Mr. Assange’s lawyers have presented a raft of evidence that he was recorded while in the Ecuadorean Embassy, which they say violated his right to privacy. The material includes video recordings, reviewed by The New York Times, in which his conversations with visitors are audible. The prosecutor and Mr. Assange’s allies argue that the C.I.A. was behind the spying. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment. After President Trump took office in 2017, the C.I.A. began espionage aimed at Mr. Assange, WikiLeaks and their ties to Russian intelligence, and the Justice Department began building a criminal case against him. But it remains unclear whether it was the Americans who were behind bugging the embassy. The case adds another layer of complexity to the legal travails of Mr. Assange, who has been indicted in the United States on charges of espionage and hacking that exposed classified national security secrets. The Justice Department has asked Britain to extradite him, and British courts have begun considering the request. His lawyers plan to introduce evidence from the Spanish case into the extradition case, arguing that it should block the British government from turning him over to the Americans. They say that the surveillance includes recordings of privileged conversations Mr. Assange had with his lawyers and doctors, and proves that he cannot receive a fair trial in the United States. The British courts are unlikely to accept that argument, according to Amy Jeffress, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter in Washington and a former Justice Department attaché at the American Embassy in London. She said the legal standard is whether extradition would comply with Britain’s Human Rights Act, which protects the right to privacy but balances it against considerations like national security and fighting crime. Mr. Assange is scheduled to testify on Dec. 20 by videoconference from Westminster Magistrates’ Court before Judge José de la Mata some 800 miles away, in Spain’s National Court in Madrid. The judge is handling the investigation into UC Global, a Spanish firm that was in charge of security at the Ecuadorean Embassy during Mr. Assange’s long stay there. David Morales, who founded UC Global after many years in the Spanish military, was indicted in October, charged with privacy violation, bribery and money laundering. He denied wrongdoing, and Judge de la Mata released him pending a trial, but ordered him to surrender his passport and report regularly to the authorities. One of Mr. Morales’s early security jobs was protecting the daughters of Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador at the time, who were living in Europe. That paved the way for a contract with Ecuador’s embassy in London. In 2017, Mr. Morales overhauled the security equipment and procedures at the embassy, replacing surveillance cameras with new ones that had microphones, according to a 61-page court filing by the public prosecutor. Mr. Assange was repeatedly assured by Ecuadorean officials that he was not being recorded. In reality, he was. He took precautions like using a white noise device in an attempt to mask conversations, and the Spanish prosecutor says UC Global took steps to counteract them. The company put microphones in embassy restrooms, where Mr. Assange sometimes held meetings for greater privacy, the court filing says. And it states that UC Global placed a microphone in a meeting room, hidden in a fire extinguisher, that could record up to 12 hours of sound. Recordings were  sent to the company’s headquarters in Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain, the prosecution says — a charge that Mr. Morales denies. When he was detained, the police also raided his home and company, and have since been decrypting emails and information from his confiscated cellphone. The court case also relies on the testimony of some former employees of UC Global who have been granted witness protection. They said that Mr. Morales traveled to the United States once or twice a month, carrying with him hard disks containing recordings from inside the London embassy. Mr. Morales repeatedly ordered them not to talk with Ecuadorean officials about his trips, they said. In the court filing, the prosecution asserts that Mr. Morales returned from a security fair in Las Vegas in 2015, gathered his employees and told them that UC Global was going to work “for the dark side,” which he explained as referring to the United States authorities. He signed a contract with Las Vegas Sands, the casino and resort company of Sheldon Adelson, and the prosecution contends that Mr. Morales passed information about Mr. Assange to security officials at the company, saying it acted as a go-between with the C.I.A. In his hearing before the Spanish judge, Mr. Morales said that any secret recording made at the London embassy was done on behalf of Ecuador’s secret service and with the knowledge of the ambassador. The Ecuadorean government has flatly denied spying on Mr. Assange. Asked by the judge why his company had set up a remote access server to allow the transfer of information gathered within the embassy, Mr. Morales said that “there was absolutely no outside access.” Mr. Morales is accused of bribing an embassy official, paying the official about $22,000 monthly to send positive reports about UC Global’s surveillance work back to the authorities in Quito. WikiLeaks gained worldwide attention in 2010, when it published a vast cache of classified material taken from American military computer systems, most of it about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That year, Swedish prosecutors sought to arrest and question Mr. Assange on sexual assault accusations, which he said were fabricated as a pretext for handing him to the United States. Mr. Assange, who was in Britain at the time, surrendered to the British police, posted bail and fought extradition to Sweden. But in 2012, fearing that he would lose that case, he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and Mr. Correa’s government granted it. Mr. Assange stayed there for nearly seven years, skipping court appearances, forfeiting his bail and continuing to run WikiLeaks. Recently, the Swedes dropped their investigation, saying that the evidence was too weak for a prosecution. In 2016, WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic Party emails that damaged the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Russian spies had hacked the party’s computers, according to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, but Mr. Assange denies any link to Russian intelligence. As Mr. Assange’s relations with his Ecuadorean hosts deteriorated, President Lenín Moreno, who succeeded Mr. Correa in 2017, pressured him to leave. In April this year, Ecuador revoked Mr. Assange’s asylum, and the British police arrested him. He was convicted of bail-jumping and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. Mr. Assange contends he is a journalist, publishing what he receives from his sources, and not responsible if they have obtained it illegally. The Obama administration reluctantly accepted that argument. The Trump administration rejects it, and charges that in addition, he aided the illegal 2010 hacking.  David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London, and Charlie Savage and Julian E. Barnes from Washington.']","Recordings have emerged of private conversations that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, had while living in the Ecuadorean Embassy.

Beloved Berlin Currywurst Stand Delivers a Bite of History,2019-11-29,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — The night the Berlin Wall fell, 30 years ago this month, Waltraud Ziervogel’s husband, Kurt, came home with the news and urged his wife to join him in the joyous celebrations and a stroll through West Berlin, suddenly accessible to them for the first time in nearly three decades. “I said, ‘Are you crazy?’ and I went to bed because I had the early shift,” said Ms. Ziervogel.  It may have been lost on her just then, but the world changed that night. When she pulled up the metal blinds of her sausage snack business at 4:30 a.m., the usually busy corner — just 400 yards from the wall — was even busier. “It was like a big party. Everyone was up and happy and partying, and many wanted to buy a sausage — but I wasn’t allowed to take West money,” she said. Three decades, tens of thousands of pork sausages and boatloads of curry-flavored ketchup later, Konnopke’s, the sausage stand under a subway overpass in the heart of Prenzlauer Berg that started its life in 1930 is still there, a monument to a working-class Berlin that has been all but priced out of existence — the all-night bars replaced by banks, upscale kitchen stores and vegan restaurants. Like many other citizens of East Germany who found themselves facing the challenges of a capitalist system with little preparation, Ms. Ziervogel, who was 53 when the wall fell, was forced to adapt. But unlike most, she was already a successful businesswoman responsible for more than a dozen employees when the wall fell. Still, the transition was hard. Her supply chain collapsed overnight, there were new taxes and new city regulations, and the changing tastes of her clientele. When the city rebuilt the subway viaduct that towers over the stand in 2010, officials tried to get her to change locations permanently. She resisted. “I like to call it the golden West,” Ms. Ziervogel said sarcastically during an interview in her garden, where in the early years she grew tomatoes for ketchup that was unavailable in the communist state. After a long fight with city officials, she managed to get permission to rebuild her stand completely in 2010 and reopened it early the next year. In the entire neighborhood, only a handful of retail businesses have survived the last three decades. As the international lineup of hungry customers on most days (Konnopke’s is closed on Sunday) can attest, Ms. Ziervogel has not only survived but thrived. Although it is hard to tell now, Prenzlauer Berg was a working-class district home to communists even before World War II. In the 1970s and ’80s, as the often war-damaged housing stock became increasingly decrepit and people moved away, the neighborhood became virtually the only place in East Germany where bohemian, gay and party scenes could take hold. Many leaders of the 1989 peaceful revolution lived there. “Even East Berlin, which was such an overly controlled, horrible space, did allow these little pockets of tolerance,” said Alexandra Richie, an Oxford-trained historian who has written a history of Berlin. Konnopke’s, which sits on a 50-foot median at the intersection of three major roads, remains the heart of the neighborhood. Celebrities, politicians and tourists regularly make the pilgrimage there. On its round birthdays (next year it will be its 90th), the company throws big street parties that are attended by local dignitaries, neighbors and longtime customers. Before the wall fell, the stand’s 4:30 a.m. opening was timed to catch not early risers, but late-night revelers coming from the Schoppenstube, the iconic East Berlin gay bar. “It was an exception — most of the rest of East Berlin had a curfew,” said Harald Hauswald, a street photographer who lived close to Konnopke’s in the 1980s and knew the neighborhood well. But the staff had to work quickly. Before long, another bar, the Lolott, whose clientele was prone to fighting, would close, and they had to make sure the two very different crowds would not meet. “We didn’t want anyone to get attacked,” said Heike Bucholz, 52, who has been working at Konnopke’s since 1984. “When I hear someone call me Waltraud, I know its one of my old night customers,” said Ms. Ziervogel. When Max Konnopke, Ms. Ziervogel’s father, started the business in 1930, he struggled at first. But one day he decided to load up his mobile kitchen into a trailer and haul it behind his motorcycle nearly 300 miles to Nuremberg, where he heard that the Nazi party was holding a big meeting. As described in an official history published by Ms. Ziervogel and her daughter, Dagmar Konnopke (who took her mother’s maiden name after a divorce), her father was mistrustful of the Nazis, but the Nuremberg rally proved a boon for his business, giving him the means to expand. Ms. Ziervogel married her husband, Kurt, who is now deceased, in 1957. They had two children: Dagmar, now 53, and Mario, now 56. Ms. Ziervogel formally took over in Prenzlauer Berg in 1976 (a second outlet in Weissensee was given to her brother and later sold), when her father retired. He died at 84, three years before the wall fell.  But the biggest challenge came in 1990 with the reunification of East and West Germany. Not just because of a new set of suppliers, taxes and rules, but because a new universe of customers expected a different set of offerings.  Konnopke’s started selling French fries. The currywurst, which used to be served with a bun and a hot mug of broth, is now cut up and served on a paper plate. (A tiny plastic fork is provided.)  Wedding parties can now reserve tables in a roofed-over pavilion, which was opened in 2011, after the last major renovation, and seats 35. “I put out tablecloths and little bouquets,” said Ms. Ziervogel. And there are now vegan currywursts. “Frau Ziervogel fought like a bull to keep this place,” said Dieter Kohl, a regular customer from before the fall of the wall, who on a recent autumn day shared a currywurst meal with his wife. Mr. Kohl left the neighborhood years ago but still makes the occasional trek to Konnopke’s.  He’s not the only longtime Berliner who keeps coming back.  On the outside wall of the gold-colored-metal shop hangs a black-and-white postcard picture featuring a much smaller stand in the 1960s (before two rebuilds, in 1983 and 2010). In the shot, a young boy looks  up at the store in front of him as his mother faces away from the camera. “At least once a week, we have someone telling us: ‘I’m that little boy,’” Ms. Konnopke said. Even now, Ms. Ziervogel is not done fighting. Starting this month, the city of Berlin decreed that she would have to remove four picnic tables because they were occupying space on a public walkway.  “Where will my customers sit?” said Ms. Ziervogel, who is certain that once the good weather comes around Konnopke’s will suffer a drop in revenue because of the missing seating.  Ms. Ziervogel predicted that the city tabloids would raise a storm about the missing benches, pressuring the city bureaucracy into reversing itself. It would not be the first time. In 2012, the tabloids went wild over a fight between Ms. Ziervogel and her son, Mario, over naming rights for a currywurst business he opened just half a mile from the original site. The tabloids titled the affair the “Currywurst War.”  After six decades on her feet, Ms. Ziervogel prefers worrying about the books and the laws, leaving the day-to-day grind of running the business to her daughter. “We have the fire brigade down the street, so we get those big fire truck sirens blasting by us at least eight times a day,” Ms. Konnopke said. “And then the subways right overhead, the trams, the traffic and the heat. It is physically exhausting.”']","For 43 years, Waltraud Ziervogel has presided over Konnopke’s, the iconic sausage business that her father started in 1930 in what became East Berlin."
