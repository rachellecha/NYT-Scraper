‘Nowhere Else to Go’: Some Defy Warnings to Flee Australian Fires,2020-01-03,"By Isabella Kwai, Livia Albeck-Ripka, Jamie Tarabay and Matthew Abbott","['NOWRA, Australia — The smoke is still smoldering from the wildfires that ravaged the small seaside town of Broulee, Australia, on New Year’s Eve, when sand dunes erupted into flames and entire neighborhoods were decimated.  Water and food is running low. Shops are taking only cash, and radio is the main source of information. The fires could intensify this weekend, as strong winds and high temperatures threaten to create even more dire conditions in the town and more than a dozen others. Clarinda Campbell and her two children left Broulee and headed for safety. Her husband, James, stayed behind to defend their home.  “I feel like it’s not real,” said Ms. Campbell, who was with her children at a family property in Surf Beach, about eight miles away. “I’ve gone to sleep every night and woken up every morning hoping that it was just a bad dream.” The authorities urged tens of thousands of people, mainly along Australia’s southeastern coast, to evacuate before this weekend, which is expected to be one of the worst periods in the country’s already catastrophic fire season. The populations of many of these towns swell during the holidays with travelers looking for a break at the beach.  Not all residents were heeding the warnings to leave. Some wanted to protect their homes from the blazes. Others worried that fleeing could put them in more danger if they ran out of fuel, encountered fallen trees or ended up in another fire zone on the clogged roads. While the past few months have been particularly bad, Australians are accustomed to the unpredictable nature of wildfires, an annual occurrence on what is the most arid continent on Earth. Many are therefore willing to take their chances, to the dismay of officials. Rob Rogers, the deputy fire services commissioner for the state of New South Wales, was blunt: There would be no help for anyone who ignored the warnings to leave. “We’ve been very honest about the risk, but if people choose to stay, that’s on them,” he said at a briefing on Friday. “Do not expect there to be a fire truck when you ring.” When the fires swept through on New Year’s Eve, Bernard Kreet huddled with 300 others at the local golf club, waiting to see the damage in the suburb of Catalina, where he lives. In the end, Mr. Kreet said that about 20 homes had been destroyed. Power was just restored on Thursday.  With concern of more fires, tourists were asked to leave the area, and many locals followed. Mr. Kreet said he thought the town would be spared, even if he expected further disruptions and supply limitations. He is hosting two families who have evacuated from other places. “It’s so hard to get out of town,” he said, adding that the roads in many seaside towns were not built to handle so many travelers. “It’s chaos down here.” Communities have rallied together, knowing that they will have to depend on one another. They are holding neighborhood meetings to come up with contingency plans in case the fires get worse and they need to head to safer ground. They are sharing food and supplies, and taking others into their homes. Justin Brady had moved to Mallacoota in the state of Victoria just a few months ago, building a beach shack in the vacation spot he had been visiting for 25 years. It was destroyed on New Year’s Eve, when the skies there turned blood red from the fires.  The roads to the town are unpassable, with trees down and embers still burning. The government is evacuating thousands from the coast via a Navy ship. The first boatload carrying about 60 people was expected to land early Saturday in Mornington Peninsula, according to Sam Hearn, the region’s mayor. Hundreds more, together with their pets, were expected to arrive on a larger naval vessel that afternoon, he added. “I’ve made the decision to stay because I’ve got nowhere else to go,” Mr. Brady said.  He has been staying with family, with three generations under one roof. A musician, Mr. Brady has been teaching the grandchildren harmonica to cheer them up. “I feel like there’s stuff I can do here,” he said. Mr. Brady and others in Mallacoota know that staying is a risk, especially given the potential for more fires. There was initially a warning that the town’s water supply had to be boiled. While that has been lifted, the power is still out.  Across Australia, the threat of more damage is significant. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service on Friday drastically expanded its estimate of the amount of land at risk from spreading fires. The weekend is expected to bring high winds and temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 38 Celsius. The combination of drought, heat and wind has made for an especially ferocious fire season. While the wildfires started in the bushland, tinder-like vegetation dried from years of drought then incinerated under heavy winds, spreading blazes toward cities, across farmland and even into lush rainforests.  The fire season, which usually follows a predictable pattern, has turned into a volatile disaster with no clear ending. On Friday afternoon, people were told to evacuate Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia State, where at least one fire had ravaged a national park, destroying about 35,000 acres. It was still burning freely, the authorities said.  Fires now ring much of Australia’s east and southeastern coasts.  The streets of Broulee, normally bustling with people, are eerily quiet. About 80 percent of residents have left, estimated Mr. Campbell, who had called a meeting of neighbors to discuss their plans for the fires this weekend. If a fire approached from the south, it would block the town’s usual exits and push residents down to the beach.  To help protect his home, he borrowed equipment from a former firefighter neighbor across the street, put water into buckets and hooked up a fire pump to the backyard pool, which holds about 6,600 gallons. “You shouldn’t have to deal with this once in a lifetime, let alone twice in a week,” he said. His parents lost most of their property in nearby Jeremadra, although their home was somehow saved.  “You can’t imagine what it looks like,” he said. “Just matchsticks. The trees are all burned. Where there was dense undergrowth is now just sand.” On Saturday, Ms. Campbell will wait nervously for her husband to call to say that he is safe. During the fires, cellphone services are especially spotty, if they exist at all. He will have to go to a nearby hilltop to get reception.  “I’m trying to get word to him to say I want him to leave,” Ms. Campbell said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.” Isabella Kwai reported from Nowra, Livia Albeck-Ripka from Moorooduc, and Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong.']","The authorities warned of potentially worse conditions this weekend, but some residents wanted to protect their homes, while others worried about more danger if they fled."
Netanyahu Seeks Immunity From Israeli Corruption Charges,2020-01-01,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Fighting for his future, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday asked Parliament to grant him immunity from prosecution in three graft cases, a rare and contentious step that critics say violates the principle of equality before the law. The immunity request is the latest twist in the political and legal drama that has paralyzed the Israeli government. Long famed for his survival skills, Mr. Netanyahu is taking the risky move to fend off charges that imperil his legacy and could eventually land him in prison. But the effort also threatens to further polarize a divided nation and prolong the political deadlock that has left the country without a fully functioning government for nearly a year.  Submitted barely three hours before the legal deadline, the immunity request could delay for months the criminal cases against Mr. Netanyahu, who faces a general election in two months, the country’s third in less than a year. If it is approved, immunity could keep him out of court for as long as he remains a member of Parliament. [Update: Benny Gantz, breaking vows, says he would serve under Netanyahu.] Mr. Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing. He had kept the country guessing about his next move, apparently wary that an immunity request could endanger his re-election prospects and that of his conservative Likud party by fueling accusations that he was putting himself above the law.  In an effort to limit the political damage, Mr. Netanyahu played down the impact of his request. Delivering a statement live on television during prime time, he insisted it was a “temporary” measure that would be valid for only one term of Parliament.  He said immunity was meant to prevent “political indictments whose purpose is to impair the will of the people,” adding, “Unfortunately, that’s what happened in my case.”  Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, is running for a fourth consecutive term in an election set for March 2. The country has no limits on the number of terms a prime minister or lawmaker can serve. The campaign, largely focused on Mr. Netanyahu’s fate, was already expected to be divisive. Two earlier elections, in April and September 2019, ended inconclusively, with neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party, able to muster the majority needed to form a viable government.  “I never imagined we would see the day when a prime minister of Israel would avoid standing before the law and the courts,” Mr. Gantz said in a televised statement immediately after Mr. Netanyahu’s announcement.  “Today it is clear what we are fighting for,” Mr. Gantz said. “Netanyahu knows he’s guilty.” He said the choice was between “immunity before all else or the citizens of Israel before all else; between the kingdom of Netanyahu or the state of Israel.” Mr. Netanyahu is accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for illicit gifts of cigars, champagne and jewelry, as well as positive news coverage. He has long argued that the criminal investigations against him are the result of a witch hunt led by elitist forces trying to oust him through “fake news” in the liberal media and through the courts. The charges have dented Mr. Netanyahu’s aura of invincibility, but he has bounced back before. In the 2006 general election, he led Likud to a disastrous result, with the party winning only 12 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. Mr. Netanyahu returned Likud to power just three years later, though, and he has remained in office ever since. In July he surpassed Israel’s founding leader, David Ben-Gurion, as the country’s longest-serving premier.  Mr. Netanyahu had zigzagged for months on the question of immunity, aware of its unpopularity and the pitfalls of appearing to evade justice. He dismissed the idea before the April election, to avoid handing the opposition damaging campaign fodder. But this week, as the deadline for his request approached, he declared that immunity was a “foundation stone of democracy.” Many countries, including Israel, have immunity laws to protect lawmakers’ freedom of action and speech in the course of their parliamentary duties. In Israel, a lawmaker can also seek immunity, under certain circumstances, for alleged crimes not committed in the line of parliamentary duty for as long as the accused is a member of Parliament. The circumstances listed in the law include an indictment that is not drafted in good faith or is discriminatory, to protect lawmakers from politically motivated prosecution. Miki Zohar, Likud’s chief whip, said this week that Mr. Netanyahu was the victim of persecution on ideological grounds, and that he appeared to have laid the groundwork for such an argument with his assertions of a witch hunt. Immunity that defends a lawmaker’s freedom of speech is indeed “a constitutional institution that is very important,” said Suzie Navot, a professor of constitutional law at the Striks School of Law near Tel Aviv. “But that is not the kind of immunity that Netanyahu is talking about.” Under Israel’s immunity law, which was amended in 2005, lawmakers no longer have automatic immunity but must seek it from a parliamentary body known as a House Committee, whose decision must then be ratified by a simple majority in Parliament. The current, caretaker government has not formed a House Committee, and there may not be one to discuss a request by Mr. Netanyahu for weeks or months after the March election, until a new government can be formed. Court proceedings against Mr. Netanyahu would be frozen until any immunity request could be heard. It is not clear whether Mr. Netanyahu could secure a parliamentary majority to grant him immunity. Avigdor Liberman, leader of the right-wing Israel Beiteinu party that used to be allied with Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud, and whose votes Mr. Netanyahu would need, said on Wednesday night that he would not support Mr. Netanyahu’s bid for immunity. Ms. Navot, the constitutional law expert, said the parliamentary process of granting immunity is quasi-judicial, requiring evidence to back up the arguments of the person requesting it, and takes place under judicial review.  It would be hard to prove that law enforcement authorities acted in bad faith in the Netanyahu cases, she said, given the caution that Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit had shown in handling the indictment. Mr. Mandelblit was appointed by Mr. Netanyahu. Granting Mr. Netanyahu immunity, Ms. Navot said, would be “a fatal blow to the rule of law and equality before the law.” No lawmaker or minister has been granted immunity since the law was amended in 2005. After Mr. Liberman was charged in 2012, as foreign minister, with fraud and breach of trust in an episode involving the promotion of an ambassador, he resigned. He was later acquitted in court and returned to his post. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, resigned in 2008, under pressure from rivals within his own government, even before he was indicted on corruption charges. He was ultimately convicted and went to prison. On Tuesday, Israel’s Supreme Court held a preliminary hearing on whether a prime ministerial candidate charged with serious crimes can even be tapped to form a new government. The hearing came in response to a petition filed by dozens of members of Israel’s high-tech industry and academia.  The court delayed issuing any ruling, even on whether it would take the case, suggesting that the judges might weigh in only if the question becomes less hypothetical after the election. The timing is delicate: Any ruling could potentially be seen as interfering in an election campaign, and the judges are already under pressure from conservative forces that are fighting to curb the court’s influence. In a video released Monday night, Mr. Netanyahu warned the court not to fall into what he called a political trap laid by people trying to foil his candidacy. “In a democracy,” he said, “the people are the only ones who decide who leads the people, and nobody else.”']","His request to Parliament is a rare move, and a potentially unpopular one, heading into a general election. But it could keep the Israeli leader out of court."
"As India Violence Gets Worse, Police Are Accused of Abusing Muslims",2020-01-02,By Kai Schultz and Sameer Yasir,"['NAGINA, India — The teens were trapped. As the protest broke up, Indian police officers in the town of Nagina chased a group of Muslim teenagers into an empty house. They grabbed them and took them to a makeshift jail. And then, the boys and community leaders said, the officers tortured them. Four of the boys, who ranged in age from 13 to 17, said in interviews with The New York Times that police officers used wooden canes to beat them and threatened to kill them for taking part in demonstrations against a divisive citizenship law that has fueled rallies and rioting across India. Three had obvious signs of deep bruising or other injuries.  Many Indians fear that the new law, which is seen as a huge political victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist base, is blatantly discriminatory toward Muslims and threatens the very foundation of India as a secular and tolerant nation.  In Uttar Pradesh, the northern Indian state where Nagina is and the one with the most Muslim residents, the rioting has been among the most intense, and the violent backlash from the police has been the most deadly and troubling.  According to accounts by the detained boys in Nagina, along with family members and other officials in their town who spoke to them immediately after they were released, police officers over the course of 30 hours terrorized them and others who had been demonstrating on Dec. 20. Police officials in the town deny that any abuse happened, or that minors had been detained at all around that time.  According to two of the boys, the officers laughed during beatings, saying, “You will die in this prison.” “They were so scared that hardly anyone could speak,” said Khalil-ur-Rehman, a municipal officer in Nagina who met the children at a police station as soon as they were released on Dec. 22. “How do you justify detaining minors, let alone beating them black and blue?”  As the Indian authorities struggle to contain the nationwide protests, more accounts are emerging of abuse meted out by police officers. According to interviews with more than three dozen people in several Uttar Pradesh towns, almost all the violence has been directed toward Muslim residents. More people — at least 19 — have been killed in this state during the protests than anywhere else in India.  Witnesses said that police officers opened fire on demonstrators with live ammunition, broke into houses and stole money, and threatened to rape women. The BBC aired footage showing police officers knocking down security cameras in a Muslim neighborhood and shattering the windows of parked cars.  The Indian news media has reported that Uttar Pradesh police officers were encouraged by their superiors to kill protesters engaged in violence, but that innocent people were also targeted. In one case, officers smacked a 72-year-old Muslim man with a rifle butt, telling him, “Muslims have only two places: Pakistan or the graveyard.” Harsh Mander, a human rights activist who formerly worked in India’s civil service, said he visited homes resembling “wastelands,” where the police had destroyed kitchens, smashed television sets and threatened to seize property. He said the authorities had interpreted the citizenship law as giving them license to force Muslims into neighboring Pakistan and, as they see it, “settle the unfinished business of Partition.” “The police have become a lynch mob,” he said. Police and state officials have denied using excessive force or singling out Muslims. They have emphasized the need to preserve order and protect innocent people against “radical groups” with “deep-rooted conspiracies” to commit violent acts.  “The kind of action the government is taking against rioters has become an example for the entire country,” read a Friday tweet from the office of Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister and a close ally of Mr. Modi.  But many residents accuse Uttar Pradesh officials of mounting an organized campaign to terrify Muslims into submission. The new citizenship bill, which creates a special path for non-Muslim migrants in India to receive citizenship, has provoked the biggest backlash Mr. Modi has faced since becoming prime minister in 2014. In Uttar Pradesh, where destructive riots erupted and protesters vandalized property, there is a growing number of accounts of police officers having been given the green light by senior officials to use harsh measures. In an audio recording that some residents and officials say features the voice of Sanjeev Tyagi, the superintendent of police in the Bijnor district, which includes Nagina, a man orders police officers to “break the arms and legs of those throwing stones at police stations.”  “Go and fix them,” he said.  Mr. Tyagi looked surprised and a bit disturbed when asked, during an interview with The New York Times, about this recording. He declined to say whether his was the voice on the recording, which one officer,  who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, said had been radioed out to the police force. Since then it has been widely shared on social media.  After India’s Parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act on Dec. 11, hundreds of thousands of protesters poured into the streets in many cities across the country to oppose the law, which favors every major South Asian faith over Islam. Mr. Modi has defended the law, saying that it would not strip citizenship from India’s Muslims and that it was intended to help religious minorities fleeing persecution in neighboring Muslim-majority countries. He said those protesting the bill were “spreading lies.”  On Dec. 19, Mr. Adityanath, a monk and staunch Hindu nationalist, publicly urged the state police to “take revenge” on protesters who were vandalizing public property. Mr. Adityanath has called Muslims “a crop of two-legged animals that has to be stopped.” During his tenure as chief minister, the state police have killed dozens of suspects in altercations known in India as police “encounters.” On the afternoon of Dec. 20, as Friday Prayer ended and people began to hit the streets across Uttar Pradesh to protest the citizenship bill, violence exploded in several towns at the same time. Thousands of officers were deployed.  At the Jama mosque in Nagina, protesters soon found themselves surrounded by the police. More than a hundred were detained and bused to an empty badminton court, where they were beaten with bamboo canes, witnesses said.  At least 21 teenagers were among the group, according to the four boys who were interviewed. Adult family members were with them during the interviews.  One of the detainees, a 15-year-old boy who showed reporters deep bruises on his leg, said police officers seemed most provoked by those who did not initially cry.  “Everyone was screaming,” said the boy, whose identity is being withheld because he is a minor and fears punishment by officials. “They forced us to drink bottles of water and then they would beat us when we asked to go to the bathroom.” Another detainee, a 16-year-old with a bandaged hand that he believed had been broken, said that a few police officers had tried to stop the abuse but were outnumbered. He said officers seemed to enjoy depriving them of sleep and making them cold.  In the interview, Mr. Tyagi, the police superintendent for the Bijnor district, denied that minors were among the people detained then, calling those reports “totally baseless.”  Mr. Tyagi stated that protesters in Nagina had gotten out of control, posing a risk. He shared videos that showed protesters rampaging in Bijnor’s business district, breaking store windows and vandalizing a vehicle that he said belonged to a Hindu man. Police officials said that at least 288 officers statewide were injured, including 61 from gunshot wounds. “We were worried that Hindus and Muslims were about to fight each other,” Mr. Tyagi said, pointing to the state’s long, bloody history of such riots.  Many of these towns are now filled with grief. The family of Mohammed Suleman, a young man fatally shot in a protest on Dec. 20, still can’t believe he is gone. Sitting in Mr. Suleman’s bedroom, a concrete shell filled with books, Mr. Suleman’s uncle, Anwar Usmani, broke down as he spoke about the boy, who he said woke up every day at 5 a.m. to study for the Indian civil service exam. “He wanted to serve the country that killed him,” Mr. Usmani said. Mr. Suleman’s family said that they had to beg police officials to give back his body after their vehicle was stopped on their way back home to the town of Nehtaur from a nearby city, where they had sought a doctor to try to save him.  Family members who had been in the vehicle said that Mahaveer Singh Rajawat, a law enforcement official for Nehtaur, pointed a gun at their chests and told them: “Behave and be silent, or I will declare that those who died were terrorists!” Mr. Suleman’s body was returned to them, but they were threatened by the police not to try to rouse public sympathy by publicly displaying it.  When asked about this during an interview with The Times, Mr. Rajawat abruptly left his office and drove away in a jeep. Mr. Tyagi, the superintendent of police, said he was not aware of these accusations.  Surrounded by mourning women, Mr. Suleman’s mother, Akbari Khatoon, rocked on her bed and wailed. “The police killed him in cold blood,” she said, “and that is what the world should know.” Saumya Khandelwal contributed reporting from Nagina, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.']","As demonstrations over a citizenship law sweep India, more accounts are emerging of mistreatment and harsh tactics by police and state officials."
"Israel Lauds Suleimani Assassination, Though With Caution",2020-01-03,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — For years, he was a distant adversary, overseeing attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. But as time went on, the threat from Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani loomed ever larger and closer for Israel. So the assassination of the Iranian commander in an American drone strike in Baghdad early Friday was greeted with satisfaction in Israel, though also with a degree of caution as the country went on alert for possible retaliation. General Suleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, oversaw an Iranian program to surround Israel with tens of thousands of missiles, according to experts. He was also the architect of Iran’s recent entrenchment in Syria and of an ambitious plan to build an Iranian front against Israel across its northern frontier, in the Golan Heights.  After a decades-old shadow war between Israel and Iran fought mostly through proxies or clandestine means, the new proximity brought the arch foes to direct blows. Amid the heightened tensions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cut short an official visit to Greece and returned home on Friday afternoon, while his ministers mostly kept a low profile in an apparent effort to avoid undue Iranian attention. Before boarding a plane home, Mr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”  “Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense,” he said. Israel’s recently appointed defense minister, Naftali Bennett, held consultations at military headquarters in Tel Aviv and released a photograph of the meeting that showed the participants — the military chief of staff, the Mossad chief and other security officials — perhaps to demonstrate readiness and create deterrence. As a precaution early Friday, the Israeli military announced the closing of a ski run in the Israeli-controlled portion of the northern Golan Heights that borders Syria. The heightened tensions come at a delicate time for Israel, after two inconclusive elections in April and September failed to produce a new government, and with a third vote set for March 2. The latest events have most likely provided a welcome distraction for Mr. Netanyahu. Though strong on security and hawkish on Iran, he was indicted in November in three corruption cases and is fighting for his survival. Before the American strike on Friday, the Israeli discourse was dominated by Mr. Netanyahu’s contentious request this week for parliamentary immunity from prosecution.  Still, Israeli opposition politicians lined up behind the embattled prime minister, praising Mr. Trump for his decision to take military action. Benny Gantz, a former military chief and now Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, said that in matters of state security, there was no opposition to the government.  In a statement, he described the assassination of General Suleimani as “the appropriate response to anyone responsible for the murder of countless innocent people and for undermining global stability.” General Suleimani’s net around Israel spread from the Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon to the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, where he provided support to Hamas and was the main patron of Islamic Jihad. Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, offered its condolences to Iran, saying in a statement that General Suleimani had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.” Hamas condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. Basem Naim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Israeli analysts, however, suggested that the prospect that Israel would be the immediate target of Iranian retaliation was slim.  “I don’t think the Iranians are now looking to bring more enemies into the battlefield,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. The removal of General Suleimani was important for Israel, he said, operationally and symbolically.  “It will take the Iranians some time at least to build a replacement for him,” said Mr. Amidror, who is a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America.  In addition, he said, the strike will have calmed fears in Israel about the United States’ willingness to act in the region. The assassination of General Suleimani ends a long chapter in Israeli history. Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted there were Israeli intelligence officials who had spent their whole careers tracking General Suleimani, starting as rookies and ending up as generals themselves. Israel had the opportunity to assassinate General Suleimani in the past, he said, but refrained from doing so, believing it would be seen as an act of war.  Mr. Yaari said the Trump administration had been a great friend to Israel but essentially left it to cope alone with General Suleimani’s buildup in Syria and the growing force of militant groups in Gaza. “Now,” Mr. Yaari said, “we see an American strike against the Iranian apex.”']",Israeli intelligence had long tracked the Iranian commander whose shadow loomed ever larger and closer. 
The Lesson of an Albanian Earthquake: The Balkans Aren’t Ready for the Big One,2020-01-01,,"['By Marc Santora, Kit Gillet and Joe Orovic DURRES, Albania — Still bleeding, the gash on his hand covered in dirty gauze, Xhafer Ahmetaj surveyed the mountain of rubble where his friends had been buried after an earthquake struck. Only one teenage boy was pulled out alive. Eight other members of the Lala family, including two toddlers, were killed in November’s 6.4-magnitude quake. Mr. Ahmetaj, 79, a former military officer, took in the devastation and shook his head. Nature, at its most violent, was to blame. But so, too, were people at their most greedy. “If you would have seen this place when it was a marsh, a place where people came to fish, you wouldn’t think houses could ever have been built here,” Mr. Ahmetaj said. Yet they were built — the construction often compromised by corruption — in a pattern repeated across Albania, a small Balkan nation. The Nov. 26 earthquake in Albania killed 51 people, sent hundreds to hospitals and left thousands homeless. As the shock recedes, the tragedy offers a stark warning for a region that has been devastated by much more powerful quakes in the past and that experts warn is ill-prepared for the next big one. From Bucharest in Romania to Sofia in Bulgaria and across the Balkan nations in southeastern Europe, successive governments have failed to address the risks posed by aging buildings.  Or they encouraged building booms in the 1990s, during the transition from Communism to capitalism, in which safety standards often took a back seat to a quick buck. The result is that millions of people live in homes unlikely to survive a major earthquake, experts say. Driving through the hardest hit areas after the recent earthquake in Albania, the scale of the challenge was evident. The quake had rendered poorly constructed buildings even more vulnerable, exposing tens of thousands to potential future danger. The country does not have nearly enough engineers and experts to assess all the properties that were damaged and even when the risk is known, the cost of doing needed repairs is often prohibitive in one of Europe’s poorest countries. Prime Minister Edi Rama said recently that the government was reshaping the budget to help deal with the crisis, but that international support was desperately needed. “Simply, it is humanly impossible to do this alone,” he said.  While Albania continues to reel, others in the region are using the moment to sound an alarm. Walking the streets of the old city in Bucharest, visitors with a keen eye will spot red circles — just above the eye line — on hundreds of buildings. They were put there by engineers to classify the buildings at greatest risk in the event of seismic activity. In the Romanian capital alone, 349 structures were deemed at the highest risk and likely to collapse in a major earthquake. Many of them are apartment complexes. Hundreds of other buildings are expected to suffer major structural damage. And those are just the ones that have been inspected.  “We only speak of about 300 buildings in danger of collapsing in Bucharest,’’ said Matei Sumbasacu, the founder of Re:Rise, Romania’s first nongovernmental organization focused on reducing seismic risk. “We know about another 1,600 buildings, and we don’t know how many others there are. But we are pretending that we need to resurvey them because, who knows, maybe they got stronger in the past 25 years.” “This is criminal,” he added, “and we are telling this to the people inside the buildings.” He is so passionate about the subject that he has tattooed on his right forearm the seismic data of an earthquake that rocked the country in 1977. Still, the memories of past tragedies have a way of fading. Romania experienced two devastating earthquakes in the 20th century. In 1940, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck at Vrancea, in eastern Romania, and caused widespread destruction. Then, on March 4, 1977, a 7.2-magnitude quake hit in the same region. The ensuing shock waves destroyed more than 30 high-rise buildings in Bucharest, almost 100 miles away. An estimated 1,578 people were killed, and roughly 11,000 were injured. It was one of the worst natural disasters in modern Romanian history and led to a series of reforms. Prof. Radu Vacareanu, the rector at the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest, said that no country was truly ready for a large-scale earthquake, except for perhaps Japan. Since its 1977 quake, Romania has put in place good technical regulations, with fairly rigorous enforcement, he said. But progress in retrofitting some of the most at-risk private buildings has not been as good as expected, he said, “mainly because of complicated ownership.”  “You have buildings with many owners of different apartments and it is very difficult, almost impossible in some situations, to get a consensus,” Mr. Vacareanu said. If a similar earthquake struck today, he said, the losses in terms of affected buildings and people killed would be “at least as high as in 1977.”  “We have buildings here in Bucharest that were affected by the 1940 earthquake and then the 1977 earthquake and then the 1986 earthquake,” he said. “Damage is accumulating from one to the other.”  Mr. Sumbasacu, of Re:Rise, said that the government was underestimating the risk. “We had an exercise in simulating an earthquake in 2018, and they said that over 4,000 people died,” he said. “If the authorities say that we will have 4,000 victims, and they have the role of calming the population, you can imagine the real extent and magnitude. We may easily pass the 10,000 mark for the death toll.” In Romania, the oldest buildings often pose the greatest risk. But in other countries, like Albania, it is more recent construction that worries many experts. When a relatively mild 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Bulgaria in 1986, the damage far exceeded what might have been expected. In the small town of Strazhitsa, in the country’s north, scores of houses were destroyed and most of those left standing were deemed unsafe to occupy. Thousands were made homeless. Since 2007, when Bulgaria joined the European Union, construction in the country has had to comply with the bloc’s requirements for earthquake resistance. However, much of the construction dates back to Communist times, when the authorities responded to urgent housing needs by erecting giant precast-panel residential complexes.  Built correctly and with proper maintenance, such structures might not pose an outsized risk. But that was often not the case. Then, in the 1990s, after the collapse of Communism, speculators rushed in and construction boomed. Peter Pavlov, the director of the Center for Seismic Engineering at the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy in Sofia, said that while he believed the country was better prepared than some of its neighbors, big questions remained, especially regarding the newer stock of buildings. “Some of the ground floors of those buildings got converted into stores and they added an extra floor on top of the building which might be considered an earthquake hazard,” he explained in a phone interview, just hours ahead of a trip to Albania to evaluate whether some of the homes damaged by the November quake could be habitable again. Mr. Pavlov called for setting up a national seismic laboratory whose task would be to test the resistance of buildings.  The initiative echoed the warnings of a recent report by the World Bank, which called the lack of knowledge about the seismic safety of old residential buildings in Bulgaria “a pressing matter.” Driving along the Adriatic coast, from northern Dalmatia in Croatia through Montenegro and south into Albania, the results of shifts in tectonic plates over the ages can be seen in the stunning landscape of mountains that rise sharply high above the Adriatic Sea, as if shoved out of the earth.  That landscape is still being shaped, rendering a long stretch of the Balkan coast susceptible to tremors. “The Earth is constantly shivering here,” said Professor Bozidar S. Pavicevic. Visitors to Dubrovnik are quickly educated on how tragedy helped shape the famed city after a 1667 earthquake nearly leveled the magnificent walled city, burying thousands of people and triggering fires that raged for weeks. Mr. Pavicevic, 86, had his “first encounter with destruction” during the Skopje earthquake of 1963, which left more than 1,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless.  The tragedy sparked the civil engineer’s decades-long study and fierce advocacy of taking seismic activity into account when considering new buildings, infrastructure and urban plans. The nascent field blossomed after a rash of devastating earthquakes hit the former Yugoslavia — starting with Skopje’s and ending with a 7.2-magnitude quake centered in Montenegro in 1979, which affected nearly the entire Adriatic coast. “That was a whole new category,” Mr. Pavicevic said of the quake, which he experienced near its epicenter outside the Montenegrin capital.  At the time, he was the director of Montenegro’s Institute for Urban Planning and Projects, making him a key figure in coordinating the former Yugoslav republic’s response, along with help from the United States Geological Survey. “We finally saw the phenomenal impact of an earthquake spread over a wide area,” he said, recounting the $4.5 billion in damage — equal to about four years’ worth of the small republic’s gross domestic product. “That is when seismic risk evolved into something included in spatial and urban plans,” he said. Those 20th-century earthquakes turned the Balkans into a petri dish for studying plate tectonics. Yet Mr. Pavicevic worries that the Balkans have ignored their own seismic history and the lessons it teaches. It is a feeling shared by other experts in the region, including Mr. Sumbasacu in Romania. “We need more courage, we need more political courage, because someone needs to be open about it,” he said. “We need to accept our vulnerability.” Marc Santora reported from Durres, Albania, Kit Gillet from Romania, and Joe Orovic from Croatia.

"Israel Lauds Suleimani Assassination, Though With Caution",2020-01-03,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — For years, he was a distant adversary, overseeing attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. But as time went on, the threat from Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani loomed ever larger and closer for Israel. So the assassination of the Iranian commander in an American drone strike in Baghdad early Friday was greeted with satisfaction in Israel, though also with a degree of caution as the country went on alert for possible retaliation. General Suleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, oversaw an Iranian program to surround Israel with tens of thousands of missiles, according to experts. He was also the architect of Iran’s recent entrenchment in Syria and of an ambitious plan to build an Iranian front against Israel across its northern frontier, in the Golan Heights.  After a decades-old shadow war between Israel and Iran fought mostly through proxies or clandestine means, the new proximity brought the arch foes to direct blows. Amid the heightened tensions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cut short an official visit to Greece and returned home on Friday afternoon, while his ministers mostly kept a low profile in an apparent effort to avoid undue Iranian attention. Before boarding a plane home, Mr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”  “Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense,” he said. Israel’s recently appointed defense minister, Naftali Bennett, held consultations at military headquarters in Tel Aviv and released a photograph of the meeting that showed the participants — the military chief of staff, the Mossad chief and other security officials — perhaps to demonstrate readiness and create deterrence. As a precaution early Friday, the Israeli military announced the closing of a ski run in the Israeli-controlled portion of the northern Golan Heights that borders Syria. The heightened tensions come at a delicate time for Israel, after two inconclusive elections in April and September failed to produce a new government, and with a third vote set for March 2. The latest events have most likely provided a welcome distraction for Mr. Netanyahu. Though strong on security and hawkish on Iran, he was indicted in November in three corruption cases and is fighting for his survival. Before the American strike on Friday, the Israeli discourse was dominated by Mr. Netanyahu’s contentious request this week for parliamentary immunity from prosecution.  Still, Israeli opposition politicians lined up behind the embattled prime minister, praising Mr. Trump for his decision to take military action. Benny Gantz, a former military chief and now Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, said that in matters of state security, there was no opposition to the government.  In a statement, he described the assassination of General Suleimani as “the appropriate response to anyone responsible for the murder of countless innocent people and for undermining global stability.” General Suleimani’s net around Israel spread from the Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon to the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, where he provided support to Hamas and was the main patron of Islamic Jihad. Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, offered its condolences to Iran, saying in a statement that General Suleimani had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.” Hamas condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. Basem Naim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Israeli analysts, however, suggested that the prospect that Israel would be the immediate target of Iranian retaliation was slim.  “I don’t think the Iranians are now looking to bring more enemies into the battlefield,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. The removal of General Suleimani was important for Israel, he said, operationally and symbolically.  “It will take the Iranians some time at least to build a replacement for him,” said Mr. Amidror, who is a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America.  In addition, he said, the strike will have calmed fears in Israel about the United States’ willingness to act in the region. The assassination of General Suleimani ends a long chapter in Israeli history. Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted there were Israeli intelligence officials who had spent their whole careers tracking General Suleimani, starting as rookies and ending up as generals themselves. Israel had the opportunity to assassinate General Suleimani in the past, he said, but refrained from doing so, believing it would be seen as an act of war.  Mr. Yaari said the Trump administration had been a great friend to Israel but essentially left it to cope alone with General Suleimani’s buildup in Syria and the growing force of militant groups in Gaza. “Now,” Mr. Yaari said, “we see an American strike against the Iranian apex.”']",Israeli intelligence had long tracked the Iranian commander whose shadow loomed ever larger and closer. 
The Lesson of an Albanian Earthquake: The Balkans Aren’t Ready for the Big One,2020-01-01,,"['By Marc Santora, Kit Gillet and Joe Orovic DURRES, Albania — Still bleeding, the gash on his hand covered in dirty gauze, Xhafer Ahmetaj surveyed the mountain of rubble where his friends had been buried after an earthquake struck. Only one teenage boy was pulled out alive. Eight other members of the Lala family, including two toddlers, were killed in November’s 6.4-magnitude quake. Mr. Ahmetaj, 79, a former military officer, took in the devastation and shook his head. Nature, at its most violent, was to blame. But so, too, were people at their most greedy. “If you would have seen this place when it was a marsh, a place where people came to fish, you wouldn’t think houses could ever have been built here,” Mr. Ahmetaj said. Yet they were built — the construction often compromised by corruption — in a pattern repeated across Albania, a small Balkan nation. The Nov. 26 earthquake in Albania killed 51 people, sent hundreds to hospitals and left thousands homeless. As the shock recedes, the tragedy offers a stark warning for a region that has been devastated by much more powerful quakes in the past and that experts warn is ill-prepared for the next big one. From Bucharest in Romania to Sofia in Bulgaria and across the Balkan nations in southeastern Europe, successive governments have failed to address the risks posed by aging buildings.  Or they encouraged building booms in the 1990s, during the transition from Communism to capitalism, in which safety standards often took a back seat to a quick buck. The result is that millions of people live in homes unlikely to survive a major earthquake, experts say. Driving through the hardest hit areas after the recent earthquake in Albania, the scale of the challenge was evident. The quake had rendered poorly constructed buildings even more vulnerable, exposing tens of thousands to potential future danger. The country does not have nearly enough engineers and experts to assess all the properties that were damaged and even when the risk is known, the cost of doing needed repairs is often prohibitive in one of Europe’s poorest countries. Prime Minister Edi Rama said recently that the government was reshaping the budget to help deal with the crisis, but that international support was desperately needed. “Simply, it is humanly impossible to do this alone,” he said.  While Albania continues to reel, others in the region are using the moment to sound an alarm. Walking the streets of the old city in Bucharest, visitors with a keen eye will spot red circles — just above the eye line — on hundreds of buildings. They were put there by engineers to classify the buildings at greatest risk in the event of seismic activity. In the Romanian capital alone, 349 structures were deemed at the highest risk and likely to collapse in a major earthquake. Many of them are apartment complexes. Hundreds of other buildings are expected to suffer major structural damage. And those are just the ones that have been inspected.  “We only speak of about 300 buildings in danger of collapsing in Bucharest,’’ said Matei Sumbasacu, the founder of Re:Rise, Romania’s first nongovernmental organization focused on reducing seismic risk. “We know about another 1,600 buildings, and we don’t know how many others there are. But we are pretending that we need to resurvey them because, who knows, maybe they got stronger in the past 25 years.” “This is criminal,” he added, “and we are telling this to the people inside the buildings.” He is so passionate about the subject that he has tattooed on his right forearm the seismic data of an earthquake that rocked the country in 1977. Still, the memories of past tragedies have a way of fading. Romania experienced two devastating earthquakes in the 20th century. In 1940, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck at Vrancea, in eastern Romania, and caused widespread destruction. Then, on March 4, 1977, a 7.2-magnitude quake hit in the same region. The ensuing shock waves destroyed more than 30 high-rise buildings in Bucharest, almost 100 miles away. An estimated 1,578 people were killed, and roughly 11,000 were injured. It was one of the worst natural disasters in modern Romanian history and led to a series of reforms. Prof. Radu Vacareanu, the rector at the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest, said that no country was truly ready for a large-scale earthquake, except for perhaps Japan. Since its 1977 quake, Romania has put in place good technical regulations, with fairly rigorous enforcement, he said. But progress in retrofitting some of the most at-risk private buildings has not been as good as expected, he said, “mainly because of complicated ownership.”  “You have buildings with many owners of different apartments and it is very difficult, almost impossible in some situations, to get a consensus,” Mr. Vacareanu said. If a similar earthquake struck today, he said, the losses in terms of affected buildings and people killed would be “at least as high as in 1977.”  “We have buildings here in Bucharest that were affected by the 1940 earthquake and then the 1977 earthquake and then the 1986 earthquake,” he said. “Damage is accumulating from one to the other.”  Mr. Sumbasacu, of Re:Rise, said that the government was underestimating the risk. “We had an exercise in simulating an earthquake in 2018, and they said that over 4,000 people died,” he said. “If the authorities say that we will have 4,000 victims, and they have the role of calming the population, you can imagine the real extent and magnitude. We may easily pass the 10,000 mark for the death toll.” In Romania, the oldest buildings often pose the greatest risk. But in other countries, like Albania, it is more recent construction that worries many experts. When a relatively mild 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Bulgaria in 1986, the damage far exceeded what might have been expected. In the small town of Strazhitsa, in the country’s north, scores of houses were destroyed and most of those left standing were deemed unsafe to occupy. Thousands were made homeless. Since 2007, when Bulgaria joined the European Union, construction in the country has had to comply with the bloc’s requirements for earthquake resistance. However, much of the construction dates back to Communist times, when the authorities responded to urgent housing needs by erecting giant precast-panel residential complexes.

"Qassim Suleimani, Master of Iran’s Intrigue, Built a Shiite Axis of Power in Mideast",2020-01-03,"By Tim Arango, Ronen Bergman and Ben Hubbard","['He changed the shape of the Syrian civil war and tightened Iran’s grip on Iraq. He was behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel. And for two decades, his every move lit up the communications networks — and fed the obsessions — of intelligence operatives across the Middle East.  On Friday, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful and shadowy 62-year-old spymaster at the head of Iran’s security machinery, was killed by an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport.  Just as his accomplishments shaped the creation of a Shiite axis of influence across the Middle East, with Iran at the center, his death is now likely to prove central to a new chapter of geopolitical tension across the region.  General Suleimani was at the vanguard of Iran’s revolutionary generation, joining the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in his early 20s after the 1979 uprising that enshrined the country’s Shiite theocracy.  He rose quickly during the brutal Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. And since 1998, he was the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ influential Quds Force, the foreign-facing arm of Iran’s security apparatus, melding intelligence work with a military strategy of nurturing proxy forces across the world.  In the West, he was seen as a clandestine force behind an Iranian campaign of international terrorism. He and other Iranian officials were designated as terrorists by the United States and Israel in 2011, accused of a plot to kill the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, one of Iran’s chief enemies in the region, in Washington. Last year, in April, the entire Quds Force was listed as a foreign terrorism group by the Trump administration.  But in Iran, many saw him as a larger-than-life hero, particularly within security circles. Anecdotes about his asceticism and quiet charisma joined to create an image of a warrior-philosopher who became the backbone of a nation’s defense against a host of enemies.  He was close to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who on Friday issued a statement calling for three days of public mourning and “forceful revenge,” in a declaration that amounted to a threat of retaliation against the United States. “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,” he said.  The first years of General Suleimani’s tenure in the late 1990s were devoted to directing the militant group Hezbollah’s effort against the Israeli military occupation of south Lebanon. General Suleimani, along with Hezbollah’s military commander, Imad Mugniyah, drove a sophisticated campaign of guerrilla warfare, combining ambushes, roadside bombs, suicide bombers, targeted killings of senior Israeli officers and attacks on Israeli defense posts. At the end, the price for Israel was too high, and in May 2000 it withdrew from Lebanon, marking a major victory for General Suleimani, his Quds Force and Hezbollah.  The Arab Spring in the Middle East, and later the fight against the Islamic State, turned General Suleimani from a shadow figure into a major player in the geopolitics of the region, said Tamir Pardo, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service. “Suleimani’s professional life can be divided into two periods,” he said. “Until the Arab Spring, he is commander of a force that has branches in various parts of the world, active mainly in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, but at the end of the day is a secret operational organization whose main purpose is terrorism.” “From the shock that befell the Middle East following the rise of ISIS, he is changing course,” Mr. Pardo continued. “He becomes a kingpin regional player, knowing with great talent how to exploit the secret infrastructure he has established for so many years, to achieve noncovert objectives — to fight, to win, to establish presence.” In recent years, the man whose face had rarely been seen became the face of Iran’s foreign operations.  In Syria, he oversaw a massive operation to shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, whose own troops had been depleted by widespread defections and fierce fighting with rebels seeking to topple the government since 2011. His command of Arabic helped put local commanders at ease as he welded them into a support network for Mr. al-Assad. Over a number of years, Iranian operatives guided by General Suleimani recruited militia fighters from other countries — mostly from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan — airlifting them into Syria to back up Mr. Assad’s forces in key battles.  Many of these militia fighters received training at military bases in Iran or on the ground in Syria by operatives from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an organization General Suleimani had helped develop over the years.  When Iranian and Iranian-backed forces became major combatants against ISIS after the group took over roughly a third of Iraq in 2014, pictures of General Suleimani on the battlefield in fatigues began being widely shared on social media. The publicity spawned rumors that General Suleimani was trying to widen his fame for a possible run for Iran’s presidency; he denied them, saying he always saw himself as just a soldier. That conflict, from 2014 through 2017, was a rare instance of Iran and the United States nominally fighting on the same side. On a number of occasions, Americans were hitting Islamic State targets from the air while General Suleimani was directing ground forces against the militants. It was unclear what direct role General Suleimani played in Yemen. But Iran’s patronage of the country’s Houthi rebels, which intensified when Saudi Arabia intervened against them in Yemen’s war in 2015, had all the hallmarks of the Suleimani playbook: above all, to support local militants as a way of expanding Iranian influence and punishing Saudi Arabia, the region’s Sunni power. Iran had long offered similar support to the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, creating decades of new security headaches for Israel. And with the support of the Quds Force, Hamas was able to take over the Gaza Strip, capable of firing rockets that can reach into most of Israeli territory. Previous American administrations had resisted striking General Suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the United States and Iran.  At least once, though, Israeli officials ran the possibility of attacking him up their command structure. That was in February 2008, while Israeli and American intelligence operatives were tracking Mr. Mugniyah, the Hezbollah commander, in the hopes of killing him, according to senior American and Israeli intelligence officials. Operatives spotted the Hezbollah commander talking with another man, who they quickly determined was Mr. Suleimani.  Excited by the possibility of killing two archenemies at once, the Israelis phoned senior government officials. But Prime Minister Ehud Olmert denied the request, as he had promised the Americans that only Mr. Mugniyah would be targeted in the operation.  Perhaps more than any other individual, General Suleimani was the foil for American plans in Iraq, which like Iran is predominantly Shiite.  After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Iranian militiamen and their Iraqi allies fought a clandestine war against American troops, launching rockets at bases and attacking convoys. The militias also played a large part in inflaming sectarian tensions that led to Iraq’s civil war in 2006 and 2007 between Shiites and Sunnis, leading President George W. Bush to order a troop surge there. General Suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of World War I. Nearly a million people died on both sides, and General Suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.  For him and his fellow soldiers, the war was a “never again” moment. Ensuring that Iraq was weak and unable to again pose a threat to Iran became the primary goal of Iran’s policy toward Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, whom the United States supported during its war with Iran in the 1980s. “For Qassim Suleimani, the Iran-Iraq war never really ended,” Ryan C. Crocker, a former American ambassador to Iraq, once said in an interview. “No human being could have come through such a World War I-style conflict and not have been forever affected. His strategic goal was an outright victory over Iraq, and if that was not possible, to create and influence a weak Iraq.” Sometimes, American officials secretly communicated with General Suleimani in an effort to ease tensions in Iraq. In 2008, the American general, David Petraeus, was trying to find a truce in a fight that American forces and the Iraqi Army were waging against Shiite militias loyal to Iran. In Mr. Petraeus’s telling of the story, he was shown a text message directed to him: “General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassim Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan.” Years later, General Suleimani personally, and mockingly, addressed another American leader: President Trump, who in July 2018 warned Iran’s president not to threaten the United States.  “It is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,” General Suleimani declared in a speech in western Iran. “I, as a soldier, respond to you.” “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine,” he added. “We are ready. We are the man of this arena.” For years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran railed against what it saw as American aggression in the region, worried that the United States would turn its attention to regime change in Iran after Mr. Hussein was gone.  American officials have blamed Iran for killing hundreds of American soldiers during the war, many with sophisticated, shaped-charge bombs that could slice through American armored vehicles. As the United States sought to negotiate a deal with Iraq that would allow American forces to stay in the country past a 2011 deadline, it was General Suleimani who relentlessly pushed Iraqi officials to refuse to sign, using a mixture of threats and the promise of more financial and military aid, American and Iraqi officials say.  On his orders, Iraqi construction crews in 2014 began building a roadway for Iranian supplies and militiamen, a small piece of what was perhaps the general’s most important project: establishing a land route from Tehran to the Mediterranean, across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, where Iran has long supported Hezbollah, a primary threat to Israel. One telling episode that illustrated the depth of Iranian control came in 2014, when the Islamic State was rampaging across Iraq. General Suleimani paid a visit to Bayan Jabr, then the country’s transportation minister. According to a collection of Iranian intelligence cables published recently by The Intercept and The New York Times, General Suleimani came to Mr. Jabr with a demand: He needed to use Iraqi airspace to fly planeloads of military supplies to support the Syrian government of Mr. Assad. Despite lobbying by the Obama administration to close Iraq’s airspace to the flights, Mr. Jabr quickly said yes. “I put my hands on my eyes and said, ‘On my eyes! As you wish!’” Mr. Jabr told an Iranian Intelligence Ministry officer, according to one of the cables. “Then he got up and approached me and kissed my forehead.” The same trove of documents contains evidence that General Suleimani is not universally admired within Iran.  A bitter rivalry between his Quds Force and the other main Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Intelligence, played out over the course of the cables. Many criticized General Suleimani’s proxy campaign in Iraq, and the way his militia allies abused the Sunni population there, as weakening Iran’s long-term interests in the region.  “This policy of Iran in Iraq has allowed the Americans to return to Iraq with greater legitimacy,” one cable read.  In others, ministry case officers portrayed General Suleimani as a relentless self-promoter who used the battle against the Islamic State to bolster his potential political aspirations in the future.  Iran watchers sounded alarm that General Suleimani’s death would unleash unpredictable regional mayhem from Syria to Iraq that would be difficult for the United States to contain. Several Iranian diplomats said that the prospect of diplomacy with the United States, being quietly negotiated through Japan and France, was effectively dead. The talk was now of revenge, not negotiations, they said. “This one life lost will likely cost many more Iranian, Iraqi, American and others,” said Ali Vaez, director of Iran program for International Crisis Group. “It is not just Suleimani’s death, but likely the death knell of the Iran nuclear deal and any prospect of diplomacy between Iran and the U.S.”  Qassim Suleimani was born in 1957 in Rabor, in eastern Iran, and later moved to the city of Kerman. He was the son of a farmer, and began laboring as a construction worker at age 12. His highest level of education was high school, and he later worked in the municipal water department in Kerman, according to a profile published by the Iranian state media.  According to a 2013 profile in The New Yorker, General Suleimani’s father became burdened with debt under the Shah. When the revolution came he was sympathetic to the cause, and joined the Revolutionary Guards soon after. He was married and had children, although there were conflicting stories in the Iranian news media about how many. Within Iran, he was widely seen as exerting more influence over the country’s foreign policy than even the country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. General Suleimani, in death if not in life, appeared to have united Iran’s rival political parties to rally behind the flag. Iran’s expansionist policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon have been contentious at home among ordinary Iranians and some reformist politicians who saw money and resources diverted from Iran to fund General Suleimani’s missions. But on Friday, there was only praise and grief. Iranian officials across the political spectrum issued statements of condolences and condemned the United States. The powerful Revolutionary Guards, of which the Quds Force is a component, said plans were underway for a huge public funeral. “He was so big that he achieved his dream of being martyred by America,” wrote a reformist politician and former vice president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi. General Suleimani had received the country’s highest military honor, the Order of Zolfaghar, established in 1856 under the Qajar dynasty. He became the only military commander to receive the honor in the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei pinned the medal on General Suleimani’s chest last February, and in remarks that now seem prophetic, said: “The Islamic Republic needs him for many more years. But I hope that in the end, he dies as a martyr.” Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles; Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv, Israel; and Ben Hubbard from Beirut.

Head-Scarf Ban and Carbon Taxes: Austria Gets an Unlikely Government,2020-01-02,By Christopher F. Schuetze and Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Seven months after his coalition with the far right collapsed in a spectacular scandal, Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s former conservative chancellor, stood before television cameras on Thursday and announced a new government — this time with the progressive Greens.  “We chose a new path,” Mr. Kurz beamed. “It was a challenge for both sides, because the differences between the two sides are big.”  The result, he said, was a new kind of compromise. “We did not try to negotiate the lowest common denominator but consciously tried to unite the best of both worlds,” Mr. Kurz said. “That’s how it is possible that both the Greens could keep their central campaign promises and so could the People’s Party.” Werner Kogler, the Greens leader, who will serve as vice chancellor, put it more bluntly: “We were elected for different things.” That’s how, in a 300-page coalition contract presented in Vienna on Thursday, plans for a head scarf ban for Muslim girls and deportation centers for unsuccessful asylum seekers sat side by side with a carbon tax on airline tickets and a target to make Austria carbon neutral by 2040.  As far as political transformations go, it was certainly remarkable — and it was being watched closely in neighboring European countries, where identity politics and climate change have crystallized as two main political fault lines in the Continent’s simmering culture wars. Since Austria’s snap elections in September, it had been unclear whether Mr. Kurz would revive a politically costly coalition with the far right or reach across the political spectrum to the Greens, his ideological opposites. With the pivot, Mr. Kurz seems intent on demonstrating a willingness to make the ideological compromises needed for a stable government and rehabilitate his reputation abroad, where his partnership with the far right had raised eyebrows.  For Austria’s Greens, who have never been in government at the national level, the coalition presents a chance to show that their party is capable of governing with an establishment conservative party at the top level.  If it succeeds, it may set an example for other European democracies, where Green parties appear poised to enter government coalitions. Across Europe, the Greens have been buoyed by a recent surge of support as issues like climate change rise on the political agenda and traditional Social Democratic parties collapse. The new Austrian coalition may prove to be a harbinger especially for Germany, where there is talk of forming a similar coalition after the next election, slated for 2021. But in Austria there is no doubt that the unlikely partners will make for what many expect to be an awkward and uncomfortable pairing, disagreeing as they do on important issues, especially immigration. “From the perspective of the Austrian People’s Party, there is no other party that is ideologically further removed than the Greens,” said Laurenz Ennser-Jedenastik, a political scientist at the University of Vienna. Mr. Kogler, the Greens’ leader, acknowledged as much in the news conference on Thursday. He stressed repeatedly that his party’s decision to join forces with Mr. Kurz was also a question of “responsibility” to keep the far-right Freedom Party out of power. “It’s important to remember the alternative,” he said. But, noted Peter Filzmaier, a professor of politics at Danube University Krems, “Kurz was also short on alternatives.”  A renewed coalition with the far right or the Social Democrats would have resulted in parliamentary majorities, but both those parties were “in deep internal crises and not very reliable,” he said. If nothing else, the new coalition shows Mr. Kurz’s skills as a political chameleon.  After co-opting much of the far-right Freedom Party’s anti-immigrant message, Mr. Kurz had in effect promised to rein in the party by bringing it into his last government. But even from his own camp he was criticized for instead enabling and sanitizing the far right, which likened migrants to rats and campaigned with material that evoked Nazi propaganda. The new coalition with the Greens may provide Mr. Kurz with a chance to remove some of the stain of that association.  Although Mr. Kurz took pains to deny it, governing the country with the far right had become increasingly difficult. Freedom Party members were criticized not only for their anti-immigrant language, but also for their links to far-right extremist groups. A raid of the intelligence services, apparently at the behest of the Freedom Party interior minister, became the subject of an intensive government inquiry. After just 16 months in office together, their coalition ended last May, when a video emerged in which Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party’s leader, was seen asking for election interference from a woman he thought to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. Saying “enough is enough,” Mr. Kurz dissolved his government and started campaigning immediately.  In September’s balloting, Mr. Kurz’s secured 37.5 percent of vote, showing that the scandal and the short-lived coalition with the Freedom Party had not fatally hurt him.  But his party did not win enough seats to govern the country on its own, and with their support surging — they won nearly 14 percent of the vote — the Greens became an appealing, if unlikely, alternative. Still, Mr. Kurz had not excluded the possibility of another coalition with either the Freedom Party, which lost significant support in the election, or, less controversially, the Social Democrats, which has also seen its support erode. The Greens were helped by the scandals that plagued the Freedom Party after it was kicked out of the government, but they were also given a lift by the growing urgency over environmental concerns, above all climate change, especially among young voters. For the Greens, the coalition will test their own flexibility and whether they can work with Mr. Kurz, with whom they are at odds on issues like migration and economic policies. In addition to a tax of 12 euros, just over $13, on every airline ticket sold, the coalition contract includes plans to make trains cheaper, extend public transport across Austria and create a task force to transform Austria’s taxation system into one that is ecologically and socially sustainable. Austria is a small country, Mr. Kogler said, but one that can be “an example and ideally a pioneer in Europe.” Although the People’s Party and the Greens work together in three states in Austria, this is the first time they will do so on the national stage, a significant distinction because of the relative weakness of state governments in Austria.  But it is not the first time in Europe that Green parties will enter a national government. They have been in coalitions in Finland, the Czech Republic, Ireland and, most famously, Germany, where they governed with the Social Democrats from 1998 to 2005.  But it became clear that, Mr. Kurz, who centered his re-election campaign on promises not only to lower taxes but also to pursue a tough line on illegal migration, intends to keep many of his campaign promises. “Migration policy will remain at the core of my political agenda,” he said on Thursday. The first question at the news conference was telling: Was there still a trace of the far right in the coalition pact? “There have to be compromises in a parliamentary democracy,” Mr. Kogler replied. Such compromises, he conceded, could be “painful.” In negotiating future policy, the Greens may be helped by  high court decisions that reversed anti-immigrant moves made by the previous government. Mr. Kurz’ latest proposal is to ban the head scarf for girls up age 14. Under the agreement, the People’s Party takes control of 11 ministries, including most of the important ones — the chancellery, the finance, foreign and interior ministries — while the Greens take over four, including a newly organized environment ministry. The governing agreement must still be approved by Green party members, who will meet this weekend to discuss and vote on the agreement, though passage seems nearly certain. The People’s Party faces no such hurdle.  If the vote passes, the government can be presented next week. And Mr. Kurz, at 33, can begin his second term as Austria’s youngest chancellor.']","After months of talks, Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives and progressive Greens agreed on a coalition that could be a harbinger for the rest of Europe."
"Qassim Suleimani, Master of Iran’s Intrigue, Built a Shiite Axis of Power in Mideast",2020-01-03,"By Tim Arango, Ronen Bergman and Ben Hubbard","['He changed the shape of the Syrian civil war and tightened Iran’s grip on Iraq. He was behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel. And for two decades, his every move lit up the communications networks — and fed the obsessions — of intelligence operatives across the Middle East.  On Friday, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful and shadowy 62-year-old spymaster at the head of Iran’s security machinery, was killed by an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport.  Just as his accomplishments shaped the creation of a Shiite axis of influence across the Middle East, with Iran at the center, his death is now likely to prove central to a new chapter of geopolitical tension across the region.  General Suleimani was at the vanguard of Iran’s revolutionary generation, joining the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in his early 20s after the 1979 uprising that enshrined the country’s Shiite theocracy.  He rose quickly during the brutal Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. And since 1998, he was the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ influential Quds Force, the foreign-facing arm of Iran’s security apparatus, melding intelligence work with a military strategy of nurturing proxy forces across the world.  In the West, he was seen as a clandestine force behind an Iranian campaign of international terrorism. He and other Iranian officials were designated as terrorists by the United States and Israel in 2011, accused of a plot to kill the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, one of Iran’s chief enemies in the region, in Washington. Last year, in April, the entire Quds Force was listed as a foreign terrorism group by the Trump administration.  But in Iran, many saw him as a larger-than-life hero, particularly within security circles. Anecdotes about his asceticism and quiet charisma joined to create an image of a warrior-philosopher who became the backbone of a nation’s defense against a host of enemies.  He was close to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who on Friday issued a statement calling for three days of public mourning and “forceful revenge,” in a declaration that amounted to a threat of retaliation against the United States. “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,” he said.  The first years of General Suleimani’s tenure in the late 1990s were devoted to directing the militant group Hezbollah’s effort against the Israeli military occupation of south Lebanon. General Suleimani, along with Hezbollah’s military commander, Imad Mugniyah, drove a sophisticated campaign of guerrilla warfare, combining ambushes, roadside bombs, suicide bombers, targeted killings of senior Israeli officers and attacks on Israeli defense posts. At the end, the price for Israel was too high, and in May 2000 it withdrew from Lebanon, marking a major victory for General Suleimani, his Quds Force and Hezbollah.  The Arab Spring in the Middle East, and later the fight against the Islamic State, turned General Suleimani from a shadow figure into a major player in the geopolitics of the region, said Tamir Pardo, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service. “Suleimani’s professional life can be divided into two periods,” he said. “Until the Arab Spring, he is commander of a force that has branches in various parts of the world, active mainly in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, but at the end of the day is a secret operational organization whose main purpose is terrorism.” “From the shock that befell the Middle East following the rise of ISIS, he is changing course,” Mr. Pardo continued. “He becomes a kingpin regional player, knowing with great talent how to exploit the secret infrastructure he has established for so many years, to achieve noncovert objectives — to fight, to win, to establish presence.” In recent years, the man whose face had rarely been seen became the face of Iran’s foreign operations.  In Syria, he oversaw a massive operation to shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, whose own troops had been depleted by widespread defections and fierce fighting with rebels seeking to topple the government since 2011. His command of Arabic helped put local commanders at ease as he welded them into a support network for Mr. al-Assad. Over a number of years, Iranian operatives guided by General Suleimani recruited militia fighters from other countries — mostly from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan — airlifting them into Syria to back up Mr. Assad’s forces in key battles.  Many of these militia fighters received training at military bases in Iran or on the ground in Syria by operatives from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an organization General Suleimani had helped develop over the years.  When Iranian and Iranian-backed forces became major combatants against ISIS after the group took over roughly a third of Iraq in 2014, pictures of General Suleimani on the battlefield in fatigues began being widely shared on social media. The publicity spawned rumors that General Suleimani was trying to widen his fame for a possible run for Iran’s presidency; he denied them, saying he always saw himself as just a soldier. That conflict, from 2014 through 2017, was a rare instance of Iran and the United States nominally fighting on the same side. On a number of occasions, Americans were hitting Islamic State targets from the air while General Suleimani was directing ground forces against the militants. It was unclear what direct role General Suleimani played in Yemen. But Iran’s patronage of the country’s Houthi rebels, which intensified when Saudi Arabia intervened against them in Yemen’s war in 2015, had all the hallmarks of the Suleimani playbook: above all, to support local militants as a way of expanding Iranian influence and punishing Saudi Arabia, the region’s Sunni power. Iran had long offered similar support to the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, creating decades of new security headaches for Israel. And with the support of the Quds Force, Hamas was able to take over the Gaza Strip, capable of firing rockets that can reach into most of Israeli territory. Previous American administrations had resisted striking General Suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the United States and Iran.  At least once, though, Israeli officials ran the possibility of attacking him up their command structure. That was in February 2008, while Israeli and American intelligence operatives were tracking Mr. Mugniyah, the Hezbollah commander, in the hopes of killing him, according to senior American and Israeli intelligence officials. Operatives spotted the Hezbollah commander talking with another man, who they quickly determined was Mr. Suleimani.  Excited by the possibility of killing two archenemies at once, the Israelis phoned senior government officials. But Prime Minister Ehud Olmert denied the request, as he had promised the Americans that only Mr. Mugniyah would be targeted in the operation.  Perhaps more than any other individual, General Suleimani was the foil for American plans in Iraq, which like Iran is predominantly Shiite.  After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Iranian militiamen and their Iraqi allies fought a clandestine war against American troops, launching rockets at bases and attacking convoys. The militias also played a large part in inflaming sectarian tensions that led to Iraq’s civil war in 2006 and 2007 between Shiites and Sunnis, leading President George W. Bush to order a troop surge there. General Suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of World War I. Nearly a million people died on both sides, and General Suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.  For him and his fellow soldiers, the war was a “never again” moment. Ensuring that Iraq was weak and unable to again pose a threat to Iran became the primary goal of Iran’s policy toward Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, whom the United States supported during its war with Iran in the 1980s. “For Qassim Suleimani, the Iran-Iraq war never really ended,” Ryan C. Crocker, a former American ambassador to Iraq, once said in an interview. “No human being could have come through such a World War I-style conflict and not have been forever affected. His strategic goal was an outright victory over Iraq, and if that was not possible, to create and influence a weak Iraq.” Sometimes, American officials secretly communicated with General Suleimani in an effort to ease tensions in Iraq. In 2008, the American general, David Petraeus, was trying to find a truce in a fight that American forces and the Iraqi Army were waging against Shiite militias loyal to Iran. In Mr. Petraeus’s telling of the story, he was shown a text message directed to him: “General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassim Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan.” Years later, General Suleimani personally, and mockingly, addressed another American leader: President Trump, who in July 2018 warned Iran’s president not to threaten the United States.  “It is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,” General Suleimani declared in a speech in western Iran. “I, as a soldier, respond to you.” “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine,” he added. “We are ready. We are the man of this arena.” For years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran railed against what it saw as American aggression in the region, worried that the United States would turn its attention to regime change in Iran after Mr. Hussein was gone.  American officials have blamed Iran for killing hundreds of American soldiers during the war, many with sophisticated, shaped-charge bombs that could slice through American armored vehicles. As the United States sought to negotiate a deal with Iraq that would allow American forces to stay in the country past a 2011 deadline, it was General Suleimani who relentlessly pushed Iraqi officials to refuse to sign, using a mixture of threats and the promise of more financial and military aid, American and Iraqi officials say.  On his orders, Iraqi construction crews in 2014 began building a roadway for Iranian supplies and militiamen, a small piece of what was perhaps the general’s most important project: establishing a land route from Tehran to the Mediterranean, across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, where Iran has long supported Hezbollah, a primary threat to Israel. One telling episode that illustrated the depth of Iranian control came in 2014, when the Islamic State was rampaging across Iraq. General Suleimani paid a visit to Bayan Jabr, then the country’s transportation minister. According to a collection of Iranian intelligence cables published recently by The Intercept and The New York Times, General Suleimani came to Mr. Jabr with a demand: He needed to use Iraqi airspace to fly planeloads of military supplies to support the Syrian government of Mr. Assad. Despite lobbying by the Obama administration to close Iraq’s airspace to the flights, Mr. Jabr quickly said yes. “I put my hands on my eyes and said, ‘On my eyes! As you wish!’” Mr. Jabr told an Iranian Intelligence Ministry officer, according to one of the cables. “Then he got up and approached me and kissed my forehead.” The same trove of documents contains evidence that General Suleimani is not universally admired within Iran.  A bitter rivalry between his Quds Force and the other main Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Intelligence, played out over the course of the cables. Many criticized General Suleimani’s proxy campaign in Iraq, and the way his militia allies abused the Sunni population there, as weakening Iran’s long-term interests in the region.  “This policy of Iran in Iraq has allowed the Americans to return to Iraq with greater legitimacy,” one cable read.  In others, ministry case officers portrayed General Suleimani as a relentless self-promoter who used the battle against the Islamic State to bolster his potential political aspirations in the future.  Iran watchers sounded alarm that General Suleimani’s death would unleash unpredictable regional mayhem from Syria to Iraq that would be difficult for the United States to contain. Several Iranian diplomats said that the prospect of diplomacy with the United States, being quietly negotiated through Japan and France, was effectively dead. The talk was now of revenge, not negotiations, they said. “This one life lost will likely cost many more Iranian, Iraqi, American and others,” said Ali Vaez, director of Iran program for International Crisis Group. “It is not just Suleimani’s death, but likely the death knell of the Iran nuclear deal and any prospect of diplomacy between Iran and the U.S.”  Qassim Suleimani was born in 1957 in Rabor, in eastern Iran, and later moved to the city of Kerman. He was the son of a farmer, and began laboring as a construction worker at age 12. His highest level of education was high school, and he later worked in the municipal water department in Kerman, according to a profile published by the Iranian state media.  According to a 2013 profile in The New Yorker, General Suleimani’s father became burdened with debt under the Shah. When the revolution came he was sympathetic to the cause, and joined the Revolutionary Guards soon after. He was married and had children, although there were conflicting stories in the Iranian news media about how many. Within Iran, he was widely seen as exerting more influence over the country’s foreign policy than even the country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. General Suleimani, in death if not in life, appeared to have united Iran’s rival political parties to rally behind the flag. Iran’s expansionist policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon have been contentious at home among ordinary Iranians and some reformist politicians who saw money and resources diverted from Iran to fund General Suleimani’s missions. But on Friday, there was only praise and grief. Iranian officials across the political spectrum issued statements of condolences and condemned the United States. The powerful Revolutionary Guards, of which the Quds Force is a component, said plans were underway for a huge public funeral. “He was so big that he achieved his dream of being martyred by America,” wrote a reformist politician and former vice president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi. General Suleimani had received the country’s highest military honor, the Order of Zolfaghar, established in 1856 under the Qajar dynasty. He became the only military commander to receive the honor in the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei pinned the medal on General Suleimani’s chest last February, and in remarks that now seem prophetic, said: “The Islamic Republic needs him for many more years. But I hope that in the end, he dies as a martyr.” Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles; Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv, Israel; and Ben Hubbard from Beirut. Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York. ']","The commander helped direct wars in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, and he became the face of Iran’s efforts to build a regional bloc of Shiite power."
The Killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani: What We Know Since the U.S. Airstrike,2020-01-03,,"['President Trump said Friday afternoon that the airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander, was ordered “to stop a war” and prevented attacks on Americans. “Suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” he said, speaking to reporters from his resort in West Palm Beach, Fla. “We took action last night to stop a war, we did not take action to start a war.” Mr. Trump said the United States is not seeking regime change in Iran, but called for Tehran’s “aggression in the region” to immediately end. He also warned Iran against retaliating, saying, “If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.” He added, “that in particular refers to Iran.” The airstrike directed by Mr. Trump dramatically ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Tehran, and Iran’s leaders quickly promised retaliation for the general’s killing. Around the time of the overnight strike, a Special Operations unit based in the United States boarded transport aircraft bound for the Middle East, one Defense Department official said.  The deployment of the elite Army Rangers was the latest to the region. This week, the Pentagon readied 4,000 troops based at Fort Bragg, N.C., for a similar security mission to Kuwait. They are to depart in the coming days, joining 750 troops already deployed, officials said. “The brigade will deploy to Kuwait as an appropriate and precautionary action in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities,” a Department of Defense spokesperson said.  General Suleimani, a powerful strategist who represented Iran’s influence across the region, was killed by an American drone at Baghdad’s airport, in an attack that had been authorized by President Trump.  Iraq’s Parliament planned to hold an emergency session over the weekend to address the airstrike, which Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called “a brazen violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and a blatant attack on the nation’s dignity.” A powerful Iraqi militia leader was also killed. The strike, regarded by analysts as perhaps the riskiest American move in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, threatened to inflame hostilities across the region. Iran’s United Nations ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, called the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani “an act of war,” and vowed that it would be met with “revenge, a harsh revenge.” “Last night, they started a military war by assassinating, by an act of terror, one of our top generals,” Mr. Takht Ravanchi said during an appearance Friday on CNN. “We cannot just remain silent. We have to act and we will act.” Asked if Iran would act militarily, Mr. Takht Ravanchi said: “That’s for the future to witness.” In the hours after the American strike, thousands of pro-Iranian social media accounts went to work. Accounts on Twitter and Instagram tagged the White House with death threats and posted images of President Trump with a severed head and coffins covered in the American flag, alongside the hashtag Operation Hard Revenge. It was not clear whether the activity was the work of actual accounts or state-backed bots, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. But they tweeted pro-Iranian, anti-American content at a rate of 3,000 tweets every 45 minutes, according to New York Times data. The social media activity may just be an opening salvo, experts said. Iran may begin a digital campaign of cyberattacks and disinformation in retaliation for General Suleimani’s death, they said. Tehran’s most likely target, the experts added, would be the American private sector. Over the past year, Iranian hackers have taken aim at Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. They have also targeted telecom companies, infrastructure systems and more than 200 oil, gas and heavy machinery companies around the world. The hackers have “developed the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure and they already have the ability to wipe data,” said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. “But they’ve gone well beyond that now. The question is what services — pipelines? dams? — will they target now.” Iran is still not “at the top of the league” of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks, Mr. Lewis and other experts said. But Tehran is much further along than American officials gave it credit for in 2009, when a classified intelligence assessment concluded that it had the motivation to inflict harm, but lacked the skills and resources to do so. Since 2010 — when an Iranian nuclear facility was the target of a joint American-Israeli cyberattack — Tehran has embraced such attacks as part its strategy of “asymmetrical warfare.” While Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps may never match the West in conventional warfare, its specialized teams have learned how much destruction they can cause to vulnerable systems, according to American intelligence assessments and private security researchers. Over the past five years, American officials and cybersecurity experts have tracked Iranian hackers as they have significantly advanced their capabilities beyond wiping data to sophisticated attacks on financial networks, internet infrastructure, energy companies — and, even more disconcerting, sites like the Bowman Dam in Westchester County and the Energy Department’s Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls. “They now have the ability to do serious harm,” Mr. Lewis said. “As the conflict with the U.S. continues, they’re going to be tempted. Expect to see a lot more testing of how far they can get into company networks, universities, federal networks and smaller government networks in towns and cities.” Iranian leaders issued strident calls on Friday for revenge against the United States after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in an overnight airstrike at the Baghdad airport.  His death is a considerable blow to Tehran, and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for retaliation and for three days of national mourning.  “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission, but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands,” the supreme leader said in a statement. Iran’s security body also pledged to avenge General Suleimani’s killing in the “right place and time,” saying it had reached a decision on how to do so.  The American strike spurred mass displays of public mourning by Iran and its network of allies across the Middle East. Iranian officials said the general’s body would be taken on a funeral procession around Baghdad, and that a funeral would be held for him in Tehran on Sunday.  On Friday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter about the strike, saying that General Suleimani “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more … but got caught!” General Suleimani was the head of the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades. The general’s prominent role meant that his death could have a ripple effect in any number of countries across the Middle East where Iran and the United States compete for influence. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone that fired missiles on a convoy of vehicles leaving the airport. Several other officials from Iraqi militias backed by Tehran were also killed. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The United States has long been at odds with Iran over its nuclear program and influence in Iraq and other countries in the region. Those tensions have surged under the Trump administration. The strike on Friday was the latest escalation between the two nations after a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, believed to have been carried out by an Iran-backed militia, killed an American contractor in December.  The United States hit back with airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia that killed 24 and prompted outrage among some who saw that attack as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Pro-Iranian demonstrators broke into the United States Embassy compound on Tuesday. The breach prompted Mr. Trump to order roughly 750 additional American troops to be deployed to the region. The State Department urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately following the strike that killed General Suleimani in Baghdad, citing “heightened tensions.” Oil prices jumped on Friday after the news of the general’s death: The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, surged in the early hours of Hong Kong trading to nearly $70 a barrel — an increase of $3. The immediate increase in the price of oil was among the largest since an attack on a critical Saudi oil installation in September that temporarily knocked out 5 percent of the world’s oil supply. By 11 a.m. in London, the price of Brent crude oil was at a three-month high of $69.20 a barrel. International oil companies based in the southeastern Iraqi city of Basra have begun evacuating American employees, according to Al Arabiya news outlet.  The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each opened about 1 percent lower on Friday, while oil company shares rose, with Exxon Mobil up 1.3 percent and Chevron up 1.2 percent in premarket trading. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had spoken to top diplomats in Britain, China and Germany on Friday about what the State Department described as President Trump’s recent decision to carry out the strike “in response to imminent threats to American lives.” Mr. Pompeo also told his foreign counterparts that the United States was committed to de-escalation, according to the State Department. Mr. Pompeo posted several statements and a video on Twitter that he said showed Iraqis “dancing in the street.” (Witnesses said that brief demonstration had involved only a small group of men, and that no one else had joined in.) “This was a man who has put American lives at risk for an awfully long time,” Mr. Pompeo said on Friday on CNN. “Last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.” He declined to provide more details about the looming attack. One American official familiar with the internal discussions about the drone strike said the administration was still trying to figure out what would come next. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the backlash over General Suleimani’s death could be even more fraught than the tensions after an American raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, who was part of a stateless group and had no international support. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a diplomat from Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran to maintain communication, had delivered a message from the United States to the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran on Friday concerning the death of General Suleimani. It did not elaborate. “Given the latest events in the region, Switzerland invites both parties to avoid any escalation,” the ministry said. As the leader of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which leads Iran’s operations abroad, General Suleimani, who was 62, was the country’s top security and intelligence commander. He was behind nearly all military and intelligence operations orchestrated by Iran in the past two decades and directed Iran-backed militias in the fight against the Islamic State.  American officials have also accused him of causing the deaths of hundreds of soldiers during the Iraq war and he was believed to have played a central role in orchestrating Iran’s support for the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  In Iran, General Suleimani was a respected political figure among hard-liners and was close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. To many Iranians, he was also a war hero, after becoming a commander while he was only in his 20s during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The general’s deputy succeeded him within hours, according to Iranian news agencies, with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appointing Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani as leader of the Quds Force on Friday. General Qaani, 62, had been the force’s deputy commander since 1997, according to Reuters. The United States Treasury Department put General Qaani on a blacklist in 2012 for what it called “financial disbursements” to various terrorist groups, including Hezbollah. Large crowds gathered for Friday Prayer in Iran and filled public squares with mass protests, while officials met privately to plot strategy and leaders vowed to avenge General Suleimani’s death. Images broadcast on Iranian state television showed thousands of supporters of General Suleimani gathered in mourning outside his house in the southeastern town of Kerman, and in other cities. “The great nation of Iran will take revenge for this heinous crime,” President Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called the strike an “act of international terrorism.”  Iran was working with Iraqi officials to repatriate the general’s body for a funeral service, perhaps as soon as Saturday, a number of Iranian journalists reported. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council also held an emergency meeting on Friday, which the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, attended. The council issued a statement after the meeting saying it had reached a decision on how to respond to the killing, but did not say what that decision was.  “America must know the criminal attack on General Suleimani was its worst strategic mistake in the Middle East and that America will not escape the consequences easily,” the statement read. “As our supreme leader said in his message, a harsh revenge awaits the criminals who have the general’s blood on their hands. These criminals will face revenge at the right time and place.” In Iraq, the strike appeared likely to accelerate calls for the departure of American troops. Along with General Suleimani, it killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of a powerful militia that is backed by Iran but under the umbrella of the Iraqi military.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq praised Mr. al-Muhandis and General Suleimani as heroes in the fight against the Islamic State and condemned their killing as a violation of sovereignty.  Friday’s strike in Baghdad also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi militia leader who was one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq and a veteran of battles against the United States and the Islamic State. Born Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, he was better known by his nom de guerre and gained prominence as mostly Shiite militias formed to fight the Islamic State in 2014. But he was a powerful force in Iraq for years, and his death alone would have sent shock waves through the country.  In 2009, the United States Treasury Department designated Mr. al-Muhandis a “threat to stability in Iraq” and accused him of helping smuggle rockets, sniper rifles and other weapons into the country from Iran.  Long before the Iraq war, he was accused of playing a role in the bombings of French and American Embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and the later attempt to assassinate Kuwait’s emir. Much of Mr. al-Muhandis’s history remains murky, including his exact age: He would have been about 66 or 67 at the time of his death, according to the United States government, which has said he was born in 1953 in Basra, Iraq.  Mr. al-Muhandis fled Iraq with the rise of Saddam Hussein and spent years in exile in Iran, cultivating close ties with Iranian officials, becoming fluent in Persian and keeping a home in Tehran. He returned to Iraq in the aftermath of the American invasion in 2003 and briefly served in Iraq’s Parliament before dropping out of public view. He helped found a militia that fought against the United States, and was accused of training and equipping a network of anti-American groups. The militia has continued to oppose the United States, and American officials blamed it for the rocket attack that killed an American contractor last week. In a reflection of the chaos that has engulfed Iraq and the region, it was only five years after the Treasury Department put sanctions on Mr. al-Muhandis that he found himself effectively on the same side as the United States. The invasion of Iraq by the Islamic State from Syria gave his militia, Iran and the United States a common enemy.  Iranian allies across the Arab world condemned the United States, reflecting the strength of the regional network General Suleimani spent much of his life building, including links to the government of Syria and militant groups in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and elsewhere. The leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that General Suleimani helped build, vowed in a statement that his group would continue on the path the general set and “work night and day to achieve his goals.” It was the responsibility of all resistance fighters to seek “just retribution” against “the most evil criminals in the world,” the leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said, meaning the United States. In Yemen, the administration run by the Houthi rebels, who have received support from Iran in their war against Saudi Arabia, condemned the United States strike as a “cowardly attack” that “makes clear the increasing American spite against all who are in favor of justice for the Islamic world.” In Syria, where General Suleimani oversaw a huge effort to shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a foreign ministry official condemned the “treacherous, criminal American aggression” that led to his killing, the state news agency SANA reported on Friday. António Guterres, the United Nations’ secretary general, voiced his deep concern over the recent rise in tensions in the Middle East, his spokesman, Farhan Haq, said in a statement. “The world cannot afford another war in the Gulf,” the statement read. “This is a moment in which leaders must exercise maximum restraint.” The killing of General Suleimani “most likely” violated international law, Agnes Callamard, the United Nations expert on extrajudicial executions, said in a post on Twitter.  “Use of lethal force is only justified to protect against an imminent threat to life,” Ms. Callamard wrote. Use of drones for targeted killings outside active hostilities was “almost never likely to be legal,” she added. Many experts also said on Friday that the strike probably ended any prospect of negotiations to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the landmark nuclear agreement Iran signed in 2015 with the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The recent escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran began with the 2018 decision by President Trump to withdraw from the deal. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the killing of General Suleimani “an adventurist step that will increase tensions throughout the region,” according to local news agencies. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry called for restraint on all sides, “especially the United States.” “China has always opposed the use of force in international relations,” the spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a daily news briefing, according to news agencies. Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, called on Friday for a de-escalation in tensions and said that further conflict in the region was not in his country’s interest. “We have always recognized the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassim Suleimani,” Mr. Raab said in a statement. “Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate.” Federica Mogherini, the former European high representative for foreign and security policy, said on Twitter that the general’s killing was “an extremely dangerous escalation.” In France, the country’s junior minister for European affairs, Amélie de Montchalin, said that she would soon consult with countries in the region. “We have woken up to a more dangerous world,” Ms. de Montchalin told French radio, calling for “stability and de-escalation.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cut short an official visit to Greece to return to Israel on Friday after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Before boarding the plane, Mr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”  General Suleimani, a longtime adversary of Israel, was credited with overseeing many attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets and he was linked with an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in the 1990s. More recently, he was behind military actions from Syria, across Israel’s northern frontier.  Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. It offered condolences to Iran on the death of General Suleimani, saying in a statement that he had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.”  Bassem Naim, a spokesman for the group, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded that the administration brief the full Congress on the strike and the next steps under consideration, noting that the move was made without lawmakers’ consultation or an authorization of military force. Ms. Pelosi spoke with Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, Thursday night after the attack, an aide said, but was not given advance notice. The strike, Ms. Pelosi said in a statement late Thursday evening, “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. America — and the world — cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” In stark contrast, Republican lawmakers — including both Iran hawks and those who have frequently clashed with Mr. Trump over his foreign policy — have almost uniformly praised the move. “Will there be escalation? Yes. But the escalation is not on our part,” Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who was stationed twice in Iraq with the Air Force, told CNN. “We’re finally responding to continued provocations by Iran.” The strike immediately spurred debate among American lawmakers about President Trump’s war powers and left congressional leaders sharply divided along party lines.  Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, accused Mr. Trump of bringing the nation “to the brink of an illegal war with Iran.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump had “exercised admirable restraint” and added that the Quds Force were “entirely to blame.” Reporting was contributed by Ben Hubbard, Farnaz Fassihi, Megan Specia, Isabel Kershner, Ronen Bergman, Lara Jakes, Eileen Sullivan, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Elian Peltier, Catie Edmondson, Benjamin Mueller, Alan Yuhas, Nick Cumming-Bruce, Nicole Perlroth, Ben Decker and Joan Nassivera.

A ‘Sir’ With Blue-Collar Roots: Britain’s Labour Race Has an Unlikely Leader,2020-01-02,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — After Britain’s Labour Party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in last month’s election, a chorus of critics faulted the party for losing touch with its working-class roots in the industrial north and becoming too closely identified with the left-wing, London-centered politics of its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Yet as the race to succeed Mr. Corbyn begins, and Labour seeks a path out of the wilderness, the early betting is on another Londoner, Keir Starmer, who not only has a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his “services to law and criminal justice,” but also holds an advanced law degree from Oxford. Mr. Starmer, who is expected to declare his candidacy in the coming weeks, is the clear favorite in a recent poll of party members conducted by the research group YouGov. He leads the field of declared and likely candidates among men and women, with voters of every age group and social class, and in all regions of the country, according to the survey of 1,059 members taken in late December. Though it is early in the race — Mr. Corbyn will stay on until March — the findings cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that Labour’s rank and file will turn to a leader from the Midlands or the north, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party made damaging inroads among once-loyal Labour voters. Instead, in backing Mr. Starmer, 57, the party’s members appear to be putting a premium on management experience and electability, after a landslide victory for Mr. Johnson that many blamed on Mr. Corbyn’s unpopularity and perceived unfitness for office. A human-rights lawyer who served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Mr. Starmer has been Labour’s Brexit policy leader under Mr. Corbyn. In that role, he challenged Mr. Johnson’s threats to pursue a “no-deal Brexit” if Parliament did not approve his withdrawal agreement with the European Union. But Mr. Starmer, who voted to remain in the European Union in 2016, also pushed his own party, which had been bitterly split over Brexit, to be open to a second referendum — something he now acknowledges will never happen in the wake of Mr. Johnson’s winning campaign to “get Brexit done.” The Labour Party kept Mr. Starmer under wraps during the campaign, in part because of his heavy identification with the Brexit debate, which the party’s leaders did not want to highlight in the election.  In the poll, Mr. Starmer was favored by 36 percent of those who responded. The next most popular candidate, with 23 percent, was Rebecca Long-Bailey, a Manchester-born member of Parliament who is viewed as representing continuity with Mr. Corbyn’s leftist leadership.  “There’s been a lot of talk about Labour needing a leader from the north or a candidate who is identifiably working class, but that doesn’t seem to be the case,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University who directed the poll for YouGov, along with the University of Sussex. “All the things that might disadvantage a white, middle-class, middle-aged man from London don’t seem to be hurting Keir Starmer,” Mr. Bale added. “He seems to be beating the Corbyn continuity candidate quite easily.” While Mr. Starmer has a “sir” in his name and is a well-compensated lawyer who lives in North London, like Mr. Corbyn’s, his roots are working-class: He is the son of a toolmaker and a nurse. Mr. Starmer prefers not to use the honorific, and in a stroke of fortune for an aspiring leader, he was named after the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie. Mr. Starmer has taken pains not to disavow Mr. Corbyn’s left-wing agenda, which is still popular with the party’s grass roots. “It’s important not to oversteer,” he said in a post-mortem interview with The Guardian. “The case for a bold and radical Labour government is as strong now as it was last Thursday.” But Mr. Starmer criticized the party’s failure to confront allegations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in the party, which dogged Mr. Corbyn during the campaign, particularly when he declined to apologize for it. Though tarnished by the defeat, Mr. Corbyn still commands a potent faction within the party, and could shape the outcome by endorsing a candidate. The party’s selection process is also lengthy and byzantine, which could open the door to a lesser-known candidate. Most of the candidates are women, which could hurt Mr. Starmer if the race comes to be defined by whether Labour should have a female leader.  Still, political analysts say the poll’s results align with their own private soundings of the party faithful. “It would be highly surprising, given YouGov’s record in predicting these contests, if their polls turn out to be off this time,” wrote Stephen Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, who is plugged into the Labour Party. Mr. Starmer’s positioning, he said, “was pretty much perfect.”']","A party that lost many of its working-class voters in last month’s election may turn, unexpectedly, to a London lawyer to be its next leader, an early poll shows."
Taiwan’s Top Military Official and 7 Others Die in Helicopter Crash,2020-01-02,By Austin Ramzy,"['Eight people including the chief of Taiwan’s armed forces were killed Thursday after the military helicopter carrying them crashed on a mountainside during a routine trip, Taiwan’s military said. The Black Hawk helicopter was carrying 13 people, including Shen Yi-ming, an air force general who served as the chief of general staff of Taiwan’s armed forces. The helicopter left Songshan Airport in Taipei, the capital, shortly before 8 a.m. to fly to Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan for an inspection, the military said. The last contact with the helicopter was at 8:07 a.m. The military has not yet said what may have caused the crash in a mountainous district southeast of Taipei. A military spokesman said Thursday morning that rescuers were struggling at the time to reach the crash site. The 13 people on board included three crew members and 10 military officials. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, called it “a sad day,” with “several excellent military leaders and colleagues killed in an accident in the line of duty.” She wrote on Facebook that General Shen was an “excellent and well-qualified chief who was also beloved by all.” Taiwan is in the final stretch of its presidential race, with Ms. Tsai holding a lead over Han Kuo-yu, the candidate from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang. Taiwan has long been a potential flash point for military conflict. China claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to prevent it from pursuing formal independence. The United States sells military equipment for Taiwan’s defense, including Black Hawk helicopters. The Obama administration approved the sale of 60 Black Hawks to Taiwan in 2010 as part of a $6.4 billion arms deal. China, in response, temporarily severed some military ties with the United States.

Why the Fires in Australia Are So Bad,2020-01-01,"By Andy Parsons, Russell Goldman and Matthew Abbott","['This fire season has been one of the worst in Australia’s history, with at least 15 people killed, hundreds of homes destroyed and millions of acres burned. And summer is far from over. This week, thousands of residents and vacationers in southeastern Australia were forced to evacuate to shorelines as bush fires encircled communities and razed scores of buildings. Military ships and aircraft were deployed on Wednesday to deliver water, food and fuel to towns cut off by the fires.  The hot, dry conditions that have fueled the fires are nothing new in Australia. Here’s why this fire season has been so calamitous.  Record-breaking temperatures, extended drought and strong winds have converged to create disastrous fire conditions. As a severe heat wave gripped most of the country in mid-December, Australia recorded its hottest day on record, with average highs of 107.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 41.9 degrees Celsius. The heat wave is continuing this week in southeastern Australia, with temperatures expected to reach 105 in Canberra, the capital. The extreme heat has followed the driest spring on record. Most of New South Wales and Queensland have been experiencing shortfalls in rain since early 2017. The drought has hit the country’s most productive agricultural areas, including some of those now ablaze. By early September, Australia started seeing ominous signs about this year’s fire season. On Sept. 9, the Binna Burra Lodge, a historic getaway in the lush mountains of Queensland, was destroyed in a bush fire. The loss, and the blazes in the surrounding rain forests, alarmed scientists, who said that such fires were extremely rare in the usually cool and wet area. The fires have burned across the country in recent months, affecting four out of six states. Australia’s east coast has been hardest hit. By early November, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires in New South Wales, the southeastern state that includes Sydney. On Nov. 11, the state issued a “catastrophic” fire danger rating for the first time in the decade that the current warning system has been in place. In Sydney, which issued a total fire ban, heavy smoke has discolored the sky on many days, and air quality there has at times been among the worst in the world. On Tuesday, social media was filled with photos of blazing red skies and people fleeing to beaches between Sydney and Melbourne. About 10 million acres have burned in New South Wales, destroying nearly 1,000 homes. Around 90 fires are currently raging in the state, with about three dozen more to the south in Victoria. In total, roughly 12 million acres have been burned by the fires. By comparison, about 1.9 million acres burned in the 2018 fires in California; those fires, which were the state’s most destructive, killed about 100 people. As the blazes swept southeastern Australia early this week, the fire season’s death toll reached at least 15, and officials said it was likely to rise. At least seven people were killed on Monday and Tuesday in New South Wales — including a volunteer firefighter, the third to die this season — and another person died in Victoria.    Tens of thousands of firefighters, the vast majority of them volunteers, have worked for weeks, sometimes putting in 12-hour days. The strain on the firefighters has raised questions about the country’s reliance on a volunteer force. Australia’s federal government announced last week that volunteers in New South Wales — as well as other states, if they requested it — would receive compensation of up to about $4,000. That change in policy was initially opposed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. This week, as the fires caused widespread destruction, Australia deployed its military and called on its allies for help. The Australian Defense Force said on Tuesday that it would send Black Hawk and Chinook military helicopters, airplanes and naval ships to Victoria and New South Wales. The government also asked the United States and Canada to provide water tanker aircraft. Canada has pledged to send more than 30 firefighters to help the Australians. The devastating start to the fire season confirmed what scientists have been predicting: that Australia’s bush fires will become more frequent and more intense as climate change worsens. Few if any other developed countries are as vulnerable to changing climate as Australia, according to scientific reports. Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, but climate change, which brings longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat, worsens these conditions and makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. The catastrophic fire conditions have put an intense focus on the Australian government’s failure to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which traps heat when released into the atmosphere. Even as emissions continue to soar, the country, currently governed by a conservative coalition, has found it difficult to reach a political consensus on energy and climate change policy. Those politics, in part, are influenced by Australia’s long mining history and its powerful coal lobby. Climate and weather are different but related concepts. Climate is a description of expected long-term weather patterns in a specific place, while weather is the mix of events occurring in the atmosphere at a particular time and place — think temperature, wind and precipitation. A changing climate has meant an increase in temperatures in the Indian and Southern Oceans, which in turn has meant drier and hotter weather across Australia this summer. The most dangerous fire days occur when hot, dry air blows from the desert center of the continent toward the populous coasts. A weather front — where air masses at different densities meet — can cause the direction of the wind to change rapidly. Ultimately, that means bigger fires spreading in multiple directions. Bush fires can be so large and hot that they generate their own dangerous, unpredictable weather systems. These so-called firestorms can produce lightning, strong winds and even fire tornadoes. What they don’t produce is rain. The volunteer firefighter who died on Monday was crushed after a fire tornado lifted a fire truck off the ground.']","Bush fire season is nothing new to Australians, but this summer has been calamitous — and it’s far from over.

Flash Floods in Indonesia Leave Hundreds of Thousands Homeless,2020-01-02,By Muktita Suhartono and Russell Goldman,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — Flash floods killed at least 43 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, the authorities said on Friday, after the city’s most intense period of rainfall since record keeping began more than 20 years ago.  On Tuesday, parts of the city recorded more than a foot of rain, according to the country’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. The rain persisted on Wednesday and more was predicted this week for the metro area, one of Asia’s largest urban districts and home to more than 30 million people.  Nearly 400,000 people had been displaced by Friday, according to the National Disaster Management Agency, as teams of emergency workers sought to clear flooded streets and repair downed power lines.  The vast majority of the displaced were in Bekasi, the Jakarta suburb that has been hardest hit by flooding, the disaster agency said. More than 100 rescue workers from the country’s emergency relief agency and several military units had been deployed in the capital, Budi Purnama, the operations director of National Search and Rescue Agency, said on Thursday.  Mr. Budi said the rescue workers were struggling in city streets that had been turned into rushing rivers. “The water discharge is very fast, the current is so strong that it even pushes parked vehicles,” he said. When Baby Hanna Siregar, a marketer who lives in Jakarta, went to sleep at her brother’s home at 3 a.m. Wednesday, everything “was still O.K.,” she said. But just three hours later, her “brother’s car was already one-third submerged.” By Thursday, she said, she and her family were trapped. “Since then, we are not able to go anywhere,” she said. “I don’t know how much longer we are going to be stranded here.”  About 40 percent of Jakarta lies below sea level, and the authorities have tried for years to alleviate flooding. Ordinary rains can swamp neighborhoods, as illegally dug wells and climate change have caused the city to sink faster than any other big city in the world.  As a result, officials announced in 2019 that they would relocate the capital to East Kalimantan Province, on the island of Borneo. The authorities said the extreme weather coupled with delays in flood alleviation projects were responsible for the week’s chaos.  “The rain falling on New Year’s Eve in the western and northern parts of Java was very extreme,” the meteorology agency said in a statement, referring to the Java Island, Indonesia’s most populous. “This rain is not ordinary rain.”  President Joko Widodo said in a tweet on Thursday that delays in flood control infrastructure projects since 2017 were responsible, and blamed “land acquisition” issues. Muktita Suhartono reported from Jakarta, and Russell Goldman from Hong Kong.']","At least 43 people have been killed in the most intense rains to strike Jakarta, the country’s capital, since record keeping began.

"Turkey, Flexing Its Muscles, Will Send Troops to Libya",2020-01-02,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey’s Parliament approved plans on Thursday to send troops to Libya, escalating what has become a chaotic proxy war between multiple powers for control of the oil-rich country. The Turkish deployment, a dramatic intervention championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, aims to bolster the fragile United Nations-backed government in Tripoli after nine months of siege from rebel forces based in eastern Libya. The size and nature of the military deployment was unclear. But coming just months after Turkey’s third military incursion into Syria, it expands Turkey’s military footprint in a volatile region and, analysts say, offers new evidence of its growing self-confidence as a regional power. For Libya’s embattled government, Mr. Erdogan has become an essential patron. Already this year, he has sent military advisers, arms and a fleet of 20 drones to defend Tripoli from the forces of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, which control much of eastern Libya and are backed by Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. According the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent monitoring organization, Turkey has already sent Syrian proxy fighters to Libya, and more have assembled in training camps in Turkey ahead of deployment. But in recent weeks, General Hifter’s forces have gained the upper hand in the battle for Tripoli. Buoyed by the arrival of Kremlin-backed Russian mercenaries, and armed with sophisticated drone-jamming technology, they have pushed farther into Tripoli, tightening their grip on the capital.  “In recent days, things have been quite bad for the government on the front line,” said Emad Badi, a Libya scholar at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. “They might have held on for just another week. Now I don’t expect Turkey to allow that to happen.” Much depends, Mr. Badi said, on what Turkey will bring to the fight and how quickly those reinforcements will arrive. Turkey could deploy a warship off the coast of Misurata, a govern-controlled city east of Tripoli, he said. Or it could deploy fighter jets to combat General Hifter’s attack drones in the air. In any event, such maneuvers might pause the fight for Libya, but not decide it. “It will be an incremental approach,” Mr. Badi said, adding that Turkey was likely to deploy the minimum resources needed to repel the offensive on Tripoli, and no more. President Trump spoke with Mr. Erdogan on Thursday, the White House said, and “pointed out that foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya.” The White House did not say whether Mr. Trump had asked Turkey to refrain from sending troops.  Mr. Erdogan has long held an ambition for a kind of restoration of the Ottoman Empire, re-establishing Turkey’s position of leadership in the Muslim world with an expansive foreign policy.  His stance, in alliance with the wealthy Gulf state Qatar, has pitted Turkey against Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. The opposing groups represent a new fault line in the Middle East, having backed opposite sides of the Arab Spring uprisings and rival forces in Libya and Syria.  An intervention in Libya may deepen Turkey’s feud with the Emirates, which is General Hifter’s main backer. But it may also open a new  conflict with Russia, which has been a partner of Turkey’s in Syria and recently sold Turkey an advanced antiaircraft missile system. At home, though. Mr. Erdogan’s geopolitical aspirations are popular. The mission in Libya, part of the former Ottoman domain, fits neatly into his vision of restoration. His assertive foreign policy has also given Mr. Erdogan a handy slate of challengers that he can point to abroad, helping him nurture nationalism and maintain his support domestically. Six months after his party’s loss of Istanbul’s mayoralty in local elections — his most significant electoral setback in a 25-year political career — Mr. Erdogan, 65, is pondering holding general elections in 2020, according to some political analysts. Although his term runs until 2023, his slide in the polls and the splintering of his party are making him consider calling a snap election in the fall, Mehmet Ali Kulat, a political consultant and pollster in Ankara, said. A faltering Turkish economy  may only add urgency to the president’s considerations. Mr. Erdogan’s assertive posturing has helped stir up nationalist feelings  and rally his core supporters, Ali Bayramoglu, who was close to Mr. Erdogan’s party in its early years, said. “Our right-wing parties did not use to act like they did not care about the United States,” Mr. Bayramoglu said. “This independence, this challenging is a new thing. Turkish right-wing voters love it.” With some justification Mr. Erdogan has argued that he has security interests in Iraq and Syria, since Turkey shares a long border with both and has suffered from instability spilling over from their conflicts. With Libya he has made similar arguments, as well as historical ones. Mr. Erdogan has noted that Libya was the last of the Ottoman territories to be lost and that Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, fought and was wounded there as a young officer. “It’s not difficult to convince Turkish public about the need for an intervention in Libya, in part because of the Ottoman legacy,” Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow of the European Council for Human Rights, said in written comments. There are important Turkish commercial interests at stake, too. Beneath Mr. Erdogan’s agreement with Libya is a desire to position Turkey for oil and gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, off the coast of Cyprus, in competition with Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel, analysts say.  “Turkey does not want to be frozen out of the great game which revolves around the hydrocarbon deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean,” Ms. Aydintasbas said.  As in Syria, Turkey wants to have troops on the ground in Libya to gain a place at the table, she said. There is also an ethnic link. The main Libyan faction backing Tripoli is from Misurata, whose population is mostly ethnically Turkish and traces its roots to Turkey. Turkey has already signed an agreement for an exclusive economic area with the Tripoli government. If the Libyan government falls, the agreement would fall with it. So Mr. Erdogan is trying to protect that agreement, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director in Ankara of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.  Mr. Erdogan’s ever more aggressive angling has unnerved his neighbors, especially in Greece, who now openly worry about confrontation. Diplomats in Athens and Brussels say the situation is tensest it has been in more than two decades, since 1996, when the two neighbors exchanged fire in the Aegean. Under pressure, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece is poised to change decades of foreign policy, announcing on Sunday that he was prepared to take Turkey to international arbitration at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But diplomats in Brussels readily admit that there is only so far they can press Turkey, considering how desperately they depend on Mr. Erdogan to control the flow of migrants to Europe, which was destabilized by the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in 2015.  Now, Mr. Erdogan faces the possibility of a new refugee crisis coming from Syria, where Russian and Syrian government forces have redoubled their offensive in Idlib, the last rebel-held province.  Seeking leverage from the potential for a crisis as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany prepares to visit Turkey this month, Mr. Erdogan has warned that he will be forced to open the gates for the refugees to enter Europe again.  Elsewhere, Mr. Erdogan’s flirtation with Russia has stirred American and European ire. So has his foray into Syria, despite President Trump’s apparent green light for it.  Typically, Mr. Erdogan is having none of it. “Of course, everyone is giving advice to us: ‘What are you doing in Syria?’ they say. ‘When will you leave Syria?’” Mr. Erdogan said in London.  “We have only one answer to them: ‘What are you doing in Syria? Do you have a border there? No. And, what are you doing there? You go there from a distance of 10,000 kilometers, 3,000, 5,000. But we have a 911 kilometer-long border.’” Mr. Trump has so far not acted on attempts by Congress to punish Turkey for its purchase of the Russian S400 missile system and for violating United States sanctions against Iran. That has not stopped Mr. Erdogan from threatening to close off United States access to Turkish bases, including Incirlik Air Base, which houses roughly 50 American tactical nuclear weapons.  Mr. Erdogan has also remained loyal to the Arab Spring uprisings since they began in 2011, placing him at odds with longstanding dictators in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, as well as the United States.  Even as other Western nations ceased support when extremists took over the uprisings or, as in the case of Egypt, a counterrevolution ousted the elected Islamist government, Turkey supported the Islamist-leaning groups that emerged from the uprisings. That includes Libya, underlining Mr. Erdogan’s desire for an independent foreign policy.  “Today there is a Turkey with an independent foreign policy, making operations for its own national security without looking for permission from anyone,” he said in London.

Israeli Supreme Court Removes an Obstacle for Netanyahu,2020-01-02,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under indictment, Israel’s Supreme Court on Thursday refused to weigh in on whether a prime ministerial candidate charged with serious crimes can be asked to form a new government. The decision gave Mr. Netanyahu a temporary reprieve ahead of a general election on March 2, and staved off a potential showdown between the government and the judiciary. The judges appeared to leave open the possibility of revisiting the case if Mr. Netanyahu ends up in a position to form a government after the election.  On Wednesday, in his fight for survival, he took the contentious step of asking Parliament to grant him immunity from prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu is Israel’s first sitting prime minister to be charged with crimes, and the first to run for re-election while under such a serious legal cloud. Dozens of people from Israel’s high-tech industry and academia had petitioned the court to resolve the question of Mr. Netanyahu’s eligibility after he was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.  During  a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, the judges made clear that they felt it was premature to rule on the petition before the election — the third in a year — and they appeared far from eager to intervene at such a delicate time. In their decision on Thursday, the three senior justices described the election period as a “kingdom of uncertainty,” adding that a need for a ruling would significantly depend on the results and which candidate comes out on top.  “The petition is premature and theoretical at this time,” they said.  Under Israeli law, a prime minister charged with crimes can continue to serve the term until a final verdict, in part to ensure that the legal authorities cannot topple a prime minister and destabilize the government. The resignation of an Israeli  premier automatically brings down the government.  But the law does not address whether a candidate under indictment can become prime minister. So for now, there is nothing in the law to stop Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, from running for a fourth consecutive term in office, and there is no limit to how many terms he can serve.  Mr. Netanyahu is accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls in exchange for positive news coverage, as well as cigars, champagne and jewelry. A ruling against Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday could have been seen as interfering in the election campaign, and judges are under pressure from conservative forces in the government that want to curb the judiciary’s influence.  In a video released on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu warned the court that it risked falling into what he called a political trap laid by his opponents. “In a democracy,” he said, “the people are the only ones who decide who leads the people, and nobody else.” He and his conservative Likud party argued that the judges should reject the petition on the grounds that the matter was not within the purview of the court. The judges disagreed with that argument, saying the question raised by the petition was “indeed one of principle and important.”  But they said they had decided to act with restraint, this being “the most sensitive and complex period that Israel is experiencing today from a political perspective.” Mr. Netanyahu’s supporters welcomed the decision. “The people are the sovereign,” Miri Regev, the Likud minister of culture, wrote on Twitter. “and the people will decide who will be the prime minister of Israel.” Some analysts said that a court ruling against Mr. Netanyahu at this stage could have caused a popular backlash and brought more voters over to his side in the election. Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party and Mr. Netanyahu’s chief opponent, described the court’s decision as “appropriate,” adding, “Netanyahu will be tried by the people at the polls — and we will win.” The last two elections, in April and September, ended inconclusively, however, with neither Likud nor Blue and White able to muster the majority needed to form a viable government. Other critics and legal experts said the Supreme Court needed to issue an opinion before the election because the voters were entitled to know the court’s stance before casting their ballots.  “The campaign of intimidation and demonization has achieved its goal and powerful forces were able to sow fear in the hearts of the judges,” the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a nongovernmental watchdog, said in a statement. The court, it said, “decided not to deal with an important democratic question and has sent an entire country to vote in elections without knowing the meaning of their vote.”   ']",The court was asked to consider whether a prime ministerial candidate charged with serious crimes can form a new government. It ruled that the petition was premature.
Why the Fires in Australia Are So Bad,2020-01-01,"By Andy Parsons, Russell Goldman and Matthew Abbott","['This fire season has been one of the worst in Australia’s history, with at least 15 people killed, hundreds of homes destroyed and millions of acres burned. And summer is far from over. This week, thousands of residents and vacationers in southeastern Australia were forced to evacuate to shorelines as bush fires encircled communities and razed scores of buildings. Military ships and aircraft were deployed on Wednesday to deliver water, food and fuel to towns cut off by the fires.  The hot, dry conditions that have fueled the fires are nothing new in Australia. Here’s why this fire season has been so calamitous.  Record-breaking temperatures, extended drought and strong winds have converged to create disastrous fire conditions. As a severe heat wave gripped most of the country in mid-December, Australia recorded its hottest day on record, with average highs of 107.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 41.9 degrees Celsius. The heat wave is continuing this week in southeastern Australia, with temperatures expected to reach 105 in Canberra, the capital. The extreme heat has followed the driest spring on record. Most of New South Wales and Queensland have been experiencing shortfalls in rain since early 2017. The drought has hit the country’s most productive agricultural areas, including some of those now ablaze. By early September, Australia started seeing ominous signs about this year’s fire season. On Sept. 9, the Binna Burra Lodge, a historic getaway in the lush mountains of Queensland, was destroyed in a bush fire. The loss, and the blazes in the surrounding rain forests, alarmed scientists, who said that such fires were extremely rare in the usually cool and wet area. The fires have burned across the country in recent months, affecting four out of six states. Australia’s east coast has been hardest hit. By early November, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires in New South Wales, the southeastern state that includes Sydney. On Nov. 11, the state issued a “catastrophic” fire danger rating for the first time in the decade that the current warning system has been in place. In Sydney, which issued a total fire ban, heavy smoke has discolored the sky on many days, and air quality there has at times been among the worst in the world. On Tuesday, social media was filled with photos of blazing red skies and people fleeing to beaches between Sydney and Melbourne. About 10 million acres have burned in New South Wales, destroying nearly 1,000 homes. Around 90 fires are currently raging in the state, with about three dozen more to the south in Victoria. In total, roughly 12 million acres have been burned by the fires. By comparison, about 1.9 million acres burned in the 2018 fires in California; those fires, which were the state’s most destructive, killed about 100 people. As the blazes swept southeastern Australia early this week, the fire season’s death toll reached at least 15, and officials said it was likely to rise. At least seven people were killed on Monday and Tuesday in New South Wales — including a volunteer firefighter, the third to die this season — and another person died in Victoria.    Tens of thousands of firefighters, the vast majority of them volunteers, have worked for weeks, sometimes putting in 12-hour days. The strain on the firefighters has raised questions about the country’s reliance on a volunteer force. Australia’s federal government announced last week that volunteers in New South Wales — as well as other states, if they requested it — would receive compensation of up to about $4,000. That change in policy was initially opposed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. This week, as the fires caused widespread destruction, Australia deployed its military and called on its allies for help. The Australian Defense Force said on Tuesday that it would send Black Hawk and Chinook military helicopters, airplanes and naval ships to Victoria and New South Wales. The government also asked the United States and Canada to provide water tanker aircraft. Canada has pledged to send more than 30 firefighters to help the Australians. The devastating start to the fire season confirmed what scientists have been predicting: that Australia’s bush fires will become more frequent and more intense as climate change worsens. Few if any other developed countries are as vulnerable to changing climate as Australia, according to scientific reports. Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, but climate change, which brings longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat, worsens these conditions and makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. The catastrophic fire conditions have put an intense focus on the Australian government’s failure to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which traps heat when released into the atmosphere. Even as emissions continue to soar, the country, currently governed by a conservative coalition, has found it difficult to reach a political consensus on energy and climate change policy. Those politics, in part, are influenced by Australia’s long mining history and its powerful coal lobby. Climate and weather are different but related concepts. Climate is a description of expected long-term weather patterns in a specific place, while weather is the mix of events occurring in the atmosphere at a particular time and place — think temperature, wind and precipitation. A changing climate has meant an increase in temperatures in the Indian and Southern Oceans, which in turn has meant drier and hotter weather across Australia this summer. The most dangerous fire days occur when hot, dry air blows from the desert center of the continent toward the populous coasts. A weather front — where air masses at different densities meet — can cause the direction of the wind to change rapidly. Ultimately, that means bigger fires spreading in multiple directions. Bush fires can be so large and hot that they generate their own dangerous, unpredictable weather systems. These so-called firestorms can produce lightning, strong winds and even fire tornadoes. What they don’t produce is rain. The volunteer firefighter who died on Monday was crushed after a fire tornado lifted a fire truck off the ground.']","Bush fire season is nothing new to Australians, but this summer has been calamitous — and it’s far from over.

Is There a Risk of Wider War With Iran?,2020-01-03,By Max Fisher,"['In the hours after an American drone strike in Iraq killed Iran’s most important military leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a question has dominated discussion in the Middle East, in Congress and on social media. Could this lead to war between the United States and Iran? In a sense, it already has. The killing of General Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, its elite security and intelligence unit, meets virtually any definition of an act of war, a categorical difference from the shadow conflicts that the United States and Iran have engaged in for years. To Iranian eyes, it is akin to Tehran ordering the death of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  But it remains uncertain where this attack, which follows weeks of tit-for-tat escalations between the two countries, will lead.  What follows is a guide to the risks of greater conflict between the United States and Iran, how the killing of General Suleimani plays into those risks and what might come next. General Suleimani’s killing all but forces Iran to retaliate, most analysts say. That’s not primarily out of national pride or saving face, but because of the fundamental drive of any state: self-preservation, which includes preserving its top leadership.  Killing one of those leaders is more than a slap in the face or a blow to military capabilities; it is a threat to the functioning of the state itself. Iran will feel compelled to retaliate, if only to demonstrate that killing its leaders will trigger counterattacks dire enough to deter the United States from doing so again. But it is difficult to predict how severe that retaliation will be, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the region. Iran has an extraordinarily difficult needle to thread. It will likely aim for counterattacks damaging enough to persuade the United States that killing General Suleimani was not worth it — a high bar, given his value and the far superior American military strength — but not so damaging as to trigger an all-out conflict.  If Iran succeeds, the results could be costly to the United States and its allies, but fall short of triggering outright war. But there is no way for it to know for sure what actions would meet both goals. And miscalculation could lead things to spiral out of control. The past month suggests that both the United States and Iran are already failing to properly calibrate their counterattacks. Each cycle of tit-for-tat escalations has, rather than forcing the other side to back down, instead led the other to ramp up, triggering another round more costly than the last.  In a sense, both sides have already lost control: It’s not as if the United States wanted its Baghdad embassy stormed or Iran wanted its Quds Force commander killed.  Another dynamic makes this cycle even harder to control: American intentions have at times been unclear. Official statements have described limited aims, such as deterring Iranian attacks. But senior officials have also described more sweeping goals like expelling Iran from the wider region or even toppling its government.  The uncertainty, along with the simple fact of overwhelming American military might, puts pressure on Iranian leaders to plan for the worst. And it makes it harder for them to know when they can safely back down.  Faced with a potentially existential threat, any state has two options: stand down and negotiate or hit the source of that threat hard enough to make it back down.  Iran chose to cut a deal most recently in 2015, when, to relieve American-led economic sanctions, it surrendered the bulk of its nuclear program and permitted invasive inspections. But the United States had made that easier by seeking to demonstrate that Iran would not expose itself to existential threats by curbing its nuclear program. Monthslong negotiations allowed Iranian leaders to feel confident that the terms were in their interest and had wide international backing.  But President Trump’s penchant for making sudden policy changes, disdaining international support and withdrawing from agreements, including that very nuclear accord, could shift Iran’s calculus. It may see gambling on retaliation as the safer option. Iran is a regional power with far more sophisticated military capabilities than any country that the United States has gone to war with since World War II. It is a far cry from Saddam Hussein’s crumbling Iraq or armies of North Vietnamese irregulars. And it has invested years of preparation in enduring a possible war. Iran’s escalations are expected to be asymmetric, which means using proxies or small attack groups to target American forces, allies or economic interests. Iran has also shown a willingness to target civilians.  American adversaries have had little success in using asymmetric attacks to force Washington to back down — just as the United States has never found a reliable strategy for deterring asymmetric attacks.  The greatest risk may be that asymmetric Iranian warfare reaches a point where the United States feels compelled to strike Iran directly. Analysts fear that this could lead to a direct, sustained war, but no one can say for sure how easily that might happen.  Iran could hardly win a shooting war with the United States, but its conventional forces would make any ground war costly and drawn out, analysts project. Iran also has extensive medium-range missiles that could strike American bases or allies throughout the Middle East. Iran could call upon proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But no governments are eager to join it in an outright war. American allies in the region —\xa0Israel and Gulf States such as Saudi Arabia — would be unlikely to join unless dragged in by Iranian attacks.  Iraq is coming under growing pressure to choose between the United States and Iran. Should American forces be expelled, Washington would lose a point of significant influence in Iraq, likely granting Iran greater sway in the country. While the possibility of an unintended slide to war is impossible to rule out, fears of World War Three — a phrase that trended overnight on social media — are overblown. Russia and China might strenuously object to American attacks, but they are no more likely to join the fight than they were when the United States invaded Iraq or helped to topple Libya’s government.  The suddenness of this escalation makes it difficult to know how fully Mr. Trump’s administration has thought through and planned for the potential consequences.  Early signs suggest that Mr. Trump’s trademark impulsiveness may have played a role. It is unclear whether European allies were notified in advance. Even Israeli leaders appeared to scramble in response.  Iran’s willingness to take risky actions — perhaps driven by a perception that the scale of the American threat leaves it with no other choice — increases the danger to all sides.  The greatest stakes are not purely political. It can be easy for Americans to forget that Iran is not just an adversary, it is also home to over 80 million civilians, many of whom are already suffering under sanctions. Millions more across the Middle East, where proxy fights are likely to play out, would also be at risk. The burdens of any conflict are likely to fall overwhelmingly on those regular families, as they always do. ']","All but forced to retaliate, Iran will likely aim for limited counterattacks that damage the United States but don’t lead to all-out war. Miscalculation could mean things spiral out of control.

"India Cold Wave Breaks Records, Shuts Schools and Makes Bad Air Worse",2020-01-02,By Hari Kumar and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — A brutal cold wave has swept northern India, blanketing streets in freezing fog, intensifying pollution, disrupting hundreds of flights and prompting school closures. India’s capital, New Delhi, experienced its coldest day in December in 119 years on Monday, with the maximum temperature dipping below 49 degrees Fahrenheit (9.4 Celsius), about 20 degrees below the average for December. Last week, the city broke its longest cold spell in more than two decades, with 10 consecutive days of extreme weather. Northern India, with its expanses of farmland and desert, is more accustomed to heat waves than dangerous cold fronts, both of which have been linked to climate change.  Centralized heating is rare in the region, and many ill-prepared residents rushed to buy warm clothing as nighttime temperatures hovered around freezing and schools near New Delhi were closed. Over the weekend, patients with pneumonia flooded hospitals, and many adults have complained of near-constant coughs and colds. In New Delhi and neighboring states, slowing winds have made air pollution worse, India’s meteorological department said. In the early hours of New Year’s Day, pollution levels in the capital soared to levels more than 20 times what the World Health Organization considers safe.  The fog is often so blinding that drivers cannot see cars slowing down in front of them, causing accidents and highway pileups. In December, hundreds of flights and trains were delayed or canceled because of low visibility. Last week, six people were killed in the city of Noida, near New Delhi, after their car skidded off the road. Investigators blamed heavy fog.  In neighboring Bangladesh, a prolonged cold spell that started in November has left at least 50 people dead, including 17 children, according to Ayesha Akhter, a medical officer in Dhaka, the capital. Most of these deaths were caused by respiratory infections, pulmonary disease or pneumonia, health officials said. “Dense fog is the main cause for the cold,” said R.K. Jenamani, a meteorologist with the national weather forecasting center. He attributed the weather’s severity to storms in the Mediterranean that have caused sudden winter rain in northern India, a phenomenon known as a “western disturbance.”  Retailers are struggling to keep up. Ramesh Gupta, a shopkeeper in New Delhi who works at one of India’s biggest electrical wholesalers’ markets, said that most branded heating appliances had sold out and that prices for basic heaters had doubled in the last week, to about $19 from $10. Vivek Sharma, who sells woolen clothing in South Delhi, said he kept shuttling between his small shop and the warehouses where he replenishes his inventory. Even those places were running low, he said. “I have never seen such demand for warm clothes,” Mr. Sharma said as a customer picked through knitted sweaters. “After an hour, nothing will be left.” The homeless, of course, are especially vulnerable. In New Delhi, the government runs 221 winter shelters that can accommodate nearly 10,000 people. But they are sometimes poorly maintained or ineffectively guarded. In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where thousands sleep on roadside pavements, Yogi Adityanath, the state’s chief minister, distributed blankets to homeless people at a shelter. Soon after he left, Indian news outlets reported that outsiders had tried to steal the blankets, prompting a police investigation. On Tuesday, frigid winds blew a hole in the side of a night shelter in Chandni Chowk, a lower-income part of New Delhi. The 50 or so people sleeping inside started to shiver and drew closer to each other.  “In such biting cold, it is not possible to sleep without a roof,” said Manmohan Singh, a laborer who earns less than $10 a day and sometimes sleeps in the shelter. Outside the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a large hospital in New Delhi that offers free treatment to the country’s poorest, hundreds of patients sprawled out on sidewalks, covering themselves with quilts for a night in the cold. “I have no other option,” said Sarveshwar Pandey, a farmer in a wool cap, who had traveled hundreds of miles from Bihar for knee treatment and slept outside on Tuesday. Kai Schultz contributed reporting.']","Across the north, including New Delhi, plunging temperatures have caused a run on shelters in a region more used to extreme heat. "
"Suleimani’s Gone, and the Iran Nuclear Deal May Be Next",2020-01-03,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — How Iran will respond to the American assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani remains a matter of speculation, but one outcome seems almost certain: the end of Europe’s long effort to keep the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal alive. In interviews on Friday, European analysts envisioned a number of baleful results from the killing of the general, who was a national hero and potential political leader in Iran, and whose death Tehran has vowed to avenge.  Among those were the downgrading of diplomacy, the destabilization of Iraq and the further strengthening of Iran’s hard-liners and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. But the more immediate threat, they said, was to the nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama in 2015.  President Trump pulled the United States out of the treaty in May 2018, calling it “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” and imposed punitive new sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. The other signatories — Europe in particular, but also Russia and China — tried hard to preserve the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. And Iran initially said it would adhere to its treaty obligations. But Tehran has since taken a series of steps away from the treaty, and analysts fear that it may now renounce all of its obligations. Tehran’s strategy could become clear in a matter of days, as it had already said that it was about to take another step away from the accord.  There was speculation that Iran would return to enriching uranium at 20 percent, a major breach of the deal, which the European signatories — France, Britain, Germany and the European Union — have warned against, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “This would give Europeans even less breathing room to keep the J.C.P.O.A. alive until November 2020,” when the world would know whether President Trump is re-elected, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “It will be very difficult for the Europeans to hold it together.”  After conversations on Friday morning with officials in Tehran, she said that “people inside Iran pushing for the diplomatic process the Europeans have been advocating have lost a lot of ground.”  She said she expected the Iranian response to the killing to be on different tracks, potentially including military attacks on American targets in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or elsewhere; cyberattacks; or various other possibilities. Part of the Iranian debate, she said, is whether to retaliate openly or through proxies in a more deniable way, which has been Iran’s practice in the past. “But with the internal pressure building up inside Iran, and now this external pressure, Iranian decision makers will have to let off some steam somewhere,” Ms. Geranmayeh said. Carl Bildt, the former prime minister of Sweden, said that Europe had been trying to prevent war between Iran and the United States for a decade, but that the scope for salvaging the nuclear accord now “is very small, and the scope for diplomacy is extremely limited.” There was a narrowing window before the elections that Iran is due to hold next month, which the conservatives were already expected to win, Mr. Bildt said. “But that window is now gone.” Still, he said, Iran is likely to be careful on how far it acts beyond the accord, since it has tried to keep the nuclear issue largely separate from its regional battles and interests. “I think their response will be more likely on the kinetic side rather than the nuclear one, at least not more than they were going to do anyway,” Mr. Bildt said. His larger concern is the effect on Iraq, which is already a fragile state. “With Iraq now a battleground between the U.S. and Iran,” Mr. Bildt said, “the state of Iraq is weakened considerably more, which will have consequences for everyone,” including Europe. For François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, the killing of General Suleimani creates great uncertainty, and could even produce a push for the general’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to take over the Iranian government. “Iran will react,” he said. “But will this trigger new dynamics in the Iranian government?” Yet the death of even such a prominent military commander may not change Iran’s fundamental calculus of its own interests, which have so far meant dissolving the edges of the nuclear deal without prompting the Europeans to abandon it, Mr. Heisbourg said.  On a more hopeful note, Mr. Heisbourg said that given Mr. Trump’s stated desire to avoid further American military engagement around the world, he might now — having shown toughness — be more open to negotiating with Iran.  And Iran, after some measured retaliation — having watched the tactics of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, with Mr. Trump — might even go along with it. The recently departed chief of the European Union’s foreign and security policy, Federica Mogherini, called the killing of General Suleimani “an extremely dangerous escalation” in the Middle East. But she said on Twitter that she hoped “some of the diplomatic achievements of the past will be preserved.’’ One of her top advisers was more doubtful.  “Even before this killing, Iran was considering whether the next step would be 20 percent enrichment, but now it’s reasonable to assume that and even more,” said the adviser, Nathalie Tocci, who is director of Italy’s Institute of International Relations. “And it’s more or less safe to conclude that there’s very little left we can do” on the nuclear accord. The Europeans “should have been braver” on the nuclear deal, Ms. Tocci said. That would have included getting its alternative trading system with Iran — intended to circumvent American economic sanctions — up and running faster and on a larger scale, and not just for humanitarian goods. Just $2 million in trade was in line this month for the barter program, known as Instex — an amount that the Iranians regard as risible, Ms. Tocci said. “It could have been $200 million,” she said, with more European courage and autonomy. The program was also hindered by a separate initiative by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who tried to be a mediator between Washington and Tehran for a program of prepayment of Iranian oil sales. Iran got excited about that, Ms. Tocci said, but “Macron tried in September to get Washington’s permission and was told, ‘No.’” “It was very French, a huge distraction, and three months were lost,” Ms. Tocci said. And with the Iranian elections coming next month, “given that the conservatives were bound to win, even moderates would have made relatively hard-line moves now.” Whatever the eventual reverberations of the killing, it will be another reminder to Europeans of their collective weakness in the face of unilateralist American policy, Ms. Tocci said.  “Europe is again exposed to the reality that its policy in the Middle East is ancillary to U.S. policy there,” she said. “So as the U.S. withdraws or attacks or whatever it does, we’re exposed to the ensuing mess without the tools to develop an alternative policy.” Europe talks more and more now about “strategic autonomy” from the United States and acting more to defend its own interests, Ms. Tocci added. “But there remains almost a psychological attitude of subservience to Washington. We talk about it and skirt around it, but we’re not there yet.”']",Europe fears that its faltering efforts to preserve the 2015 pact have been dealt a fatal blow with the United States’ killing of a top Iranian commander. 
"A Hit Man, a Detective Novelist and a Woman Who Fell From the Sky",2020-01-03,,"['By Dan Bilefsky Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky, the Montreal-based Canada correspondent for The Times, filling in this week for Ian Austen. Happy New Year! The auspiciousness of 2020 invites inevitable reflections on the past decade. In my case, I have been thinking about the most memorable people I have met or profiled over the past decade or so as a correspondent in places including Paris, London, Istanbul and Prague. Here are 10 — among them a British hit man and the world’s most unlikely monogamist in Turkey. Louise Penny: An Affable Canadian Novelist With a Penchant for Murder \u200b From the moment I met the best-selling writer Louise Penny in the spring of 2018, I was struck by her abiding humanity, even if she had electrocuted one character and bashed another in the head with a door knocker. Ms. Penny, who has grappled with alcoholism and suicide, later told me that her novels were, ultimately, about human goodness. “I know what it’s like to hate yourself so much that you have to murder yourself,” she said. “Coming out the other side gave me a profound belief that goodness exists.” Vaclav Havel: The Playwright Who Overthrew Communism  There are rare people who ennoble you by their sheer presence. One such person was Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, who led the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. When I first met Mr. Havel in Prague back in 2008, he told me about the five years he had spent in prison as a dissident, his 19 plays and his 14 years as president. “I have had a very adventurous life but not because I have an adventurous nature,” he said. In 2011, I froze in place on a rainy street in Istanbul when I learned of his death, before rushing back to my hotel to update his obituary for The Times. Writing it was both inspiring and humbling. Vesna Vulovic: The Woman Who Fell From The Sky  Nearly five decades ago, Vesna Vulovic fell thousands of feet after the plane she was on exploded midair. Miraculously, Ms. Vulovic, a flight attendant from the former Yugoslavia, survived. When I met her at her home in Belgrade in 2008, she told me she had no memory of the fall. But she vividly recalled its aftermath, when she was celebrated as a national hero. She earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest recorded fall without a parachute. She died in 2016 at age 66. \u200bRatko Mladic: The Butcher of Bosnia  When I arrived in the poor, remote Bosnian village where Ratko Mladic grew up, it was covered with blacks crows. It was somehow fitting for the hometown of the Bosnian-Serb general held responsible for the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. In 2010, I and another Times reporter, Doreen Carvajal, investigated his whereabouts. He was captured one year later, in a Serbian farming village. His conviction in November 2017 for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes marked the end of one of Europe’s bloodiest chapters since the end of World War II. Seemona Sumasar: A Revenge Plot So Intricate, The Prosecutors Were Pawns  In 2011, when I was a Metropolitan reporter in New York, I stumbled on a crime story right out of an episode of C.S.I. The case focused on Seemona Sumasar, a petite former Wall Street analyst who had been raped by a former boyfriend. When she refused to drop the charges against him, he framed her for a series of brazen armed robberies that never took place. As a result, the rapist and his victim switched places: Ms. Sumasar spent seven months in prison. “In the collective memory, no one has ever seen anything like this before,” the Queens district attorney told me at the time. Pashe Keqi: A Sworn Virgin of Albania  For centuries in a rural northern part of Albania, people lived under an ancient warrior code called the Kanun, dating to Ottoman times. Under the Kanun, murder must be avenged with blood. Consequently, thousands of men were killed in so-called blood feuds, leaving women alone in a culture where men ruled. Some women adapted by taking an oath of virginity and thereby becoming the men of the house. In 2008, I set out for the mountains of Albania and met Pashe Keqi, 78, a sworn virgin, to learn what had motivated her to swap genders. The resulting story is not one I will soon forget. Freddie Foreman: He Was Once the ‘Godfather of British Crime.’ Now He’s Just a Grandfather. When I was researching my book, “The Last Job,” about a group of geriatric jewel thieves known as “The Bad Grandpas,” I met Freddie Foreman. Mr. Foreman, now 87, was a former hit man for the diabolical Kray twins in London in the 1960s. Yet when I knocked on his door for the first time in 2017, he looked like a sweet grandpa.

"A Hit Man, a Detective Novelist and a Woman Who Fell From the Sky",2020-01-03,,"['By Dan Bilefsky Hi, this is Dan Bilefsky, the Montreal-based Canada correspondent for The Times, filling in this week for Ian Austen. Happy New Year! The auspiciousness of 2020 invites inevitable reflections on the past decade. In my case, I have been thinking about the most memorable people I have met or profiled over the past decade or so as a correspondent in places including Paris, London, Istanbul and Prague. Here are 10 — among them a British hit man and the world’s most unlikely monogamist in Turkey. Louise Penny: An Affable Canadian Novelist With a Penchant for Murder \u200b From the moment I met the best-selling writer Louise Penny in the spring of 2018, I was struck by her abiding humanity, even if she had electrocuted one character and bashed another in the head with a door knocker. Ms. Penny, who has grappled with alcoholism and suicide, later told me that her novels were, ultimately, about human goodness. “I know what it’s like to hate yourself so much that you have to murder yourself,” she said. “Coming out the other side gave me a profound belief that goodness exists.” Vaclav Havel: The Playwright Who Overthrew Communism  There are rare people who ennoble you by their sheer presence. One such person was Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, who led the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. When I first met Mr. Havel in Prague back in 2008, he told me about the five years he had spent in prison as a dissident, his 19 plays and his 14 years as president. “I have had a very adventurous life but not because I have an adventurous nature,” he said. In 2011, I froze in place on a rainy street in Istanbul when I learned of his death, before rushing back to my hotel to update his obituary for The Times. Writing it was both inspiring and humbling. Vesna Vulovic: The Woman Who Fell From The Sky  Nearly five decades ago, Vesna Vulovic fell thousands of feet after the plane she was on exploded midair. Miraculously, Ms. Vulovic, a flight attendant from the former Yugoslavia, survived. When I met her at her home in Belgrade in 2008, she told me she had no memory of the fall. But she vividly recalled its aftermath, when she was celebrated as a national hero. She earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest recorded fall without a parachute. She died in 2016 at age 66. \u200bRatko Mladic: The Butcher of Bosnia  When I arrived in the poor, remote Bosnian village where Ratko Mladic grew up, it was covered with blacks crows. It was somehow fitting for the hometown of the Bosnian-Serb general held responsible for the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. In 2010, I and another Times reporter, Doreen Carvajal, investigated his whereabouts. He was captured one year later, in a Serbian farming village. His conviction in November 2017 for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes marked the end of one of Europe’s bloodiest chapters since the end of World War II. Seemona Sumasar: A Revenge Plot So Intricate, The Prosecutors Were Pawns  In 2011, when I was a Metropolitan reporter in New York, I stumbled on a crime story right out of an episode of C.S.I. The case focused on Seemona Sumasar, a petite former Wall Street analyst who had been raped by a former boyfriend. When she refused to drop the charges against him, he framed her for a series of brazen armed robberies that never took place. As a result, the rapist and his victim switched places: Ms. Sumasar spent seven months in prison. “In the collective memory, no one has ever seen anything like this before,” the Queens district attorney told me at the time. Pashe Keqi: A Sworn Virgin of Albania  For centuries in a rural northern part of Albania, people lived under an ancient warrior code called the Kanun, dating to Ottoman times. Under the Kanun, murder must be avenged with blood. Consequently, thousands of men were killed in so-called blood feuds, leaving women alone in a culture where men ruled. Some women adapted by taking an oath of virginity and thereby becoming the men of the house. In 2008, I set out for the mountains of Albania and met Pashe Keqi, 78, a sworn virgin, to learn what had motivated her to swap genders. The resulting story is not one I will soon forget. Freddie Foreman: He Was Once the ‘Godfather of British Crime.’ Now He’s Just a Grandfather. When I was researching my book, “The Last Job,” about a group of geriatric jewel thieves known as “The Bad Grandpas,” I met Freddie Foreman. Mr. Foreman, now 87, was a former hit man for the diabolical Kray twins in London in the 1960s. Yet when I knocked on his door for the first time in 2017, he looked like a sweet grandpa. Over wine, we talked about his childhood during World War II and, eventually, about murder. It was hard to square the endearing raconteur with the man known as “Brown Bread Fred” (“brown bread” is Cockney rhyming slang for “dead”).

How the U.S. Embassy in Iraq Became a Target,2020-01-01,By Alan Yuhas,"['For months, furious protests have battered Iraq, driven by frustration at a dysfunctional economy, corruption and the pervasive influence of a foreign power: Iran. Then a rocket attack killed an American contractor in Iraq, American airstrikes hit an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, and Iraqis’ anger turned back on the United States, culminating with a break-in at its embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday. The airstrikes and the embassy standoff, with demonstrators drawn largely from Iranian-backed militias, brought the United States to its most serious crisis in the country in years — and pulled it deeper into the volatile problems engulfing Iraq and its neighbor Iran.  Complicated at the best of times, the relations between Iraq, Iran and the United States are now even more fraught.  On Friday, more than 30 rockets were fired at an Iraqi military base near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, killing an American civilian contractor and wounding four American and two Iraqi servicemen. The United States accused an Iranian-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah, of carrying out the attack. A spokesman for the militia denied its involvement. President Trump blamed Iran for the attack, writing Tuesday on Twitter, “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many.” The American military launched airstrikes against the militia over the weekend, killing 24 members in what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called “a decisive response.” He said the United States would “not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy.” The United States and Iran are at longstanding odds — over influence in Iraq, Iran’s nuclear program and other issues — and tensions have spiked under the Trump administration, which pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord and imposed punishing sanctions on Tehran.  But the American airstrikes came at a particularly combustible moment in Iraq, where anger at foreign meddling was already running high. For much of the last 16 years, Iraqis’ ire has been directed at the United States for its invasion and the war and occupation that followed. Iran has also deeply embedded in Iraq, raising fears that the country would be caught in the rivalry between Tehran and Washington.  The country’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, warned that Iraq must not become “a field for settling regional and international scores,” and Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called the airstrikes a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. On Tuesday, protesters stormed the sprawling American Embassy compound in Baghdad. They did not enter the main embassy buildings, and eventually joined thousands of others nearby — many of them members of the fighting groups technically overseen by the Iraqi military, and many chanting, “Death to America.”  Mr. Trump accused Iran of “orchestrating” the break-in, adding that “they will be held fully responsible.” Many of the protesters who broke into the compound were members of Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias. On Wednesday, militia leaders ordered their supporters to stand down, and most of the people outside the compound withdrew. Huge, sometimes violent protests began erupting across Iraq in October, as people angry about unemployment, corruption and shambolic public services poured into the streets. For 12 weeks, the government flailed for a solution, variously promising reform and cracking down.  Those earlier protests, drawing a cross-section of Iraqis, appeared to be broader based than the standoff this week. More than 500 people were killed and 19,000 injured in the earlier unrest, according to the United Nations special envoy to Iraq.  The brutal government response hardened protesters’ resolve, and the protests gradually expanded to include complaints about Iran’s widespread influence in Iraq’s government. (An Iranian general, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, had brokered the deal creating the current government.) Many protesters link Iranian influence to corruption in the government and among Shiite militias.  In November, protesters burned down the Iranian Consulate in the southern city of Najaf, and for weeks, protesters camped outside the heavily guarded Green Zone of Baghdad, the seat of Parliament and the prime minister. By the end of the month, Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi said he would resign. Iraq’s government has been in limbo ever since, unable to pick his successor. After years of competing with the United States for influence over Iraq, Iran has emerged as an aggressive and powerful force in Iraqi life.  Iran wields powerful influence in the government, business and religion. Iranian-linked parties have gained significant strength in Parliament, especially since the American military withdrawal in 2009. And when the Islamic State invaded Iraq in 2014, Iran helped form Shiite militias to fight it, giving it leverage in Iraq’s security. As the militias and the United States — effectively fighting on the same side — drove the Islamic State out of territory it controlled in Iraq, the militias gained influence. They control powerful factions in Parliament and the military, and some have turned into mafia-like groups that use extortion rackets to profit from Iraqis.  Some militias have attacked Iraqi bases where Americans are stationed, too. The populist cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has called for the United States and Iran to leave Iraq, urged the militias to stop “irresponsible actions.” The group accused in Friday’s rocket attack, Kataib Hezbollah, has close ties to Iran, but many Iraqis consider it a primarily Iraqi force. It is separate from the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, though both groups have Iran’s backing and oppose the United States. The State Department has designated both groups as terrorist organizations. Kataib Hezbollah promised “retaliation” for the airstrikes, without providing details. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the United States “must accept full responsibility for the consequences of this illegal action.” The United States has about 5,200 troops in Iraq, and a fluctuating number of civilian contractors. Most of the soldiers are stationed at a base northwest of Baghdad and at a base in the Kurdish-controlled north. The embassy compound in Baghdad opened in 2009 and, at 104 acres, is nearly as large as Vatican City. The compound and the American Consulate in Erbil, in northern Iraq, have a combined staff of 486, most in Baghdad.  After the storming on Tuesday, the Pentagon sent 120 additional Marines to Baghdad. Late Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced that about 750 troops would deploy to the region. The American presence in Iraq has declined sharply from its height during and immediately after the Iraq war. There were nearly 16,000 people in the embassy compound in 2012, and 170,000 troops in Iraq in 2007. Amid rising tensions with Iran this year, the State Department ordered some diplomats to leave the embassy. Adding to the regional turmoil, Iran has also been reckoning with its worst unrest in decades.  These protests began in November with a sudden increase in gasoline prices, and grew into demonstrations against Iran’s leaders and how they have handled American sanctions, a staggering economy and anger from neighbors in Iraq and Lebanon. Thousands of people demonstrated, many from cities with large low-income and working-class populations, but Iran’s security forces crushed the protest, killing up to 450 people, according to human rights groups. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, justified the crackdown by calling the protests a plot by Iran’s enemies at home and abroad.']","After months of turmoil in Iraq, U.S. airstrikes against a pro-Iranian militia drew a backlash."
Pope Francis Apologizes After Slapping Away a Clinging Pilgrim,2020-01-01,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Pope Francis apologized on Wednesday for the flash of anger — or self-protection — that he exhibited while greeting the faithful around the Vatican’s giant Nativity scene after a New Year’s Eve liturgy the evening before. In an incident captured on video and spread across the internet, Francis can be seen reaching into the crowd and seeking the hands of children. As he turns away, a woman in the crowd grabs his right hand with both of her hands and yanks the 83-year-old pope back, causing him to momentarily lose his balance. Francis, visibly upset, slaps twice at the woman’s hands to free himself, rebuking her, and then angrily turns away. In his traditional Wednesday remarks, the pontiff offered an apology as he ruminated on patience and how it conquers “iniquity and power.” “Many times we lose our patience,” he said. “I do, too, and I’m sorry for yesterday’s bad example.”  This is not the first time the world has focused on papal handshakes gone awry. In March, Francis repeatedly withdrew his hand from worshipers as they sought to kiss his ring.  Video of that receiving line also circulated widely, and it became material for jokes on late-night talk shows. It was also a source of consternation for conservatives, many of whom dislike Francis and called the video disturbing evidence of the pope’s breaking with tradition and ritual. The Vatican said at the time that the pope’s motivation for yanking his hand back was itself viral. “It was a simple question of hygiene,” said Alessandro Gisotti, who was then the Vatican’s chief spokesman.  On the papal plane later that month, a reporter jokingly withdrew his hand as Francis sought to shake it, prompting a good-humored explanation from Francis that he had simply been looking out for people’s health.']","As the pontiff greeted members of the public on New Year’s Eve, one woman grabbed his hand with both of hers. A video of the incident was shared widely online."

Bracing for an Even Worse Weekend of Australia Fires,2020-01-03,"By Isabella Kwai, Daniel Victor and Jamie Tarabay","['SYDNEY, Australia — Already besieged by one of the worst wildfire seasons in Australian history, evacuees and those staying put on Friday braced for conditions to grow even more dire.  Across Australia’s southeast, supermarket shelves emptied, gas stations closed and roads became clogged with traffic as skies turned a hellish red or a smoke-choked white. Firefighters were overwhelmed by more than 100 raging blazes and families were forced to make perilous stay-or-go decisions. The toll so far includes 18 deaths, more than 1,000 homes destroyed and thousands of animals killed. On Friday, experts and government officials offered a grim warning: The upcoming weekend is likely to be the most dangerous yet.  Early Friday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service drastically expanded its estimate of the amount of land at risk from spreading fires, including “ember attacks,” in which burning wood fragments are carried by wind. The weekend is expected to bring high winds and temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 38 Celsius.  New South Wales, the state that includes Sydney, declared a state of emergency in its southeastern region on Thursday. Residents and tourists across a broad swath of the southeast were advised to flee.  Across three states, the official word was clear: Evacuate the areas at risk of more fires this weekend. There was still a window, said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales State, for people to get out of towns along the south coast. “Please do not stay in the area unless you absolutely have to,” she said at a briefing on Friday. “When you have so many fires still releasing embers, we know that the wind conditions can make it another terrible day.” Rob Rogers, the deputy fire commissioner for New South Wales, was more blunt. He said there would be no help for anyone who ignored the warnings to leave.  “We’ve been very honest about the risk, but if people choose to stay, that’s on them,” he said. “Do not expect there to be a fire truck when you ring.” He also warned people who decided to stay not to change their minds at the last minute and get on the road. Such moves have been fatal, he said. “Cars are not safe places to be.” In South Australia, fire chief Mark Jones said he was disappointed that many people had not heeded official warnings to leave Kangaroo Island, off the coast of the state, where an uncontrolled blaze swept through about 35,000 acres of national park with no end in sight. “It may be too late for them,” he said on Friday. “We urge them to seek safety.” The Royal Australian Navy began rescuing people trapped in Mallacoota, a seaside town in Victoria, after fires cut off its land-based escape routes. The Department of Defense said on Friday afternoon that 57 people had departed on one of its ships, and about 900 would leave throughout the day.  About 4,000 people, including about 3,000 tourists, were trapped in the town, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Some people would be unable to board the ships because it required using ropes to get on board, ABC reported. Those who made it onto a ship will take a 17-hour voyage to get to Melbourne. More than 1,000 homes have been destroyed by the wildfires in Australia — and the toll has the potential to get worse.  Mick and Sue Kelly spent much of the last 20 years building the home of their dreams on a patch of forested land in Surf Beach, six miles south of Batemans Bay. “He’s not a bricklayer, but he laid every brick himself,” Ms. Kelly said of her husband. They would sleep in one room with their two children while the rest of the house was under construction. He would go to his job and save up money and then take a break to work on the house. On Christmas Day, the couple, now in their 60s, hosted their children and grandchildren as they had done every year, even as they knew fires were burning trees 15 miles from their home. Six days later, as the year ended, the house caught fire. The whole structure — the gabled roofs, the Edwardian columns and the inner courtyard garden were decimated. Only a sandstone skeleton remained.  “The wind changed on New Year’s Eve to a southerly and brought all the embers with it, they covered the whole house and we ran for our lives,” said Mr. Kelly.  People staying behind on the south coast were preparing for the worst, after days of dwindling resources.  Clarinda Campbell, 37, said she and her two children had been without power and had barely slept since Tuesday, when fires swept through the area. They fled to a property owned by her parents in Surf Beach, where phone reception was out in all but a few spots. Water and food sources were running low, with no way to store them, and there was no garbage disposal service. Radio was the main source of information, and shops were accepting only cash.  But the community rallied together, she said. On Friday, a neighbor brought fresh bread, which is now a luxury. “It has been very touching,” Ms. Campbell said. “In the crisis you see the best and the worst.”  On Friday, the family fueled up their cars in case a getaway was necessary.  Without the use of phones, they had to make contingency plans. Ms. Campbell said she was nervously waiting for Saturday, when her husband, who had stayed behind in the town of Broulee to defend their home, was supposed to run to a nearby hilltop with a sliver of cellular reception, to let her know if he was safe.  With the possibility of fires blocking escape routes, she was trying to reach her husband on Friday to persuade him to leave. “It feels like it’s not real,” she said. “I’ve gone to sleep every night and woken up every morning hoping that it was just a bad dream.”  Bernard Kreet, a caterer in Catalina, said he was hosting two families who had been evacuated from other towns, thinking that Catalina would probably avoid the worst.

The Australia Wildfires in Pictures,2020-01-03,By The New York Times,"['Flames have blackened an area the size of Guatemala, destroyed some 2,000 homes and killed at least 28 people in one of the worst wildfire seasons in Australian history. More than 200 blazes are still burning, many of them completely uncontrolled. On Saturday, Victoria’s Forest Fire Management confirmed on Twitter that one of its firefighters had died while working on a bushfire near Omeo. On Friday, two of the biggest infernos merged into what officials called a “mega-fire,” straddling the country’s two hardest-hit and most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria. Steady winds continue to drive the flames, but the record-breaking heat that made conditions worse last month and into the new year has abated, and the possibility of at least a little rain next week entered the forecast. The fire season began early this year, in September, enabled by heat, wind and drought that had left trees and brush tinder dry. The blazes grew steadily worse and have consumed more than 41,000 square miles so far, spreading a harmful shroud of smoke across much of southeastern Australia, and even touching some suburbs of Sydney, the most populous city. Here is a look at some of the most powerful images of the fires and the devastation they have left behind, the people and animals attempting to escape them, and the continuing effort to contain them.

‘It’s Going to Be a Blast Furnace’: Australia Fires Intensify,2020-01-02,"By Livia Albeck-Ripka, Jamie Tarabay and Richard Pérez-Peña","['INVERLOCH, Australia — They fled from looming firestorms that threatened to cut off their escape, only to join a slog alongside the masses of others who crowded the roads. Thousands more waited for rescue by sea. Across the scorched southeast, frightened Australians — taking a few cherished things, abandoning their homes and vacation rentals, and braving smoke that discolored the skies — struggled Thursday to evacuate as wildfires turned the countryside into charcoal wasteland. And from government officials came a disheartening warning: This weekend will be one of the worst periods yet in Australia’s catastrophic fire season. “It’s going to be a blast furnace,” Andrew Constance, the transport minister of New South Wales, told The Sydney Morning Herald. The blazes have strained the country’s firefighting resources, and the fire season, though still young, already ranks as among the worst in Australia’s recorded history. The state of New South Wales declared an emergency in its southeastern region on Thursday, calling on residents and vacationers to evacuate. Mr. Constance said the relocation was the largest in the region’s history. [Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia’s blazes intensify.] To the south, the state of Victoria declared a disaster on Thursday, allowing it to authorize the evacuation of areas along its eastern coast. Using any means they could find, the authorities were warning people to evacuate. But with communication in some areas spotty to nonexistent, it was not clear that everyone would get the message.  In just the past week, at least nine people have died, and many more are unaccounted for. In all, at least 18 people have died in this fire season.  The blazes have consumed more than 1,000 houses, killed countless animals and ravaged a Pacific coast region of farms, bush, eucalyptus forests, mountains, lakes and vacation spots. About 15 million acres have been blackened over the past four months, and more than 100 wildfires are still burning.  With the Southern Hemisphere summer barely underway and the country already reeling from record-breaking heat, no one expects relief any time soon. No rain is in the forecast. “We’re still talking four to six weeks at best before we start to see a meaningful reprieve in the weather,” Shane Fitzsimmons, the rural fire commissioner for the state of New South Wales, told reporters. In Mallacoota, a coastal town in Victoria state, the Australian Navy on Friday began ferrying to safety some of the 4,000 people trapped there when flames cut off all escape routes on land.  People camped on the beach and slept in small boats, they said, trying to shield themselves from flying embers as the inferno moved toward them. The heavy smoke meant only a few people with medical problems could be evacuated by helicopter. Among those on the beach was Justin Brady, a musician who just moved from Melbourne to Mallacoota, about 250 miles to the east. He managed to salvage a fiddle, a mandolin and some harmonicas before abandoning the home he built and its contents to the flames. “It’s been pretty heavy,” he said. Others nearby were not nearly so measured, venting their anger at the national and state governments, which they said had not taken the crisis seriously enough. Michael Harkin, who lives in Sydney and was vacationing in Mallacoota, complained of “incompetent governance” that is “not keeping us safe at all.” “I’m looking forward to getting somewhere that isn’t here,” he said. The emergency services minister of New South Wales, David Elliott, drew withering criticism on social media after he left the country on Tuesday for a vacation in Britain and France. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that he said he would return “if the bushfire situation should demand it.” Mr. Elliott’s departure came just weeks after Prime Minister Scott Morrison was widely ridiculed for taking a vacation in Hawaii during the crisis. He cut his trip short.  The Navy ship that arrived at Mallacoota, the HMAS Choules, delivered food, water and medical supplies, and was expected to leave with hundreds of evacuees. Once it is far enough from shore, the sickest people can be taken away by helicopter.  The Choules will return for more people, officials said, but it will be a slow process; the trip to a safe port in the sprawling country is expected to take 17 hours. Many of the people aboard the cramped ship will have to spend most of that time sitting on the open deck. The evacuation orders have been easier to make than to carry out. Two-lane roads are carrying highway-level traffic, and some roads have been closed by the fires or blocked by downed trees and power lines. Long lines of cars snake around gas stations, tanks run dry, and drives that would normally take two hours last half a day or more. The state premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said 17 people were still missing as fires swept alpine resorts and the normally bucolic Gippsland area. Thousands of people have gone days without electricity or phone service. With cell towers destroyed but landlines still working, long lines formed at pay phones, creating scenes from another era. Officials advised people to boil water before using it, after power failures knocked out local water treatment facilities. Stores have run short of essentials like diapers, baby formula, bread and bottled water. With lodgings full, many people fleeing the fires have been forced to sleep in their cars.  Businesses with generators have continued to operate, but some have run out of fuel, and others are near that point. Craig Scott, the manager of a supermarket in Ulladulla, a beach town about 100 miles south of Sydney, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he planned to keep the generator there running by siphoning fuel from the tanks of fishing boats. He said the store had just gotten the generator a few months ago, when no one imagined how desperately it would be needed. So vast and intense are the fires that they can create their own weather, generating winds as they suck in fresh air at ground level, and sparking lightning in the immense ash clouds that rise from them. Canberra, Australia’s capital, recorded the worst air quality ever measured on Thursday; the largest city, Sydney, has been suffering through intense smoke for weeks; and ash from the blazes has darkened skies and coated glaciers in New Zealand, more than a thousand miles away. The fires have set off anger at Prime Minister Morrison, in particular. He has played down the role of global warming, opposed measures to combat climate change and, at least initially, rejected additional funding for firefighters. On Thursday, Mr. Morrison was heckled as he visited Cobargo, a New South Wales village where fires have killed two men and destroyed the main street. When he extended his hand to one woman, she said she would shake it only if he increased spending on firefighting. “You won’t be getting any votes down here, buddy,” one man yelled. “You’re out, son.”  As Mr. Morrison left hurriedly, the man taunted him about returning to Kirribilli House, the prime minister’s elegant official residence in Sydney, with spectacular views of the harbor and the city. “I don’t see Kirribilli burning,” the man yelled. Mr. Morrison said he understood residents’ frustration. “I’m not surprised people are feeling very raw at the moment,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “That’s why I came today, to be here, to see it for myself, to offer what comfort I could.”  “I understand the very strong feelings people have — they’ve lost everything,” he said, adding that there were still “some very dangerous days ahead.” Livia Albeck-Ripka reported from Inverloch, Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong, and Richard Pérez-Peña from London. Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Sydney.']","Calling for evacuations along the southeastern coast, officials said the next few days would be among the worst yet in an already catastrophic fire season."
Pro-Iranian Protesters End Siege of U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,2020-01-01,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — After a second day of tense protests at the American Embassy in Baghdad, thousands of pro-Iranian demonstrators dispersed on Wednesday, ending a siege that had trapped American diplomats in the embassy compound overnight and winding down a potentially explosive crisis for the Trump administration. The demonstrators had swarmed outside the embassy, chanting “Death to America!” Some tried to scale the compound’s walls, and others clambered onto the roof of the reception building they had burned the day before.  In contrast to Tuesday, when some demonstrators forced their way into the compound and set some of the outbuildings on fire, the crowd on Wednesday was smaller and no protesters breached the compound’s gates. When the demonstrators — largely members of Iranian-backed militias angered by deadly American airstrikes over the weekend — reached the roof of the burned reception building on Wednesday, American security forces, including Marine reinforcements sent by the Pentagon the day before, fired tear gas to drive them back. The full withdrawal came after leaders of the Iranian-backed militias who had organized the demonstration called on the crowd to leave, and most gradually drifted away on foot or drove off in trucks.  The leaders later announced that their agreement to withdraw was conditioned on a commitment from Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to move ahead with legislation to force American troops to withdraw from Iraq.  Whether or not such a law comes to pass, the episode reflected the new reality in Iraq. Iran’s ability to deploy militias to blockade American diplomats inside the embassy for most of two days made clear how much power they wield within the Iraqi government.  Despite a 16-year American effort to establish a government friendlier to Western interests, at a cost of more than $1 trillion and 5,000 American lives, Iraq’s leaders lined up in opposition to the American airstrikes and its security forces allowed the militias to reach the American diplomatic compound. Some people wearing the uniforms of the Iraqi security forces were even seen attacking the compound themselves. The Iraqi government’s acquiescence raises the question of whether the continued American presence in Iraq is tenable. The two-day standoff at the embassy evoked traumatic memories of earlier attacks on American diplomatic posts in Tehran and Benghazi, Libya, though it ended peacefully, without reports of deaths or injuries. But it was not likely to be the last word on the matter. “This is one round of many rounds to come,” said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington.  Miscalculations by both the United States and Iran led to the standoff. It began with a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base on Friday that killed an American contractor and wounded several Iraqi and American service members. The United States blamed Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia with close ties to Iran. The militia denied involvement in the rocket attack. American forces retaliated with airstrikes on five sites controlled by the militia, in Syria and Iraq, on Sunday. The airstrikes killed at least two dozen people and wounded twice as many; Iran has put the death toll at 31. Iran’s proxy militias seemed to think they could conduct hit-and-run attacks on military bases without fear of retaliation, and the United States thought it could punish them with sweeping airstrikes without consequence. Both assumptions turned out to be wrong. The American airstrikes, set off a broad outcry in Iraq that the United States seemed not to have anticipated and that now looks likely to precipitate an effort to expel all American forces.  On Tuesday, thousands of Iraqi militia fighters marched on the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad to protest the American strikes, and some of them forced their way through the outer wall. They did not attempt to breach the embassy itself. The Iraqi authorities, who had prevented previous demonstrators from even entering the Green Zone that encompasses the embassy, allowed the protesters to approach the diplomatic compound unimpeded. In recent months, in the face of antigovernment protests, it was Iraqi forces firing tear gas to dispel protesters. But this week, the Iraqi authorities left the task to the United States, rather than confront their own people. The militias, although closely tied to Iran, are made up of Iraqis and fall under the umbrella of the Iraqi security forces, though they have a great deal of independence.  But the Trump administration sees both the killing of the American contractor and the attack on the embassy as the direct work of Iran. “These are the kinds of tactics that they use,” Brian Hook, the administration’s special representative for Iran, said in an interview on CNN on Wednesday. “Forty years ago they stormed our embassy. And then here we are 40 years later and they’re directing these terrorist groups to then attack our embassy.” President Trump tweeted Tuesday that Iran “will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities.” “They will pay a very BIG PRICE!"" he said. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded on Wednesday, taunting, “You can’t do anything.” Iraqi militias played a crucial role in the fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS. While many of the armed groups, which are principally made up of Shiite Muslims, are backed by Iran, a Shiite theocracy at odds with the United States, the two powers had a common goal in their effort to defeat the Islamic State.  Once the Islamic State was largely demolished, however, the Iran-backed militias turned their attention to constraining United States activities in Iraq, especially after the Trump administration ratcheted up its sanctions against Iran. The administration said that the militias had carried out 11 attacks on Iraqi bases housing American service members in just the past two months and that the airstrikes were a necessary deterrent to prevent further attacks. There are about 30 militias under the banner of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, each answering to different leaders who do not always agree with one another. Neither the government nor any of the factions has the authority to corral all of them, making for a dangerous mix. If the United States intended to send a message of deterrence with the airstrikes on Sunday, the Iraqi militias also had a message for the Americans. Scrawled on a wall of the embassy was graffiti using a nickname for Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “He passed through here,” the message said.  Some militia members hung a green banner with yellow writing on the burned embassy reception area saying “Popular Mobilization Commission,” the umbrella group for the militias, as if to remove any doubt about who was in charge. Late Wednesday afternoon, the commission asked its members to end the protest “out of respect for the government’s sovereignty.” The protesters’ message, it said, “has been heard.” Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, and Alissa Rubin from Paris.']","Iran’s ability to deploy militias to attack the American Embassy, with Iraqi support, made clear how much power it wields in Iraq.

Mexico Prison Fight Leaves at Least 16 Inmates Dead,2020-01-01,By Elian Peltier,"['A fight at a prison in northern Mexico has left at least 16 inmates dead and five wounded, the local authorities said, in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the country’s troubled penal system for years. The violence broke out Tuesday afternoon at the Cieneguillas men’s penitentiary in the state of Zacatecas, said the state’s public safety secretary, Ismael Camberos Hernández. He said that prison officials were alerted by alarms and the sounds of gunshots and that they grappled for nearly three hours to bring the situation under control.  Four guns were discovered in the prison after the riot, Mr. Hernández said. He said they had most likely reached inmates on Tuesday, when relatives could visit for the last day of the year. Prison personnel also confiscated cellphones and knives during an inspection of inmates’ cells on Sunday, Mr. Hernández added. The authorities did not say how the fight started, but several Mexican news outlets reported that inmates from rival cartels had turned a dispute over a friendly soccer game into a deadly fight.  The brawl on Tuesday was the latest episode of spiraling violence in Mexican prisons, many of which are overcrowded and poorly guarded. In 2016, nearly 50 inmates died in a blood bath that involved dozens of hammers and makeshift blades. In October, six inmates died in a clash between rival groups at a prison in the central state of Morelos. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has come under heightened pressure in recent months to respond to relentless violence in the country, which he has promised to tackle at its roots. He was elected in 2018 on the promise of fighting poverty and inequalities with “abrazos no balazos” — hugs, not bullets — and he has also created a new armed force, the National Guard.']",Officials said several guns were found in the penitentiary.
Airstrike That Killed Suleimani Also Killed Powerful Iraqi Militia Leader,2020-01-03,By Alan Yuhas,"['The American airstrike that killed a powerful Iranian general in Iraq on Friday also killed an Iraqi militia leader who was one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq and a veteran of battles against the United States and the Islamic State. The death of the militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, alone would have sent shock waves through Iraq, even if Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the intelligence chief who led Iran’s Quds Force, had not died with him.  As the deputy commander of a loose coalition of militias, Mr. al-Muhandis oversaw a disparate military force that arose to help Iraq defeat the Islamic State but has since become a power unto itself, its members operating with significant independence, often at the behest of Iran. Mr. al-Muhandis was also a founder of the individual militia that was attacked by American airstrikes on Sunday and that led the assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad this week. He is still considered heroic by many Iraqis for his ability to corral Iraq’s bickering militias into an effective fighting force against the Islamic State. In the vacuum that followed Saddam Hussein’s fall, he created new networks to undermine the American occupation. And when Iran sought to embed itself in Iraqi life, it was Mr. al-Muhandis, fluent in Persian and close to General Suleimani, who served as its reliable right hand. Mr. al-Muhandis advised the general, and both men preferred to operate from the shadows, even as their exploits earned them fame at home and enemies in the West. Born Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, he was better known by his nom de guerre and gained his greatest prominence leading the mostly Shiite militias that formed to fight the Islamic State in 2014.  Mr. al-Muhandis kept close ties with Iran throughout his life, including during the campaign that made him most popular at home: As Iraqi militias fought against the Islamic State, or ISIS, he publicly thanked Iran and General Suleimani for their support.  Iraq’s military condemned the airstrike that killed Mr. al-Muhandis, saying in a tweet that it mourned him as a hero. Mr. al-Muhandis’s ties to Iran were well known. In 2009, he was identified as an adviser to General Suleimani by the United States Treasury Department, and accused of helping smuggle rockets, sniper rifles and other weapons from Iran to Iraq. American officials said he had also provided “logistical support for attacks” against coalition forces in Iraq and sent militia fighters to train in Iran. Long before the American invasion of Iraq, he was accused of playing a role in the bombings of the French and American Embassies in Kuwait, in 1983, and the later attempt to assassinate Kuwait’s emir. In 2007, a Kuwaiti court sentenced him to death in absentia. Much of Mr. al-Muhandis’s history remains murky, including his exact age: He would have been about 66 or 67 at the time of his death, according to the United States government, which has said he was born in 1953 in Basra, Iraq.  Mr. al-Muhandis fled Iraq with the rise of Saddam Hussein, who tried to crush the Islamic Dawa party, a Shiite group of which the future militia leader was a member.  Mr. al-Muhandis hoped to turn Iraq into a Shiite state similar to Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. And he spent years in exile there, cultivating close ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, becoming fluent in Persian and keeping a home in Tehran. He and many other Shiite leaders returned to Iraq in the aftermath of the American invasion in 2003, and Mr. al-Muhandis briefly served in Iraq’s Parliament before dropping out of public view. He also helped found Kataib Hezbollah, a militia that targeted the United States during the Iraq war and was accused of training and equipping a network of anti-American groups. Kataib Hezbollah has continued to oppose the United States, and American officials blamed it for a rocket attack that killed an American contractor last week.  Kataib Hezbollah, which is separate from Hezbollah in Lebanon, denied responsibility for the attack.  After the attack, the United States launched airstrikes on five Kataib Hezbollah locations, killing at least 24 militia members. In response, pro-Iranian demonstrators, drawn largely from militias, swarmed the American Embassy compound in Baghdad, setting some outbuildings on fire. The demonstrating militia members dispersed a day later, on orders from militia leaders, just days before Americans launched the drone attacked that killed Mr. al-Muhandis. In a reflection of the chaos that has engulfed Iraq and the region, it was only five years after the Treasury Department put sanctions on Mr. al-Muhandis that he found himself effectively on the same side as the United States. The invasion of Iraq by the Islamic State from Syria gave his militia, Iran and the United States a common enemy.  Mr. al-Muhandis set about organizing mostly Shiite militias against ISIS, and the groups stepped in where Iraq’s military had collapsed and slowly wrested back territory. About 30 militias have been loosely organized under an umbrella group, called the Popular Mobilization Forces, or P.M.F., that is technically overseen by Iraq’s government. But neither the Iraqi military nor any single faction has the authority to bring all the militias into consistent line: Each militia answers to its different leaders, who do not always agree with each other. Many, but not all, have ties to Iran. The militias played a crucial role in demolishing ISIS’s self-declared caliphate, and Mr. al-Muhandis became “the most powerful single actor” among the militias, according to a November 2019 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The report described him as “in essence an Iranian agent.” After helping drive ISIS out of its territory in Iraq, many of the Iran-backed militias began trying to limit American activities in the country. Efforts by the current prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to curb the activities of Mr. al-Muhandis had failed, the report said.  American warnings to the Iraqi government about Mr. al-Muhandis went at least as far back as 2014, according to the The New Yorker. That year, the magazine said that Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq, said that American officials told the prime minister at the time “that if Muhandis wanted to stay healthy he needed to stay in Iran.”']","Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a lifelong ally of Iran, was the Iraqi deputy commander of the group overseeing militias, and long at odds with the United States."
"Israel Lauds Suleimani Assassination, Though With Caution",2020-01-03,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — For years, he was a distant adversary, overseeing attacks on Israeli and Jewish targets abroad. But as time went on, the threat from Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani loomed ever larger and closer for Israel. So the assassination of the Iranian commander in an American drone strike in Baghdad early Friday was greeted with satisfaction in Israel, though also with a degree of caution as the country went on alert for possible retaliation. General Suleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, oversaw an Iranian program to surround Israel with tens of thousands of missiles, according to experts. He was also the architect of Iran’s recent entrenchment in Syria and of an ambitious plan to build an Iranian front against Israel across its northern frontier, in the Golan Heights.  After a decades-old shadow war between Israel and Iran fought mostly through proxies or clandestine means, the new proximity brought the arch foes to direct blows. Amid the heightened tensions, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cut short an official visit to Greece and returned home on Friday afternoon, while his ministers mostly kept a low profile in an apparent effort to avoid undue Iranian attention. Before boarding a plane home, Mr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”  “Israel stands with the United States in its just struggle for peace, security and self-defense,” he said. Israel’s recently appointed defense minister, Naftali Bennett, held consultations at military headquarters in Tel Aviv and released a photograph of the meeting that showed the participants — the military chief of staff, the Mossad chief and other security officials — perhaps to demonstrate readiness and create deterrence. As a precaution early Friday, the Israeli military announced the closing of a ski run in the Israeli-controlled portion of the northern Golan Heights that borders Syria. The heightened tensions come at a delicate time for Israel, after two inconclusive elections in April and September failed to produce a new government, and with a third vote set for March 2. The latest events have most likely provided a welcome distraction for Mr. Netanyahu. Though strong on security and hawkish on Iran, he was indicted in November in three corruption cases and is fighting for his survival. Before the American strike on Friday, the Israeli discourse was dominated by Mr. Netanyahu’s contentious request this week for parliamentary immunity from prosecution.  Still, Israeli opposition politicians lined up behind the embattled prime minister, praising Mr. Trump for his decision to take military action. Benny Gantz, a former military chief and now Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, said that in matters of state security, there was no opposition to the government.  In a statement, he described the assassination of General Suleimani as “the appropriate response to anyone responsible for the murder of countless innocent people and for undermining global stability.” General Suleimani’s net around Israel spread from the Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon to the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, where he provided support to Hamas and was the main patron of Islamic Jihad. Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, offered its condolences to Iran, saying in a statement that General Suleimani had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.” Hamas condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. Basem Naim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Israeli analysts, however, suggested that the prospect that Israel would be the immediate target of Iranian retaliation was slim.  “I don’t think the Iranians are now looking to bring more enemies into the battlefield,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. The removal of General Suleimani was important for Israel, he said, operationally and symbolically.  “It will take the Iranians some time at least to build a replacement for him,” said Mr. Amidror, who is a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America.  In addition, he said, the strike will have calmed fears in Israel about the United States’ willingness to act in the region. The assassination of General Suleimani ends a long chapter in Israeli history. Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted there were Israeli intelligence officials who had spent their whole careers tracking General Suleimani, starting as rookies and ending up as generals themselves. Israel had the opportunity to assassinate General Suleimani in the past, he said, but refrained from doing so, believing it would be seen as an act of war.  Mr. Yaari said the Trump administration had been a great friend to Israel but essentially left it to cope alone with General Suleimani’s buildup in Syria and the growing force of militant groups in Gaza. “Now,” Mr. Yaari said, “we see an American strike against the Iranian apex.”']",Israeli intelligence had long tracked the Iranian commander whose shadow loomed ever larger and closer.

Before the American strike on Friday, the Israeli discourse was dominated by Mr. Netanyahu’s contentious request this week for parliamentary immunity from prosecution.  Still, Israeli opposition politicians lined up behind the embattled prime minister, praising Mr. Trump for his decision to take military action. Benny Gantz, a former military chief and now Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, said that in matters of state security, there was no opposition to the government.  In a statement, he described the assassination of General Suleimani as “the appropriate response to anyone responsible for the murder of countless innocent people and for undermining global stability.” General Suleimani’s net around Israel spread from the Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon to the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, where he provided support to Hamas and was the main patron of Islamic Jihad. Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, offered its condolences to Iran, saying in a statement that General Suleimani had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.” Hamas condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. Basem Naim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Israeli analysts, however, suggested that the prospect that Israel would be the immediate target of Iranian retaliation was slim.  “I don’t think the Iranians are now looking to bring more enemies into the battlefield,” said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. The removal of General Suleimani was important for Israel, he said, operationally and symbolically.  “It will take the Iranians some time at least to build a replacement for him,” said Mr. Amidror, who is a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America.  In addition, he said, the strike will have calmed fears in Israel about the United States’ willingness to act in the region. The assassination of General Suleimani ends a long chapter in Israeli history. Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted there were Israeli intelligence officials who had spent their whole careers tracking General Suleimani, starting as rookies and ending up as generals themselves. Israel had the opportunity to assassinate General Suleimani in the past, he said, but refrained from doing so, believing it would be seen as an act of war.  Mr. Yaari said the Trump administration had been a great friend to Israel but essentially left it to cope alone with General Suleimani’s buildup in Syria and the growing force of militant groups in Gaza. “Now,” Mr. Yaari said, “we see an American strike against the Iranian apex.”']",Israeli intelligence had long tracked the Iranian commander whose shadow loomed ever larger and closer. 
Outrage in Iran After Killing of Suleimani: Here’s What You Need to Know,2020-01-05,,"['Iran’s government said it was no longer abiding by a commitment it made under the 2015 nuclear deal and it would not limit its enrichment of uranium. The decision to lift all restrictions on the production of nuclear fuel meant the effective end of the nuclear deal, experts said, though Iran left open the possibility that it will return to the limits if sanctions are lifted. “It’s finished. If there’s no limitation on production, then there is no deal,” said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonprofit in Washington. The announcement came after Iran’s National Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the country’s nuclear policy in the aftermath of Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani’s assassination. The statement said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran will end its final limitations in the nuclear deal, meaning the limitation in the number of centrifuges. Therefore Iran’s nuclear program will have no limitations in production including enrichment capacity and percentage and number of enriched uranium and research and expansion.” But the government said Iran would continue its cooperation with International Atomic Agency. The announcement followed several steps by Iran to move away from the terms of the agreement, nearly two years after President Trump withdrew the United States from the deal. Since that renunciation, the Trump administration has imposed severe sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s economy. The nuclear agreement had ended many economic sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledge to use nuclear power peacefully. The European parties to the deal, including Britain, France and Germany, had struggled to preserve the agreement amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran’s statement Sunday did not include details about its enrichment ambitions. And the country did not say it was expelling the inspectors who monitor its nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted: Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear expert on Iran and associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter that the announcement was “ambiguous,” with room for “both negotiation and escalation.”  “War crime,” said Iran’s foreign minister. “It doesn’t work that way,” replied President Trump. Earlier in the day, the American president, taking to Twitter, had warned Iran against retaliating for the killing of General Soleimani. He said the United States had already picked out targets to hit in Iran if it did, including cultural sites. “Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis!” Iran’s information and telecommunications minister  declared on Twitter. ”They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit."" The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that “targeting cultural sites is a war crime.” But on Sunday evening, aboard Air Force One on his way back from his holiday trip to Florida, Mr. Trump did not back down. “They’re allowed to kill our people,” he said to reporters. “They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.” Iraqi lawmakers voted 170-0 on Sunday in favor of expelling American troops from their country, just days after a United States drone strike killed the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force on Iraqi soil. The vote was not final and many lawmakers did not attend the session. But Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi drafted the language and submitted the bill to Parliament, leaving little doubt about his support. The drone strike that killed the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, at the Baghdad airport on Friday also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias. The attack was viewed in Iraq as a violation of the nation’s sovereignty, and the country’s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that it had summoned the American ambassador in Baghdad. Iraq’s Parliament was divided over demands from angry citizens to expel American troops. Many of its 328 members, primarily Kurds and Sunnis, did not attend Sunday’s session and did not vote. In his speech to lawmakers, Mr. Mahdi laid out two possibilities: to either quickly end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq, or to set a timeline for that expulsion.  The measure approved by the Parliament did not include a timeline, and only instructed the government to end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq. Officials said no decision had been made about whether any American troops would be able to stay, or under what conditions. Iranian officials reacted to the vote with congratulatory messages and said General Soleimani’s death had delivered a huge victory over the United States. Hesameddin Ashena, a top adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, in a Twitter post, said: “Expanding friendship with our neighbors and domestic unity are the best gifts for protecting our national security. America and Israel are the only winners of a rift between neighbors.” Asked about the vote on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States would continue to battle the Islamic State. “It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region,” he said in an interview on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” If American forces leave the country, European Union and coalition forces will likely have to follow, because they rely on the American logistics and intelligence resources to protect their forces and the civilians that work with them. NATO has already announced the suspension of its training mission for Iraqi forces. From Israel to Saudi Arabia, the United States’ allies in the Middle East have long warned Washington about Iran’s campaigns in the region — many of them masterminded by General Suleimani. But with scant exception, their response to his killing has been silence.  Iran has built close ties with the government of Syria and armed groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. That puts many Iranian partners within firing range of American allies like Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For many of them, the wisest course of action over the weekend seemed to be to say nothing. “Saudi Arabia and all the gulf countries are just quiet,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, a political sociologist in Saudi Arabia. “They don’t want to antagonize the Iranians, because the situation in the region is so delicate, so divided, so sensitive, that you don’t want to stir it up further.” The spread of Iran’s network means that it could rely on allied forces to strike — for instance at Saudi oil facilities, just across the Persian Gulf — while giving Tehran a way to deny responsibility.  And many officials in the Middle East are concerned about the degree of support they can expect from Mr. Trump should they become targets of Iranian retaliation, cyberattack or sabotage. Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi deputy defense minister, flew to Washington this weekend to meet with American officials. In Iraq, pro-Iranian militias pose a powerful threat to groups that prefer the United States. In Lebanon, American allies kept quiet to avoid Hezbollah, a major political party and the country’s strongest military force.  And even in Israel, celebrations were muted, with officials wanting to avoid any suggestion of involvement in the killing. “The entire region is on edge, as we are in unchartered territory,” said Taufiq Rahim, a senior fellow at the foundation New America who works in the Persian Gulf. “There is no way to be ready for what comes next, because anything could be a target.” The American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria said on Sunday that it was pausing its yearslong mission of attacking the Islamic State and training local forces in both countries as United States forces braced for retaliation from Iran over the killing of its top military commander. A statement from the American command pointed to recent attacks on Iraqi and American bases, one of which killed an American contractor last month. “We have therefore paused these activities, subject to continuous review,” it said of the fight against ISIS. After the killing last week of the commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani — who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of troops over the years — the approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq and several hundred in Syria are focused on fortifying their outposts. The assassination of General Suleimani removed the leader of one of the Islamic State’s most effective opponents. He had been responsible for building up the alliance of Iran-backed militias that played a significant role in driving the militants out of their strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Also on Sunday, Islamic State militants attacked Iraqi security forces near the northern city of Kirkuk, killing two Iraqi soldiers and injuring another, the Iraqi Joint Command said. Echoing President Trump’s remarks the day before, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned on Sunday that the United States could attack Iran itself if leaders there took hostile actions against American interests in the aftermath of the drone strike that killed a top general. “I’ve been part of the discussion and planning process — everything I’ve seen about how we will respond with great force and great vigor if the Iranian leadership makes a bad decision,” Mr. Pompeo said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We hope that they won’t, but when they do, America will respond.” In appearances on five television news shows on Sunday morning, Mr. Pompeo underscored Mr. Trump’s message the previous day that the United States had chosen sites to attack within Iran if Tehran ordered assaults on American assets or citizens in retaliation for a drone strike that killed General Suleimani in Baghdad. He tweeted on Saturday that the United States had pinpointed 52 targets in Iran if it retaliated for the killing, prompting Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to say on Twitter that “targeting cultural sites is a war crime.”  Mr. Zarif added, “whether kicking or screaming, end of U.S. malign presence in West Asia has begun.” Mr. Trump said on Sunday that “media posts” would serve as notification to Congress about a potential strike. Mr. Pompeo also blamed the 2015 nuclear deal for the rising hostilities. He told CNN that “this war kicked off” when the Obama administration entered into the agreement. Though Tehran had been abiding by the terms of the deal, Mr. Pompeo said, the agreement gave Iran “free rein” to expand its regional activities. In protest over that latest threat, Iran on Sunday summoned the Swiss envoy representing American interests in Tehran, Reuters reported. Hundreds of thousands of mourners poured into the streets of Iran to pay their respects to Maj. General Qassim Suleimani on Sunday, one day after joint funerals were held in Baghdad for the slain Quds Force leader and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a powerful militia leader in Iraq and a close adviser to the general. Both men were killed by an American drone strike early Friday at Baghdad’s airport, inflaming tensions between Washington and Tehran and raising fears that more violence would follow.  President Trump said he had ordered the airstrikes not just as retaliation for past attacks on Americans, but also to prevent “imminent and sinister attacks” on more Americans. But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and its president, Hassan Rouhani, both promised that the country would take “revenge” for the killing. Iraq’s most influential Shiite religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, sent a letter of condolence to Iran’s supreme leader that praised General Soleimani for helping fight the Islamic State and stabilize Iraq over the past decade. Iran’s regional reach was visible during the services in Baghdad, which were as close to a state ceremony in Iraq as any since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Many mourners were members of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, militias that came together to fight the Islamic State —\xa0and the most powerful of which are affiliated with Iran. Tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched through Baghdad, waving flags and chanting that “revenge is coming” to the United States.  “The worst thing that happened to Iran in the recent months was not the killing of General Suleimani but the turning of the Iraqi Shia against Iran before he was killed,” said Abbas Kadhim, the head of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council, referring to recent protests against Iranian influence. “That was reversed by the killing of Suleimani.” Mr. Kadhim said that while Iran could afford the loss of a general or a politician, they could not afford “the turning of the Shia in neighboring countries against them.” “That’s why this show of support for Iran in the holy cities, in Lebanon and Iraq after the killing of Suleimani is a huge victory,” he said. “They regained the most important element of their strategy in the region, which is the support of local populations.” Mr. al-Muhandis, one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq, was accused of playing a role in embassy bombings in Kuwait in the 1980s and funneling weapons to pro-Iranian militias in the 2000s. Many Iraqis saw him as a hero for his role in the battle against the Islamic State. The leader of Hezbollah, the Islamist movement backed by Iran, warned in a speech Sunday that the killing of General Suleimani would only motivate Iran’s allies in the Middle East to strike harder against the United States and Israel. “Assassinating General Suleimani means targeting the entire axis of resistance,” said the militant leader, Hassan Nasrallah, speaking via video feed at a memorial service. “The United States will leave our region humiliated. When U.S. troops leave the region in coffins, Washington will realize it has lost, and Trump will realize that he has lost the election.” Mr. Nasrallah vowed to target American bases, soldiers and Marines — a response he called “retribution, a fair one” — but took care to add that he was “not talking about the American people at all.” Hezbollah, a militia and political party based in Lebanon, is perhaps the most formidable of the network of proxy forces Iran has built up around the Middle East, which also includes pro-Iranian militias in Iraq.  The State Department has classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, and the militia has battled and skirmished repeatedly with Israel. It maintained close ties with General Suleimani, and was now mourning him as a hero over the weekend  Mr. Nasrallah said that he had met with the general on Wednesday in Beirut, where General Suleimani had stopped before flying to Baghdad. The group released what appeared to be a photo of the two men meeting. On Sunday, Mr. Nasrallah said that the general’s death marked “the start of a new stage, not just for Iraq or Iran, but for the entire region” — a stage he warned would be awash in anti-American violence. As the United States has escalated its conflict with Iran, many in the generation of Americans who have grown up since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, have become alarmed by the prospect of being swept up in an extended conflict. Over high school lunch tables, teenagers speak of World War III. When they get home, they tearfully ask their parents whether they could be drafted. Social media feeds have exploded with predictions of military action and wisecracking memes about end times. With an all-volunteer military fighting the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East that have been simmering since they were toddlers, many young men had grown used to thinking of the longstanding requirement that they register for the draft as a mere bureaucratic formality. “Now it’s like, what exactly did we sign up for?” said Adrian Flynn, a high school senior in New York who turned 18 in October. And demonstrators took to the streets of cities across the United States over the weekend to protest the killing of an Iranian general and the possibility that it could lead to yet another war. “Unless the people of the United States rise up and stop it, this war will engulf the whole region and could quickly turn into a global conflict of unpredictable scope and potentially the gravest consequences,” said a statement by the coalition behind the protests. That group included Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, an antiwar coalition, and Code Pink, an antiwar organization led by women. More than 80 protests were organized, in places like Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, Miami and Philadelphia. Marchers in Times Square in New York chanted, “U.S. out of the Middle East.” Organizers had begun calling for nationwide protests early last week, before the drone strike that killed General Suleimani. They had already been fearful of the possible effects of rising tensions between the United States and Iran in recent months. Even as Western allies said they had been given no warning about the United States’ killing of General Suleimani, Britain’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that America had a right to self-defense in killing the Iranian military commander. Asked in an interview with the BBC whether the killing was legal, Mr. Raab said, “There is a right of self-defense.” “It was General Suleimani’s job description to engage proxies and militias,” Mr. Raab said, “to attack Western countries that were legitimately there.” Describing General Suleimani as a “regional menace,” he said he did not agree that the killing was an act of war — a label that Iran’s United Nations ambassador used to describe the killing, and which analysts have said is applicable. Mr. Raab said he had spoken to Iraq’s prime minister and president to urge a de-escalation of tensions in the region after the drone killing.  President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke by telephone with President Trump on Sunday, according to a statement from the French president’s office, and expressed solidarity with allies “in light of the attacks carried out in recent weeks against the coalition in Iraq,” his office said in the statement. Mr. Macron also expressed concerns about “destabilizing activities of the Quds force under General Qassem Soleimani,” his office said, and urged Iran avoid “taking any measures that could lead to an escalation in the situation and destabilizing the region.” In Germany, a government spokeswoman also expressed sympathy for the United States’ position. “The American action was a reaction to a series of military provocations for which Iran is responsible,” the spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, said at a news conference on Friday, according to Reuters.  “We also see with great concern Iran’s activities in the region,” she said, adding that Berlin would aim to de-escalate the tensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had criticized Europes response to the killing of General Suleimani, telling Fox News on Friday night that “the Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be.” Reporting was contributed by Alissa J. Rubin, Ben Hubbard, Falih Hassan, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Eric Schmitt, Vivian Yee, David D. Kirkpatrick, Edward Wong, Tess Felder, Yonette Joseph, Mariel Padilla and Maggie Haberman.']","Iran said it would essentially abandon its obligations under a land mark nuclear deal, and the Iraqi Parliament voted to expel American troops."
‘Nowhere Else to Go’: Some Defy Warnings to Flee Australian Fires,2020-01-03,"By Isabella Kwai, Livia Albeck-Ripka, Jamie Tarabay and Matthew Abbott","['NOWRA, Australia — The smoke is still smoldering from the wildfires that ravaged the small seaside town of Broulee, Australia, on New Year’s Eve, when sand dunes erupted into flames and entire neighborhoods were decimated.  Water and food is running low. Shops are taking only cash, and radio is the main source of information. The fires could intensify this weekend, as strong winds and high temperatures threaten to create even more dire conditions in the town and more than a dozen others. Clarinda Campbell and her two children left Broulee and headed for safety. Her husband, James, stayed behind to defend their home.  “I feel like it’s not real,” said Ms. Campbell, who was with her children at a family property in Surf Beach, about eight miles away. “I’ve gone to sleep every night and woken up every morning hoping that it was just a bad dream.” The authorities urged tens of thousands of people, mainly along Australia’s southeastern coast, to evacuate before this weekend, which is expected to be one of the worst periods in the country’s already catastrophic fire season. The populations of many of these towns swell during the holidays with travelers looking for a break at the beach.  Not all residents were heeding the warnings to leave. Some wanted to protect their homes from the blazes. Others worried that fleeing could put them in more danger if they ran out of fuel, encountered fallen trees or ended up in another fire zone on the clogged roads. While the past few months have been particularly bad, Australians are accustomed to the unpredictable nature of wildfires, an annual occurrence on what is the most arid continent on Earth. Many are therefore willing to take their chances, to the dismay of officials. Rob Rogers, the deputy fire services commissioner for the state of New South Wales, was blunt: There would be no help for anyone who ignored the warnings to leave. “We’ve been very honest about the risk, but if people choose to stay, that’s on them,” he said at a briefing on Friday. “Do not expect there to be a fire truck when you ring.” When the fires swept through on New Year’s Eve, Bernard Kreet huddled with 300 others at the local golf club, waiting to see the damage in the suburb of Catalina, where he lives. In the end, Mr. Kreet said that about 20 homes had been destroyed. Power was just restored on Thursday.  With concern of more fires, tourists were asked to leave the area, and many locals followed. Mr. Kreet said he thought the town would be spared, even if he expected further disruptions and supply limitations. He is hosting two families who have evacuated from other places. “It’s so hard to get out of town,” he said, adding that the roads in many seaside towns were not built to handle so many travelers. “It’s chaos down here.” Communities have rallied together, knowing that they will have to depend on one another. They are holding neighborhood meetings to come up with contingency plans in case the fires get worse and they need to head to safer ground. They are sharing food and supplies, and taking others into their homes. Justin Brady had moved to Mallacoota in the state of Victoria just a few months ago, building a beach shack in the vacation spot he had been visiting for 25 years. It was destroyed on New Year’s Eve, when the skies there turned blood red from the fires.  The roads to the town are unpassable, with trees down and embers still burning. The government is evacuating thousands from the coast via a Navy ship. The first boatload carrying about 60 people was expected to land early Saturday in Mornington Peninsula, according to Sam Hearn, the region’s mayor. Hundreds more, together with their pets, were expected to arrive on a larger naval vessel that afternoon, he added. “I’ve made the decision to stay because I’ve got nowhere else to go,” Mr. Brady said.  He has been staying with family, with three generations under one roof. A musician, Mr. Brady has been teaching the grandchildren harmonica to cheer them up. “I feel like there’s stuff I can do here,” he said. Mr. Brady and others in Mallacoota know that staying is a risk, especially given the potential for more fires. There was initially a warning that the town’s water supply had to be boiled. While that has been lifted, the power is still out.  Across Australia, the threat of more damage is significant. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service on Friday drastically expanded its estimate of the amount of land at risk from spreading fires. The weekend is expected to bring high winds and temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 38 Celsius. The combination of drought, heat and wind has made for an especially ferocious fire season. While the wildfires started in the bushland, tinder-like vegetation dried from years of drought then incinerated under heavy winds, spreading blazes toward cities, across farmland and even into lush rainforests.  The fire season, which usually follows a predictable pattern, has turned into a volatile disaster with no clear ending. On Friday afternoon, people were told to evacuate Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia State, where at least one fire had ravaged a national park, destroying about 35,000 acres. It was still burning freely, the authorities said.  Fires now ring much of Australia’s east and southeastern coasts.  The streets of Broulee, normally bustling with people, are eerily quiet. About 80 percent of residents have left, estimated Mr. Campbell, who had called a meeting of neighbors to discuss their plans for the fires this weekend. If a fire approached from the south, it would block the town’s usual exits and push residents down to the beach.  To help protect his home, he borrowed equipment from a former firefighter neighbor across the street, put water into buckets and hooked up a fire pump to the backyard pool, which holds about 6,600 gallons. “You shouldn’t have to deal with this once in a lifetime, let alone twice in a week,” he said. His parents lost most of their property in nearby Jeremadra, although their home was somehow saved.  “You can’t imagine what it looks like,” he said. “Just matchsticks. The trees are all burned. Where there was dense undergrowth is now just sand.” On Saturday, Ms. Campbell will wait nervously for her husband to call to say that he is safe. During the fires, cellphone services are especially spotty, if they exist at all. He will have to go to a nearby hilltop to get reception.  “I’m trying to get word to him to say I want him to leave,” Ms. Campbell said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.” Isabella Kwai reported from Nowra, Livia Albeck-Ripka from Moorooduc, and Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong.']","The authorities warned of potentially worse conditions this weekend, but some residents wanted to protect their homes, while others worried about more danger if they fled."
"Qassim Suleimani, Master of Iran’s Intrigue, Built a Shiite Axis of Power in Mideast",2020-01-03,"By Tim Arango, Ronen Bergman and Ben Hubbard","['He changed the shape of the Syrian civil war and tightened Iran’s grip on Iraq. He was behind hundreds of American deaths in Iraq and waves of militia attacks against Israel. And for two decades, his every move lit up the communications networks — and fed the obsessions — of intelligence operatives across the Middle East.  On Friday, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful and shadowy 62-year-old spymaster at the head of Iran’s security machinery, was killed by an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport.  Just as his accomplishments shaped the creation of a Shiite axis of influence across the Middle East, with Iran at the center, his death is now likely to prove central to a new chapter of geopolitical tension across the region.  General Suleimani was at the vanguard of Iran’s revolutionary generation, joining the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in his early 20s after the 1979 uprising that enshrined the country’s Shiite theocracy.  He rose quickly during the brutal Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. And since 1998, he was the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ influential Quds Force, the foreign-facing arm of Iran’s security apparatus, melding intelligence work with a military strategy of nurturing proxy forces across the world.  In the West, he was seen as a clandestine force behind an Iranian campaign of international terrorism. He and other Iranian officials were designated as terrorists by the United States and Israel in 2011, accused of a plot to kill the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, one of Iran’s chief enemies in the region, in Washington. Last year, in April, the entire Quds Force was listed as a foreign terrorism group by the Trump administration.  But in Iran, many saw him as a larger-than-life hero, particularly within security circles. Anecdotes about his asceticism and quiet charisma joined to create an image of a warrior-philosopher who became the backbone of a nation’s defense against a host of enemies.  He was close to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who on Friday issued a statement calling for three days of public mourning and “forceful revenge,” in a declaration that amounted to a threat of retaliation against the United States. “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,” he said.  The first years of General Suleimani’s tenure in the late 1990s were devoted to directing the militant group Hezbollah’s effort against the Israeli military occupation of south Lebanon. General Suleimani, along with Hezbollah’s military commander, Imad Mugniyah, drove a sophisticated campaign of guerrilla warfare, combining ambushes, roadside bombs, suicide bombers, targeted killings of senior Israeli officers and attacks on Israeli defense posts. At the end, the price for Israel was too high, and in May 2000 it withdrew from Lebanon, marking a major victory for General Suleimani, his Quds Force and Hezbollah.  The Arab Spring in the Middle East, and later the fight against the Islamic State, turned General Suleimani from a shadow figure into a major player in the geopolitics of the region, said Tamir Pardo, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service. “Suleimani’s professional life can be divided into two periods,” he said. “Until the Arab Spring, he is commander of a force that has branches in various parts of the world, active mainly in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, but at the end of the day is a secret operational organization whose main purpose is terrorism.” “From the shock that befell the Middle East following the rise of ISIS, he is changing course,” Mr. Pardo continued. “He becomes a kingpin regional player, knowing with great talent how to exploit the secret infrastructure he has established for so many years, to achieve noncovert objectives — to fight, to win, to establish presence.” In recent years, the man whose face had rarely been seen became the face of Iran’s foreign operations.  In Syria, he oversaw a massive operation to shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, whose own troops had been depleted by widespread defections and fierce fighting with rebels seeking to topple the government since 2011. His command of Arabic helped put local commanders at ease as he welded them into a support network for Mr. al-Assad. Over a number of years, Iranian operatives guided by General Suleimani recruited militia fighters from other countries — mostly from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan — airlifting them into Syria to back up Mr. Assad’s forces in key battles.  Many of these militia fighters received training at military bases in Iran or on the ground in Syria by operatives from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an organization General Suleimani had helped develop over the years.  When Iranian and Iranian-backed forces became major combatants against ISIS after the group took over roughly a third of Iraq in 2014, pictures of General Suleimani on the battlefield in fatigues began being widely shared on social media. The publicity spawned rumors that General Suleimani was trying to widen his fame for a possible run for Iran’s presidency; he denied them, saying he always saw himself as just a soldier. That conflict, from 2014 through 2017, was a rare instance of Iran and the United States nominally fighting on the same side. On a number of occasions, Americans were hitting Islamic State targets from the air while General Suleimani was directing ground forces against the militants. It was unclear what direct role General Suleimani played in Yemen. But Iran’s patronage of the country’s Houthi rebels, which intensified when Saudi Arabia intervened against them in Yemen’s war in 2015, had all the hallmarks of the Suleimani playbook: above all, to support local militants as a way of expanding Iranian influence and punishing Saudi Arabia, the region’s Sunni power. Iran had long offered similar support to the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, creating decades of new security headaches for Israel. And with the support of the Quds Force, Hamas was able to take over the Gaza Strip, capable of firing rockets that can reach into most of Israeli territory. Previous American administrations had resisted striking General Suleimani directly, either because of operational concerns or out of fear that killing him could destabilize the region further and lead to all-out war between the United States and Iran.  At least once, though, Israeli officials ran the possibility of attacking him up their command structure. That was in February 2008, while Israeli and American intelligence operatives were tracking Mr. Mugniyah, the Hezbollah commander, in the hopes of killing him, according to senior American and Israeli intelligence officials. Operatives spotted the Hezbollah commander talking with another man, who they quickly determined was Mr. Suleimani.  Excited by the possibility of killing two archenemies at once, the Israelis phoned senior government officials. But Prime Minister Ehud Olmert denied the request, as he had promised the Americans that only Mr. Mugniyah would be targeted in the operation.  Perhaps more than any other individual, General Suleimani was the foil for American plans in Iraq, which like Iran is predominantly Shiite.  After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, Iranian militiamen and their Iraqi allies fought a clandestine war against American troops, launching rockets at bases and attacking convoys. The militias also played a large part in inflaming sectarian tensions that led to Iraq’s civil war in 2006 and 2007 between Shiites and Sunnis, leading President George W. Bush to order a troop surge there. General Suleimani and other leaders of his generation were shaped by the brutal war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s, a conflict so cruel, with trench warfare and chemical weapons, that some compared it to the devastation of World War I. Nearly a million people died on both sides, and General Suleimani spent much of that war on the front lines.  For him and his fellow soldiers, the war was a “never again” moment. Ensuring that Iraq was weak and unable to again pose a threat to Iran became the primary goal of Iran’s policy toward Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, whom the United States supported during its war with Iran in the 1980s. “For Qassim Suleimani, the Iran-Iraq war never really ended,” Ryan C. Crocker, a former American ambassador to Iraq, once said in an interview. “No human being could have come through such a World War I-style conflict and not have been forever affected. His strategic goal was an outright victory over Iraq, and if that was not possible, to create and influence a weak Iraq.” Sometimes, American officials secretly communicated with General Suleimani in an effort to ease tensions in Iraq. In 2008, the American general, David Petraeus, was trying to find a truce in a fight that American forces and the Iraqi Army were waging against Shiite militias loyal to Iran. In Mr. Petraeus’s telling of the story, he was shown a text message directed to him: “General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassim Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan.” Years later, General Suleimani personally, and mockingly, addressed another American leader: President Trump, who in July 2018 warned Iran’s president not to threaten the United States.  “It is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,” General Suleimani declared in a speech in western Iran. “I, as a soldier, respond to you.” “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine,” he added. “We are ready. We are the man of this arena.” For years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iran railed against what it saw as American aggression in the region, worried that the United States would turn its attention to regime change in Iran after Mr. Hussein was gone.  American officials have blamed Iran for killing hundreds of American soldiers during the war, many with sophisticated, shaped-charge bombs that could slice through American armored vehicles. As the United States sought to negotiate a deal with Iraq that would allow American forces to stay in the country past a 2011 deadline, it was General Suleimani who relentlessly pushed Iraqi officials to refuse to sign, using a mixture of threats and the promise of more financial and military aid, American and Iraqi officials say.  On his orders, Iraqi construction crews in 2014 began building a roadway for Iranian supplies and militiamen, a small piece of what was perhaps the general’s most important project: establishing a land route from Tehran to the Mediterranean, across Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, where Iran has long supported Hezbollah, a primary threat to Israel. One telling episode that illustrated the depth of Iranian control came in 2014, when the Islamic State was rampaging across Iraq. General Suleimani paid a visit to Bayan Jabr, then the country’s transportation minister. According to a collection of Iranian intelligence cables published recently by The Intercept and The New York Times, General Suleimani came to Mr. Jabr with a demand: He needed to use Iraqi airspace to fly planeloads of military supplies to support the Syrian government of Mr. Assad. Despite lobbying by the Obama administration to close Iraq’s airspace to the flights, Mr. Jabr quickly said yes. “I put my hands on my eyes and said, ‘On my eyes! As you wish!’” Mr. Jabr told an Iranian Intelligence Ministry officer, according to one of the cables. “Then he got up and approached me and kissed my forehead.” The same trove of documents contains evidence that General Suleimani is not universally admired within Iran.  A bitter rivalry between his Quds Force and the other main Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Intelligence, played out over the course of the cables. Many criticized General Suleimani’s proxy campaign in Iraq, and the way his militia allies abused the Sunni population there, as weakening Iran’s long-term interests in the region.  “This policy of Iran in Iraq has allowed the Americans to return to Iraq with greater legitimacy,” one cable read.  In others, ministry case officers portrayed General Suleimani as a relentless self-promoter who used the battle against the Islamic State to bolster his potential political aspirations in the future.  Iran watchers sounded alarm that General Suleimani’s death would unleash unpredictable regional mayhem from Syria to Iraq that would be difficult for the United States to contain. Several Iranian diplomats said that the prospect of diplomacy with the United States, being quietly negotiated through Japan and France, was effectively dead. The talk was now of revenge, not negotiations, they said. “This one life lost will likely cost many more Iranian, Iraqi, American and others,” said Ali Vaez, director of Iran program for International Crisis Group. “It is not just Suleimani’s death, but likely the death knell of the Iran nuclear deal and any prospect of diplomacy between Iran and the U.S.”  Qassim Suleimani was born in 1957 in Rabor, in eastern Iran, and later moved to the city of Kerman. He was the son of a farmer, and began laboring as a construction worker at age 12. His highest level of education was high school, and he later worked in the municipal water department in Kerman, according to a profile published by the Iranian state media.  According to a 2013 profile in The New Yorker, General Suleimani’s father became burdened with debt under the Shah. When the revolution came he was sympathetic to the cause, and joined the Revolutionary Guards soon after. He was married and had children, although there were conflicting stories in the Iranian news media about how many. Within Iran, he was widely seen as exerting more influence over the country’s foreign policy than even the country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. General Suleimani, in death if not in life, appeared to have united Iran’s rival political parties to rally behind the flag. Iran’s expansionist policies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon have been contentious at home among ordinary Iranians and some reformist politicians who saw money and resources diverted from Iran to fund General Suleimani’s missions. But on Friday, there was only praise and grief. Iranian officials across the political spectrum issued statements of condolences and condemned the United States. The powerful Revolutionary Guards, of which the Quds Force is a component, said plans were underway for a huge public funeral. “He was so big that he achieved his dream of being martyred by America,” wrote a reformist politician and former vice president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi. General Suleimani had received the country’s highest military honor, the Order of Zolfaghar, established in 1856 under the Qajar dynasty. He became the only military commander to receive the honor in the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khamenei pinned the medal on General Suleimani’s chest last February, and in remarks that now seem prophetic, said: “The Islamic Republic needs him for many more years. But I hope that in the end, he dies as a martyr.” Tim Arango reported from Los Angeles; Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv, Israel; and Ben Hubbard from Beirut. Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.

Outrage in Iran After Killing of Suleimani: Here’s What You Need to Know,2020-01-05,,"['Iran’s government said it was no longer abiding by a commitment it made under the 2015 nuclear deal and it would not limit its enrichment of uranium. The decision to lift all restrictions on the production of nuclear fuel meant the effective end of the nuclear deal, experts said, though Iran left open the possibility that it will return to the limits if sanctions are lifted. “It’s finished. If there’s no limitation on production, then there is no deal,” said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonprofit in Washington. The announcement came after Iran’s National Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the country’s nuclear policy in the aftermath of Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani’s assassination. The statement said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran will end its final limitations in the nuclear deal, meaning the limitation in the number of centrifuges. Therefore Iran’s nuclear program will have no limitations in production including enrichment capacity and percentage and number of enriched uranium and research and expansion.” But the government said Iran would continue its cooperation with International Atomic Agency. The announcement followed several steps by Iran to move away from the terms of the agreement, nearly two years after President Trump withdrew the United States from the deal. Since that renunciation, the Trump administration has imposed severe sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s economy. The nuclear agreement had ended many economic sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledge to use nuclear power peacefully. The European parties to the deal, including Britain, France and Germany, had struggled to preserve the agreement amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran’s statement Sunday did not include details about its enrichment ambitions. And the country did not say it was expelling the inspectors who monitor its nuclear program. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted: Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear expert on Iran and associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter that the announcement was “ambiguous,” with room for “both negotiation and escalation.”  “War crime,” said Iran’s foreign minister. “It doesn’t work that way,” replied President Trump. Earlier in the day, the American president, taking to Twitter, had warned Iran against retaliating for the killing of General Soleimani. He said the United States had already picked out targets to hit in Iran if it did, including cultural sites. “Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis!” Iran’s information and telecommunications minister  declared on Twitter. ”They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit."" The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that “targeting cultural sites is a war crime.” But on Sunday evening, aboard Air Force One on his way back from his holiday trip to Florida, Mr. Trump did not back down. “They’re allowed to kill our people,” he said to reporters. “They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.” Iraqi lawmakers voted 170-0 on Sunday in favor of expelling American troops from their country, just days after a United States drone strike killed the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force on Iraqi soil. The vote was not final and many lawmakers did not attend the session. But Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi drafted the language and submitted the bill to Parliament, leaving little doubt about his support. The drone strike that killed the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, at the Baghdad airport on Friday also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias. The attack was viewed in Iraq as a violation of the nation’s sovereignty, and the country’s Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that it had summoned the American ambassador in Baghdad. Iraq’s Parliament was divided over demands from angry citizens to expel American troops. Many of its 328 members, primarily Kurds and Sunnis, did not attend Sunday’s session and did not vote. In his speech to lawmakers, Mr. Mahdi laid out two possibilities: to either quickly end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq, or to set a timeline for that expulsion.  The measure approved by the Parliament did not include a timeline, and only instructed the government to end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq. Officials said no decision had been made about whether any American troops would be able to stay, or under what conditions. Iranian officials reacted to the vote with congratulatory messages and said General Soleimani’s death had delivered a huge victory over the United States. Hesameddin Ashena, a top adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, in a Twitter post, said: “Expanding friendship with our neighbors and domestic unity are the best gifts for protecting our national security. America and Israel are the only winners of a rift between neighbors.” Asked about the vote on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States would continue to battle the Islamic State. “It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region,” he said in an interview on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” If American forces leave the country, European Union and coalition forces will likely have to follow, because they rely on the American logistics and intelligence resources to protect their forces and the civilians that work with them. NATO has already announced the suspension of its training mission for Iraqi forces. From Israel to Saudi Arabia, the United States’ allies in the Middle East have long warned Washington about Iran’s campaigns in the region — many of them masterminded by General Suleimani. But with scant exception, their response to his killing has been silence.  Iran has built close ties with the government of Syria and armed groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. That puts many Iranian partners within firing range of American allies like Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For many of them, the wisest course of action over the weekend seemed to be to say nothing. “Saudi Arabia and all the gulf countries are just quiet,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, a political sociologist in Saudi Arabia. “They don’t want to antagonize the Iranians, because the situation in the region is so delicate, so divided, so sensitive, that you don’t want to stir it up further.” The spread of Iran’s network means that it could rely on allied forces to strike — for instance at Saudi oil facilities, just across the Persian Gulf — while giving Tehran a way to deny responsibility.  And many officials in the Middle East are concerned about the degree of support they can expect from Mr. Trump should they become targets of Iranian retaliation, cyberattack or sabotage. Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi deputy defense minister, flew to Washington this weekend to meet with American officials. In Iraq, pro-Iranian militias pose a powerful threat to groups that prefer the United States. In Lebanon, American allies kept quiet to avoid Hezbollah, a major political party and the country’s strongest military force.  And even in Israel, celebrations were muted, with officials wanting to avoid any suggestion of involvement in the killing. “The entire region is on edge, as we are in unchartered territory,” said Taufiq Rahim, a senior fellow at the foundation New America who works in the Persian Gulf. “There is no way to be ready for what comes next, because anything could be a target.” The American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria said on Sunday that it was pausing its yearslong mission of attacking the Islamic State and training local forces in both countries as United States forces braced for retaliation from Iran over the killing of its top military commander. A statement from the American command pointed to recent attacks on Iraqi and American bases, one of which killed an American contractor last month. “We have therefore paused these activities, subject to continuous review,” it said of the fight against ISIS. After the killing last week of the commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani — who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of troops over the years — the approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq and several hundred in Syria are focused on fortifying their outposts. The assassination of General Suleimani removed the leader of one of the Islamic State’s most effective opponents. He had been responsible for building up the alliance of Iran-backed militias that played a significant role in driving the militants out of their strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Also on Sunday, Islamic State militants attacked Iraqi security forces near the northern city of Kirkuk, killing two Iraqi soldiers and injuring another, the Iraqi Joint Command said. Echoing President Trump’s remarks the day before, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned on Sunday that the United States could attack Iran itself if leaders there took hostile actions against American interests in the aftermath of the drone strike that killed a top general. “I’ve been part of the discussion and planning process — everything I’ve seen about how we will respond with great force and great vigor if the Iranian leadership makes a bad decision,” Mr. Pompeo said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We hope that they won’t, but when they do, America will respond.” In appearances on five television news shows on Sunday morning, Mr. Pompeo underscored Mr. Trump’s message the previous day that the United States had chosen sites to attack within Iran if Tehran ordered assaults on American assets or citizens in retaliation for a drone strike that killed General Suleimani in Baghdad. He tweeted on Saturday that the United States had pinpointed 52 targets in Iran if it retaliated for the killing, prompting Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to say on Twitter that “targeting cultural sites is a war crime.”  Mr. Zarif added, “whether kicking or screaming, end of U.S. malign presence in West Asia has begun.” Mr. Trump said on Sunday that “media posts” would serve as notification to Congress about a potential strike. Mr. Pompeo also blamed the 2015 nuclear deal for the rising hostilities. He told CNN that “this war kicked off” when the Obama administration entered into the agreement. Though Tehran had been abiding by the terms of the deal, Mr. Pompeo said, the agreement gave Iran “free rein” to expand its regional activities. In protest over that latest threat, Iran on Sunday summoned the Swiss envoy representing American interests in Tehran, Reuters reported. Hundreds of thousands of mourners poured into the streets of Iran to pay their respects to Maj. General Qassim Suleimani on Sunday, one day after joint funerals were held in Baghdad for the slain Quds Force leader and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a powerful militia leader in Iraq and a close adviser to the general. Both men were killed by an American drone strike early Friday at Baghdad’s airport, inflaming tensions between Washington and Tehran and raising fears that more violence would follow.  President Trump said he had ordered the airstrikes not just as retaliation for past attacks on Americans, but also to prevent “imminent and sinister attacks” on more Americans. But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and its president, Hassan Rouhani, both promised that the country would take “revenge” for the killing. Iraq’s most influential Shiite religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, sent a letter of condolence to Iran’s supreme leader that praised General Soleimani for helping fight the Islamic State and stabilize Iraq over the past decade. Iran’s regional reach was visible during the services in Baghdad, which were as close to a state ceremony in Iraq as any since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Many mourners were members of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, militias that came together to fight the Islamic State —\xa0and the most powerful of which are affiliated with Iran. Tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched through Baghdad, waving flags and chanting that “revenge is coming” to the United States.  “The worst thing that happened to Iran in the recent months was not the killing of General Suleimani but the turning of the Iraqi Shia against Iran before he was killed,” said Abbas Kadhim, the head of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council, referring to recent protests against Iranian influence. “That was reversed by the killing of Suleimani.” Mr. Kadhim said that while Iran could afford the loss of a general or a politician, they could not afford “the turning of the Shia in neighboring countries against them.” “That’s why this show of support for Iran in the holy cities, in Lebanon and Iraq after the killing of Suleimani is a huge victory,” he said. “They regained the most important element of their strategy in the region, which is the support of local populations.” Mr. al-Muhandis, one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq, was accused of playing a role in embassy bombings in Kuwait in the 1980s and funneling weapons to pro-Iranian militias in the 2000s. Many Iraqis saw him as a hero for his role in the battle against the Islamic State. The leader of Hezbollah, the Islamist movement backed by Iran, warned in a speech Sunday that the killing of General Suleimani would only motivate Iran’s allies in the Middle East to strike harder against the United States and Israel. “Assassinating General Suleimani means targeting the entire axis of resistance,” said the militant leader, Hassan Nasrallah, speaking via video feed at a memorial service. “The United States will leave our region humiliated. When U.S. troops leave the region in coffins, Washington will realize it has lost, and Trump will realize that he has lost the election.” Mr. Nasrallah vowed to target American bases, soldiers and Marines — a response he called “retribution, a fair one” — but took care to add that he was “not talking about the American people at all.” Hezbollah, a militia and political party based in Lebanon, is perhaps the most formidable of the network of proxy forces Iran has built up around the Middle East, which also includes pro-Iranian militias in Iraq.  The State Department has classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, and the militia has battled and skirmished repeatedly with Israel. It maintained close ties with General Suleimani, and was now mourning him as a hero over the weekend  Mr. Nasrallah said that he had met with the general on Wednesday in Beirut, where General Suleimani had stopped before flying to Baghdad. The group released what appeared to be a photo of the two men meeting. On Sunday, Mr. Nasrallah said that the general’s death marked “the start of a new stage, not just for Iraq or Iran, but for the entire region” — a stage he warned would be awash in anti-American violence. As the United States has escalated its conflict with Iran, many in the generation of Americans who have grown up since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, have become alarmed by the prospect of being swept up in an extended conflict. Over high school lunch tables, teenagers speak of World War III. When they get home, they tearfully ask their parents whether they could be drafted. Social media feeds have exploded with predictions of military action and wisecracking memes about end times. With an all-volunteer military fighting the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East that have been simmering since they were toddlers, many young men had grown used to thinking of the longstanding requirement that they register for the draft as a mere bureaucratic formality. “Now it’s like, what exactly did we sign up for?” said Adrian Flynn, a high school senior in New York who turned 18 in October. And demonstrators took to the streets of cities across the United States over the weekend to protest the killing of an Iranian general and the possibility that it could lead to yet another war. “Unless the people of the United States rise up and stop it, this war will engulf the whole region and could quickly turn into a global conflict of unpredictable scope and potentially the gravest consequences,” said a statement by the coalition behind the protests. That group included Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, an antiwar coalition, and Code Pink, an antiwar organization led by women. More than 80 protests were organized, in places like Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, Miami and Philadelphia. Marchers in Times Square in New York chanted, “U.S. out of the Middle East.” Organizers had begun calling for nationwide protests early last week, before the drone strike that killed General Suleimani. They had already been fearful of the possible effects of rising tensions between the United States and Iran in recent months. Even as Western allies said they had been given no warning about the United States’ killing of General Suleimani, Britain’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that America had a right to self-defense in killing the Iranian military commander. Asked in an interview with the BBC whether the killing was legal, Mr. Raab said, “There is a right of self-defense.” “It was General Suleimani’s job description to engage proxies and militias,” Mr. Raab said, “to attack Western countries that were legitimately there.” Describing General Suleimani as a “regional menace,” he said he did not agree that the killing was an act of war — a label that Iran’s United Nations ambassador used to describe the killing, and which analysts have said is applicable. Mr. Raab said he had spoken to Iraq’s prime minister and president to urge a de-escalation of tensions in the region after the drone killing.  President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke by telephone with President Trump on Sunday, according to a statement from the French president’s office, and expressed solidarity with allies “in light of the attacks carried out in recent weeks against the coalition in Iraq,” his office said in the statement. Mr. Macron also expressed concerns about “destabilizing activities of the Quds force under General Qassem Soleimani,” his office said, and urged Iran avoid “taking any measures that could lead to an escalation in the situation and destabilizing the region.” In Germany, a government spokeswoman also expressed sympathy for the United States’ position. “The American action was a reaction to a series of military provocations for which Iran is responsible,” the spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer, said at a news conference on Friday, according to Reuters.  “We also see with great concern Iran’s activities in the region,” she said, adding that Berlin would aim to de-escalate the tensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had criticized Europes response to the killing of General Suleimani, telling Fox News on Friday night that “the Europeans haven’t been as helpful as I wish that they could be.” Reporting was contributed by Alissa J. Rubin, Ben Hubbard, Falih Hassan, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Eric Schmitt, Vivian Yee, David D. Kirkpatrick, Edward Wong, Tess Felder, Yonette Joseph, Mariel Padilla and Maggie Haberman.']","Iran said it would essentially abandon its obligations under a land mark nuclear deal, and the Iraqi Parliament voted to expel American troops."
"Venezuela’s Maduro Claims Control of National Assembly, Consolidating Grip on Power",2020-01-05,By Julie Turkewitz,"['CARACAS — Lawmakers aligned with Venezuela’s repressive leader, Nicolás Maduro, began an attempt to consolidate his grip on the nation on Sunday by wresting control of the National Assembly, the last political institution still dominated by the opposition.  In a chaotic session in which security forces surrounded the National Assembly building, intimidating members of the opposition who tried to enter, supporters of Mr. Maduro blocked the re-election of Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, as the body’s head, and named another legislator instead. Members of the Venezuelan opposition immediately denounced the effort, calling it a “parliamentary coup d’état” and saying there had been no quorum to call the vote.  The Maduro administration’s plunges the country’s already turbulent political situation further into chaos, raising questions about who controls the assembly and whether Mr. Guaidó can continue to assert that he is the Venezuela’s interim president, in a direct challenge to Mr. Maduro.  Mr. Guaidó positioned himself as head of a caretaker government a year ago, just two weeks after being elected head of the assembly. Standing in the streets of Caracas with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Mr. Guaidó said then that Mr. Maduro’s 2018 election was fraudulent. Invoking an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the assembly if the presidency becomes vacant, he claimed the country’s leadership. That announcement last year was quickly recognized by dozens of foreign governments, including the United States, which backed him by imposing crippling sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government. To continue to claim the interim presidency, Mr. Guaidó needed to be re-elected as head of the assembly on Sunday, according to analysts in and outside the country. His victory was expected, as the opposition controls the legislative body, but at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó from entering the assembly’s white-walled building. Video footage showed Mr. Guaidó, surrounded by supporters, attempt to climb over the spiked metal fence to access the building where the vote would be held.  Inside, a member of Mr. Maduro’s party, Héctor Agüero, swore in the legislator Luis Parra as head of the assembly. There was no vote count. Mr. Parra is a former member of the opposition who turned against Mr. Guaidó after Mr. Guaidó opened a corruption claim against him. The United States immediately condemned the move.  On Twitter, Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said that Mr. Guaidó “remains Venezuela’s interim president under its constitution,” adding that Sunday’s “phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum.” In recent weeks, the opposition and the United States government accused Mr. Maduro of trying to block Mr. Guaidó’s re-election by bribing and harassing lawmakers. In December, Elliott Abrams, the United States special envoy to Venezuela, accused Mr. Maduro of trying to pay deputies up to $500,000 each to vote against Mr. Guaidó’s re-election. In an interview just days after Christmas, Mr. Guaidó, 36, insisted that he had the votes for re-election. But he acknowledged that Mr. Maduro was unpredictable and that anything could happen. “There is no manual,” he said, “for battling a dictatorship.” But Sunday’s election highlighted Mr. Guaidó’s embattled position: A year after he seemed poised to oust Mr. Maduro and bring relief to his once-wealthy nation, now facing economic collapse, he appears to be losing ground.  Mr. Guaidó coalition is in disarray, with dozens of his allies in exile, others in jail, and still others turning against him. Mr. Maduro’s grip on power is firm. And Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis is deepening, with millions in poverty, food shortages widespread and its citizens continuing to flee. Mr. Guaidó’s own assessment of the last year is that he underestimated the government’s “ability to inflict harm” — meaning its willingness to threaten those who dissent. He cited the recent disappearance of one member of his party, Gilber Caro, who has not been seen since Dec. 20. “The persecution is brutal,” he said. The enthusiasm with which many Venezuelans greeted him last year has ebbed. While huge protests in the region have forced out the president of Bolivia and pushed leaders in Chile and Ecuador to respond to citizens’ demands, Venezuelans have mostly retreated from the streets. And President Trump, who once floated the possibility of a military intervention in Venezuela, has turned his attention elsewhere. “It’s not that the Maduro government is particularly strong, but it survived,” said Margarita López Maya, a longtime Venezuelan political scientist who lives in Caracas. “And this is victory for them: surviving.”  Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.

‘It’s an Atomic Bomb’: Australia Deploys Military as Fires Spread,2020-01-04,"By Livia Albeck-Ripka, Isabella Kwai, Thomas Fuller and Jamie Tarabay","['HASTINGS, Australia — The evacuees walked down the gangway of the giant naval vessel to the dock, each carrying just a few items of luggage. Some held infants and others their dogs, whose legs were still shaky from the 20-hour voyage down the coast of Australia. They were weary, and their clothes smelled of smoke, but the terrible infernos were finally behind them. Four days after a bush fire ravaged the remote coastal town of Mallacoota, forcing people to shelter on the beach under blood-red skies, more than 1,000 stranded residents and vacationers arrived on Saturday in Hastings, a town near Melbourne.  The authorities said it was most likely the largest peacetime maritime rescue operation in Australia’s history. It was also a symbol of a country in perpetual flight from danger during a catastrophic fire season — and the challenge the government faces in getting the blazes under control.  [Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia’s blazes intensify.] Searing heat and afternoon winds propelled fires over large swaths of Australia on Saturday, adding to the devastation of a deadly fire season that has now claimed 24 lives. Thousands of people have been evacuated, while many towns and cities under threat were still smoldering from ferocious blazes that ripped through the countryside earlier in the week. More than 12 million acres have burned so far, an area larger than Switzerland, and the damage is expected to only get worse in the extremely arid conditions that are allowing the fires to spread. The fires are also so hot and so large that they are creating their own weather patterns, which can worsen the conditions. With more than a month still to go in the fire season, the government announced on Saturday a large-scale use of military assets, a deployment not seen since World War II, experts say. About 3,000 army reservists, along with aircraft and naval ships, are being made available to help with the evacuation and firefighting efforts.  “The government has not taken this decision lightly,” said Defense Minister Linda Reynolds. “It is the first time that reserves have been called out in this way in living memory.” In anticipation of the bad conditions on Saturday, thousands of people were evacuated, largely from communities along the southeastern coast, where the towns swell with tourists during the summer. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that a third Australian Navy ship, the Adelaide, would be used to evacuate people.  Mr. Morrison, who has been widely criticized for his response to the fires, had resisted a major intervention by the national government, saying firefighting has traditionally been the domain of the individual states. He has also minimized the link between global warming and the extreme conditions that have fueled the fires.  The states and their overwhelmingly volunteer force of firefighters in rural areas have been stretched and depleted by a season that started earlier and has been especially ferocious. While Australia has long dealt with bush fires, a yearslong drought and record-breaking temperatures have made for a more volatile and unpredictable season.  The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the western Sydney suburb of Penrith, which reached a high of 48.9 degrees Celsius, or 120 degrees Fahrenheit, was the hottest place in the country on Saturday. Last month Australia recorded its warmest day across the continent. As climate change worsens, scientists are predicting that the fires will become more frequent and more intense. John Blaxland, a professor at the Strategic and Defense Studies Center at the Australian National University, said the country had not seen a catastrophe on this scale, affecting so many people in so many different locations, since Australia became independent in 1901.  With other obligations in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, the military was not necessarily staffed to handle a looming climate crisis, he said. “If this is the new normal, then that model is broken,” he said. Officials on Saturday said one major fire had crossed from the state of Victoria north into New South Wales and was spreading quickly. Fire-generated thunderstorms have appeared over blazes in two different places. Emergency workers were using cranes and air tankers to fight the fires, as winds moving up the coast were causing some of the blazes to merge. The fires are blazing ferociously along Australia’s eastern coast, as well as South Australia, Tasmania and parts of Western Australia. In southern Australia, fire tore through a popular nature reserve known for its koalas, sea lions and other wildlife, killing a man and his grown son. In towns along the coast between Melbourne and Sydney, shops closed, power was cut and the authorities went door to door ordering evacuations. In Nowra, a coastal town two hours south of Sydney, the sky went dark as the air filled with choking smoke.  At a lawn-bowling club transformed into an evacuation center, people strapped on gas masks, while dogs barked frantically. A chaplain ministered to the anxious.  “There’s nowhere safe,” said Liddy Lant, a hospital cleaner still in her uniform who had fled from her home on Saturday. “I could seriously just sit down and cry.” The fire commissioner of the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales, Shane Fitzsimmons, told reporters on Saturday that more than 148 active fires were burning in his state alone, with 12 at an emergency level. Farther south, in Victoria, the authorities counted more than 50 active fires. “This is not a bush fire,” Andrew Constance, the transport minister in New South Wales, told ABC radio. “It’s an atomic bomb.” For Australia’s wildlife, the toll has been incalculable. About 87 percent of Australia’s wildlife is endemic to the country, which means it can be found only on this island continent.  And a great many of those species, like the koala, the southern brown bandicoot and the long-footed potoroo, have populations living in the regions now being obliterated by the fires. Because the fires this season have been so intense and consumed wetlands as well as dry eucalyptus forests, there are few places many of these animals can seek refuge. “We’ve never seen fires like this, not to this extent, not all at once, and the reservoir of animals that could come and repopulate the areas, they may not be there,” said Jim Radford, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Melbourne.  At the evacuation center in Nowra, about a hundred people sought cover throughout the day. Children chased each other around as paramedics strapped oxygen masks onto elderly residents.  Ms. Lant, 71, said she received an emergency alert on Saturday afternoon telling her to evacuate immediately from North Nowra. She ran home to fetch her dog, Kaiser, and her bird. Her cat had fled. Firefighters were knocking on doors telling her neighbors to leave. Her brother is in Mallacoota, the town where residents are being evacuated by the navy.  “I’ve just had it,” she said. At the next table, the Barwick family and their two dogs were waiting, as they had for days. Although their home in Worrigee was not in the direct line of fire, they had arrived here on Tuesday night, having lived through a bush fire in 2017.  Their two children had been traumatized by that experience. Back then, they had to flee the approaching flames, spending hours on the beach.  “I don’t need them seeing the plumes again,” said Daniel Barwick. “I’m just trying to protect them as much as possible.” As people disembarked the naval ships in Hastings on Saturday, emergency service workers offered emotional support and premade sandwiches. Buses then took them either to Melbourne or a relief center in the nearby town of Somerville, where many would be picked up by friends and relatives. The arrivals said they were thankful to be safely ashore. A man who had stepped off a bus in Somerville embraced a woman who had come to meet him, and sobbed. What Darcy Brown, 16, craved most was a shower. Ms. Brown had just moved with her family to Mallacoota when the fire razed their new home and worsened her asthma. It was “devastating,” she said. Others said their personal brush with climate disaster had crystallized their view that the government needed to do more not just to reduce heat-trapping emissions, but also to help the country adapt to a warmer world. One woman disembarking the boat, Corrin Mueller, 23, carried a sign that read “inaction costs more,” which she described as referring to the Australian government’s failure to reduce emissions.  “We’re only here because nobody’s acted quick enough,” she said. “And there’s so much more we can still do to stop more people having to go through this.” Livia Albeck-Ripka reported from Hastings; Isabella Kwai and Thomas Fuller from Nowra, Australia; and Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong.']","With more than a month still to go in the fire season, the government announced a large-scale use of military assets, a deployment not seen since World War II."
The Killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani: What We Know Since the U.S. Airstrike,2020-01-03,,"['President Trump said Friday afternoon that the airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander, was ordered “to stop a war” and prevented attacks on Americans. “Suleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” he said, speaking to reporters from his resort in West Palm Beach, Fla. “We took action last night to stop a war, we did not take action to start a war.” Mr. Trump said the United States is not seeking regime change in Iran, but called for Tehran’s “aggression in the region” to immediately end. He also warned Iran against retaliating, saying, “If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.” He added, “that in particular refers to Iran.” The airstrike directed by Mr. Trump dramatically ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Tehran, and Iran’s leaders quickly promised retaliation for the general’s killing. Around the time of the overnight strike, a Special Operations unit based in the United States boarded transport aircraft bound for the Middle East, one Defense Department official said.  The deployment of the elite Army Rangers was the latest to the region. This week, the Pentagon readied 4,000 troops based at Fort Bragg, N.C., for a similar security mission to Kuwait. They are to depart in the coming days, joining 750 troops already deployed, officials said. “The brigade will deploy to Kuwait as an appropriate and precautionary action in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities,” a Department of Defense spokesperson said.  General Suleimani, a powerful strategist who represented Iran’s influence across the region, was killed by an American drone at Baghdad’s airport, in an attack that had been authorized by President Trump.  Iraq’s Parliament planned to hold an emergency session over the weekend to address the airstrike, which Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called “a brazen violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and a blatant attack on the nation’s dignity.” A powerful Iraqi militia leader was also killed. The strike, regarded by analysts as perhaps the riskiest American move in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, threatened to inflame hostilities across the region. Iran’s United Nations ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, called the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani “an act of war,” and vowed that it would be met with “revenge, a harsh revenge.” “Last night, they started a military war by assassinating, by an act of terror, one of our top generals,” Mr. Takht Ravanchi said during an appearance Friday on CNN. “We cannot just remain silent. We have to act and we will act.” Asked if Iran would act militarily, Mr. Takht Ravanchi said: “That’s for the future to witness.” In the hours after the American strike, thousands of pro-Iranian social media accounts went to work. Accounts on Twitter and Instagram tagged the White House with death threats and posted images of President Trump with a severed head and coffins covered in the American flag, alongside the hashtag Operation Hard Revenge. It was not clear whether the activity was the work of actual accounts or state-backed bots, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. But they tweeted pro-Iranian, anti-American content at a rate of 3,000 tweets every 45 minutes, according to New York Times data. The social media activity may just be an opening salvo, experts said. Iran may begin a digital campaign of cyberattacks and disinformation in retaliation for General Suleimani’s death, they said. Tehran’s most likely target, the experts added, would be the American private sector. Over the past year, Iranian hackers have taken aim at Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. They have also targeted telecom companies, infrastructure systems and more than 200 oil, gas and heavy machinery companies around the world. The hackers have “developed the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure and they already have the ability to wipe data,” said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. “But they’ve gone well beyond that now. The question is what services — pipelines? dams? — will they target now.” Iran is still not “at the top of the league” of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks, Mr. Lewis and other experts said. But Tehran is much further along than American officials gave it credit for in 2009, when a classified intelligence assessment concluded that it had the motivation to inflict harm, but lacked the skills and resources to do so. Since 2010 — when an Iranian nuclear facility was the target of a joint American-Israeli cyberattack — Tehran has embraced such attacks as part its strategy of “asymmetrical warfare.” While Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps may never match the West in conventional warfare, its specialized teams have learned how much destruction they can cause to vulnerable systems, according to American intelligence assessments and private security researchers. Over the past five years, American officials and cybersecurity experts have tracked Iranian hackers as they have significantly advanced their capabilities beyond wiping data to sophisticated attacks on financial networks, internet infrastructure, energy companies — and, even more disconcerting, sites like the Bowman Dam in Westchester County and the Energy Department’s Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls. “They now have the ability to do serious harm,” Mr. Lewis said. “As the conflict with the U.S. continues, they’re going to be tempted. Expect to see a lot more testing of how far they can get into company networks, universities, federal networks and smaller government networks in towns and cities.” Iranian leaders issued strident calls on Friday for revenge against the United States after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in an overnight airstrike at the Baghdad airport.  His death is a considerable blow to Tehran, and Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for retaliation and for three days of national mourning.  “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission, but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands,” the supreme leader said in a statement. Iran’s security body also pledged to avenge General Suleimani’s killing in the “right place and time,” saying it had reached a decision on how to do so.  The American strike spurred mass displays of public mourning by Iran and its network of allies across the Middle East. Iranian officials said the general’s body would be taken on a funeral procession around Baghdad, and that a funeral would be held for him in Tehran on Sunday.  On Friday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter about the strike, saying that General Suleimani “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more … but got caught!” General Suleimani was the head of the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the architect of nearly every significant operation by Iranian intelligence and military forces over the past two decades. The general’s prominent role meant that his death could have a ripple effect in any number of countries across the Middle East where Iran and the United States compete for influence. The strike was carried out by an MQ-9 Reaper drone that fired missiles on a convoy of vehicles leaving the airport. Several other officials from Iraqi militias backed by Tehran were also killed. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The United States has long been at odds with Iran over its nuclear program and influence in Iraq and other countries in the region. Those tensions have surged under the Trump administration. The strike on Friday was the latest escalation between the two nations after a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, believed to have been carried out by an Iran-backed militia, killed an American contractor in December.  The United States hit back with airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia that killed 24 and prompted outrage among some who saw that attack as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Pro-Iranian demonstrators broke into the United States Embassy compound on Tuesday. The breach prompted Mr. Trump to order roughly 750 additional American troops to be deployed to the region. The State Department urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately following the strike that killed General Suleimani in Baghdad, citing “heightened tensions.” Oil prices jumped on Friday after the news of the general’s death: The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, surged in the early hours of Hong Kong trading to nearly $70 a barrel — an increase of $3. The immediate increase in the price of oil was among the largest since an attack on a critical Saudi oil installation in September that temporarily knocked out 5 percent of the world’s oil supply. By 11 a.m. in London, the price of Brent crude oil was at a three-month high of $69.20 a barrel. International oil companies based in the southeastern Iraqi city of Basra have begun evacuating American employees, according to Al Arabiya news outlet.  The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each opened about 1 percent lower on Friday, while oil company shares rose, with Exxon Mobil up 1.3 percent and Chevron up 1.2 percent in premarket trading. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had spoken to top diplomats in Britain, China and Germany on Friday about what the State Department described as President Trump’s recent decision to carry out the strike “in response to imminent threats to American lives.” Mr. Pompeo also told his foreign counterparts that the United States was committed to de-escalation, according to the State Department. Mr. Pompeo posted several statements and a video on Twitter that he said showed Iraqis “dancing in the street.” (Witnesses said that brief demonstration had involved only a small group of men, and that no one else had joined in.) “This was a man who has put American lives at risk for an awfully long time,” Mr. Pompeo said on Friday on CNN. “Last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.” He declined to provide more details about the looming attack. One American official familiar with the internal discussions about the drone strike said the administration was still trying to figure out what would come next. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the backlash over General Suleimani’s death could be even more fraught than the tensions after an American raid in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, who was part of a stateless group and had no international support. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a diplomat from Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran to maintain communication, had delivered a message from the United States to the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran on Friday concerning the death of General Suleimani. It did not elaborate. “Given the latest events in the region, Switzerland invites both parties to avoid any escalation,” the ministry said. As the leader of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which leads Iran’s operations abroad, General Suleimani, who was 62, was the country’s top security and intelligence commander. He was behind nearly all military and intelligence operations orchestrated by Iran in the past two decades and directed Iran-backed militias in the fight against the Islamic State.  American officials have also accused him of causing the deaths of hundreds of soldiers during the Iraq war and he was believed to have played a central role in orchestrating Iran’s support for the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  In Iran, General Suleimani was a respected political figure among hard-liners and was close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. To many Iranians, he was also a war hero, after becoming a commander while he was only in his 20s during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The general’s deputy succeeded him within hours, according to Iranian news agencies, with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appointing Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani as leader of the Quds Force on Friday. General Qaani, 62, had been the force’s deputy commander since 1997, according to Reuters. The United States Treasury Department put General Qaani on a blacklist in 2012 for what it called “financial disbursements” to various terrorist groups, including Hezbollah. Large crowds gathered for Friday Prayer in Iran and filled public squares with mass protests, while officials met privately to plot strategy and leaders vowed to avenge General Suleimani’s death. Images broadcast on Iranian state television showed thousands of supporters of General Suleimani gathered in mourning outside his house in the southeastern town of Kerman, and in other cities. “The great nation of Iran will take revenge for this heinous crime,” President Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called the strike an “act of international terrorism.”  Iran was working with Iraqi officials to repatriate the general’s body for a funeral service, perhaps as soon as Saturday, a number of Iranian journalists reported. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council also held an emergency meeting on Friday, which the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, attended. The council issued a statement after the meeting saying it had reached a decision on how to respond to the killing, but did not say what that decision was.  “America must know the criminal attack on General Suleimani was its worst strategic mistake in the Middle East and that America will not escape the consequences easily,” the statement read. “As our supreme leader said in his message, a harsh revenge awaits the criminals who have the general’s blood on their hands. These criminals will face revenge at the right time and place.” In Iraq, the strike appeared likely to accelerate calls for the departure of American troops. Along with General Suleimani, it killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of a powerful militia that is backed by Iran but under the umbrella of the Iraqi military.  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq praised Mr. al-Muhandis and General Suleimani as heroes in the fight against the Islamic State and condemned their killing as a violation of sovereignty.  Friday’s strike in Baghdad also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi militia leader who was one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq and a veteran of battles against the United States and the Islamic State. Born Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, he was better known by his nom de guerre and gained prominence as mostly Shiite militias formed to fight the Islamic State in 2014. But he was a powerful force in Iraq for years, and his death alone would have sent shock waves through the country.  In 2009, the United States Treasury Department designated Mr. al-Muhandis a “threat to stability in Iraq” and accused him of helping smuggle rockets, sniper rifles and other weapons into the country from Iran.  Long before the Iraq war, he was accused of playing a role in the bombings of French and American Embassies in Kuwait in 1983, and the later attempt to assassinate Kuwait’s emir. Much of Mr. al-Muhandis’s history remains murky, including his exact age: He would have been about 66 or 67 at the time of his death, according to the United States government, which has said he was born in 1953 in Basra, Iraq.  Mr. al-Muhandis fled Iraq with the rise of Saddam Hussein and spent years in exile in Iran, cultivating close ties with Iranian officials, becoming fluent in Persian and keeping a home in Tehran. He returned to Iraq in the aftermath of the American invasion in 2003 and briefly served in Iraq’s Parliament before dropping out of public view. He helped found a militia that fought against the United States, and was accused of training and equipping a network of anti-American groups. The militia has continued to oppose the United States, and American officials blamed it for the rocket attack that killed an American contractor last week. In a reflection of the chaos that has engulfed Iraq and the region, it was only five years after the Treasury Department put sanctions on Mr. al-Muhandis that he found himself effectively on the same side as the United States. The invasion of Iraq by the Islamic State from Syria gave his militia, Iran and the United States a common enemy.  Iranian allies across the Arab world condemned the United States, reflecting the strength of the regional network General Suleimani spent much of his life building, including links to the government of Syria and militant groups in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and elsewhere. The leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that General Suleimani helped build, vowed in a statement that his group would continue on the path the general set and “work night and day to achieve his goals.” It was the responsibility of all resistance fighters to seek “just retribution” against “the most evil criminals in the world,” the leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said, meaning the United States. In Yemen, the administration run by the Houthi rebels, who have received support from Iran in their war against Saudi Arabia, condemned the United States strike as a “cowardly attack” that “makes clear the increasing American spite against all who are in favor of justice for the Islamic world.” In Syria, where General Suleimani oversaw a huge effort to shore up the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a foreign ministry official condemned the “treacherous, criminal American aggression” that led to his killing, the state news agency SANA reported on Friday. António Guterres, the United Nations’ secretary general, voiced his deep concern over the recent rise in tensions in the Middle East, his spokesman, Farhan Haq, said in a statement. “The world cannot afford another war in the Gulf,” the statement read. “This is a moment in which leaders must exercise maximum restraint.” The killing of General Suleimani “most likely” violated international law, Agnes Callamard, the United Nations expert on extrajudicial executions, said in a post on Twitter.  “Use of lethal force is only justified to protect against an imminent threat to life,” Ms. Callamard wrote. Use of drones for targeted killings outside active hostilities was “almost never likely to be legal,” she added. Many experts also said on Friday that the strike probably ended any prospect of negotiations to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the landmark nuclear agreement Iran signed in 2015 with the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The recent escalation in tensions between the United States and Iran began with the 2018 decision by President Trump to withdraw from the deal. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the killing of General Suleimani “an adventurist step that will increase tensions throughout the region,” according to local news agencies. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry called for restraint on all sides, “especially the United States.” “China has always opposed the use of force in international relations,” the spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a daily news briefing, according to news agencies. Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, called on Friday for a de-escalation in tensions and said that further conflict in the region was not in his country’s interest. “We have always recognized the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qassim Suleimani,” Mr. Raab said in a statement. “Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate.” Federica Mogherini, the former European high representative for foreign and security policy, said on Twitter that the general’s killing was “an extremely dangerous escalation.” In France, the country’s junior minister for European affairs, Amélie de Montchalin, said that she would soon consult with countries in the region. “We have woken up to a more dangerous world,” Ms. de Montchalin told French radio, calling for “stability and de-escalation.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cut short an official visit to Greece to return to Israel on Friday after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Before boarding the plane, Mr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for “acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”  General Suleimani, a longtime adversary of Israel, was credited with overseeing many attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets and he was linked with an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Argentina in the 1990s. More recently, he was behind military actions from Syria, across Israel’s northern frontier.  Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, condemned what it called “U.S. bullying” that it said served the interests of Israel. It offered condolences to Iran on the death of General Suleimani, saying in a statement that he had “played a major and critical role in supporting Palestinian resistance at all levels.”  Bassem Naim, a spokesman for the group, said on Twitter that the assassination “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability.” Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded that the administration brief the full Congress on the strike and the next steps under consideration, noting that the move was made without lawmakers’ consultation or an authorization of military force. Ms. Pelosi spoke with Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, Thursday night after the attack, an aide said, but was not given advance notice. The strike, Ms. Pelosi said in a statement late Thursday evening, “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. America — and the world — cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” In stark contrast, Republican lawmakers — including both Iran hawks and those who have frequently clashed with Mr. Trump over his foreign policy — have almost uniformly praised the move. “Will there be escalation? Yes. But the escalation is not on our part,” Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who was stationed twice in Iraq with the Air Force, told CNN. “We’re finally responding to continued provocations by Iran.” The strike immediately spurred debate among American lawmakers about President Trump’s war powers and left congressional leaders sharply divided along party lines.  Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, accused Mr. Trump of bringing the nation “to the brink of an illegal war with Iran.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump had “exercised admirable restraint” and added that the Quds Force were “entirely to blame.” Reporting was contributed by Ben Hubbard, Farnaz Fassihi, Megan Specia, Isabel Kershner, Ronen Bergman, Lara Jakes, Eileen Sullivan, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Elian Peltier, Catie Edmondson, Benjamin Mueller, Alan Yuhas, Nick Cumming-Bruce, Nicole Perlroth, Ben Decker and Joan Nassivera.

"A Revolution in Jewish Learning, With Women Driving Change",2020-01-04,By Isabel Kershner,"['RAANANA, Israel — It was Day 2,699, with 12 days to go. At 8:15 a.m. on a recent weekday about a half-dozen women settled around the dining table in a suburban home in Raanana, a few miles north of Tel Aviv, and opened their Talmudic volumes. A quiet excitement was in the air. They were close to finishing a marathon undertaking: a seven-and-a-half-year cycle of Jewish learning known as Daf Yomi, Hebrew for “daily page.” A visitor read along on a tablet.  Study of the Babylonian Talmud, an archaic, dense and complex text written partly in Aramaic and embodying rabbinical discussions on everything from sacrifices to menstruation, has formed the underpinning of Jewish life, law and scholarship for centuries. For most of that time it was almost exclusively the domain of men. While Talmud study by women was not forbidden by rabbis, it was generally frowned upon, and still is in parts of the strictly Orthodox world.  Now Daf Yomi is increasingly being embraced by women, since technology and social media have made it more accessible. Michelle Cohen Farber, 47, a modern Orthodox scholar and mother of five, is the teacher in whose home the Raanana group gathers for 45-minute sessions. The Daf Yomi program, Ms. Cohen Farber said, “is about getting women to open this book, for the continuity of the Jewish people.” She added, “If you exclude women from it, that’s 50 percent of the population.”  The rigorous but speedy daily routine of studying a single, double-sided folio is “built for the average, busy, working woman,” she said. Ms. Cohen Farber is believed to be the first woman to have taught an entire cycle of Daf Yomi via a daily podcast, which she broadcasts in English and Hebrew. There are also Daf Yomi phone apps and lively discussions in Facebook groups. In Jerusalem on Sunday, Hadran, an organization that advances Talmud study for women and that Ms. Cohen Farber co-founded, is holding a first global women’s Siyum celebration. The “Siyum,” or completion of the 13th cycle of the Daf Yomi, falls Saturday. About 3,000 people, mostly women, are expected to attend, and it will be streamed live to an international audience. The 1,500-year-old Talmud is a meandering text including interpretations of biblical Halakha, or Jewish law, ethics and narratives full of digressions and arguments among rabbis.  It largely depicts women as a husband’s property. And the final volume, Niddah, deals with the intricacies of a woman’s physiology and anatomy and the laws of family purity, including the prohibition of intercourse with a menstruating woman. Ilana Kurshan, a Jerusalem resident originally from Long Island, said she did not have “the anger some women have” over the Talmud’s depiction of women as property. “I feel so blessed to be a Jewish woman in the 21st century,” she said. A Hasidic rabbi in Lublin, Poland, conceived the Daf Yomi tradition nearly 100 years ago, setting the order of study as a way of unifying and synchronizing an increasingly sprawling Jewish diaspora by having Jews focus on the same page each day. A few women first began the Daf Yomi program several decades ago. Talmud study has since been introduced in some religious girls’ schools, and there has been growing interest in secular academia and modern Orthodox circles. Talmud was often considered too difficult and less relevant for women than other texts like the weekly Torah portion. But now that more women are doing it, there seems to have been little pushback from Orthodox men, even in Israel, where more liberal streams of Judaism have not been recognized by the rapidly growing ultra-Orthodox population and by the state rabbinical authority known as the Chief Rabbinate. Eliezer Simcha Weiss, the Rabbinate-affiliated rabbi of a local regional council in central Israel, said of women studying Talmud, “As long as it is not done as a provocation but out of a genuine wish to increase their knowledge of Torah, and as long as they look at it as a book of holiness and importance, I see nothing wrong with it.” He was familiar with Ms. Cohen Farber’s podcast. He noted that even the regular study of Talmud by men was fairly new: It used to be limited to yeshiva students and scholars. “Now everybody’s studying Daf Yomi,” he said, calling it the “in thing.” He also said some people objected to the whole idea of studying — or to a degree speed-reading — the daily page as far too superficial. Ms. Kurshan called women’s participation in Talmud study “a step in an evolutionary process.” The author of “If All the Seas Were Ink: A Memoir,” a book published in 2017 about her experiences with Daf Yomi, Ms. Kurshan said it connected her with an intellectual community. In her book, Ms. Kurshan describes the Talmud as a “stream of rabbinic consciousness.” Speeding through a page a day is meant to provide a foundation, she said. “You can always learn in more depth. I’ll never tire. It’s a book you could spend your whole life reading.”   Whether women bring new insights or perspectives to discussions of the Talmud is “the one-million-dollar question,” said Devorah Evron, director of the Susi Bradfield Women’s Institute of Halakhic Leadership at Midreshet Lindenbaum, a women’s seminary in Jerusalem, who has also taught Daf Yomi to women. When women started becoming doctors and lawyers, she said, the same questions were asked: “Are they just like men with different biology, or is there something they are bringing with them? The same goes here,” she said. “The discussion can be a little different, and that’s the beauty of it.” Ruth Leah Kahan, one of Ms. Cohen Farber’s students, said, “We’re doing this because we can, not because we have something to prove.” She has been coming to class since Day 20, she said, adding that she quickly caught up with the group. After the end of this cycle, she said, “I’m looking forward to starting again.”']","For centuries, Talmud study has been the domain of men. Now women are increasingly embracing it."
Conflict With Iran Threatens Fight Against ISIS,2020-01-04,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['For the militants of the Islamic State, the American drone strike that killed the Iranian commander Qassim Suleimani was a two-for-one victory. First, the killing of General Suleimani removed the leader of one of the Islamic State’s most effective opponents, responsible for building up the alliance of Iran-backed militias that did much of the ground fighting to drive the militants out of their strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The assassination has also redirected the wrath of those militias and their many political allies inside Iraq squarely against the American presence there, raising doubts about the continued viability of the American-led campaign to eradicate what is left of the Islamic State and to prevent its revival in both Iraq and neighboring Syria. “This is precisely the sort of deus ex machina the organization needed, to give it room to operate and to allow it to break out of its current marginality,” said Sam Heller, an analyst at the International Crisis Group who studies the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.  “Even if the American forces are not withdrawn immediately, it is very difficult for me to imagine that they can meaningfully continue the counter ISIS fight.”  Former defense and intelligence officials said that the escalating American confrontation with the Iran-backed Iraqi militias directed by General Suleimani will now mean that the American forces in both Syria and Iraq must worry as much about protecting themselves from attack as they do about fighting the Islamic State, a distraction that could seriously hamper the campaign.  “They are going to be too focused on protecting the mission instead of on fighting ISIS,” said Dana Stroul, a former senior Pentagon official and the co-chair of a congressionally sponsored bipartisan Syria Study Group. But a more sweeping and immediate first test will come on Sunday, when the Iraqi Parliament is expected to vote on a proposal to expel the American forces from Iraq. The nearly 5,000 American troops stationed in Iraq provide essential support to the Iraqi forces trying to hunt down the thousands of ISIS insurgents still plotting attacks from hide-outs in remote rural areas, deserts and mountains.  Without American surveillance, intelligence, transportation and air support, analysts say, the Islamic State fighters would detect the sweeps by Iraqi forces in plenty of time to escape and evade — allowing the ISIS fighters impunity to rebuild their organization. What’s more, the intelligence and logistical support provided by the American military is equally necessary to the European and other military partners in the American-led international coalition against ISIS.  Even the smaller contingent of fewer than 1,000 American service members still deployed to fight the Islamic State in Syria would be impossible to sustain without support from the Americans inside Iraq. And some analysts argued that President Trump’s drawdown in Syria had already left the American forces there vulnerable to attack while alleviating the pressure against ISIS. As a result, a parliamentary vote to expel the American forces from Iraq would effectively end the military effort to defeat ISIS and thwart a comeback. “That is the end of the D ISIS mission as we know it,” Ms. Stroul, now a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote in a text message, using initials for the coalition to defeat the Islamic State. The Iraqi government established after the United States invasion in 2003 has long struggled to balance its dependence on Washington and the West against its close ties to its neighbor Iran. The Iraqi government in Baghdad relied heavily on those Iranian-backed militias in the fight against ISIS.  And many Iraqi politicians have their own close ties to Iran. Among them are many leaders or representatives of those Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militias who now have now been elected to Parliament. What’s more, American officials have repeatedly reassured nervous Iraqis that the United States forces who returned in 2014 had come only to support the Iraqi fight against ISIS. The American diplomats and military officers have always emphasized that the American forces were present only at the formal invitation of the Iraqi government and only to help increase the capacity of the Iraqi forces to combat ISIS themselves. But in the last week, the United States forces in Iraq have not only assassinated General Suleimani. The same drone strike killed a senior Iraqi militia leader who was also a top government security official and a former member of parliament. His Iraqi public relations chief was killed, too.  And in the preceding days, the United States had already killed more than 25 Iraqi fighters from a major Iran-backed militia. They were killed in a missile strike carried out in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several other people at an Iraqi military base. “Action of this type is an obvious grave breach of those agreed-upon terms” of the American military’s return to Iraq, said Mr. Heller of the International Crisis Group. Even if the Parliament does not immediately expel the American forces, he said, “I don’t see how, in the wake of these killings, the U.S. presence continues.” American officials have long considered General Suleimani a fearsome enemy. After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, he helped form and direct Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq blamed for killing hundreds of Americans. But in the fight against the Islamic State after 2014, the United States had tacitly accepted General Suleimani as an awkward ally. Iran’s Shiite Muslim clerical rulers found common cause with Washington against the Sunni militants of ISIS, and the Iranian-backed militias sponsored by General Suleimani did much of the fighting on the ground while American jets, helicopters and drones provided air power. The militias also stopped attacking the American forces who returned to Iraq. And those forces settled into positions inside Iraqi military bases, where they depend for their safety and protection on Iraqi security forces — despite their hosts’ many ties to Tehran. Now President Trump has embarked on an escalating confrontation with Iran, seeking to use sweeping economic sanctions to force Tehran to submit to new restrictions on its military activities and nuclear programs. The Iran-backed Iraqi militias in recent months have once again begun to threaten or attack Americans. And when a mob instigated by one of the militias last week besieged the American Embassy compound in Baghdad’s heavily protected Green Zone, the failure of the Iraqi security forces to prevent the attack and the belated response after it started were both stark reminders of their limitations, in part because of their divided allegiance. If the escalation leads to a larger battle in Iraq between the United States and Iran, the chaos would create the same conditions that have allowed ISIS to thrive in the past, said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Iran team chief in the Pentagon under President Obama and director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “That is a perfect situation for ISIS to regenerate,” he said.  Douglas London, a professor at the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown and a recently former C.I.A. official with experience in the region, warned that the backlash against the United States also increased the potential for so-called green-on-blue attacks by members of Iraqi forces against their American guests. “We have not really had the green-on-blue attacks in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan, but the risk of that would certainly rise,” he said. The leaders of ISIS must now be delighted to see their foes in Iraq attacking each other, argued Barbara Slavin, a scholar of Iran at the Atlantic Council. “It serves us right if ISIS comes crouching back,” she added.']",The American assassination of a top Iranian commander may make it impossible for American forces to stay in Iraq. That could ease an ISIS comeback.
Iranians Close Ranks Behind Leaders After U.S. Kills Popular General,2020-01-04,By Farnaz Fassihi and Richard Pérez-Peña,"['In cities across Iran, tens of thousands packed the streets to mourn Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Black-clad women and men beat their chests and clutched photos of him. A black flag went up on the golden dome of Imam Reza shrine in the city of Mashhad, one of the holiest sites of Shiite Islam. Just a few weeks earlier, the streets were filled with protesters angry with their leaders over the flailing economy and the country’s international isolation. But at least for now, Iran is united — in anger at the United States. For years, it has been a divided nation led by aged revolutionaries determined to impose their will on a predominantly young population with no memory of the Shah, who was deposed in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and with a thirst to live in a more normal nation integrated into the world. Suddenly, with one targeted assassination, the nation rallied behind its leaders.  Young and old. Rich and poor. Hard-liner and reformer, General Suleimani, Iran’s most powerful military leader, was almost universally admired and had near cult figure status. After being killed in Baghdad on Friday in a drone strike ordered by President Trump, his image is now plastered across Tehran, shrouded in black drapes. “Without doubt, the people of Iran will take revenge for this horrific criminal act,” tweeted the president, Hassan Rouhani, a leader who once advocated diplomacy and integration with the West. In Iraq on Saturday, tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched through the capital, Baghdad, vowing to exact revenge on the United States at a funeral procession for two revered Iraqi military figures who were also killed in the attack on General Suleimani. And back in Iran, politicians and ordinary people of all stripes voiced support for the vow by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that “severe revenge awaits those criminals” who killed the general. The assassination appears to have solidified the hard-liners’ grip on power, neutralizing at least for the moment those who had called for talks with the West, experts inside and outside of Iran said.  Iran’s relative moderates like Mr. Rouhani have been on the defensive since Mr. Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed an array of sanctions, contributing to Iran’s sharp economic decline.  That reversal bolstered hard-line critics who said it discredited those who had accepted American assurances. Moderates had nurtured fading hopes of renewed talks with Washington — possibly between the two presidents.  Any talk of outreach or liberalization seems more dangerous than it has in years and is likely to fade from public debate for the time being. The prospect of negotiations with the United States, tweeted Sara Masoumi, a prominent reformist journalist, is now “below zero.” “At least in the short term, this will create a rally to the flag; Suleimani was personally popular,” said Vali R. Nasr, a Middle East scholar and former dean of Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. He predicted “an outpouring of emotion,” both organic and whipped up by the government. Iran is bestowing honors on Mr. Suleimani as if he were a combination of statesman and saint. His body will circulate around shrines in all the holy cities of Shiite Islam from Samarra, Kadhimiya, Karbala and Najaf in Iraq to Mashhad and Qom in Iran. As his body makes its way to four Iranian cities over the next few days, large crowds are expected to attend and display their solidarity and defiance. This show of unity, however, could be short-lived.  The deep grievances that ignited protests against the government in November still remain in place: economic hardship, international isolation and social oppression. Some Iranian opposition supporters have praised the assassination and are in favor of Washington increasing its maximum pressure policy on Iran’s rulers. Just last month, mass anti-government protests shook Iran, showing deep discontent — which only grew with a brutal crackdown that killed as many as 1,000 people. Fury at the United States is now expected to deflect attention from the country’s economic suffering and the recent protests. And the assassination may well provide Iran’s leaders with an excuse to intensify its repression of dissenters and critics. General Suleimani’s killing “was the worst thing that could happen to civic movements in Iran and Iraq,” said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity expert based in New York.  “It means more pressure on people who are already being squeezed politically and economically.” In just a few days, the conflict between the United States and Iran has escalated drastically. A rocket attack on a military base in Iraq killed an American on Friday; the United States blamed it on an Iran-backed militia and carried out airstrikes Sunday that killed some two dozen militia fighters. On Tuesday, militias swarmed the American embassy compound in Baghdad, breached the outer wall and set fire to some structures. General Suleimani led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which conducts Iran’s foreign military operations. He commanded Iranian forces battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He also headed Iran’s role in arming, training and directing anti-ISIS Shiite militias; the American attack that killed him also killed the powerful leader of Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. In addition, the general directed Iran’s involvement with forces like the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others that are in conflict with the United States and its regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. The United States had labeled him a terrorist since 2007 and imposed economic sanctions on him. But in Iran, the government built up his public image as the person keeping the country safe. He went from a commander in the shadows to a household name, regularly seen in news videos directing troops in battle, meeting with allied leaders and reciting poetry about martyrdom.  “Qassim Suleimani has been seen as the public face of Iran’s regional policy,” said Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow and leader of the Iran Forum at Chatham House, an international affairs institute based in London. “Since the fight against ISIS, you’ve seen this surge of support for him.” Iranians who are usually outspoken in support of human rights have turned to national solidarity and sorrow at his death. “How soon we forget how close ISIS was to us and who defeated this monster,” the actress Bahareh Rahnama posted on her Instagram account. One of Iran’s biggest celebrities, she is well known for her support of women’s rights.  General Suleimani was broadly thought of as a conservative, but he took care not to align himself with any political faction in Iran or take sides in domestic disputes, allowing him to be seen as above politics. “He’s someone who had a depth and breadth of relationships within the Iranian system that allowed him to work with all key players,” said Ariane Tabatabai, an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation focused on the Middle East and Iran. She cited his close working relationship with Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is seen as a moderate. “Every major political actor within Iran, from reformist to hard-liner, is saying this is a great loss,” she said. Iran announced a three-day funeral procession for General Suleimani which began on Saturday in Baghdad and then moves to other cities in Iraq. The procession will continue in Mashhad, Iran on Sunday and Tehran on Monday, where Ayatollah Khamenei will pray over the general’s body at Tehran University.  Then on Tuesday it will go to his hometown, Kerman, for burial. Iranian media reported that he left a will asking for a simple burial there. An enormous turnout is expected, and leaders of militant groups from across the region are expected to attend the services, several people with knowledge of the planning said. “Many Iranians, whether they like the regime or not, did consider Suleimani as a sort of national symbol,” said Raz Zimmt, an Iran specialist at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, and they see his assassination “as something that hurts national pride. ”Mahmoud Dowlatabadi, a prominent Iranian author who has spoken out for artistic freedom, wrote that “Iran once again lost one of its most honorable children.” Since Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Iran has revived its nuclear program in stages, amid escalating conflicts with the United States. The European signers of the agreement promised to find a way to offset the effects of the sanctions, but so far have failed. Hints at renewed negotiations with Washington have gone nowhere. “The moderates were already on life support” before the killing of General Suleimani, Mr. Nasr said, and Iran will hold legislative elections next month. “I would guess the hard-liners are going to do very well. This kind of pressure on Iran, just like in any country, plays into the hands of the security forces.”']","The death of Qassim Suleimani strengthened the hand of hard-liners, experts say, and undermined those who have tried to normalize relations with the West."

"A Revolution in Jewish Learning, With Women Driving Change",2020-01-04,By Isabel Kershner,"['RAANANA, Israel — It was Day 2,699, with 12 days to go. At 8:15 a.m. on a recent weekday about a half-dozen women settled around the dining table in a suburban home in Raanana, a few miles north of Tel Aviv, and opened their Talmudic volumes. A quiet excitement was in the air. They were close to finishing a marathon undertaking: a seven-and-a-half-year cycle of Jewish learning known as Daf Yomi, Hebrew for “daily page.” A visitor read along on a tablet.  Study of the Babylonian Talmud, an archaic, dense and complex text written partly in Aramaic and embodying rabbinical discussions on everything from sacrifices to menstruation, has formed the underpinning of Jewish life, law and scholarship for centuries. For most of that time it was almost exclusively the domain of men. While Talmud study by women was not forbidden by rabbis, it was generally frowned upon, and still is in parts of the strictly Orthodox world.  Now Daf Yomi is increasingly being embraced by women, since technology and social media have made it more accessible. Michelle Cohen Farber, 47, a modern Orthodox scholar and mother of five, is the teacher in whose home the Raanana group gathers for 45-minute sessions. The Daf Yomi program, Ms. Cohen Farber said, “is about getting women to open this book, for the continuity of the Jewish people.” She added, “If you exclude women from it, that’s 50 percent of the population.”  The rigorous but speedy daily routine of studying a single, double-sided folio is “built for the average, busy, working woman,” she said. Ms. Cohen Farber is believed to be the first woman to have taught an entire cycle of Daf Yomi via a daily podcast, which she broadcasts in English and Hebrew. There are also Daf Yomi phone apps and lively discussions in Facebook groups. In Jerusalem on Sunday, Hadran, an organization that advances Talmud study for women and that Ms. Cohen Farber co-founded, is holding a first global women’s Siyum celebration. The “Siyum,” or completion of the 13th cycle of the Daf Yomi, falls Saturday. About 3,000 people, mostly women, are expected to attend, and it will be streamed live to an international audience. The 1,500-year-old Talmud is a meandering text including interpretations of biblical Halakha, or Jewish law, ethics and narratives full of digressions and arguments among rabbis.  It largely depicts women as a husband’s property. And the final volume, Niddah, deals with the intricacies of a woman’s physiology and anatomy and the laws of family purity, including the prohibition of intercourse with a menstruating woman. Ilana Kurshan, a Jerusalem resident originally from Long Island, said she did not have “the anger some women have” over the Talmud’s depiction of women as property. “I feel so blessed to be a Jewish woman in the 21st century,” she said. A Hasidic rabbi in Lublin, Poland, conceived the Daf Yomi tradition nearly 100 years ago, setting the order of study as a way of unifying and synchronizing an increasingly sprawling Jewish diaspora by having Jews focus on the same page each day. A few women first began the Daf Yomi program several decades ago. Talmud study has since been introduced in some religious girls’ schools, and there has been growing interest in secular academia and modern Orthodox circles. Talmud was often considered too difficult and less relevant for women than other texts like the weekly Torah portion. But now that more women are doing it, there seems to have been little pushback from Orthodox men, even in Israel, where more liberal streams of Judaism have not been recognized by the rapidly growing ultra-Orthodox population and by the state rabbinical authority known as the Chief Rabbinate. Eliezer Simcha Weiss, the Rabbinate-affiliated rabbi of a local regional council in central Israel, said of women studying Talmud, “As long as it is not done as a provocation but out of a genuine wish to increase their knowledge of Torah, and as long as they look at it as a book of holiness and importance, I see nothing wrong with it.” He was familiar with Ms. Cohen Farber’s podcast. He noted that even the regular study of Talmud by men was fairly new: It used to be limited to yeshiva students and scholars. “Now everybody’s studying Daf Yomi,” he said, calling it the “in thing.” He also said some people objected to the whole idea of studying — or to a degree speed-reading — the daily page as far too superficial. Ms. Kurshan called women’s participation in Talmud study “a step in an evolutionary process.” The author of “If All the Seas Were Ink: A Memoir,” a book published in 2017 about her experiences with Daf Yomi, Ms. Kurshan said it connected her with an intellectual community. In her book, Ms. Kurshan describes the Talmud as a “stream of rabbinic consciousness.” Speeding through a page a day is meant to provide a foundation, she said. “You can always learn in more depth. I’ll never tire. It’s a book you could spend your whole life reading.”   Whether women bring new insights or perspectives to discussions of the Talmud is “the one-million-dollar question,” said Devorah Evron, director of the Susi Bradfield Women’s Institute of Halakhic Leadership at Midreshet Lindenbaum, a women’s seminary in Jerusalem, who has also taught Daf Yomi to women. When women started becoming doctors and lawyers, she said, the same questions were asked: “Are they just like men with different biology, or is there something they are bringing with them? The same goes here,” she said. “The discussion can be a little different, and that’s the beauty of it.” Ruth Leah Kahan, one of Ms. Cohen Farber’s students, said, “We’re doing this because we can, not because we have something to prove.” She has been coming to class since Day 20, she said, adding that she quickly caught up with the group. After the end of this cycle, she said, “I’m looking forward to starting again.”']","For centuries, Talmud study has been the domain of men. Now women are increasingly embracing it."
Conflict With Iran Threatens Fight Against ISIS,2020-01-04,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['For the militants of the Islamic State, the American drone strike that killed the Iranian commander Qassim Suleimani was a two-for-one victory. First, the killing of General Suleimani removed the leader of one of the Islamic State’s most effective opponents, responsible for building up the alliance of Iran-backed militias that did much of the ground fighting to drive the militants out of their strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The assassination has also redirected the wrath of those militias and their many political allies inside Iraq squarely against the American presence there, raising doubts about the continued viability of the American-led campaign to eradicate what is left of the Islamic State and to prevent its revival in both Iraq and neighboring Syria. “This is precisely the sort of deus ex machina the organization needed, to give it room to operate and to allow it to break out of its current marginality,” said Sam Heller, an analyst at the International Crisis Group who studies the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.  “Even if the American forces are not withdrawn immediately, it is very difficult for me to imagine that they can meaningfully continue the counter ISIS fight.”  Former defense and intelligence officials said that the escalating American confrontation with the Iran-backed Iraqi militias directed by General Suleimani will now mean that the American forces in both Syria and Iraq must worry as much about protecting themselves from attack as they do about fighting the Islamic State, a distraction that could seriously hamper the campaign.  “They are going to be too focused on protecting the mission instead of on fighting ISIS,” said Dana Stroul, a former senior Pentagon official and the co-chair of a congressionally sponsored bipartisan Syria Study Group. But a more sweeping and immediate first test will come on Sunday, when the Iraqi Parliament is expected to vote on a proposal to expel the American forces from Iraq. The nearly 5,000 American troops stationed in Iraq provide essential support to the Iraqi forces trying to hunt down the thousands of ISIS insurgents still plotting attacks from hide-outs in remote rural areas, deserts and mountains.  Without American surveillance, intelligence, transportation and air support, analysts say, the Islamic State fighters would detect the sweeps by Iraqi forces in plenty of time to escape and evade — allowing the ISIS fighters impunity to rebuild their organization. What’s more, the intelligence and logistical support provided by the American military is equally necessary to the European and other military partners in the American-led international coalition against ISIS.  Even the smaller contingent of fewer than 1,000 American service members still deployed to fight the Islamic State in Syria would be impossible to sustain without support from the Americans inside Iraq. And some analysts argued that President Trump’s drawdown in Syria had already left the American forces there vulnerable to attack while alleviating the pressure against ISIS. As a result, a parliamentary vote to expel the American forces from Iraq would effectively end the military effort to defeat ISIS and thwart a comeback. “That is the end of the D ISIS mission as we know it,” Ms. Stroul, now a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote in a text message, using initials for the coalition to defeat the Islamic State. The Iraqi government established after the United States invasion in 2003 has long struggled to balance its dependence on Washington and the West against its close ties to its neighbor Iran. The Iraqi government in Baghdad relied heavily on those Iranian-backed militias in the fight against ISIS.  And many Iraqi politicians have their own close ties to Iran. Among them are many leaders or representatives of those Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militias who now have now been elected to Parliament. What’s more, American officials have repeatedly reassured nervous Iraqis that the United States forces who returned in 2014 had come only to support the Iraqi fight against ISIS. The American diplomats and military officers have always emphasized that the American forces were present only at the formal invitation of the Iraqi government and only to help increase the capacity of the Iraqi forces to combat ISIS themselves. But in the last week, the United States forces in Iraq have not only assassinated General Suleimani. The same drone strike killed a senior Iraqi militia leader who was also a top government security official and a former member of parliament. His Iraqi public relations chief was killed, too.  And in the preceding days, the United States had already killed more than 25 Iraqi fighters from a major Iran-backed militia. They were killed in a missile strike carried out in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several other people at an Iraqi military base. “Action of this type is an obvious grave breach of those agreed-upon terms” of the American military’s return to Iraq, said Mr. Heller of the International Crisis Group. Even if the Parliament does not immediately expel the American forces, he said, “I don’t see how, in the wake of these killings, the U.S. presence continues.” American officials have long considered General Suleimani a fearsome enemy. After the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, he helped form and direct Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq blamed for killing hundreds of Americans. But in the fight against the Islamic State after 2014, the United States had tacitly accepted General Suleimani as an awkward ally. Iran’s Shiite Muslim clerical rulers found common cause with Washington against the Sunni militants of ISIS, and the Iranian-backed militias sponsored by General Suleimani did much of the fighting on the ground while American jets, helicopters and drones provided air power. The militias also stopped attacking the American forces who returned to Iraq. And those forces settled into positions inside Iraqi military bases, where they depend for their safety and protection on Iraqi security forces — despite their hosts’ many ties to Tehran. Now President Trump has embarked on an escalating confrontation with Iran, seeking to use sweeping economic sanctions to force Tehran to submit to new restrictions on its military activities and nuclear programs. The Iran-backed Iraqi militias in recent months have once again begun to threaten or attack Americans. And when a mob instigated by one of the militias last week besieged the American Embassy compound in Baghdad’s heavily protected Green Zone, the failure of the Iraqi security forces to prevent the attack and the belated response after it started were both stark reminders of their limitations, in part because of their divided allegiance. If the escalation leads to a larger battle in Iraq between the United States and Iran, the chaos would create the same conditions that have allowed ISIS to thrive in the past, said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Iran team chief in the Pentagon under President Obama and director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “That is a perfect situation for ISIS to regenerate,” he said.  Douglas London, a professor at the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown and a recently former C.I.A. official with experience in the region, warned that the backlash against the United States also increased the potential for so-called green-on-blue attacks by members of Iraqi forces against their American guests. “We have not really had the green-on-blue attacks in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan, but the risk of that would certainly rise,” he said. The leaders of ISIS must now be delighted to see their foes in Iraq attacking each other, argued Barbara Slavin, a scholar of Iran at the Atlantic Council. “It serves us right if ISIS comes crouching back,” she added.']",The American assassination of a top Iranian commander may make it impossible for American forces to stay in Iraq. That could ease an ISIS comeback.
Deadly Airstrike in Libya Wreaks Havoc at Military Academy,2020-01-04,,"['CAIRO (AP) — An airstrike slammed into a military academy in Libya’s capital, Tripoli, on Saturday, killing at least 16 people, most of them students, the health authorities said.  Malek Merset, a spokesman with the Tripoli-based health ministry, said the airstrike took place in the Hadaba area, just south of the city center, where fighting has been raging for months. He said the strike wounded at least 37 others, who were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.  Tripoli has been the scene of fighting since April between the self-styled Libyan National Army led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter and an array of militias loosely allied with the weak but United Nations-supported government that holds the capital.  The fighting has escalated in recent weeks since General Hifter declared a “final” and decisive battle for the capital after the Tripoli authorities signed military and maritime agreements with Turkey. On Thursday the Turkish Parliament authorized the deployment of troops to Libya.  Footage shared online on Saturday showed wounded people with bandages and blood on their legs being treated in a hospital. The Tripoli-based government blamed the Libyan National Army for the airstrike, but the group had no immediate comment.  General Hifter’s surprise military offensive in April came despite commitments to attend a national conference weeks later aimed at forming a united government and moving toward elections. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi as the country’s longtime leader and later killed him.   General Hifter’s Libyan National Army and the eastern government have the support of France, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and other key Arab countries; the Tripoli-based government is backed by Turkey, Italy and Qatar.']","At least 16 were killed and 37 wounded in an attack in Tripoli, the capital."
Erdogan Announces First Turkish Troops Are Heading to Libya,2020-01-05,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey has started deploying troops to Libya, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday evening in a live television interview, keeping his promise to support the fragile government in Tripoli even as Western states have warned against escalating a conflict between the government and rebel forces. Turkish troops will be part of a combined training and fighting force to support the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj in Tripoli, which has been under attack for months by forces from eastern Libya. Mr. Erdogan told CNN that Turkish troops would set up an operations center headed by a lieutenant general and would focus on coordination and training. The first troops were already gradually heading out, he said, but the larger concentration of forces will follow later.  Mr. Erdogan’s comments came after the Turkish Parliament approved a resolution on Thursday to send troops to Libya. Last month Turkey signed an economic agreement with Tripoli, and Mr. al-Serraj’s government requested military assistance. Turkey has become increasingly embroiled in a proxy war as Gen. Khalifa Hifter — who controls much of eastern Libya and is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Russia — has sought to seize control of the whole country. In recent weeks, General Hifter’s forces have been buoyed by the arrival of Kremlin-backed Russian mercenaries armed with sophisticated drone-jamming technology. They have pushed farther into Tripoli, tightening their grip on the capital. In a sign of the worsening situation, at least 30 people were killed and 33 wounded, many of them military cadets, in a missile strike this weekend on a military academy in Tripoli.  It is not clear how large a force Turkey intends to send, but Turkish analysts have described a mixed air, land and naval force. Turkey has plans, they say, to establish a sea and land base, possibly in Misurata, and to train a Libyan national army.  Two naval frigates are already nearby in Algeria and a submarine is off Libya, a Turkish reporter and analyst, Mete Sohtaoglu, posted Saturday on Twitter. He said combat aircraft and commandos would also be deployed. Mr. Erdogan said the aim of the deployment, which he said would last for one year, was to help the Libyan government forces gain the upper hand. “It is to keep them on their feet and let them come out of it with victory and have their own land,” he said.  “The actual aim of this decision that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey has taken is to help secure a cease-fire, and help a return to the political process,” he added. He said the deployment was intended to help bring stability — “to prevent any development that would destabilize the region and cause humanitarian tragedies.” Mr. Erdogan seemed at pains to emphasize for his domestic audience that Turkish soldiers would not be doing the fighting, but would serve in training and coordinating operations. Other forces, he said, apparently referring to Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, would make up the combat units, he said.  Some Turkish-backed Syrian fighters have already arrived in Tripoli in recent days. ']",Turkish forces would deploy for a year to bolster the government in Tripoli and allow a return to the political process.
"As Fires Rage, Australia Sees Its Leader as Missing in Action",2020-01-05,"By Livia Albeck-Ripka, Jamie Tarabay and Isabella Kwai","['HASTINGS, Australia — The posters have popped up on streets around Australia, showing the prime minister looking very tropical: floral wreath on his head, ocean-blue shirt open at the collar.  “MISSING,” they blared. “Your country is on fire.” The immediate reference was clear. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been widely castigated for taking a vacation to Hawaii last month, and trying to keep it quiet, while Australia was in the early clutches of one of its most devastating fire seasons ever. But the message went well beyond one island getaway. Angry and frightened, Australians have been venting their frustration with Mr. Morrison over what they see as his nonchalant and ineffectual response to the disastrous blazes and his unwavering dismissal of the force that has made them so intense: climate change. With thousands fleeing eastern towns this weekend as fires swept from the hills to the coast, the inescapable realities of a warming world were colliding with the calculated politics of inaction.  Mr. Morrison has minimized the connection between climate change and Australia’s extreme environmental conditions, even as the country just completed its hottest and driest year on record. He has derided calls to end coal mining as “reckless,” prioritizing economic interests and loyalty to a powerful lobby. He has opposed taxing heat-trapping emissions or taking other significant steps to reduce them, although a majority of Australians say the government should take stronger action.  And he has signaled no change in his policies even as 24 people have died, hundreds of homes have been destroyed, and more than 12 million acres have burned, an area larger than Denmark. On Sunday, weather conditions eased a bit, with light rain in some areas, but blazes were still burning in Victoria and New South Wales, and some towns were being evacuated.  “The thing that strikes everyone about the present situation is the federal government’s disengagement and lethargy, to put it politely,” said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a policy institute. “People are just bewildered,” he added. As the fire conditions worsened over the weekend, Mr. Morrison defended his government’s response and announced a military mobilization — one that he quickly promoted in a video on social media, drawing widespread criticism. He also denied that his government had played down the links between global warming and changes in Australia’s weather patterns. “The government has always made this connection, and that has never been in dispute,” he said. The prime minister said he was undeterred by the anger directed at him. “There has been a lot of blame being thrown around,” he said. “Blame: It doesn’t help anybody at this time, and over-analysis of these things is not a productive exercise.” Mr. Morrison’s attempt at damage control came as Australians have been voicing a growing sense since November, when the fires arrived early and with far more force than usual, that the government is no longer protecting them in the way it once did.  For much of the time since, the prime minister said that it was not the time to talk about climate change, and that those who did were merely trying to score political points.  But each surge of the flames into crowded suburbs and coastal getaways has presented a fresh test of Mr. Morrison’s defense of the status quo. He has sought to tamp down outrage mostly with photo opportunities and a populist appeal that echoes President Trump. Mr. Morrison has portrayed those who support greater climate action as effete snobs trying to impose their ways on an unwilling quiet majority. The prime minister published a New Year’s message in newspapers across Australia that pushed back against international pressure for the country to do more.  “Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas or respond to what others tell us we should think or what we should do,” Mr. Morrison said. “We have always made our own decisions in Australia.” Critics suggest that his antipathy toward action on climate change has contributed to what they consider a hands-off response to the fires, treating them as a tragedy rather than a turning point. For months, Mr. Morrison rebuffed calls for a more forceful intervention by the federal government — like a broad military deployment or the largely symbolic declaration of a national emergency — by noting that firefighting had long been the responsibility of individual states. He changed course on Saturday, announcing a call-up of military reservists and new aircraft resources.  The prime minister also initially resisted pressure to compensate the thousands of volunteer firefighters who are performing the overwhelming bulk of the work to protect communities. He later relented, approving payments for each of up to about $4,200, or 6,000 Australian dollars. The decision came a week after he cut his Hawaii trip short and returned to Australia following the deaths of two volunteer firefighters. Mr. Morrison, who began his professional life in tourism, has been mocked online with the hashtag #scottyfrommarketing. On New Year’s Day, as fire victims surveyed the destruction from the wildfires under orange skies, photos emerged of Mr. Morrison hosting the Australian cricket team in Sydney. “It reminds me of the George W. Bush moment after Hurricane Katrina in 2005,” said Daniel Flitton of the Lowy Institute, a nonpartisan policy center in Australia. “He seemed to be out of touch, and misread the depths of public concern. That became a lodestone he had to carry for the rest of his term in office.” More recently, Mr. Morrison has tried to defend Australia’s environmental policies, portraying his government as taking firm action. He said repeatedly in a news conference on Thursday — his first since before Christmas — that the government was on course to “meet and beat” its emission reduction targets. Climate scientists say those targets were low to begin with. And Australia’s emissions have been rising, while the leadership continues to fight for the right to emit even more.  During United Nations climate talks in Madrid late last year, Australia came under heavy criticism for proposing to carry over credits from the two-decade-old Kyoto Protocol to help it meet its targets under the landmark Paris accord.  “We are laggards,” said Joseph Camilleri, an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, where he specializes in existential threats, including climate change.  “What the Australian fires do best is show us that climate change is now with us here and truly,” he added, “and everyone, including Australia, needs to do an awful lot more than we are doing.” Australia’s conservative leaders often point out that the country accounts for only a tiny percentage of the world’s heat-trapping emissions. But some experts called the Madrid maneuver a potentially pernicious example from a country that continues to extract and export huge amounts of coal that ends up being burned in power plants around the world.  “The government claims it has reduced emissions,” Mr. Hare said. “What they’re using are essentially accounting tricks to justify or explain their reasoning.”  In his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Morrison framed the government’s climate policy in a way he often has before, as something he will not let get in the way of continued prosperity. He also asked Australians to trust the government and to be patient.  To many, that appeal did not match the gravity of the fear and anxiety coursing through the country.  Jim McLennan, an adjunct professor specializing in bush-fire preparedness at La Trobe University, said that many of the regions affected this season had no recent history of severe bush fires, making it difficult for communities to prepare. Australians are also emotionally unready, he added, for the extreme future that most likely awaits them. Some scientists say people may have to throng to cities to escape the threat of bush fires.  “I can’t think of a time,” he said, “where we have had so many serious fires occurring in so many different parts of the country at roughly the same time. It is a kind of new world.”  Mr. Morrison may be able to weather the political storms. The next election is two years away, and he is fresh off a surprise electoral victory in which he was buoyed by support in Queensland, a coal-mining center. But across the country’s heavily populated eastern coast, the public’s patience is nearly exhausted and turning rapidly to fury. Hours after the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Morrison visited a fire-ravaged community, Cobargo, to see the damage and pledge support to residents.  They heckled him out of town. “You left the country to burn,” one person yelled before the prime minister walked away and set off in his car. In Mallacoota, another devastated community in southeastern Australia where hundreds of people were evacuated by naval ship to the town of Hastings, Michael Harkin, a vacationer from Sydney, said his experience during the fires had intensified his anger toward the government over its inaction on climate change. The Morrison government, he said, was exhibiting “incompetent governance avoiding the inevitable.”  “They’re not keeping us safe at all,” he added.

Is There a Risk of Wider War With Iran?,2020-01-03,By Max Fisher,"['In the hours after an American drone strike in Iraq killed Iran’s most important military leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a question has dominated discussion in the Middle East, in Congress and on social media. Could this lead to war between the United States and Iran? In a sense, it already has. The killing of General Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, its elite security and intelligence unit, meets virtually any definition of an act of war, a categorical difference from the shadow conflicts that the United States and Iran have engaged in for years. To Iranian eyes, it is akin to Tehran ordering the death of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  But it remains uncertain where this attack, which follows weeks of tit-for-tat escalations between the two countries, will lead.  What follows is a guide to the risks of greater conflict between the United States and Iran, how the killing of General Suleimani plays into those risks and what might come next. General Suleimani’s killing all but forces Iran to retaliate, most analysts say. That’s not primarily out of national pride or saving face, but because of the fundamental drive of any state: self-preservation, which includes preserving its top leadership.  Killing one of those leaders is more than a slap in the face or a blow to military capabilities; it is a threat to the functioning of the state itself. Iran will feel compelled to retaliate, if only to demonstrate that killing its leaders will trigger counterattacks dire enough to deter the United States from doing so again. But it is difficult to predict how severe that retaliation will be, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the region. Iran has an extraordinarily difficult needle to thread. It will likely aim for counterattacks damaging enough to persuade the United States that killing General Suleimani was not worth it — a high bar, given his value and the far superior American military strength — but not so damaging as to trigger an all-out conflict.  If Iran succeeds, the results could be costly to the United States and its allies, but fall short of triggering outright war. But there is no way for it to know for sure what actions would meet both goals. And miscalculation could lead things to spiral out of control. The past month suggests that both the United States and Iran are already failing to properly calibrate their counterattacks. Each cycle of tit-for-tat escalations has, rather than forcing the other side to back down, instead led the other to ramp up, triggering another round more costly than the last.  In a sense, both sides have already lost control: It’s not as if the United States wanted its Baghdad embassy stormed or Iran wanted its Quds Force commander killed.  Another dynamic makes this cycle even harder to control: American intentions have at times been unclear. Official statements have described limited aims, such as deterring Iranian attacks. But senior officials have also described more sweeping goals like expelling Iran from the wider region or even toppling its government.  The uncertainty, along with the simple fact of overwhelming American military might, puts pressure on Iranian leaders to plan for the worst. And it makes it harder for them to know when they can safely back down.  Faced with a potentially existential threat, any state has two options: stand down and negotiate or hit the source of that threat hard enough to make it back down.  Iran chose to cut a deal most recently in 2015, when, to relieve American-led economic sanctions, it surrendered the bulk of its nuclear program and permitted invasive inspections. But the United States had made that easier by seeking to demonstrate that Iran would not expose itself to existential threats by curbing its nuclear program. Monthslong negotiations allowed Iranian leaders to feel confident that the terms were in their interest and had wide international backing.  But President Trump’s penchant for making sudden policy changes, disdaining international support and withdrawing from agreements, including that very nuclear accord, could shift Iran’s calculus. It may see gambling on retaliation as the safer option. Iran is a regional power with far more sophisticated military capabilities than any country that the United States has gone to war with since World War II. It is a far cry from Saddam Hussein’s crumbling Iraq or armies of North Vietnamese irregulars. And it has invested years of preparation in enduring a possible war. Iran’s escalations are expected to be asymmetric, which means using proxies or small attack groups to target American forces, allies or economic interests. Iran has also shown a willingness to target civilians.  American adversaries have had little success in using asymmetric attacks to force Washington to back down — just as the United States has never found a reliable strategy for deterring asymmetric attacks.  The greatest risk may be that asymmetric Iranian warfare reaches a point where the United States feels compelled to strike Iran directly. Analysts fear that this could lead to a direct, sustained war, but no one can say for sure how easily that might happen.  Iran could hardly win a shooting war with the United States, but its conventional forces would make any ground war costly and drawn out, analysts project. Iran also has extensive medium-range missiles that could strike American bases or allies throughout the Middle East. Iran could call upon proxy militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But no governments are eager to join it in an outright war. American allies in the region —\xa0Israel and Gulf States such as Saudi Arabia — would be unlikely to join unless dragged in by Iranian attacks.  Iraq is coming under growing pressure to choose between the United States and Iran. Should American forces be expelled, Washington would lose a point of significant influence in Iraq, likely granting Iran greater sway in the country. While the possibility of an unintended slide to war is impossible to rule out, fears of World War Three — a phrase that trended overnight on social media — are overblown. Russia and China might strenuously object to American attacks, but they are no more likely to join the fight than they were when the United States invaded Iraq or helped to topple Libya’s government.  The suddenness of this escalation makes it difficult to know how fully Mr. Trump’s administration has thought through and planned for the potential consequences.  Early signs suggest that Mr. Trump’s trademark impulsiveness may have played a role. It is unclear whether European allies were notified in advance. Even Israeli leaders appeared to scramble in response.  Iran’s willingness to take risky actions — perhaps driven by a perception that the scale of the American threat leaves it with no other choice — increases the danger to all sides.  The greatest stakes are not purely political. It can be easy for Americans to forget that Iran is not just an adversary, it is also home to over 80 million civilians, many of whom are already suffering under sanctions. Millions more across the Middle East, where proxy fights are likely to play out, would also be at risk. The burdens of any conflict are likely to fall overwhelmingly on those regular families, as they always do. ']","All but forced to retaliate, Iran will likely aim for limited counterattacks that damage the United States but don’t lead to all-out war. Miscalculation could mean things spiral out of control.

"Suleimani’s Gone, and the Iran Nuclear Deal May Be Next",2020-01-03,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — How Iran will respond to the American assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani remains a matter of speculation, but one outcome seems almost certain: the end of Europe’s long effort to keep the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal alive. In interviews on Friday, European analysts envisioned a number of baleful results from the killing of the general, who was a national hero and potential political leader in Iran, and whose death Tehran has vowed to avenge.  Among those were the downgrading of diplomacy, the destabilization of Iraq and the further strengthening of Iran’s hard-liners and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. But the more immediate threat, they said, was to the nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama in 2015.  President Trump pulled the United States out of the treaty in May 2018, calling it “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” and imposed punitive new sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. The other signatories — Europe in particular, but also Russia and China — tried hard to preserve the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. And Iran initially said it would adhere to its treaty obligations. But Tehran has since taken a series of steps away from the treaty, and analysts fear that it may now renounce all of its obligations. Tehran’s strategy could become clear in a matter of days, as it had already said that it was about to take another step away from the accord.  There was speculation that Iran would return to enriching uranium at 20 percent, a major breach of the deal, which the European signatories — France, Britain, Germany and the European Union — have warned against, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “This would give Europeans even less breathing room to keep the J.C.P.O.A. alive until November 2020,” when the world would know whether President Trump is re-elected, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “It will be very difficult for the Europeans to hold it together.”  After conversations on Friday morning with officials in Tehran, she said that “people inside Iran pushing for the diplomatic process the Europeans have been advocating have lost a lot of ground.”  She said she expected the Iranian response to the killing to be on different tracks, potentially including military attacks on American targets in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or elsewhere; cyberattacks; or various other possibilities. Part of the Iranian debate, she said, is whether to retaliate openly or through proxies in a more deniable way, which has been Iran’s practice in the past. “But with the internal pressure building up inside Iran, and now this external pressure, Iranian decision makers will have to let off some steam somewhere,” Ms. Geranmayeh said. Carl Bildt, the former prime minister of Sweden, said that Europe had been trying to prevent war between Iran and the United States for a decade, but that the scope for salvaging the nuclear accord now “is very small, and the scope for diplomacy is extremely limited.” There was a narrowing window before the elections that Iran is due to hold next month, which the conservatives were already expected to win, Mr. Bildt said. “But that window is now gone.” Still, he said, Iran is likely to be careful on how far it acts beyond the accord, since it has tried to keep the nuclear issue largely separate from its regional battles and interests. “I think their response will be more likely on the kinetic side rather than the nuclear one, at least not more than they were going to do anyway,” Mr. Bildt said. His larger concern is the effect on Iraq, which is already a fragile state. “With Iraq now a battleground between the U.S. and Iran,” Mr. Bildt said, “the state of Iraq is weakened considerably more, which will have consequences for everyone,” including Europe. For François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, the killing of General Suleimani creates great uncertainty, and could even produce a push for the general’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to take over the Iranian government. “Iran will react,” he said. “But will this trigger new dynamics in the Iranian government?” Yet the death of even such a prominent military commander may not change Iran’s fundamental calculus of its own interests, which have so far meant dissolving the edges of the nuclear deal without prompting the Europeans to abandon it, Mr. Heisbourg said.  On a more hopeful note, Mr. Heisbourg said that given Mr. Trump’s stated desire to avoid further American military engagement around the world, he might now — having shown toughness — be more open to negotiating with Iran.  And Iran, after some measured retaliation — having watched the tactics of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, with Mr. Trump — might even go along with it. The recently departed chief of the European Union’s foreign and security policy, Federica Mogherini, called the killing of General Suleimani “an extremely dangerous escalation” in the Middle East. But she said on Twitter that she hoped “some of the diplomatic achievements of the past will be preserved.’’ One of her top advisers was more doubtful.  “Even before this killing, Iran was considering whether the next step would be 20 percent enrichment, but now it’s reasonable to assume that and even more,” said the adviser, Nathalie Tocci, who is director of Italy’s Institute of International Relations. “And it’s more or less safe to conclude that there’s very little left we can do” on the nuclear accord. The Europeans “should have been braver” on the nuclear deal, Ms. Tocci said. That would have included getting its alternative trading system with Iran — intended to circumvent American economic sanctions — up and running faster and on a larger scale, and not just for humanitarian goods. Just $2 million in trade was in line this month for the barter program, known as Instex — an amount that the Iranians regard as risible, Ms. Tocci said. “It could have been $200 million,” she said, with more European courage and autonomy. The program was also hindered by a separate initiative by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who tried to be a mediator between Washington and Tehran for a program of prepayment of Iranian oil sales. Iran got excited about that, Ms. Tocci said, but “Macron tried in September to get Washington’s permission and was told, ‘No.’” “It was very French, a huge distraction, and three months were lost,” Ms. Tocci said. And with the Iranian elections coming next month, “given that the conservatives were bound to win, even moderates would have made relatively hard-line moves now.” Whatever the eventual reverberations of the killing, it will be another reminder to Europeans of their collective weakness in the face of unilateralist American policy, Ms. Tocci said.  “Europe is again exposed to the reality that its policy in the Middle East is ancillary to U.S. policy there,” she said. “So as the U.S. withdraws or attacks or whatever it does, we’re exposed to the ensuing mess without the tools to develop an alternative policy.” Europe talks more and more now about “strategic autonomy” from the United States and acting more to defend its own interests, Ms. Tocci added. “But there remains almost a psychological attitude of subservience to Washington. We talk about it and skirt around it, but we’re not there yet.”']",Europe fears that its faltering efforts to preserve the 2015 pact have been dealt a fatal blow with the United States’ killing of a top Iranian commander. 
Mourners Throng Iran’s Streets for Suleimani Funeral Marches,2020-01-05,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Huge crowds of mourners poured into the streets of two Iranian cities on Sunday to pay their respects to Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the second most powerful figure in the country and leader of the elite Quds force, who was killed on Friday in an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport.  General Suleimani’s body was returned to Iran early Sunday — after tens of thousands of people joined processions for him in four Iraqi cities — and was received with military salutes at the airport in Ahvaz, a city in the southwest. A funeral procession then made its way through Ahvaz, the coffin draped in flowers and an Iranian flag, and depicting mourning symbols of the Shiite faith. A mass of people snaked across the city’s main streets and a long bridge over the Karoun River. Stretching over 30 kilometers, or almost 20 miles, the crowds of men and women in black carried flags and photos of Mr. Suleimani and beat their chests in unison as Islamic prayers blasted from speakers around the city. Iranian state television estimated that the mourners in Ahvaz and Mashhad, where the general’s body was flown later for another procession, numbered in the millions.  “The attack really wounded and insulted the national pride of Iranians,” said Amir, a 35-year-old businessman and resident of Ahvaz who asked that his last name not be used for security reasons. “I went to show my solidarity and to say no to war with Iran.”  Tensions across the Middle East have steadily ratcheted up since Friday’s killing of General Suleimani, who was credited with building Iran’s vast network of proxy militant groups across the region, from Yemen to Syria to Lebanon. On Sunday, Iran announced it was ending commitments it made to limit its nuclear fuel production in its 2015 deal with world powers. Senior Iranian military officials warned of a military retaliation for the killing. The outpouring of grief reflects General Suleimani’s cultlike status in the country, which transcends political factions and grievances against the government. The majority of Iranians, even critics of the government, viewed him as the man who had protected Iran’s security against foreign threats like the Islamic State and conflict with Israel and the United States. General Suleimani, who also oversaw the building up of a network of Shiite militias in Iraq, was the most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Among the others killed in the attack was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, which includes at least half a dozen pro-Iranian militias. His body was also flown into Iran on Sunday. The choice of Ahvaz as the first stop of the funeral procession in Iran was significant because the city has a large ethnic Arab population which has not always supported the government. Many citizens there had joined the recent protests against the regime. But they united in their support for General Suleimani, a figure they viewed as larger than life. After the procession through Ahvaz, the general’s body was flown to Mashhad, a holy city in northeastern Iran that contains Shiites’ third most important shrine. Millions of people also flocked to the streets there, and the city was shut to car traffic. Men and women openly wept and called for revenge on the United States during interviews in the state news media. The host of state television broadcasting the funeral processions said that the turnout underscored the public fury at the United States, and that any negotiations or a deal with the United States was over. The general’s coffin is to travel to Tehran on Monday for a state funeral that will begin at Tehran University and make its way to the landmark Freedom Square. A public holiday has been declared, and the municipality is bracing for an estimated crowd of 15 million, according to a person familiar with the planning. Tehran’s emergency shelters are open and free to visitors from other cities, and free meals will be available. Various government agencies and ministries have offered to provide water and food to participants. A highway in Tehran has already been named after the general. “Tomorrow is a national day,” said Meysam Sharifi, a Tehran resident who plans to attend the procession with his family. “It’s the responsibility of every Iranian to come and commemorate a national hero.”  The general will be buried Tuesday in  his hometown, Kerman, according to the wishes expressed in his will. It is unclear whether Mr. al-Muhandis will be buried in Iran or if his body will be returned to Najaf, Iraq, where almost all Iraqi Shiites are buried. Mr. al-Muhandis married an Iranian and became an Iranian citizen.']","The killing of the revered Iranian general “really wounded and insulted the national pride,” one resident said. "

Ms. Penny, who has grappled with alcoholism and suicide, later told me that her novels were, ultimately, about human goodness. “I know what it’s like to hate yourself so much that you have to murder yourself,” she said. “Coming out the other side gave me a profound belief that goodness exists.” Vaclav Havel: The Playwright Who Overthrew Communism  There are rare people who ennoble you by their sheer presence. One such person was Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, who led the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia. When I first met Mr. Havel in Prague back in 2008, he told me about the five years he had spent in prison as a dissident, his 19 plays and his 14 years as president. “I have had a very adventurous life but not because I have an adventurous nature,” he said. In 2011, I froze in place on a rainy street in Istanbul when I learned of his death, before rushing back to my hotel to update his obituary for The Times. Writing it was both inspiring and humbling. Vesna Vulovic: The Woman Who Fell From The Sky  Nearly five decades ago, Vesna Vulovic fell thousands of feet after the plane she was on exploded midair. Miraculously, Ms. Vulovic, a flight attendant from the former Yugoslavia, survived. When I met her at her home in Belgrade in 2008, she told me she had no memory of the fall. But she vividly recalled its aftermath, when she was celebrated as a national hero. She earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest recorded fall without a parachute. She died in 2016 at age 66. \u200bRatko Mladic: The Butcher of Bosnia  When I arrived in the poor, remote Bosnian village where Ratko Mladic grew up, it was covered with blacks crows. It was somehow fitting for the hometown of the Bosnian-Serb general held responsible for the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. In 2010, I and another Times reporter, Doreen Carvajal, investigated his whereabouts. He was captured one year later, in a Serbian farming village. His conviction in November 2017 for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes marked the end of one of Europe’s bloodiest chapters since the end of World War II. Seemona Sumasar: A Revenge Plot So Intricate, The Prosecutors Were Pawns  In 2011, when I was a Metropolitan reporter in New York, I stumbled on a crime story right out of an episode of C.S.I. The case focused on Seemona Sumasar, a petite former Wall Street analyst who had been raped by a former boyfriend. When she refused to drop the charges against him, he framed her for a series of brazen armed robberies that never took place. As a result, the rapist and his victim switched places: Ms. Sumasar spent seven months in prison. “In the collective memory, no one has ever seen anything like this before,” the Queens district attorney told me at the time. Pashe Keqi: A Sworn Virgin of Albania  For centuries in a rural northern part of Albania, people lived under an ancient warrior code called the Kanun, dating to Ottoman times. Under the Kanun, murder must be avenged with blood. Consequently, thousands of men were killed in so-called blood feuds, leaving women alone in a culture where men ruled. Some women adapted by taking an oath of virginity and thereby becoming the men of the house. In 2008, I set out for the mountains of Albania and met Pashe Keqi, 78, a sworn virgin, to learn what had motivated her to swap genders. The resulting story is not one I will soon forget. Freddie Foreman: He Was Once the ‘Godfather of British Crime.’ Now He’s Just a Grandfather. When I was researching my book, “The Last Job,” about a group of geriatric jewel thieves known as “The Bad Grandpas,” I met Freddie Foreman. Mr. Foreman, now 87, was a former hit man for the diabolical Kray twins in London in the 1960s. Yet when I knocked on his door for the first time in 2017, he looked like a sweet grandpa. Over wine, we talked about his childhood during World War II and, eventually, about murder. It was hard to square the endearing raconteur with the man known as “Brown Bread Fred” (“brown bread” is Cockney rhyming slang for “dead”). Xavier Dolan: An Iconoclastic Quebec Filmmaker Appropriately enough, interviewing Xavier Dolan, who talked to me for nearly eight hours about his life and childhood, felt like being in one of his frenetic films. Mr. Dolan is an actor, director and former child star. By the time he was 29, he had directed seven films. His eighth feature, “Matthias & Maxime,” about friendship and male intimacy, premiered at Cannes in May. Dominique Strauss-Kahn: From I.M.F. Chief to Perp Walks  Before the #MeToo era began, I covered the pimping trial of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French former head of the International Monetary Fund. It was, by any account, a remarkable fall from grace. During his trial, those in attendance, me included, sat in discomfort as prostitutes testified about the sexual tastes of a man once touted as a future French president. The trial of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, previously accused of assaulting a hotel maid in New York, shined an uncomfortable light on a culture where powerful men had been able to behave with impunity. Aga Mehmet Arslan: A Polygamist Who Champions Monogamy While a correspondent in Turkey, I met a polygamist who had five wives and so many children — 55 — he couldn’t remember all of their names. A jovial man with a prodigious pot belly, Aga Mehmet Arslan told me that he regretted marrying all of his wives, since the multiple marriages had created jealousies and, above all, because he was a romantic. “Marrying five wives is not sinful, and I did so because to have many wives is a sign of power,” he said, perched on a divan at his house. “But I wouldn’t do it again.” Canadians who have been following the adventures of The Times’s 52 Places Traveler could be forgiven for their glee after discovering that his final destination after a paradise in French Polynesia was Calgary. Among the draws of Calgary, he writes, is the Calgary Central Library, “a stunning building at the gateway to the city’s developing East Village neighborhood.” In 2016, a strange and disturbing phenomenon occurred: Civilians started driving onto Canadian military bases distracted by their cellphone screens. It turned out they were chasing the digital animated creatures of Pokémon Go in off-limits places. This week the Canadian military released internal documents about the befuddling phenomenon.

"Suleimani’s Gone, and the Iran Nuclear Deal May Be Next",2020-01-03,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — How Iran will respond to the American assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani remains a matter of speculation, but one outcome seems almost certain: the end of Europe’s long effort to keep the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal alive. In interviews on Friday, European analysts envisioned a number of baleful results from the killing of the general, who was a national hero and potential political leader in Iran, and whose death Tehran has vowed to avenge.  Among those were the downgrading of diplomacy, the destabilization of Iraq and the further strengthening of Iran’s hard-liners and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. But the more immediate threat, they said, was to the nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama in 2015.  President Trump pulled the United States out of the treaty in May 2018, calling it “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” and imposed punitive new sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign. The other signatories — Europe in particular, but also Russia and China — tried hard to preserve the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. And Iran initially said it would adhere to its treaty obligations. But Tehran has since taken a series of steps away from the treaty, and analysts fear that it may now renounce all of its obligations. Tehran’s strategy could become clear in a matter of days, as it had already said that it was about to take another step away from the accord.  There was speculation that Iran would return to enriching uranium at 20 percent, a major breach of the deal, which the European signatories — France, Britain, Germany and the European Union — have warned against, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “This would give Europeans even less breathing room to keep the J.C.P.O.A. alive until November 2020,” when the world would know whether President Trump is re-elected, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “It will be very difficult for the Europeans to hold it together.”  After conversations on Friday morning with officials in Tehran, she said that “people inside Iran pushing for the diplomatic process the Europeans have been advocating have lost a lot of ground.”  She said she expected the Iranian response to the killing to be on different tracks, potentially including military attacks on American targets in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan or elsewhere; cyberattacks; or various other possibilities. Part of the Iranian debate, she said, is whether to retaliate openly or through proxies in a more deniable way, which has been Iran’s practice in the past. “But with the internal pressure building up inside Iran, and now this external pressure, Iranian decision makers will have to let off some steam somewhere,” Ms. Geranmayeh said. Carl Bildt, the former prime minister of Sweden, said that Europe had been trying to prevent war between Iran and the United States for a decade, but that the scope for salvaging the nuclear accord now “is very small, and the scope for diplomacy is extremely limited.” There was a narrowing window before the elections that Iran is due to hold next month, which the conservatives were already expected to win, Mr. Bildt said. “But that window is now gone.” Still, he said, Iran is likely to be careful on how far it acts beyond the accord, since it has tried to keep the nuclear issue largely separate from its regional battles and interests. “I think their response will be more likely on the kinetic side rather than the nuclear one, at least not more than they were going to do anyway,” Mr. Bildt said. His larger concern is the effect on Iraq, which is already a fragile state. “With Iraq now a battleground between the U.S. and Iran,” Mr. Bildt said, “the state of Iraq is weakened considerably more, which will have consequences for everyone,” including Europe. For François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, the killing of General Suleimani creates great uncertainty, and could even produce a push for the general’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to take over the Iranian government. “Iran will react,” he said. “But will this trigger new dynamics in the Iranian government?” Yet the death of even such a prominent military commander may not change Iran’s fundamental calculus of its own interests, which have so far meant dissolving the edges of the nuclear deal without prompting the Europeans to abandon it, Mr. Heisbourg said.  On a more hopeful note, Mr. Heisbourg said that given Mr. Trump’s stated desire to avoid further American military engagement around the world, he might now — having shown toughness — be more open to negotiating with Iran.  And Iran, after some measured retaliation — having watched the tactics of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, with Mr. Trump — might even go along with it. The recently departed chief of the European Union’s foreign and security policy, Federica Mogherini, called the killing of General Suleimani “an extremely dangerous escalation” in the Middle East. But she said on Twitter that she hoped “some of the diplomatic achievements of the past will be preserved.’’ One of her top advisers was more doubtful.  “Even before this killing, Iran was considering whether the next step would be 20 percent enrichment, but now it’s reasonable to assume that and even more,” said the adviser, Nathalie Tocci, who is director of Italy’s Institute of International Relations. “And it’s more or less safe to conclude that there’s very little left we can do” on the nuclear accord. The Europeans “should have been braver” on the nuclear deal, Ms. Tocci said. That would have included getting its alternative trading system with Iran — intended to circumvent American economic sanctions — up and running faster and on a larger scale, and not just for humanitarian goods. Just $2 million in trade was in line this month for the barter program, known as Instex — an amount that the Iranians regard as risible, Ms. Tocci said. “It could have been $200 million,” she said, with more European courage and autonomy. The program was also hindered by a separate initiative by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who tried to be a mediator between Washington and Tehran for a program of prepayment of Iranian oil sales. Iran got excited about that, Ms. Tocci said, but “Macron tried in September to get Washington’s permission and was told, ‘No.’” “It was very French, a huge distraction, and three months were lost,” Ms. Tocci said. And with the Iranian elections coming next month, “given that the conservatives were bound to win, even moderates would have made relatively hard-line moves now.” Whatever the eventual reverberations of the killing, it will be another reminder to Europeans of their collective weakness in the face of unilateralist American policy, Ms. Tocci said.  “Europe is again exposed to the reality that its policy in the Middle East is ancillary to U.S. policy there,” she said. “So as the U.S. withdraws or attacks or whatever it does, we’re exposed to the ensuing mess without the tools to develop an alternative policy.” Europe talks more and more now about “strategic autonomy” from the United States and acting more to defend its own interests, Ms. Tocci added. “But there remains almost a psychological attitude of subservience to Washington. We talk about it and skirt around it, but we’re not there yet.”']",Europe fears that its faltering efforts to preserve the 2015 pact have been dealt a fatal blow with the United States’ killing of a top Iranian commander. 
The Australia Wildfires in Pictures,2020-01-03,By The New York Times,"['Flames have blackened an area the size of Guatemala, destroyed some 2,000 homes and killed at least 28 people in one of the worst wildfire seasons in Australian history. More than 200 blazes are still burning, many of them completely uncontrolled. On Saturday, Victoria’s Forest Fire Management confirmed on Twitter that one of its firefighters had died while working on a bushfire near Omeo. On Friday, two of the biggest infernos merged into what officials called a “mega-fire,” straddling the country’s two hardest-hit and most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria. Steady winds continue to drive the flames, but the record-breaking heat that made conditions worse last month and into the new year has abated, and the possibility of at least a little rain next week entered the forecast. The fire season began early this year, in September, enabled by heat, wind and drought that had left trees and brush tinder dry. The blazes grew steadily worse and have consumed more than 41,000 square miles so far, spreading a harmful shroud of smoke across much of southeastern Australia, and even touching some suburbs of Sydney, the most populous city. Here is a look at some of the most powerful images of the fires and the devastation they have left behind, the people and animals attempting to escape them, and the continuing effort to contain them.

A Shocked Iraq Reconsiders Its Relationship With the U.S.,2020-01-04,"By Falih Hassan, Tim Arango and Alissa J. Rubin","['BAGHDAD — American oil workers were fleeing Iraq on Friday, as fears grew of war between the United States and Iran. At sermons in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, worshipers chanted, “Death to America!”  And in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad, where antigovernment protesters have gathered for months, a banner went up with a pointed message to both Iran and the United States: “Keep your conflicts away from Iraq.” Iraqis awoke to the news on Friday that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, the architect of Iran’s dominating influence over Iraq, had been killed in an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport, along with several others.  Even before the shock of the brazen killing wore off, Iraqi factions were weighing their responses. Militias with ties to Iran vowed bloody revenge. The prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, condemned the attack as “an outrageous breach to Iraqi sovereignty” and said Parliament would meet to discuss the future of the United States presence in Iraq. Anti-government protesters, who have been protesting Iran’s stifling influence in the country, were worried their movement could be snuffed out by pro-Iran militias. And throughout the country, there was the familiar feeling that Iraq was a mere bystander in the broader geopolitical conflict between the United States and Iran taking place on Iraqi soil. More broadly, the events raised a single, overarching question: can the United States maintain a cooperative security relationship with Iraq given the upheaval the assassination has provoked? The question was already coursing through the halls of power in Baghdad, even as the Trump administration said Friday that it was rushing new troops to the region in response to the crisis. The airstrike on General Suleimani “was a clear breach of the terms of the American forces’ presence,” Mr. Abdul Mahdi said.  He said that Parliament would meet in the coming days to consider “appropriate measures to preserve the dignity of Iraq and its security and sovereignty,” including whether to ask the Americans to leave. It could well turn out that the killing of General Suleimani, intended as a shot against Iran, could accelerate one of Iran’s long-term objectives: pushing the United States military out of Iraq. “I think in his death he put the final nail in the coffin of the U.S. military presence in Iraq,” said Mohammad Shabani, a doctoral researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London who focuses on Iran-Iraq relations. “If Iran can erase the U.S. military presence in Iraq and all it has to do is give up five Iranian military men, would Iran do it? I think the answer is yes.” The United States has nearly 5,000 troops in Iraq on a handful of bases.  But whether they stay or go, the American power in Iraq was only likely to be diminished. “One sure result of the U.S. strike is that the era of U.S.-Iraq cooperation is over,” Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former American diplomat, wrote on Twitter. “The U.S. diplomatic & mil presence will end b/c Iraq asks us to depart or our presence is just a target or both. The result will be greater Iranian influence, terrorism and Iraqi infighting.” More than 16 years after the American invasion of Iraq, a devastating conflict that cost close to $1 trillion and claimed about 5,000 American lives, Iran is the dominant power in Iraq, and its grip on Baghdad was on vivid display this week, even before General Suleimani’s killing. When American airstrikes attacked the bases of a pro-Iranian militia on Sunday, killing at least 24 of its fighters, Iraqi officials spoke in one voice condemning the United States for violating Iraqi sovereignty, but few criticized the militia for carrying out the attack that killed an American contractor and precipitated the airstrikes. When militia fighters marched on the American embassy on Tuesday to attack it, Iraqi security forces stepped aside to let them pass. And as they lay siege to the embassy, setting fire to buildings and effectively blockading embassy personnel in the embassy overnight, Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi found that he was powerless to get them to leave. For 24 hours, he held almost constant emergency meetings with the militia leaders, urging them to withdraw, according to officials involved in the meetings. “Please, you are putting me in a critical situation,” he begged, according to Brig. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf. “We are a state, and we have to conduct ourselves as a state. We have to protect these embassies.” He finally persuaded the militia leaders to withdraw their forces only by threatening to leave his job and “leave the country to chaos,” according to Iraqi officials familiar with the exchanges.  Experts said that if the Trump administration had a strategy to work with the Iraqi government to achieve stability and sovereignty — through diplomatic and economic engagement — the killing of General Suleimani in a drone strike early Friday would have provided a measure of leverage. Kenneth M. Pollack, a former C.I.A. official who is an expert on Iraq and Iran at the American Enterprise Institute, said the assassination means that, at least for a time, “Iraqi politicians will be less fearful of Iran and more willing to listen to the Americans.” The Iranians in Iraq, he said, having lost their leader, will be on their heels, trying to figure out what to do next.  But, he said, the United States seems to have no policy on Iraq beyond using the country as a base to confront Iran. “I have been talking to my friends at State and there is no effort to use this to push Iraq in a better direction,” he said. He called the killing “a tactical move directed at Iran without a wider regional strategy.” Iran, on the contrary, is deeply embedded in Iraq on many levels. “The United States has only one color, it is the military color, that is all that it spends its money on,” said Qais al-Khazali, the leader of a pro-Iranian militia. “But Iran has many colors — in culture, in politics, in religion, in many spheres.”  On the streets, some Iraqis celebrated General Suleimani’s demise. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted an image of Iraqis waving their country’s flag, describing them as, “dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Suleimani is no more.” The reality on the streets, where antigovernment protests have swelled, with calls for an end to Iran’s influence, was something else, though, as fear of what may come outweighed any jubilation over the killing of General Suleimani. Faiq al-Shakhe, a member of Parliament, said the demonstrators showed, “no signs of happiness or celebration.” Instead, he said, they were worried about a violent response from Iran-aligned militias, who have already killed many protesters and may now, more than ever, see them as agents of the United States. “It was a wrong act from America because America should have coordinated with the Iraqi government,” said Ameer Abbas, a protester, who shared the widespread view that the American attack was a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Another protester, Mustafa Nader, said, “we are all against foreign interventions, whether from Iran, Saudi Arabia or the United States. We do not have a personal problem with Iran, but if America were to intervene at the same level as Iran, you will see as much objection as there has been against Iran, and maybe stronger.” Emma Sky, a former adviser to American forces in Iraq and a senior fellow at Yale, said the American-Iraqi relationship “is going to be really damaged” by the killing. “I think there will be more calls for the U.S. to withdraw troops,” she said. She said Americans will be hard pressed to justify a continued presence in Iraq because of the perception that its objectives are not aimed at promoting a stable Iraq, but containing Iran. “The U.S. doesn’t have a policy on Iraq,” she said. “It has a policy on Iran.” While Iraq’s Parliament is sure to take up the issue of the American troop presence, few expect the government to actually expel the Americans. Many Iraqi leaders still view an American presence as vital to its security, and depend on American training of the Iraqi security forces and, for better or worse, as a counterweight to Iranian influence. Still, the Americans are left with few vital defenders in Iraq. “No one is going to speak up for us, despite all we’ve done and in spite of the mistakes — and God knows we’ve done some bad ones,” said Ryan Crocker, a former United States ambassador to Iraq and now the diplomat in residence at Princeton University. “All we’ve given Iraq, and the Shia in particular, were things they could never have dreamed of before 2003. But that was then and this is now.” Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, Tim Arango from Los Angeles and Alissa J. Rubin from Paris.

Cries of ‘Revenge Is Coming’ at Funerals for Slain Commanders in Iraq,2020-01-04,"By Alissa J. Rubin, Ben Hubbard and Falih Hassan","['BAGHDAD — As Iraq held joint funeral services on Saturday for two revered military leaders killed in an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport this past week, tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched through Baghdad, waving flags and chanting that “revenge is coming” to the United States. The surprise killing on Friday of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the architect of Iran’s regional security strategy, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a powerful Iraqi militia commander and government official, threatened to shift fault lines across the Middle East. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed “forceful revenge” as the country mourned the death of General Suleimani, and calls have accelerated to eject the United States from Iraq. Across the region, fears are rising that the shadow war that had been building between the United States and Iran could suddenly escalate into a wide-ranging conflict. General Suleimani, 62, spent much of his life building Iran’s network of ties with militant groups across the Middle East, including in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  The extent of that network added to the uncertainty about how Iran might respond to his killing. If it chose to, Tehran could do so by relying on allied forces in any of those places to target American troops or allies such as Israel, Saudi Arabia or other Persian Gulf countries. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security updated its National Terrorism Advisory System to warn that Iran “is capable, at a minimum, of carrying out attacks with temporary disruptive effects against critical infrastructure in the United States.” The system’s bulletins, which are shared among law enforcement across the country, also reiterated that there was no current, specific, credible threat against the United States. Experts said it remained unclear how, when and even whether Iran would make good on its threats of vengeance. They noted that the country had to balance its need to show resolve against a staunch enemy and its reluctance to thrust itself into a full-scale war with the United States, a much stronger power. That led some scholars to suggest that Iran’s response could end up being underwhelming. “Technically, Iran could attack U.S. bases in Syria or in Iraq, but that would drive an even greater retaliation from the United States that I don’t think even Iran would wish to happen,” said Lina Khatib, the head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. “I may be in the minority here, but I think with this new development, despite Iran’s outlandish statements, ultimately Iran has been pushed into a corner,” she added. The funeral services were held against a backdrop of extreme regional tension as Iran and the United States signaled they could be on the brink of a potentially catastrophic war. Since the killings of General Suleimani and Mr. al-Muhandis, neither side has made another move — although both have made threats.  At the joint funerals, as close to a state ceremony in Iraq as any since the fall of Saddam Hussein, a key pillar of Iran’s regional reach was on display in Baghdad. Many of the mourners were members of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, militias that came together to fight the Islamic State and that are now overseen by the Iraqi security forces.  The most powerful of those militias are affiliated with Iran; their fighters wore somber faces and black clothes as they marched, carrying the flags of their groups. They chanted: “The blood of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis will not be spilled in vain. Revenge is coming.” The loss of Mr. al-Muhandis was a profound one for the Iraqi fighters, who saw him not just as a militia leader close to Iran but also as someone who had helped rally the armed groups when they first formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State as it threatened to sweep toward Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. The militias have since been brought under the umbrella of the Iraqi security forces, and Mr. al-Muhandis was their deputy head. Many declared: “Our men do not fear America; each man dies on his day. Your voice, Abu Mahdi, remains the loudest one.” Iran can count on a range of assets in the region, including the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen and a range of fighting groups in Iraq and Syria that operate close to small contingents of American troops.  In recent months, Iran and its allies have struck oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and targeted tanker traffic in some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. A senior commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the gulf, saying that Iran would retaliate against Americans wherever they were within reach of the Islamic Republic. Gen. Gholamali Abuhamzeh, the commander of the Guards in the southern province of Kerman, said on Friday in comments reported by the Tasnim news agency on Saturday: “The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West, and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there.” He said Iran had long ago identified “vital American targets in the region,” and added, “Some 35 U.S. targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach.” His comments were echoed Saturday by Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani, the newly appointed head of Iran’s Quds Force, who said Iran’s counterattack on American targets would have “a large geographic reach.”  Another warning was issued by Abu Ali al-Husseini, the special operations chief of Khataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia whose bases in Iraq and Syria the United States bombed a week ago. He said the Iraqi military should stay at least a half-mile away “from the American enemy bases” starting on Sunday evening. Any Iraqi military personnel who stayed with the Americans, he suggested, were acting as “human shields.” A number of Iraq’s Shiite militia leaders are expected to travel to Tehran on Sunday to meet with Quds Force commanders, according to several militia leaders.  While the killing of General Suleimani was a blow to factions aligned with Iran, his death was not mourned in other parts of the Middle East. Many others in the Arab world hated him for marshaling militias to help President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, expand Iran’s leverage in Iraq and boost the ability of Yemen’s Houthi rebels to inflict pain on Saudi Arabia. “He will kill no more,” read a front-page editorial in Saudi Arabia’s Arab News. “Let there be no tears shed for Qassim Suleimani; he must have known that he could not get away with these crimes forever, and that he would not die in his bed,” wrote Faisal Abbas, the newspaper’s editor. General Suleimani’s body arrived in Iran on Sunday for a funeral service. A large state service is expected in Tehran on Monday, and the general is expected to be buried in his hometown, Kerman, on Tuesday, Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported. Amid the tensions, the United States has called on its citizens to leave Iraq, shuttered its embassy in Baghdad, sent additional Marines and on Thursday deployed 700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division to the region. American contractors who train Iraqi troops have begun returning home.  After the strike, President Trump said the attack had been intended “to stop a war” and warned Iran that the United States military had already identified targets for further strikes “if Americans anywhere are threatened.” But critics have called the strike essentially a political assassination that could further destabilize the region.  On Saturday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in a telephone call with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, “The risky military action by the United States violates the fundamental norms of international relations and will worsen regional tensions and turmoil.”  “China urges the United States not to recklessly misuse armed force and to seek solutions to problems through dialogue,” Mr. Wang said, according to a summary of the call issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, also spoke with Mr. Zarif, telling him that “such actions by the United States grossly violate the norms of international law,” according to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. In a telephone call with France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Mr. Wang also indicated that China hoped to salvage the international agreement curtailing Iran’s nuclear capabilities. He told Mr. Le Drian that the deal was a hard-won “pillar for safeguarding the peace and stability of the Middle East,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported on its website. Among those attending the funeral on Saturday were Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq and a number of senior Shiite leaders, including Ammar al-Hakim; Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a former prime minister; Falih Al Fayad, the national security adviser; and Hadi al-Amiri, the leader of the Badr Organization, which is both a political party and has one of the largest and oldest militias.  Mr. Abdul Mahdi looked upset as he walked surrounded by security officers in a sea of militia fighters. As Iraq’s leader, he has been caught between Iran, its neighbor, and the United States as the two have ratcheted up their confrontations.  The latest round of violence started with a rocket attack a week ago that killed an American contractor working at an Iraqi military base in the north of the country. That was followed by an American attack on five Popular Mobilization militia bases in western Iraq and Syria that killed more than 24 people and set in motion the events that led to a nearly two-day siege of the United States Embassy in Baghdad.  After the funerals on Saturday, some mourners tried to again enter the Green Zone, which holds the seat of the Iraqi government and the embassies of the United States and other countries. But they were pushed back. Also on Saturday, rocket attacks occurred near bases in Baghdad and Balad that host coalition troops, according to the American military. No coalition troops were harmed, it said. In Iran, the news media flooded its broadcasts and front pages with coverage of General Suleimani’s death, and even news outlets perceived to be more moderate called for revenge.  When President Hassan Rouhani of Iran paid his condolences on Saturday during a visit to General Suleimani’s home, he, too, spoke of revenge — but with an open-ended timeline. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Mr. Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today, but for years to come.” “Retaliation is definite,” Gen. Mohammad Reza Naghdi, a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said on Iranian state television. “The U.S. should not waste time sending us messages, letters and liaisons.”  He said American officials had “mobilized everyone” to seek an intervention to avoid an Iranian retaliation. “If you weren’t man enough, why did you do it?” The killing of General Suleimani was likely to further fuel anti-Americanism in Iran, as well as empower the country’s hard-liners over those who called for diplomatic efforts with the United States, said Hamidreza Azizi, assistant professor of international relations at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran.  “This will erode the face of the moderate camp inside Iran, and it will even turn the moderates into hard-liners,” he said.

Do-gooder or ‘Devil’? A Friar’s Work Divides a Venezuelan Village,2020-01-03,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['EL TUKUKO, Venezuela — The Rev. Nelson Sandoval’s repeated clashes with Socialist officials, Marxist rebels and tribal chiefs have earned him both loyal followers and bitter enemies in a remote and neglected Indigenous village in the rainforest of western Venezuela. To some of the community’s 3,500 residents, he is “the Devil.” His supporters know him as their “second father.” For the last 15 years, Father Sandoval has been working to bring education and health care to the village, El Tukuko.  His allies say this has made him the main lifeline keeping El Tukuko afloat amid Venezuela’s unprecedented economic crisis, underlining how the fortunes of entire communities can hinge on single individuals in a disintegrating country. His detractors, however, “tell me I will go to hell,” said Father Sandoval, a jovial, 49-year-old Capuchin friar with a penchant for swearing. “I tell them, I’m already living in hell.” Like most of rural Venezuela, El Tukuko has been devastated by Venezuela’s seven-year economic crisis. Electricity and phone connections are sporadic. Malnutrition is rife and the local state clinic is out of medicines. Without a police or military presence, the surrounding Perijá Mountains, which stretch to nearby Colombia, have been taken over by cow rustlers, drug traffickers and cross-border rebels. Father Sandoval lays the blame for the village’s dire conditions squarely on Venezuela’s long-serving Socialist government. “They are a curse that has befallen us,” he said of the government of President Nicolás Maduro. “They live like kings while people eat crap. As a Christian, I can’t accept this inconsistency.” During the oil boom of the 2000s, Venezuela’s central government tried to weaken the Roman Catholic Church’s grip on Indigenous communities like this one with free housing and cash handouts.  But as the government has retreated in the wake of the country’s economic collapse, the Los Ángeles del Tukuko mission that Father Sandoval oversees is again assuming some of the basic functions of the state. Its outsize role recalls the Church’s secular power — and decidedly mixed legacy — in Latin America’s colonial era, when proselytizing spread deadly germs along with education. And while the Church prevented the Spanish colonists from formally enslaving the Indigenous populations, it often participated in their brutal exploitation.  “Some say the Church is a parasite that feeds on Indigenous lands,” Father Sandoval said in an interview at the mission. “They have no idea of all that we have done for these people.” During a reporter’s visit to the village in December, Father Sandoval was stopped by everyone he passed on his strolls around El Tukuko’s dirt streets, which were decorated with dozens of homemade Nativity scenes of thatch and clay. Without money for store-bought decorations, most families built makeshift Christmas trees out of sticks and shredded candy wrappers and plastic bags. As Father Sandoval walked around the village, wearing a thick brown habit, his curly mop of white hair, balding crown and moderate pouch made him resemble a stock Friar Tuck in a “Robin Hood” adaptation.  “Capuchino patume!” said Luisa Pique, a pensioner, as the monk passed by, meaning “the Capuchins are good” in the local Yukpa language. Like most here, Ms. Pique had studied and worked at the mission. While most in the village admire him, Father Sandoval’s ceaseless, apocalyptic denunciations of Mr. Maduro — “Those who dedicate themselves to doing harm are evil,” he has said — have earned him some sharp criticism among local notables.  Some Yukpa chiefs resent his interference in what they see as Indigenous matters; others believe his politicization of the village’s problems damages their chances of obtaining public resources. Father Sandoval has denounced the plan of local Yukpa chiefs to appoint an overall head of the tribe as a government plot. He also accused some chiefs of pilfering subsidized food supplies and rustling cattle, earning him a moniker of “the Devil” among their supporters. “He gets involved in all the arguments,” said Lusbi Portillo, a Venezuelan anthropologist and veteran Indigenous activist. “The work this man does is ideological, political.” Spanish monks built the Tukuko mission in 1945 to convert the Yukpa people and establish the first peaceful contact with the smaller but more warlike Bari tribe deep in the mountains. The Bari had been fighting a losing war with Venezuelan ranchers, who paid a bounty for every dead tribesman. The mission’s founder dropped from a helicopter, amid a hail of arrows, on the main Bari village in 1960 to convince their chief to lay down the arms. In return, the friars lobbied the Venezuelan government to declare the Perijá Mountains an Indigenous reservation, protecting the Bari’s remaining lands and helping ensure their survival. Such stories of the friars’ jungle adventures helped inspire a young Father Sandoval to join the missionary life. He was born in the conservative ranching town of San José about an hour away from El Tukuko. His mother was a schoolteacher, his father an alcoholic handyman. Father Sandoval spent his youth caring for his grandfather while his father got drunk, an experience that he said introduced him to the bliss of humility. The violence provoked by his father’s drinking drove Father Sandoval toward the Catholic youth club organized by local friars. During the club’s field trips to the Perijá Mountains, he discovered the Tukuko mission, an imposing blue neocolonial building set amid deep green foothills, and decided to dedicate his life to its work. The mission now runs a school for 716 Indigenous children, providing them with nutritious daily lunches, a rarity in Venezuela’s impoverished education system. The nearby state school has just a few dozen students. About 30 students from remote communities or troubled households, including several orphans, live in the mission.  “He is like a second father to me,” said Marvillo Sevogira, a 23-year-old member of the Bari Indigenous group who is on course to become an engineer thanks to a college scholarship from Father Sandoval. Tukuko’s mission and its farmland are by far the biggest source of employment in the village, providing dozens of teachers, school aides and farm hands with an income. The mission has a stockpile of medicine received from the United Nations and from Caritas, a Catholic charity, in stark contrast with the empty shelves in the local clinic.  A nutrition program organized by Caritas with Father Sandoval’s support helped 105 children and pregnant women recover from malnutrition this year, according to the village’s Caritas organizer, Berta Moreno.  “He’s been a major help for everyone here,” said the village nurse, Audio Morran. When flash floods hit El Tukuko in October, Father Sandoval and Ms. Moreno handed out emergency kits to the affected families. The regional government had banned humanitarian agencies from participating in the relief, according to two aid workers who tried to deliver supplies, and officials have yet to inspect El Tukuko’s affected area. The office of the local governor, Omar Prieto, did not respond to a request for comment about its handling of the floods. For all his good works, parishioners say Father Sandoval’s know-it-all, paternalistic attitude can be grating.  At the mission, he chastised Mr. Morran, the village nurse with 27 years of experience, when he came to fill a prescription for a patient. “I doubt that this is the right combination, though I’m not a nurse or a doctor,” Father Sandoval said with a sniff. The retreat of Mr. Maduro’s Socialist government has brought Father Sandoval a new, more radical competitor for Yukpa’s hearts and minds. The collapse of law and order in Venezuela has led to the expansion of the National Liberation Army, a group of Colombian-based Marxist guerrillas, in the region. To garner Indigenous favor, the guerrillas, also known as the E.L.N., promised to redistribute private land and kick out the Church “parasites.” After several verbal spats, there is now a tense truce between the mission and the rebels, Father Sandoval said. “I inconvenience them, they are not my friends,” he said. “But they don’t touch me because they know I have the Indigenous support.” Despite his preaching to the villagers to live a moral life, Father Sandoval said he understands the dilemmas facing his parishioners in the economic crisis. Many of his students have dropped out of school to work the coca fields or cocaine laboratories in Colombia, where they make at least 20 times Venezuela’s minimum wage, according to interviews with four coca laborers in El Tukuko. “I can’t compete with the offer,” Father Sandoval said. “How can I tell a youth to go study, if they can make so much more scratching coca?” he said, using slang for harvesting cocaine’s raw material. While church attendance in El Tukuko is under pressure from evangelical groups and secularization, the local community remains deeply attached to Catholic symbols and celebrations. During the December visit, a farmer blasting Colombian accordion country music from a portable radio knelt by Father Sandoval, called Friar Nelson by everyone here, to ask for his blessing. A blind man asked for dinner at the mission. “It’s is thanks to them that we can read, write, go on studying after school,” said Mileidi Martínez, El Tukuko’s Yukpa chief, referring to the missionaries. “Friar Nelson works for the well-being of this community. This is his home.” Sheyla Urdaneta contributed reporting from Maracaibo, Venezuela.']","Venezuela’s government opposes the Rev.

"Venezuela’s Maduro Claims Control of National Assembly, Tightening Grip on Power",2020-01-05,By Julie Turkewitz,"['CARACAS — Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, moved on Sunday to consolidate his grip on power by taking control of the country’s last independent institution and sidelining the lawmaker who had staked a rival claim to the presidency. As Mr. Maduro’s security forces surrounded the National Assembly building, his supporters blocked the re-election of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the body’s head. That deprived Mr. Guaidó of the position that allowed him challenge to Mr. Maduro’s leadership. By the end of a chaotic day, Venezuela’s political turmoil had somehow found a way to worsen. The country already had two men who claim to be its rightful president and two rival legislatures. Now, one of the legislative bodies has two competing leaders. After Maduro backers elected their own man on Sunday to lead the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó’s supporters gathered at a newspaper’s headquarters, and in a dramatic roll call vote, re-elected him to the leadership position.  The political chaos comes at a time when Venezuela is facing economic collapse. Hunger is widespread, and millions have fled the country. By seizing control of the National Assembly, Mr. Maduro cemented his control over the country. But the move was immediately denounced by members of the Venezuelan opposition, who called it a “parliamentary coup d’état,” and by critics abroad.  “Maduro saw this as an opportunity to take over the only institution still widely regarded as legitimate,” said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue. “The international community will not recognize the new National Assembly.” A year ago, Mr. Guaidó declared himself head of a caretaker government, just two weeks after being elected head of the Assembly. Standing in the streets of Caracas with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Mr. Guaidó asserted that Mr. Maduro’s 2018 election was fraudulent.  Invoking an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant, he claimed the country’s leadership. That claim was quickly recognized by dozens of foreign governments, including the United States, which backed Mr. Guaidó effort to take power by imposing crippling sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government. To maintain his claim the interim presidency, Mr. Guaidó needed to be re-elected as head of the Assembly on Sunday, according to analysts inside and outside the country. His victory was expected, since the opposition controls the legislative body. But at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó and other supporters from entering the Assembly’s building. Video footage showed Mr. Guaidó attempting to climb over the spiked metal fence to gain entry to the building where the vote would be held.  Inside, Mr. Maduro’s party swore in as head of the Assembly a legislator named Luis Parra, a former member of the opposition who turned against Mr. Guaidó after the Assembly leader opened a corruption claim against him. There was no vote count. Mr. Parra then issued a statement calling for a “national reconciliation,” saying that his first goal was to put an end to confrontations “from those sectors that clearly wanted to destroy the Parliament today.” On national television on Sunday night, Mr. Maduro called the election of Mr. Parra “a rebellion from within the Assembly” and said “the country rejected and rejects Juan Guaidó.” The United States condemned the move.  Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Mr. Guaidó “remains Venezuela’s interim president under its Constitution.” He said that Sunday’s “phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum.” In recent weeks, the opposition and the United States government had accused Mr. Maduro of trying to block Mr. Guaidó’s re-election by bribing and harassing lawmakers. In December, Elliott Abrams, the United States special envoy to Venezuela, accused Mr. Maduro of trying to pay deputies up to $500,000 each to vote against Mr. Guaidó’s re-election. In an interview just days after Christmas, Mr. Guaidó, 36, insisted that he had the votes for re-election. But he acknowledged that Mr. Maduro was unpredictable and that anything could happen. “There is no manual,” he said, “for battling a dictatorship.” A year after Mr. Guaidó first stepped onto the national stage, garnering widespread support among Venezuelans, he appeared to be losing ground. Since February, his approval ratings had fallen about 20 points, to 42 percent, according to the Caracas polling firm Datanálisis. Venezuelans are struggling to deal with unmet expectations. And in Mr. Guaidó’s own assessment, he underestimated the government’s “ability to inflict harm” — meaning its willingness to threaten those who dissent. He cited the recent disappearance of one member of his party, Gilber Caro, who has not been seen since Dec. 20.  “The persecution is brutal,” he said. He also gravely underestimated Mr. Maduro’s hold on the armed forces, which are one of the pillars of his government, analysts said. In late April, in one of the most dramatic moments of the year, Mr. Guaidó gathered his supporters at an air base named La Carlota and called for mass military defections. It was, he said, the final stage of “Operation Liberty.” “The moment is now!” he said on Twitter. “Together we’re invincible!” But the troops failed to arrive. Mr. Maduro had spent years handing privileges and lucrative business connections to high-ranking officers to ensure their loyalty. The officers Mr. Guaidó sought to sway had everything to lose — and at best uncertain gains — if they switched sides. Manuel Cristopher Figuera, Mr. Maduro’s former head of intelligence and the highest-ranking official to defect last year, said in an interview said that two top officials who had pledged to support Mr. Maduro’s ouster ultimately reneged, helping seal Mr. Guaidó’s fate. While huge protests in the region have forced out the president of Bolivia and pushed leaders in Chile and Ecuador to respond to citizens’ demands, Venezuelans have mostly retreated from the streets. And President Trump, who once floated the possibility of a military intervention in Venezuela, has turned his attention elsewhere. “It’s not that the Maduro government is particularly strong, but it survived,” said Margarita López Maya, a longtime Venezuelan political scientist who lives in Caracas. “And this is victory for them: surviving.”  Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.']",It was the last political institution in opposition hands. Now President Nicolás Maduro’s has moved closer to total control of the state.
China Replaces Its Top Representative in Hong Kong With an Enforcer,2020-01-04,By Keith Bradsher,"['BEIJING — The Chinese government abruptly replaced its top representative in Hong Kong on Saturday evening, installing a senior Communist Party official with a record of difficult assignments in inland provinces that involved working closely with the security services. The top representative, Wang Zhimin, was replaced as the head of the powerful Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong by Luo Huining, the official Xinhua news service said. The move came two months after the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee called for measures to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong, although few details have been released. Mr. Wang became the first senior official to lose his job after seven months of often-violent protests in the city and a stinging rebuff to pro-Beijing political parties in local elections six weeks ago. He had devoted most of his career to Hong Kong issues and had worked closely for decades with the city’s business and political elite. But he attracted broad criticism in Hong Kong and Beijing alike for failing to anticipate the broad-based groundswell of hostility provoked by an extradition bill last spring. Mr. Wang then made no move to stop scheduled elections for neighborhood district councils in November, in the mistaken confidence that pro-Beijing candidates would maintain their longstanding dominance. Pro-democracy candidates captured 87 percent of the seats. “The massive defeat of the pro-establishment camp at the district council elections sealed his fate, but I think even before then, they had decided to remove him because he repeatedly failed to predict the mood of the city,” said Willy Lam, a specialist in Chinese factional politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Yet until Saturday, Beijing had at least publicly stood by Mr. Wang. When Reuters reported after the elections that he might be removed, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Hong Kong dismissed the report as “false news.” Mr. Wang’s successor, Mr. Luo, has served as the top official, Communist Party secretary, in two provinces. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has found in him a representative whose main qualification appears to be political loyalty and experience in tough security measures, but who has little familiarity with Hong Kong. From 2003 to 2016, Mr. Luo rose through the ranks in Qinghai Province, in western China, where Beijing has pursued increasingly stringent policies toward a large Tibetan minority. Mr. Luo became governor there in 2010 and then Communist Party secretary in 2013, according to his official biography. In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party’s senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct. Mr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China’s national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast. The Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty. Like other Chinese provincial leaders, Mr. Luo has had some dealings with Hong Kong, especially over investment and business. He held talks with his predecessor, Mr. Wang, at least once, leading a delegation from Shanxi Province to Hong Kong in late 2018. On that visit, Mr. Luo also met the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to discuss investment opportunities. But he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in Hong Kong. By contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017. When Mr. Luo stepped down as party chief in Shanxi, in November, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province’s “political ecology” and overhaul its economy, two tasks that Mr. Xi may also want him to take on in Hong Kong. Mr. Luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of Mr. Xi and other central leaders. Mr. Wang and Mr. Luo are among the roughly 200 members of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Central Committee, which gathers roughly once a year to discuss policy and review the performance of China’s political leadership. The extradition bill supported by Mr. Wang last spring would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the opaque and often-harsh justice system in mainland China. Mrs. Lam suspended legislative consideration of the bill in mid-June and her secretary of security, John Lee, formally withdrew it in October. There was no public indication on Saturday night of what, if any, role Mr. Wang might play in the future. Chris Buckley contributed reporting.

3 Americans Die in Shabab Attack on Kenyan Base,2020-01-05,By Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-Neff,"['WASHINGTON — A United States service member and two American military contractors died on Sunday in an attack on a Kenyan military base that the Pentagon said was carried out by the Islamic extremist group the Shabab. The attack at the military airstrip at Manda Bay, Kenya, early Sunday involved small-arms and other hostile fire, according to a statement by the military’s Africa Command. Fighters from the Shabab, an East African terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, fought their way onto the base before Kenyan and American troops drove them back. In the past several years, Manda Bay was used by Army Green Berets as an outstation where they both trained Kenyan Rangers — who had their own training center there — and supervised them as they crossed over the border into neighboring Somalia to fight the Shabab. But recently, the Green Berets were replaced with units from both the Navy SEALs and Marine Special Operations teams. According to military officials, the base has been problematic at best, with cross-border operations rarely going ahead as planned, prompting American officials to consider ending their use of parts of the base altogether. The deaths of the three Americans, whose identities were not made public pending notification of their families, were the first United States military-related deaths in Africa since an Army Special Forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Alex Conrad, died from wounds he received during a firefight with Shabab fighters in June 2018, at a small outpost near the town of Jamaame, Somalia, about 200 miles southwest of Mogadishu, the capital. The attack in Kenya comes about a week after an explosives-laden truck blew up at a busy intersection in Mogadishu, killing at least 79 people, the latest sign of resurgent militant activity in a country plagued by an enduring strain of violent extremism. Authorities believe that attack was also carried out by Shabab fighters. American military officials said they assessed that the attack in Kenya was not related to soaring tensions between the United States and Iran after an American drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, one of Iran’s top generals. In Kenya, about 200 American soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as about 100 Pentagon civilian employees and contractors, are helping train and assist Kenyan forces, who are battling local cells of the Shabab. American officials said that local Shabab fighters most likely carried out the attack on Sunday. The Africa Command’s statement said that six contractor-operated civilian aircraft were damaged, but The Associated Press, citing an internal Kenyan police report, said the damage was much more extensive, including two American helicopters and multiple American vehicles at the airstrip. An American official said five Shabab fighters were killed in the early-morning firefight. “We will pursue those responsible for this attack and al-Shabab, who seeks to harm Americans and U.S. interests,” Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the head of the Africa Command, said in the statement. “We remain committed to preventing al-Shabab from maintaining a safe haven to plan deadly attacks against the U.S. homeland, East African and international partners.” The Pentagon is weighing whether to sharply reduce or pull out several hundred American troops stationed in West Africa as the first phase of a global reshuffling of United States forces. But Defense Department officials said it was less likely that troops would be withdrawn from Somalia because — as the recent attacks by Shabab fighters gruesomely underscore — security in the country remains fraught. General Townsend is scheduled to testify to Congress later this month during annual hearings for each of the Pentagon’s worldwide commands. He is expected to face tough questioning from lawmakers about the Pentagon’s planning for the continent. The Pentagon carried out 63 drone strikes in Somalia last year — almost all against Shabab militants, with a few against a branch of the Islamic State. That compares with 47 strikes against the Shabab in 2018.']",A service member and two contractors became the first American military-related deaths in Africa since 2018.
Cries of ‘Revenge Is Coming’ at Funerals for Slain Commanders in Iraq,2020-01-04,"By Alissa J. Rubin, Ben Hubbard and Falih Hassan","['BAGHDAD — As Iraq held joint funeral services on Saturday for two revered military leaders killed in an American drone strike near the Baghdad airport this past week, tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched through Baghdad, waving flags and chanting that “revenge is coming” to the United States. The surprise killing on Friday of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the architect of Iran’s regional security strategy, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a powerful Iraqi militia commander and government official, threatened to shift fault lines across the Middle East. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed “forceful revenge” as the country mourned the death of General Suleimani, and calls have accelerated to eject the United States from Iraq. Across the region, fears are rising that the shadow war that had been building between the United States and Iran could suddenly escalate into a wide-ranging conflict. General Suleimani, 62, spent much of his life building Iran’s network of ties with militant groups across the Middle East, including in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  The extent of that network added to the uncertainty about how Iran might respond to his killing. If it chose to, Tehran could do so by relying on allied forces in any of those places to target American troops or allies such as Israel, Saudi Arabia or other Persian Gulf countries. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security updated its National Terrorism Advisory System to warn that Iran “is capable, at a minimum, of carrying out attacks with temporary disruptive effects against critical infrastructure in the United States.” The system’s bulletins, which are shared among law enforcement across the country, also reiterated that there was no current, specific, credible threat against the United States. Experts said it remained unclear how, when and even whether Iran would make good on its threats of vengeance. They noted that the country had to balance its need to show resolve against a staunch enemy and its reluctance to thrust itself into a full-scale war with the United States, a much stronger power. That led some scholars to suggest that Iran’s response could end up being underwhelming. “Technically, Iran could attack U.S. bases in Syria or in Iraq, but that would drive an even greater retaliation from the United States that I don’t think even Iran would wish to happen,” said Lina Khatib, the head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London-based research institute. “I may be in the minority here, but I think with this new development, despite Iran’s outlandish statements, ultimately Iran has been pushed into a corner,” she added. The funeral services were held against a backdrop of extreme regional tension as Iran and the United States signaled they could be on the brink of a potentially catastrophic war. Since the killings of General Suleimani and Mr. al-Muhandis, neither side has made another move — although both have made threats.  At the joint funerals, as close to a state ceremony in Iraq as any since the fall of Saddam Hussein, a key pillar of Iran’s regional reach was on display in Baghdad. Many of the mourners were members of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces, militias that came together to fight the Islamic State and that are now overseen by the Iraqi security forces.  The most powerful of those militias are affiliated with Iran; their fighters wore somber faces and black clothes as they marched, carrying the flags of their groups. They chanted: “The blood of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis will not be spilled in vain. Revenge is coming.” The loss of Mr. al-Muhandis was a profound one for the Iraqi fighters, who saw him not just as a militia leader close to Iran but also as someone who had helped rally the armed groups when they first formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State as it threatened to sweep toward Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. The militias have since been brought under the umbrella of the Iraqi security forces, and Mr. al-Muhandis was their deputy head. Many declared: “Our men do not fear America; each man dies on his day. Your voice, Abu Mahdi, remains the loudest one.” Iran can count on a range of assets in the region, including the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen and a range of fighting groups in Iraq and Syria that operate close to small contingents of American troops.  In recent months, Iran and its allies have struck oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and targeted tanker traffic in some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. A senior commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the gulf, saying that Iran would retaliate against Americans wherever they were within reach of the Islamic Republic. Gen. Gholamali Abuhamzeh, the commander of the Guards in the southern province of Kerman, said on Friday in comments reported by the Tasnim news agency on Saturday: “The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West, and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there.” He said Iran had long ago identified “vital American targets in the region,” and added, “Some 35 U.S. targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach.” His comments were echoed Saturday by Brig. Gen. Ismail Qaani, the newly appointed head of Iran’s Quds Force, who said Iran’s counterattack on American targets would have “a large geographic reach.”  Another warning was issued by Abu Ali al-Husseini, the special operations chief of Khataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia whose bases in Iraq and Syria the United States bombed a week ago. He said the Iraqi military should stay at least a half-mile away “from the American enemy bases” starting on Sunday evening. Any Iraqi military personnel who stayed with the Americans, he suggested, were acting as “human shields.” A number of Iraq’s Shiite militia leaders are expected to travel to Tehran on Sunday to meet with Quds Force commanders, according to several militia leaders.  While the killing of General Suleimani was a blow to factions aligned with Iran, his death was not mourned in other parts of the Middle East. Many others in the Arab world hated him for marshaling militias to help President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, expand Iran’s leverage in Iraq and boost the ability of Yemen’s Houthi rebels to inflict pain on Saudi Arabia. “He will kill no more,” read a front-page editorial in Saudi Arabia’s Arab News. “Let there be no tears shed for Qassim Suleimani; he must have known that he could not get away with these crimes forever, and that he would not die in his bed,” wrote Faisal Abbas, the newspaper’s editor. General Suleimani’s body arrived in Iran on Sunday for a funeral service. A large state service is expected in Tehran on Monday, and the general is expected to be buried in his hometown, Kerman, on Tuesday, Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported. Amid the tensions, the United States has called on its citizens to leave Iraq, shuttered its embassy in Baghdad, sent additional Marines and on Thursday deployed 700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division to the region. American contractors who train Iraqi troops have begun returning home.  After the strike, President Trump said the attack had been intended “to stop a war” and warned Iran that the United States military had already identified targets for further strikes “if Americans anywhere are threatened.” But critics have called the strike essentially a political assassination that could further destabilize the region.  On Saturday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in a telephone call with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, “The risky military action by the United States violates the fundamental norms of international relations and will worsen regional tensions and turmoil.”  “China urges the United States not to recklessly misuse armed force and to seek solutions to problems through dialogue,” Mr. Wang said, according to a summary of the call issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, also spoke with Mr. Zarif, telling him that “such actions by the United States grossly violate the norms of international law,” according to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. In a telephone call with France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Mr. Wang also indicated that China hoped to salvage the international agreement curtailing Iran’s nuclear capabilities. He told Mr. Le Drian that the deal was a hard-won “pillar for safeguarding the peace and stability of the Middle East,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported on its website. Among those attending the funeral on Saturday were Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq and a number of senior Shiite leaders, including Ammar al-Hakim; Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a former prime minister; Falih Al Fayad, the national security adviser; and Hadi al-Amiri, the leader of the Badr Organization, which is both a political party and has one of the largest and oldest militias.  Mr. Abdul Mahdi looked upset as he walked surrounded by security officers in a sea of militia fighters. As Iraq’s leader, he has been caught between Iran, its neighbor, and the United States as the two have ratcheted up their confrontations.  The latest round of violence started with a rocket attack a week ago that killed an American contractor working at an Iraqi military base in the north of the country. That was followed by an American attack on five Popular Mobilization militia bases in western Iraq and Syria that killed more than 24 people and set in motion the events that led to a nearly two-day siege of the United States Embassy in Baghdad.  After the funerals on Saturday, some mourners tried to again enter the Green Zone, which holds the seat of the Iraqi government and the embassies of the United States and other countries. But they were pushed back. Also on Saturday, rocket attacks occurred near bases in Baghdad and Balad that host coalition troops, according to the American military. No coalition troops were harmed, it said. In Iran, the news media flooded its broadcasts and front pages with coverage of General Suleimani’s death, and even news outlets perceived to be more moderate called for revenge.  When President Hassan Rouhani of Iran paid his condolences on Saturday during a visit to General Suleimani’s home, he, too, spoke of revenge — but with an open-ended timeline. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Mr. Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today, but for years to come.” “Retaliation is definite,” Gen. Mohammad Reza Naghdi, a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said on Iranian state television. “The U.S. should not waste time sending us messages, letters and liaisons.”  He said American officials had “mobilized everyone” to seek an intervention to avoid an Iranian retaliation. “If you weren’t man enough, why did you do it?” The killing of General Suleimani was likely to further fuel anti-Americanism in Iran, as well as empower the country’s hard-liners over those who called for diplomatic efforts with the United States, said Hamidreza Azizi, assistant professor of international relations at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran.  “This will erode the face of the moderate camp inside Iran, and it will even turn the moderates into hard-liners,” he said.

Airstrike That Killed Suleimani Also Killed Powerful Iraqi Militia Leader,2020-01-03,By Alan Yuhas,"['The American airstrike that killed a powerful Iranian general in Iraq on Friday also killed an Iraqi militia leader who was one of Iran’s top lieutenants in Iraq and a veteran of battles against the United States and the Islamic State. The death of the militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, alone would have sent shock waves through Iraq, even if Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the intelligence chief who led Iran’s Quds Force, had not died with him.  As the deputy commander of a loose coalition of militias, Mr. al-Muhandis oversaw a disparate military force that arose to help Iraq defeat the Islamic State but has since become a power unto itself, its members operating with significant independence, often at the behest of Iran. Mr. al-Muhandis was also a founder of the individual militia that was attacked by American airstrikes on Sunday and that led the assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad this week. He is still considered heroic by many Iraqis for his ability to corral Iraq’s bickering militias into an effective fighting force against the Islamic State. In the vacuum that followed Saddam Hussein’s fall, he created new networks to undermine the American occupation. And when Iran sought to embed itself in Iraqi life, it was Mr. al-Muhandis, fluent in Persian and close to General Suleimani, who served as its reliable right hand. Mr. al-Muhandis advised the general, and both men preferred to operate from the shadows, even as their exploits earned them fame at home and enemies in the West. Born Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, he was better known by his nom de guerre and gained his greatest prominence leading the mostly Shiite militias that formed to fight the Islamic State in 2014.  Mr. al-Muhandis kept close ties with Iran throughout his life, including during the campaign that made him most popular at home: As Iraqi militias fought against the Islamic State, or ISIS, he publicly thanked Iran and General Suleimani for their support.  Iraq’s military condemned the airstrike that killed Mr. al-Muhandis, saying in a tweet that it mourned him as a hero. Mr. al-Muhandis’s ties to Iran were well known. In 2009, he was identified as an adviser to General Suleimani by the United States Treasury Department, and accused of helping smuggle rockets, sniper rifles and other weapons from Iran to Iraq. American officials said he had also provided “logistical support for attacks” against coalition forces in Iraq and sent militia fighters to train in Iran. Long before the American invasion of Iraq, he was accused of playing a role in the bombings of the French and American Embassies in Kuwait, in 1983, and the later attempt to assassinate Kuwait’s emir. In 2007, a Kuwaiti court sentenced him to death in absentia. Much of Mr. al-Muhandis’s history remains murky, including his exact age: He would have been about 66 or 67 at the time of his death, according to the United States government, which has said he was born in 1953 in Basra, Iraq.  Mr. al-Muhandis fled Iraq with the rise of Saddam Hussein, who tried to crush the Islamic Dawa party, a Shiite group of which the future militia leader was a member.  Mr. al-Muhandis hoped to turn Iraq into a Shiite state similar to Iran after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. And he spent years in exile there, cultivating close ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, becoming fluent in Persian and keeping a home in Tehran. He and many other Shiite leaders returned to Iraq in the aftermath of the American invasion in 2003, and Mr. al-Muhandis briefly served in Iraq’s Parliament before dropping out of public view. He also helped found Kataib Hezbollah, a militia that targeted the United States during the Iraq war and was accused of training and equipping a network of anti-American groups. Kataib Hezbollah has continued to oppose the United States, and American officials blamed it for a rocket attack that killed an American contractor last week.  Kataib Hezbollah, which is separate from Hezbollah in Lebanon, denied responsibility for the attack.  After the attack, the United States launched airstrikes on five Kataib Hezbollah locations, killing at least 24 militia members. In response, pro-Iranian demonstrators, drawn largely from militias, swarmed the American Embassy compound in Baghdad, setting some outbuildings on fire. The demonstrating militia members dispersed a day later, on orders from militia leaders, just days before Americans launched the drone attacked that killed Mr. al-Muhandis. In a reflection of the chaos that has engulfed Iraq and the region, it was only five years after the Treasury Department put sanctions on Mr. al-Muhandis that he found himself effectively on the same side as the United States. The invasion of Iraq by the Islamic State from Syria gave his militia, Iran and the United States a common enemy.  Mr. al-Muhandis set about organizing mostly Shiite militias against ISIS, and the groups stepped in where Iraq’s military had collapsed and slowly wrested back territory. About 30 militias have been loosely organized under an umbrella group, called the Popular Mobilization Forces, or P.M.F., that is technically overseen by Iraq’s government. But neither the Iraqi military nor any single faction has the authority to bring all the militias into consistent line: Each militia answers to its different leaders, who do not always agree with each other. Many, but not all, have ties to Iran. The militias played a crucial role in demolishing ISIS’s self-declared caliphate, and Mr. al-Muhandis became “the most powerful single actor” among the militias, according to a November 2019 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The report described him as “in essence an Iranian agent.” After helping drive ISIS out of its territory in Iraq, many of the Iran-backed militias began trying to limit American activities in the country. Efforts by the current prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to curb the activities of Mr. al-Muhandis had failed, the report said.  American warnings to the Iraqi government about Mr. al-Muhandis went at least as far back as 2014, according to the The New Yorker. That year, the magazine said that Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador to Iraq, said that American officials told the prime minister at the time “that if Muhandis wanted to stay healthy he needed to stay in Iran.”']","Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a lifelong ally of Iran, was the Iraqi deputy commander of the group overseeing militias, and long at odds with the United States."
"Venezuela’s Maduro Claims Control of National Assembly, Tightening Grip on Power",2020-01-05,By Julie Turkewitz,"['CARACAS — Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, moved on Sunday to consolidate his grip on power by taking control of the country’s last independent institution and sidelining the lawmaker who had staked a rival claim to the presidency. As Mr. Maduro’s security forces surrounded the National Assembly building, his supporters blocked the re-election of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the body’s head. That deprived Mr. Guaidó of the position that allowed him challenge to Mr. Maduro’s leadership. By the end of a chaotic day, Venezuela’s political turmoil had somehow found a way to worsen. The country already had two men who claim to be its rightful president and two rival legislatures. Now, one of the legislative bodies has two competing leaders. After Maduro backers elected their own man on Sunday to lead the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó’s supporters gathered at a newspaper’s headquarters, and in a dramatic roll call vote, re-elected him to the leadership position.  The political chaos comes at a time when Venezuela is facing economic collapse. Hunger is widespread, and millions have fled the country. By seizing control of the National Assembly, Mr. Maduro cemented his control over the country. But the move was immediately denounced by members of the Venezuelan opposition, who called it a “parliamentary coup d’état,” and by critics abroad.  “Maduro saw this as an opportunity to take over the only institution still widely regarded as legitimate,” said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue. “The international community will not recognize the new National Assembly.” A year ago, Mr. Guaidó declared himself head of a caretaker government, just two weeks after being elected head of the Assembly. Standing in the streets of Caracas with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Mr. Guaidó asserted that Mr. Maduro’s 2018 election was fraudulent.  Invoking an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant, he claimed the country’s leadership. That claim was quickly recognized by dozens of foreign governments, including the United States, which backed Mr. Guaidó effort to take power by imposing crippling sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government. To maintain his claim the interim presidency, Mr. Guaidó needed to be re-elected as head of the Assembly on Sunday, according to analysts inside and outside the country. His victory was expected, since the opposition controls the legislative body. But at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó and other supporters from entering the Assembly’s building. Video footage showed Mr. Guaidó attempting to climb over the spiked metal fence to gain entry to the building where the vote would be held.  Inside, Mr. Maduro’s party swore in as head of the Assembly a legislator named Luis Parra, a former member of the opposition who turned against Mr. Guaidó after the Assembly leader opened a corruption claim against him. There was no vote count. Mr. Parra then issued a statement calling for a “national reconciliation,” saying that his first goal was to put an end to confrontations “from those sectors that clearly wanted to destroy the Parliament today.” On national television on Sunday night, Mr. Maduro called the election of Mr. Parra “a rebellion from within the Assembly” and said “the country rejected and rejects Juan Guaidó.” The United States condemned the move.  Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Mr. Guaidó “remains Venezuela’s interim president under its Constitution.” He said that Sunday’s “phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum.” In recent weeks, the opposition and the United States government had accused Mr. Maduro of trying to block Mr. Guaidó’s re-election by bribing and harassing lawmakers. In December, Elliott Abrams, the United States special envoy to Venezuela, accused Mr. Maduro of trying to pay deputies up to $500,000 each to vote against Mr. Guaidó’s re-election. In an interview just days after Christmas, Mr. Guaidó, 36, insisted that he had the votes for re-election. But he acknowledged that Mr. Maduro was unpredictable and that anything could happen. “There is no manual,” he said, “for battling a dictatorship.” A year after Mr. Guaidó first stepped onto the national stage, garnering widespread support among Venezuelans, he appeared to be losing ground. Since February, his approval ratings had fallen about 20 points, to 42 percent, according to the Caracas polling firm Datanálisis. Venezuelans are struggling to deal with unmet expectations. And in Mr. Guaidó’s own assessment, he underestimated the government’s “ability to inflict harm” — meaning its willingness to threaten those who dissent. He cited the recent disappearance of one member of his party, Gilber Caro, who has not been seen since Dec. 20.  “The persecution is brutal,” he said. He also gravely underestimated Mr. Maduro’s hold on the armed forces, which are one of the pillars of his government, analysts said. In late April, in one of the most dramatic moments of the year, Mr. Guaidó gathered his supporters at an air base named La Carlota and called for mass military defections. It was, he said, the final stage of “Operation Liberty.” “The moment is now!” he said on Twitter. “Together we’re invincible!” But the troops failed to arrive. Mr. Maduro had spent years handing privileges and lucrative business connections to high-ranking officers to ensure their loyalty. The officers Mr. Guaidó sought to sway had everything to lose — and at best uncertain gains — if they switched sides. Manuel Cristopher Figuera, Mr. Maduro’s former head of intelligence and the highest-ranking official to defect last year, said in an interview said that two top officials who had pledged to support Mr. Maduro’s ouster ultimately reneged, helping seal Mr. Guaidó’s fate. While huge protests in the region have forced out the president of Bolivia and pushed leaders in Chile and Ecuador to respond to citizens’ demands, Venezuelans have mostly retreated from the streets. And President Trump, who once floated the possibility of a military intervention in Venezuela, has turned his attention elsewhere. “It’s not that the Maduro government is particularly strong, but it survived,” said Margarita López Maya, a longtime Venezuelan political scientist who lives in Caracas. “And this is victory for them: surviving.”  Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.']",It was the last political institution in opposition hands. Now President Nicolás Maduro’s has moved closer to total control of the state.
Some NATO Troops Begin Leaving Iraq,2020-01-07,By Ron DePasquale,"['NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, in the aftermath of the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran in Baghdad.  The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced on Monday that the training had been temporarily suspended. For the security of NATO personnel, the organization said in a statement that it would be taking precautions — including “the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside Iraq.”  NATO, which has been running the training operation since 2018, will continue to maintain a presence in Iraq and remains committed to fighting international terrorism, an official said, while refusing to divulge details about troop movements. NATO, which has roughly 500 soldiers in Iraq, lifted some of them out of Baghdad’s Green Zone in helicopters Monday night.  General Suleimani was killed in an American drone strike at the Baghdad airport on Friday alongside a powerful Iraqi militia leader. Since then, Iran and its partners have stepped up calls for vengeance Iran attacked two American forces at two bases in Iraq early Wednesday, Iranian official news media and United States officials said. Some NATO countries, like Canada, Germany and Croatia, have announced that they are moving troops out of Iraq altogether, at least temporarily, because of security concerns.  Canada is moving some of its 500 military personnel temporarily to Kuwait, the country’s top military official, Gen. Jonathan Vance, said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Thirty of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq will be sent to Jordan and Kuwait, while others will remain positioned in the less volatile Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the German Defense and Foreign Ministries said in a joint letter to the German parliament, the Bundestag.  “When the training is able to resume, the military personnel can be reinstated,” the letter said. Croatia has moved seven of its contingent of 14 soldiers to Kuwait and sent the rest home, its Defense Ministry said. Slovakia has removed its seven soldiers. The Pentagon, for its part, has directed about 4,500 additional American troops to the region atop the roughly 50,000 already there. The new troops will act primarily as a defensive force, meant to reinforce American bases and compounds in the region and respond to a possible Iranian attack in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani.  A brigade of roughly 4,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division based out of Fort Bragg, N.C., has started deploying to Kuwait. The troops are part of the division’s global response force, kept on standby for particular emergencies. In Iraq and Syria, however, the American-led coalition halted its yearslong campaign against the Islamic State on Sunday, as United States forces braced for retaliation from Iran. About 5,200 troops in Iraq and several hundred in Syria are now focused on fortifying their outposts instead of pursuing remnants of the Islamic State and training local forces. Further complicating matters, Iraqi lawmakers voted Sunday to expel American forces from their country. The vote will not be final until it is signed by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, and it was unclear whether Iraq’s current caretaker government had the authority to end the relationship with the United States military. Although the vote in Parliament was 170-0, lawmakers were more divided on the issue of ousting American troops than that tally may suggest. Many of the 328 members of Parliament, primarily those representing the country’s ethnic Kurdish and Sunni Muslim minorities, did not attend the session and did not vote.']","The alliance, which has been training Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, said that it would begin removing some troops after the United States killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani."
"Iran ‘Concludes’ Attacks, Foreign Minister Says",2020-01-07,,"['Iran has “concluded” its attacks on American forces and does “not seek escalation or war,” the country’s foreign minister said in a tweet on Wednesday.  Moments later, President Trump said in a tweet that he would make a statement on Wednesday morning about the conflict, and suggested that  damages and casualties sustained by American forces were minimal. But he also said the assessment of the attacks was ongoing. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s tweet followed two missile attacks on bases in Iraq housing American forces in response to the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  “Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched,” Mr. Zarif said.  “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” he added.  Tensions between the United States and Iran came to a head in recent weeks when an American military contractor was killed, Iranian-backed militias stormed the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad on New Year’s Eve and General Suleimani was killed in an American drone strike last Friday. Iran swore vengeance for the general’s death leading to concerns of full-scale war in the region. On Tuesday, Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed. “All is well!,” President Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!”  Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, the Pentagon said Tuesday.  “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Asad and Erbil,” Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in a statement. There were no immediate reports of casualties. In a briefing in Washington, an official said that the Pentagon “had no confirmation” that any Americans had been killed.  Iranian officials said the attacks were the start of a promised retaliation for the killing of a top Revolutionary Guards commander. “The fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards has begun,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement on a Telegram channel. Iranian news media reported the attacks hours after the remains of the commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, were returned to his hometown in Iran for burial. Hossein Soleimani, the editor in chief of Mashregh, the main Revolutionary Guards news website, said that more than 30 ballistic missiles had been fired at the base at Asad, in Anbar Province, in western Iraq.  A base in Erbil, in northern Iraq, was also attacked. An Iranian Revolutionary Guards statement on state television said: “If America responds to these attacks there will be bigger attacks on the way. This is not a threat, it’s a warning.” Some Iranian officials tweeted images of Iranian flags in a pointed rejoinder to President Trump, who tweeted an American flag after General Suleimani was killed. In a statement, the White House said,  “The president has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.”  Throughout the day, reports from American intelligence agencies of an imminent attack from Iran had intensified, and senior officials said they were bracing for some kind of attack against American bases in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East. As tensions mounted, Mr. Trump’s top national security advisers met Tuesday afternoon in the White House Situation Room, where they were joined by the president after his meeting with the Greek prime minister. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was meeting with senior Democrats Tuesday evening in her Capitol office suite, discussing Mr. Trump’s impeachment, when she was handed a note about the Iranian attack. “We’ve got to pray,” she said, according to Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who was at the meeting. Ms. Pelosi said she was “closely monitoring the situation.” “We must ensure the safety of our service members, including ending needless provocations from the administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence,” she said in a tweet. “America & world cannot afford war.” Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman, said she returned a call shortly thereafter from Vice President Mike Pence, who briefed her on the strikes. Mr. Pence also briefed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. In December 2018, Mr. Trump visited American military forces at Al Asad. It was his first trip to troops stationed in a combat zone. The base at Asad is an Iraqi base that has long been a hub for American military operations in western Iraq. Danish troops have also been stationed there in recent years. In 2017, as the American-led coalition built up the base for its campaign against the Islamic State, roughly 500 American military and civilian personnel were located there. Some troops departed after the defeat of the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate in 2019, but the base maintains a robust presence of coalition troops. The American base in Erbil has been a Special Operations hub, home to hundreds of troops, logistics personnel, and intelligence specialists. Transport aircraft, gunships, and reconnaissance planes have used the airport as an anchor point for operations in both northern Iraq and deep into Syria.  Oil prices jumped and markets slumped in Asia early on Wednesday, as investors tried to parse reports of missile attacks on military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed. Prices for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, jumped above $70 a barrel in futures markets, a nearly 4 percent rise from Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the American oil price benchmark, jumped more than 3 percent to about $65 a barrel. Stock markets also dropped sharply. Shares in Japan opened 2.4 percent lower, while markets in Hong Kong and South Korea fell more than 1 percent on their opening. Investors were also predicting a tough day on Wall Street. Futures contracts representing bets on the American stock market indicated a drop of more than 1 percent in New York’s morning. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Tuesday that General Suleimani had been planning attacks to occur within days, laying out the administration’s legal justification for killing the Iranian commander in a drone strike. Americans officials have been pressed over their claims that they targeted General Suleimani to forestall imminent attacks against U.S. interests. At a Pentagon news conference Tuesday, Mr. Esper was asked whether attacks had been expected in days or weeks. “I think it’s more fair to say days,” the defense secretary said. He declined to offer more details, nor to describe the intelligence underpinning that assessment. Mr. Esper said General Suleimani, who was killed Friday in Iraq, “was in Baghdad to coordinate additional attacks.” “He’s been conducting terrorist activities against us and our coalition partners for over 20 years,” Mr. Esper said. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans, soldiers, on his hands and wounded thousands more. And then we could talk about all of the mayhem he’s caused against the Syrian people, the people of Lebanon. Even his own people in Iran.” He added: “To somehow suggest that he wasn’t a legitimate target, I think, is fanciful. He was clearly on the battlefield.” Mr. Esper also said that despite an unsigned draft letter from the American military command in Baghdad on troop withdrawal and a unanimous vote by the Iraqi Parliament, the United States does not plan to pull its troops out of Iraq right now. The Pentagon has made preparations in anticipation of Iranian retaliation, Mr. Esper said, and American troops in the Middle East are on a heightened state of alert. “I think we should expect that they will retaliate in some way, shape or form,” Mr. Esper told a news conference at the Pentagon. “We’re prepared for any contingency and then we’ll respond appropriately to whatever they do.” President Trump on Tuesday told reporters he would avoid targeting cultural sites in military attacks, walking back a threat he made against Iran days earlier. Following a bipartisan and international uproar, Mr. Trump conceded that striking such sites would amount to a war crime. “If that’s what the law is, I like to obey the law,” he said in the Oval Office as he hosted the visiting prime minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. His remarks to reporters came a day after Mark T. Esper, the secretary of defense, said striking Iranian cultural sites with no military value would be a war crime. That appeared to put him at odds with his boss.  “We will follow the laws of armed conflict,” the defense secretary said at a news briefing at the Pentagon on Monday when asked if cultural sites would be targeted. On Saturday, Mr. Trump declared that the United States had identified 52 potential targets in Iran, some “important to Iran & the Iranian culture.” None of them qualified as cultural sites, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified.  But the president’s threats and his initial refusal to back down in the face of criticism generated condemnation at home and abroad while deeply discomfiting American military leaders. NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, in the wake of the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.  On Monday, the NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced that training had been temporarily suspended. Describing security of NATO personnel, the organization said in a statement that it would be taking precautions — including “the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside Iraq.’’  NATO “maintains a presence in Iraq’’ and remains committed “to fighting international terrorism,” an official said, but refused to provide “operational details’’ about troop movements. NATO has had roughly 500 soldiers doing the training. Some NATO countries, like Canada, Germany and Croatia, have announced that they are moving troops out of Iraq altogether, at least temporarily, because of security concerns.  Canada is temporarily moving to Kuwait some of its 500 military personnel based in Iraq, the country’s top military official, Gen. Jonathan Vance, said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Thirty of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq will be sent to Jordan and Kuwait, while others will remain positioned in the less volatile Kurdistan region, the German defense and foreign ministries said in a joint letter to the German parliament, the Bundestag.  “When the training is able to resume, the military personnel can be reinstated,” the letter said. Croatia has also moved its small contingent of soldiers — 14 — from Iraq, with seven bound for Kuwait and the rest headed home, the Croatian Defense Ministry said. Slovakia has also removed its seven soldiers. Some NATO troops began leaving Baghdad’s Green Zone in helicopters Monday night. The NATO training mission began in 2018 at Iraq’s request. The killing of General Suleimani initially jolted oil markets, but the surge in prices has eased. On Tuesday afternoon, the Brent crude oil benchmark was down about 1.5 percent, to about $67.87 a barrel. Analysts attribute the modesty of the increase to market skepticism that Iran will seek to hobble oil trading by, for example, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel that many oil tankers have to pass through when they leave the Persian Gulf.  Oil flows have not been disrupted, so far, and the markets are “pricing in just a low probability of something happening,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, a research firm. Iranian state-run news outlets reported a deadly stampede during the funeral procession for General Suleimani in his hometown, Kerman, in southeastern Iran, on Tuesday.  Millions were reported to have flooded the town’s streets to witness the procession for the general, who was killed in an American drone strike in Baghdad last week. His death has fanned smoldering tensions between the United States and Iran, and fueled fears of a broader conflict.  The crowding and subsequent stampede in Kerman led to General Suleimani’s burial being postponed, state news media reported. He was buried around midnight, as Iran prepared to launch missile attacks against American forces in retaliation for his death, said Hossein Soleimani, the editor in chief of the main Revolutionary Guards news website. Photographs of the procession showed an elaborately decorated truck carrying General Suleimani’s coffin through streets packed densely with mourners, many wearing black and carrying pictures of the dead commander.  “Unfortunately, as a result of a stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the Iranian emergency medical services, told the news agency IRIB. Fifty-six people died and 213 were injured, the broadcaster IRIB reported on its website. Images and videos posted on social media showed the aftermath of the crush, with emergency workers and bystanders attempting to resuscitate people lying on the ground. The lifeless bodies of other victims, jackets covering their faces, could be seen nearby. The general’s body had been flown to Kerman after a funeral in Tehran on Monday that had brought even bigger crowds into the streets of the Iranian capital.  In a fiery speech made in General Suleimani’s hometown on Tuesday, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps vowed to “set ablaze” places where Americans and their allies live. “We will take revenge — a revenge that will be tough, strong, decisive and finishing and will make them regret,” the corps’s leader, Hossein Salami, said on Tuesday in a front of a crowd of mourners. “We will set ablaze the place they like, and they know where it is.” “Today, the seeds of hatred for the U.S. have been sown in the hearts of Muslims,” he added, according to Fars, an Iranian news agency associated with the Revolutionary Guards.  The pledge to seek vengeance echoed the rhetoric of many of the country’s leaders since General Suleimani’s killing on Friday. “Death to Israel,” the crowd chanted back, according to news reports. Israel, a close ally of the United States, has long been an enemy of Iran.  Thousands of mourners, dressed in black and carrying photos of General Suleimani, crowded the central square of Kerman, where the general’s body was taken for burial after a funeral procession on Monday in Tehran, the capital. Before arriving in Kerman, the general’s remains were taken to the holy city of Qom, where thousands of residents came out, hoping for a chance to touch the coffin of a man the state has declared a martyr.  On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept and offered prayers over General Suleimani’s coffin at the enormous state funeral. The ayatollah, Iran’s supreme leader, had a close relationship with the general, who was widely considered to be the country’s second-most powerful man.  General Suleimani’s successor swore revenge during Monday’s ceremony.  “God the almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger,” said Esmail Ghaani, the Iranian general who will succeed General Suleimani as head of the Quds Force, the foreign expeditionary arm of the Revolutionary Guards. “Certainly, actions will be taken,” he added. With the American role in the Middle East in flux, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew to Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday for a victory lap of sorts.  Highlighting Russia’s newfound influence in the region, Mr. Putin met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the strongman whose rule was largely rescued by Russian military intervention in Syria’s civil war.  Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Assad that “one can now confidently state that huge strides have been made in restoring Syrian statehood and the territorial integrity of the country,” a Kremlin statement said.  The Kremlin made no mention of Iran in its description of Mr. Putin’s visit, which had not been announced ahead of time. But Tehran was a crucial partner of Moscow in propping up Mr. al-Assad against Syrian rebels, including those backed by the United States.  Russia has called the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran illegal and expressed condolences to Tehran. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin is scheduled to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Istanbul, with Syria and Libya on the agenda, according to the Kremlin. President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke with the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, by phone on Tuesday afternoon to plead for calm and de-escalation.  Mr. Macron called on Iran to “refrain from any step that might aggravate the escalation already underway,” according to a statement from the Élysée Palace, the seat of the French presidency.  France has tried to play the role of mediator between the Iranians and Americans for months, but in vain. The French president also called on Iran to respect the 2015 nuclear accord, and to release two French academics, Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal, who are being held there, a major source of tension between the two countries.  Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said on Tuesday that he had been rejected for a visa to attend a Security Council meeting at the United Nations headquarters in New York, confirming reports from American news outlets that he would be barred. Mr. Zarif, in an interview with the Iranian news outlet Press TV, said that his office had requested a visa weeks ago to participate in the meeting on Thursday, rejecting claims by American officials that they had not had time to process the application. “The Americans are trying to create the impression that our request to attend the meeting was put forth following the assassination of General Suleimani,” Mr. Zarif said, according to the news outlet, adding, “The question everyone needs to be asking this lawbreaking administration is: What are they so scared of?” Mr. Zarif later posted on Twitter about the situation, taking aim at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Trump. During a Tuesday morning news conference, Mr. Pompeo was asked about the visa but said he would not comment specifically on visa matters. He added that the United States would “comply with our obligations” under United Nations rules.  Robert C. O’Brien, the American national security adviser, was asked on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning about the visa.  “I don’t think Secretary Pompeo thought that this was the right time for Mr. Zarif to come to the United States, and whenever he comes to New York, he spreads propaganda,” Mr. O’Brien said.   In August, the United States announced sanctions on Mr. Zarif, a seasoned diplomat who helped negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal.  Across the Middle East and the world, United States embassies warned Americans of potential attacks from Iran, as Iranian generals vowed to avenge the senior commander killed in an American drone strike. In Jerusalem, the embassy told Americans on Monday to watch out for “mortars and rocket fire.” A day earlier, the United States Mission in Saudi Arabia had warned citizens to be prepared for “missile and drone attacks.”  The security alerts follow the targeted killing on Friday of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leading figure in Iran’s foreign-facing intelligence and military operations.  At General Suleimani’s funeral in Tehran on Monday, military commanders promised vengeance. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told advisers that any retaliation against the United States should be direct, proportional and carried out openly by Iran. That is a startling departure for the Iranian leadership, which has typically cloaked its attacks behind the actions of proxies it has cultivated around the region. But in the fury generated by the killing of General Suleimani, a close ally and personal friend of the supreme leader, the ayatollah was apparently willing to cast aside those traditional cautions. Warnings to United State citizens were sent by American diplomats not only in the Middle East but also in Asia. The American Embassy in Beijing, citing “heightened tension in the Middle East,” advised American citizens on Tuesday to keep a low profile, be aware of their surroundings, stay alert in tourist locations, review personal security plans and ensure that their travel documents were updated and accessible. American citizens in South Korea said they had received similar warnings. American diplomats in the Middle East began sending advisories earlier in the week. American embassies across the region have been on heightened alert since Dec. 31, when militants, backed by the Iranian government, stormed the embassy in Baghdad. President Trump said the assault was organized by General Suleimani.  Last week, embassies in Baghdad and in Beirut, Lebanon, issued security alerts. Some airlines have halted flights to the Iraqi capital, including EgyptAir, which on Tuesday announced that its flights in and out of the city would stop from Wednesday through Friday. The Iranian Parliament on Tuesday passed a bill declaring the American military’s top leadership to be “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions, according to news reports in state media. The bill aimed at the Pentagon’s top brass mirrored a Trump administration policy implemented in April that imposed economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations, companies and individuals with ties to it.  That policy represented the first time an arm of a sovereign government had been designated a terrorist organization. The Defense Department said the killing of General Suleimani was justified in part because of the corps’s terrorist designation. General Suleimani led the Quds Force, a unit of the Revolutionary Guards that conducted intelligence-gathering and attacks outside Iran’s borders.  An official letter from the Defense Department informing Iraq that American troops were “repositioning forces” for “movement out of Iraq” produced headlines around the world saying that an American withdrawal had begun. But the letter, drafted by the United States military command in Baghdad, was sent out by mistake. The furor it caused prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to call an urgent news conference to deny the reports. “It was an honest mistake,” General Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.” Reporting was contributed by Megan Specia, Russell Goldman, Farnaz Fassihi, David D.

"Venezuela’s Maduro Claims Control of National Assembly, Consolidating Grip on Power",2020-01-05,By Julie Turkewitz,"['CARACAS — Lawmakers aligned with Venezuela’s repressive leader, Nicolás Maduro, began an attempt to consolidate his grip on the nation on Sunday by wresting control of the National Assembly, the last political institution still dominated by the opposition.  In a chaotic session in which security forces surrounded the National Assembly building, intimidating members of the opposition who tried to enter, supporters of Mr. Maduro blocked the re-election of Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, as the body’s head, and named another legislator instead. Members of the Venezuelan opposition immediately denounced the effort, calling it a “parliamentary coup d’état” and saying there had been no quorum to call the vote.  The Maduro administration’s plunges the country’s already turbulent political situation further into chaos, raising questions about who controls the assembly and whether Mr. Guaidó can continue to assert that he is the Venezuela’s interim president, in a direct challenge to Mr. Maduro.  Mr. Guaidó positioned himself as head of a caretaker government a year ago, just two weeks after being elected head of the assembly. Standing in the streets of Caracas with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Mr. Guaidó said then that Mr. Maduro’s 2018 election was fraudulent. Invoking an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the assembly if the presidency becomes vacant, he claimed the country’s leadership. That announcement last year was quickly recognized by dozens of foreign governments, including the United States, which backed him by imposing crippling sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government. To continue to claim the interim presidency, Mr. Guaidó needed to be re-elected as head of the assembly on Sunday, according to analysts in and outside the country. His victory was expected, as the opposition controls the legislative body, but at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó from entering the assembly’s white-walled building. Video footage showed Mr. Guaidó, surrounded by supporters, attempt to climb over the spiked metal fence to access the building where the vote would be held.  Inside, a member of Mr. Maduro’s party, Héctor Agüero, swore in the legislator Luis Parra as head of the assembly. There was no vote count. Mr. Parra is a former member of the opposition who turned against Mr. Guaidó after Mr. Guaidó opened a corruption claim against him. The United States immediately condemned the move.  On Twitter, Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said that Mr. Guaidó “remains Venezuela’s interim president under its constitution,” adding that Sunday’s “phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum.” In recent weeks, the opposition and the United States government accused Mr. Maduro of trying to block Mr. Guaidó’s re-election by bribing and harassing lawmakers. In December, Elliott Abrams, the United States special envoy to Venezuela, accused Mr. Maduro of trying to pay deputies up to $500,000 each to vote against Mr. Guaidó’s re-election. In an interview just days after Christmas, Mr. Guaidó, 36, insisted that he had the votes for re-election. But he acknowledged that Mr. Maduro was unpredictable and that anything could happen. “There is no manual,” he said, “for battling a dictatorship.” But Sunday’s election highlighted Mr. Guaidó’s embattled position: A year after he seemed poised to oust Mr. Maduro and bring relief to his once-wealthy nation, now facing economic collapse, he appears to be losing ground.  Mr. Guaidó coalition is in disarray, with dozens of his allies in exile, others in jail, and still others turning against him. Mr. Maduro’s grip on power is firm. And Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis is deepening, with millions in poverty, food shortages widespread and its citizens continuing to flee. Mr. Guaidó’s own assessment of the last year is that he underestimated the government’s “ability to inflict harm” — meaning its willingness to threaten those who dissent. He cited the recent disappearance of one member of his party, Gilber Caro, who has not been seen since Dec. 20. “The persecution is brutal,” he said. The enthusiasm with which many Venezuelans greeted him last year has ebbed. While huge protests in the region have forced out the president of Bolivia and pushed leaders in Chile and Ecuador to respond to citizens’ demands, Venezuelans have mostly retreated from the streets. And President Trump, who once floated the possibility of a military intervention in Venezuela, has turned his attention elsewhere. “It’s not that the Maduro government is particularly strong, but it survived,” said Margarita López Maya, a longtime Venezuelan political scientist who lives in Caracas. “And this is victory for them: surviving.”  Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.   ']","The National Assembly was the last political institution still in the opposition’s hands, and by seizing its leadership, President Nicolás Maduro’s supporters move closer to total control of the state."
The U.S. Seemed to Be Leaving Iraq. But It Was All an ‘Honest Mistake.’,2020-01-06,By Helene Cooper and Alissa J.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad. But the vote was not the final word on the subject and the Iraqi government had not formally notified the United States to leave. General Milley said that military officials had begun making arrangements for a withdrawal in the event that a decision was made to pull out, and that the letter was a draft being prepared in the event it was needed. Which it was not, at least not yet. “There’s been no decision made to leave Iraq, period,” Mr. Esper said. “There is no decision to leave, nor did we issue any plans to leave.” He said the military was “moving forces around” to consolidate their positions and that, not only were they not withdrawing, but at the moment more forces were arriving from Kuwait.

Rubin from Baghdad.']",A letter saying that the U.S. was “repositioning forces” for “movement out of Iraq” produced headlines around the world that a withdrawal had begun.
British Woman Who Accused Israelis of Rape in Cyprus Is Spared Prison,2020-01-07,By Lizzy Ioannidou and Iliana Magra,"['PARALIMNI, Cyprus — A British woman who was convicted last month of lying to the authorities in Cyprus when she accused a dozen Israelis of raping her in a resort town before retracting her statement will not serve any time in prison, after she was given a four-month suspended sentence on Tuesday. The woman, who said she had been pressured by the authorities to change her account, will now be allowed to return to Britain after a judge said that he was willing to give her “a second chance” in a case that has drawn international attention. The handling of her case and the guilty verdict have outraged rights groups — scores of people, including some who had traveled from Israel, protested outside the courthouse in a show of support — and her lawyers said they planned to appeal her conviction in an effort to clear her name. Dominic Raab, the British foreign minister, said that he had “very serious concerns” about her treatment in Cyprus, telling the BBC on Sunday, “I think she’s gone through a terrible ordeal.” The local news media in Cyprus reported last week that President Nicos Anastasiades had planned to pardon the woman, who has not been publicly identified, if she received a prison term, though the suspended sentence means that he will be spared from having to make such a decision. The woman, who was 19 when she made the accusation last July, had accused the Israelis, who were ages 15 to 18, of raping her in a hotel room in Ayia Napa, in southeastern Cyprus, in July. The police arrested the young men that month but later released them after the woman retracted the accusations. The judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, noting that the case drew international attention, said that he would spare the British woman from prison, citing her otherwise clean criminal record, her young age and the fact that she had spent six months in Cyprus, including one month in detention, after her arrest. “I am willing to give her a second chance,” he said. Still, he made clear that he regarded her actions as serious. “The offense of public mischief is a serious one, as it seeks to mislead the authorities and divert their attention away from the serious offense,” he told the court. The judge observed that the accusations had consequences for both the British woman, because she had not been able to attend university, and the accused Israelis, because it “restricted the freedom of 12 young men.”  The sentence was suspended for three years, meaning that the British woman could still go to prison if she committed another offense during that time frame, and she will have to pay 140 euros, about $156, to cover expenses for the state incurred during the trial. Her mother appeared pleased by the sentence — “we’re finally going home,” she told her daughter’s supporters after the hearing ended — but her lawyers said that the fight for justice was not over.  Lewis Power, one of the defense lawyers, said that the woman had been “stripped of her dignity and human rights” and that they would take their case to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. Nicoletta Charalambidou, another defense lawyer, said that because going through the justice system in Cyprus could take years, they would seek to expedite the process. The chief investigating officer in the case, Marios Christou, testified during her trial for public mischief that she had admitted reporting the episode because the young men “were recording her having sex” and “she felt insulted.” He also cited inconsistencies between her statement and video footage from the night in question.  The woman pleaded not guilty when her trial began in October, but she later testified that the police had pressured her into retracting her accusations, and the handling of the case by the authorities was condemned in Cyprus and Britain. Several women’s rights groups protested outside the Foreign Office and the Cypriot Embassy in London on Monday in support of the woman. They also urged Britain’s Foreign Office to “boycott Cyprus.”  Lucy and Verity Nevitt, the founders of the Gemini Project, a British nonprofit group that works to end sexual violence, called the woman’s treatment “inhumane.” “The message from Cypriot authorities is essentially ‘if you talk, we will silence you’,” they said in an email on Monday.  The woman’s legal team argued that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. They told the court during her trial that the police had pressured her to retract the accusations against the Israelis, although Mr. Christou, the investigating officer, testified that the police had not pressured her to change her stance. The case also raised questions in Israel over consensual sex and societal pressures on young men regarding their “manliness.” Although some in the country defended the accused in this case after they were released from police custody, many were upset to see celebrations greeting them at the airport on their return home.  More than 50 Israeli activists affiliated with the Association of Rape Crisis Centers, an Israeli nonprofit, traveled to Cyprus to show their support to the British woman, and demonstrated outside the courtroom on Tuesday while her sentence was being handed down.  Orit Sulitzeanu, the organization’s director, said in a statement from Cyprus that the court’s guilty verdict “testified to the deep lack of understanding of what sexual injury is.”  “I hope the young Israeli men will realize that they hurt the young woman badly,” she said, “even if they were not put on trial.” Lizzy Ioannidou reported from Paralimni, and Iliana Magra from London. Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

"Iran ‘Concludes’ Attacks, Foreign Minister Says",2020-01-07,,"['Iran has “concluded” its attacks on American forces and does “not seek escalation or war,” the country’s foreign minister said in a tweet on Wednesday.  Moments later, President Trump said in a tweet that he would make a statement on Wednesday morning about the conflict, and suggested that  damages and casualties sustained by American forces were minimal. But he also said the assessment of the attacks was ongoing. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s tweet followed two missile attacks on bases in Iraq housing American forces in response to the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  “Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched,” Mr. Zarif said.  “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” he added.  Tensions between the United States and Iran came to a head in recent weeks when an American military contractor was killed, Iranian-backed militias stormed the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad on New Year’s Eve and General Suleimani was killed in an American drone strike last Friday. Iran swore vengeance for the general’s death leading to concerns of full-scale war in the region. On Tuesday, Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed. “All is well!,” President Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!”  Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, the Pentagon said Tuesday.  “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Asad and Erbil,” Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in a statement. There were no immediate reports of casualties. In a briefing in Washington, an official said that the Pentagon “had no confirmation” that any Americans had been killed.  Iranian officials said the attacks were the start of a promised retaliation for the killing of a top Revolutionary Guards commander. “The fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards has begun,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement on a Telegram channel. Iranian news media reported the attacks hours after the remains of the commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, were returned to his hometown in Iran for burial. Hossein Soleimani, the editor in chief of Mashregh, the main Revolutionary Guards news website, said that more than 30 ballistic missiles had been fired at the base at Asad, in Anbar Province, in western Iraq.  A base in Erbil, in northern Iraq, was also attacked. An Iranian Revolutionary Guards statement on state television said: “If America responds to these attacks there will be bigger attacks on the way. This is not a threat, it’s a warning.” Some Iranian officials tweeted images of Iranian flags in a pointed rejoinder to President Trump, who tweeted an American flag after General Suleimani was killed. In a statement, the White House said,  “The president has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.”  Throughout the day, reports from American intelligence agencies of an imminent attack from Iran had intensified, and senior officials said they were bracing for some kind of attack against American bases in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East. As tensions mounted, Mr. Trump’s top national security advisers met Tuesday afternoon in the White House Situation Room, where they were joined by the president after his meeting with the Greek prime minister. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was meeting with senior Democrats Tuesday evening in her Capitol office suite, discussing Mr. Trump’s impeachment, when she was handed a note about the Iranian attack. “We’ve got to pray,” she said, according to Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who was at the meeting. Ms. Pelosi said she was “closely monitoring the situation.” “We must ensure the safety of our service members, including ending needless provocations from the administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence,” she said in a tweet. “America & world cannot afford war.” Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman, said she returned a call shortly thereafter from Vice President Mike Pence, who briefed her on the strikes. Mr. Pence also briefed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. In December 2018, Mr. Trump visited American military forces at Al Asad. It was his first trip to troops stationed in a combat zone. The base at Asad is an Iraqi base that has long been a hub for American military operations in western Iraq. Danish troops have also been stationed there in recent years. In 2017, as the American-led coalition built up the base for its campaign against the Islamic State, roughly 500 American military and civilian personnel were located there. Some troops departed after the defeat of the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate in 2019, but the base maintains a robust presence of coalition troops. The American base in Erbil has been a Special Operations hub, home to hundreds of troops, logistics personnel, and intelligence specialists. Transport aircraft, gunships, and reconnaissance planes have used the airport as an anchor point for operations in both northern Iraq and deep into Syria.  Oil prices jumped and markets slumped in Asia early on Wednesday, as investors tried to parse reports of missile attacks on military bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed. Prices for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, jumped above $70 a barrel in futures markets, a nearly 4 percent rise from Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the American oil price benchmark, jumped more than 3 percent to about $65 a barrel. Stock markets also dropped sharply. Shares in Japan opened 2.4 percent lower, while markets in Hong Kong and South Korea fell more than 1 percent on their opening. Investors were also predicting a tough day on Wall Street. Futures contracts representing bets on the American stock market indicated a drop of more than 1 percent in New York’s morning. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Tuesday that General Suleimani had been planning attacks to occur within days, laying out the administration’s legal justification for killing the Iranian commander in a drone strike. Americans officials have been pressed over their claims that they targeted General Suleimani to forestall imminent attacks against U.S. interests. At a Pentagon news conference Tuesday, Mr. Esper was asked whether attacks had been expected in days or weeks. “I think it’s more fair to say days,” the defense secretary said. He declined to offer more details, nor to describe the intelligence underpinning that assessment. Mr. Esper said General Suleimani, who was killed Friday in Iraq, “was in Baghdad to coordinate additional attacks.” “He’s been conducting terrorist activities against us and our coalition partners for over 20 years,” Mr. Esper said. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans, soldiers, on his hands and wounded thousands more. And then we could talk about all of the mayhem he’s caused against the Syrian people, the people of Lebanon. Even his own people in Iran.” He added: “To somehow suggest that he wasn’t a legitimate target, I think, is fanciful. He was clearly on the battlefield.” Mr. Esper also said that despite an unsigned draft letter from the American military command in Baghdad on troop withdrawal and a unanimous vote by the Iraqi Parliament, the United States does not plan to pull its troops out of Iraq right now. The Pentagon has made preparations in anticipation of Iranian retaliation, Mr. Esper said, and American troops in the Middle East are on a heightened state of alert. “I think we should expect that they will retaliate in some way, shape or form,” Mr. Esper told a news conference at the Pentagon. “We’re prepared for any contingency and then we’ll respond appropriately to whatever they do.” President Trump on Tuesday told reporters he would avoid targeting cultural sites in military attacks, walking back a threat he made against Iran days earlier. Following a bipartisan and international uproar, Mr. Trump conceded that striking such sites would amount to a war crime. “If that’s what the law is, I like to obey the law,” he said in the Oval Office as he hosted the visiting prime minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. His remarks to reporters came a day after Mark T. Esper, the secretary of defense, said striking Iranian cultural sites with no military value would be a war crime. That appeared to put him at odds with his boss.  “We will follow the laws of armed conflict,” the defense secretary said at a news briefing at the Pentagon on Monday when asked if cultural sites would be targeted. On Saturday, Mr. Trump declared that the United States had identified 52 potential targets in Iran, some “important to Iran & the Iranian culture.” None of them qualified as cultural sites, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified.  But the president’s threats and his initial refusal to back down in the face of criticism generated condemnation at home and abroad while deeply discomfiting American military leaders. NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, in the wake of the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.  On Monday, the NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced that training had been temporarily suspended. Describing security of NATO personnel, the organization said in a statement that it would be taking precautions — including “the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside Iraq.’’  NATO “maintains a presence in Iraq’’ and remains committed “to fighting international terrorism,” an official said, but refused to provide “operational details’’ about troop movements. NATO has had roughly 500 soldiers doing the training. Some NATO countries, like Canada, Germany and Croatia, have announced that they are moving troops out of Iraq altogether, at least temporarily, because of security concerns.  Canada is temporarily moving to Kuwait some of its 500 military personnel based in Iraq, the country’s top military official, Gen. Jonathan Vance, said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Thirty of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq will be sent to Jordan and Kuwait, while others will remain positioned in the less volatile Kurdistan region, the German defense and foreign ministries said in a joint letter to the German parliament, the Bundestag.  “When the training is able to resume, the military personnel can be reinstated,” the letter said. Croatia has also moved its small contingent of soldiers — 14 — from Iraq, with seven bound for Kuwait and the rest headed home, the Croatian Defense Ministry said. Slovakia has also removed its seven soldiers. Some NATO troops began leaving Baghdad’s Green Zone in helicopters Monday night. The NATO training mission began in 2018 at Iraq’s request. The killing of General Suleimani initially jolted oil markets, but the surge in prices has eased. On Tuesday afternoon, the Brent crude oil benchmark was down about 1.5 percent, to about $67.87 a barrel. Analysts attribute the modesty of the increase to market skepticism that Iran will seek to hobble oil trading by, for example, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel that many oil tankers have to pass through when they leave the Persian Gulf.  Oil flows have not been disrupted, so far, and the markets are “pricing in just a low probability of something happening,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, a research firm. Iranian state-run news outlets reported a deadly stampede during the funeral procession for General Suleimani in his hometown, Kerman, in southeastern Iran, on Tuesday.  Millions were reported to have flooded the town’s streets to witness the procession for the general, who was killed in an American drone strike in Baghdad last week. His death has fanned smoldering tensions between the United States and Iran, and fueled fears of a broader conflict.  The crowding and subsequent stampede in Kerman led to General Suleimani’s burial being postponed, state news media reported. He was buried around midnight, as Iran prepared to launch missile attacks against American forces in retaliation for his death, said Hossein Soleimani, the editor in chief of the main Revolutionary Guards news website. Photographs of the procession showed an elaborately decorated truck carrying General Suleimani’s coffin through streets packed densely with mourners, many wearing black and carrying pictures of the dead commander.  “Unfortunately, as a result of a stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the Iranian emergency medical services, told the news agency IRIB. Fifty-six people died and 213 were injured, the broadcaster IRIB reported on its website. Images and videos posted on social media showed the aftermath of the crush, with emergency workers and bystanders attempting to resuscitate people lying on the ground. The lifeless bodies of other victims, jackets covering their faces, could be seen nearby. The general’s body had been flown to Kerman after a funeral in Tehran on Monday that had brought even bigger crowds into the streets of the Iranian capital.  In a fiery speech made in General Suleimani’s hometown on Tuesday, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps vowed to “set ablaze” places where Americans and their allies live. “We will take revenge — a revenge that will be tough, strong, decisive and finishing and will make them regret,” the corps’s leader, Hossein Salami, said on Tuesday in a front of a crowd of mourners. “We will set ablaze the place they like, and they know where it is.” “Today, the seeds of hatred for the U.S. have been sown in the hearts of Muslims,” he added, according to Fars, an Iranian news agency associated with the Revolutionary Guards.  The pledge to seek vengeance echoed the rhetoric of many of the country’s leaders since General Suleimani’s killing on Friday. “Death to Israel,” the crowd chanted back, according to news reports. Israel, a close ally of the United States, has long been an enemy of Iran.  Thousands of mourners, dressed in black and carrying photos of General Suleimani, crowded the central square of Kerman, where the general’s body was taken for burial after a funeral procession on Monday in Tehran, the capital. Before arriving in Kerman, the general’s remains were taken to the holy city of Qom, where thousands of residents came out, hoping for a chance to touch the coffin of a man the state has declared a martyr.  On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept and offered prayers over General Suleimani’s coffin at the enormous state funeral. The ayatollah, Iran’s supreme leader, had a close relationship with the general, who was widely considered to be the country’s second-most powerful man.  General Suleimani’s successor swore revenge during Monday’s ceremony.  “God the almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger,” said Esmail Ghaani, the Iranian general who will succeed General Suleimani as head of the Quds Force, the foreign expeditionary arm of the Revolutionary Guards. “Certainly, actions will be taken,” he added. With the American role in the Middle East in flux, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew to Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday for a victory lap of sorts.  Highlighting Russia’s newfound influence in the region, Mr. Putin met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the strongman whose rule was largely rescued by Russian military intervention in Syria’s civil war.  Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Assad that “one can now confidently state that huge strides have been made in restoring Syrian statehood and the territorial integrity of the country,” a Kremlin statement said.  The Kremlin made no mention of Iran in its description of Mr. Putin’s visit, which had not been announced ahead of time. But Tehran was a crucial partner of Moscow in propping up Mr. al-Assad against Syrian rebels, including those backed by the United States.  Russia has called the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran illegal and expressed condolences to Tehran. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin is scheduled to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Istanbul, with Syria and Libya on the agenda, according to the Kremlin. President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke with the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, by phone on Tuesday afternoon to plead for calm and de-escalation.  Mr. Macron called on Iran to “refrain from any step that might aggravate the escalation already underway,” according to a statement from the Élysée Palace, the seat of the French presidency.  France has tried to play the role of mediator between the Iranians and Americans for months, but in vain. The French president also called on Iran to respect the 2015 nuclear accord, and to release two French academics, Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal, who are being held there, a major source of tension between the two countries.  Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said on Tuesday that he had been rejected for a visa to attend a Security Council meeting at the United Nations headquarters in New York, confirming reports from American news outlets that he would be barred. Mr. Zarif, in an interview with the Iranian news outlet Press TV, said that his office had requested a visa weeks ago to participate in the meeting on Thursday, rejecting claims by American officials that they had not had time to process the application. “The Americans are trying to create the impression that our request to attend the meeting was put forth following the assassination of General Suleimani,” Mr. Zarif said, according to the news outlet, adding, “The question everyone needs to be asking this lawbreaking administration is: What are they so scared of?” Mr. Zarif later posted on Twitter about the situation, taking aim at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Trump. During a Tuesday morning news conference, Mr. Pompeo was asked about the visa but said he would not comment specifically on visa matters. He added that the United States would “comply with our obligations” under United Nations rules.  Robert C. O’Brien, the American national security adviser, was asked on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning about the visa.  “I don’t think Secretary Pompeo thought that this was the right time for Mr. Zarif to come to the United States, and whenever he comes to New York, he spreads propaganda,” Mr. O’Brien said.   In August, the United States announced sanctions on Mr. Zarif, a seasoned diplomat who helped negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal.  Across the Middle East and the world, United States embassies warned Americans of potential attacks from Iran, as Iranian generals vowed to avenge the senior commander killed in an American drone strike. In Jerusalem, the embassy told Americans on Monday to watch out for “mortars and rocket fire.” A day earlier, the United States Mission in Saudi Arabia had warned citizens to be prepared for “missile and drone attacks.”  The security alerts follow the targeted killing on Friday of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leading figure in Iran’s foreign-facing intelligence and military operations.  At General Suleimani’s funeral in Tehran on Monday, military commanders promised vengeance. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told advisers that any retaliation against the United States should be direct, proportional and carried out openly by Iran. That is a startling departure for the Iranian leadership, which has typically cloaked its attacks behind the actions of proxies it has cultivated around the region. But in the fury generated by the killing of General Suleimani, a close ally and personal friend of the supreme leader, the ayatollah was apparently willing to cast aside those traditional cautions. Warnings to United State citizens were sent by American diplomats not only in the Middle East but also in Asia. The American Embassy in Beijing, citing “heightened tension in the Middle East,” advised American citizens on Tuesday to keep a low profile, be aware of their surroundings, stay alert in tourist locations, review personal security plans and ensure that their travel documents were updated and accessible. American citizens in South Korea said they had received similar warnings. American diplomats in the Middle East began sending advisories earlier in the week. American embassies across the region have been on heightened alert since Dec. 31, when militants, backed by the Iranian government, stormed the embassy in Baghdad. President Trump said the assault was organized by General Suleimani.  Last week, embassies in Baghdad and in Beirut, Lebanon, issued security alerts. Some airlines have halted flights to the Iraqi capital, including EgyptAir, which on Tuesday announced that its flights in and out of the city would stop from Wednesday through Friday. The Iranian Parliament on Tuesday passed a bill declaring the American military’s top leadership to be “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions, according to news reports in state media. The bill aimed at the Pentagon’s top brass mirrored a Trump administration policy implemented in April that imposed economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations, companies and individuals with ties to it.  That policy represented the first time an arm of a sovereign government had been designated a terrorist organization. The Defense Department said the killing of General Suleimani was justified in part because of the corps’s terrorist designation. General Suleimani led the Quds Force, a unit of the Revolutionary Guards that conducted intelligence-gathering and attacks outside Iran’s borders.  An official letter from the Defense Department informing Iraq that American troops were “repositioning forces” for “movement out of Iraq” produced headlines around the world saying that an American withdrawal had begun. But the letter, drafted by the United States military command in Baghdad, was sent out by mistake. The furor it caused prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to call an urgent news conference to deny the reports. “It was an honest mistake,” General Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.” Reporting was contributed by Megan Specia, Russell Goldman, Farnaz Fassihi, David D. Kirkpatrick, Melissa Eddy, Edward Wong, Lara Jakes, Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman, Alissa J.

Erdogan Announces First Turkish Troops Are Heading to Libya,2020-01-05,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey has started deploying troops to Libya, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday evening in a live television interview, keeping his promise to support the fragile government in Tripoli even as Western states have warned against escalating a conflict between the government and rebel forces. Turkish troops will be part of a combined training and fighting force to support the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj in Tripoli, which has been under attack for months by forces from eastern Libya. Mr. Erdogan told CNN that Turkish troops would set up an operations center headed by a lieutenant general and would focus on coordination and training. The first troops were already gradually heading out, he said, but the larger concentration of forces will follow later.  Mr. Erdogan’s comments came after the Turkish Parliament approved a resolution on Thursday to send troops to Libya. Last month Turkey signed an economic agreement with Tripoli, and Mr. al-Serraj’s government requested military assistance. Turkey has become increasingly embroiled in a proxy war as Gen. Khalifa Hifter — who controls much of eastern Libya and is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Russia — has sought to seize control of the whole country. In recent weeks, General Hifter’s forces have been buoyed by the arrival of Kremlin-backed Russian mercenaries armed with sophisticated drone-jamming technology. They have pushed farther into Tripoli, tightening their grip on the capital. In a sign of the worsening situation, at least 30 people were killed and 33 wounded, many of them military cadets, in a missile strike this weekend on a military academy in Tripoli.  It is not clear how large a force Turkey intends to send, but Turkish analysts have described a mixed air, land and naval force. Turkey has plans, they say, to establish a sea and land base, possibly in Misurata, and to train a Libyan national army.  Two naval frigates are already nearby in Algeria and a submarine is off Libya, a Turkish reporter and analyst, Mete Sohtaoglu, posted Saturday on Twitter. He said combat aircraft and commandos would also be deployed. Mr. Erdogan said the aim of the deployment, which he said would last for one year, was to help the Libyan government forces gain the upper hand. “It is to keep them on their feet and let them come out of it with victory and have their own land,” he said.  “The actual aim of this decision that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey has taken is to help secure a cease-fire, and help a return to the political process,” he added. He said the deployment was intended to help bring stability — “to prevent any development that would destabilize the region and cause humanitarian tragedies.” Mr. Erdogan seemed at pains to emphasize for his domestic audience that Turkish soldiers would not be doing the fighting, but would serve in training and coordinating operations. Other forces, he said, apparently referring to Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, would make up the combat units, he said.  Some Turkish-backed Syrian fighters have already arrived in Tripoli in recent days. ']",Turkish forces would deploy for a year to bolster the government in Tripoli and allow a return to the political process.
"Car Plows Into German Tourists in Italy, Killing 6 and Injuring 11",2020-01-05,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — A car plowed into a group of young German tourists as they crossed a road in northern Italy early on Sunday, killing six people and injuring 11 others, four seriously, Italian officials said. The driver, a 27-year-old man from the area, showed a blood-alcohol level nearly four times Italy’s legal limit, according to the prosecutor’s office in Bolzano, a city in the South Tyrol area of northern Italy. The man, identified by the police by his initials, SL, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter.  The victims were part of a group of youths, aged 20 to 25, who had booked a five-day vacation through a travel agency. Most were German, but officials said one of the injured was Italian.  The vacationers were returning from a night out at a pub and were hit while crossing a state road to reach their lodgings, said Arno Kompatscher, the region’s president. They had used a public shuttle service established in the region so that young people could go out and have fun but not drink and drive, he said. “These young people wanted to have a good time — and from one second to the next were ripped from life or badly injured,” Armin Laschet, the governor of North-Rhine Westphalia, the German state where many of the victims were from, said on Twitter. The crash occurred around 1:15 a.m. Sunday in the mountain village of Lutago, which is in the municipality of Valle Aurina in the South Tyrol region, near the Austrian border, according to a spokesman for the local military police. The Bolzano prosecutor’s office said it appeared the driver had been exceeding the speed limit of 50 kilometers per hour, or about 31 miles per hour. The accident site is close to a volunteer firefighter station, Mr. Kompatscher said, “so rescue teams reached the scene in just a few minutes.” He said about 160 rescuers had been involved. Six people died on impact, according to Lt. Col. Alessandro Coassin of the Bolzano carabinieri, the military police investigating the accident. He said four others had been transferred to hospitals in “very serious” condition. Two others were taken to a hospital in Innsbruck, Austria, and one each to hospitals in Bolzano and Brunico, Italy.  Seven others, including a local woman, were being treated at various hospitals for multiple injuries. “There were dozens of ambulances and rescue vehicles, including helicopters, on the scene,” he said. The Bolzano’s prosecutors office said that preliminary investigations had not clarified where the first pedestrian was hit, but that “immediately after the collision, the driver lost control of the car and crashed into debris on the right side of the road.” He was taken to a hospital for other tests and to allow him to access to a psychologist, Mr. Kompatscher said. The lieutenant said the man’s blood-alcohol level was “considerably higher than the legal limit.” Mr. Kompatscher said that the victims had been identified and that their families had been notified. A hotline was set up to provide information to the relatives. “Some relatives have already arrived, and others are expected to come by nightfall,” he said. One victim was identified as being from Cologne and another from the town of Remscheid, according to a police spokesman, the German press agency DPA reported. South Tyrol, or Alto Adige —\xa0a largely German-speaking autonomous region of northern Italy with ski resorts in the Dolomites mountain range and quaint villages around Bolzano — is popular with German tourists.  In 2017, the most recent year available, there were nearly 175,000 road accidents in Italy, resulting in 3,378 deaths, and 246,750 injured, according to the Italian statistics agency ISTAT. Of these, 600 were pedestrians. The accident occurred on the final long weekend of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays in Italy, which will be capped by Epiphany on Monday. “The year is starting with a tragic accident” involving six young victims, Mr. Kompatscher told RaiNews24, the Italian state news channel. “Our thoughts go to the victims, their families and friends,” he said.  In April last year, 29 German tourists were killed and 28 others injured when a bus plunged off a road on the Portuguese island of Madeira. The bus, which was carrying 56 people, rolled down a steep hillside after veering off the road on a bend east of the capital, Funchal, and struck at least one house, Portuguese officials said.  Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting from Berlin. ']","The victims had used a shuttle service set up to prevent drunken driving, but prosecutors said they were hit by a man with blood-alcohol levels far over the limit. "
Giving Birth Where the Family Is,2020-01-05,By Amber Bracken and Megan Specia,"['INUKJUAK, Quebec — The woman’s moans of pain mingled with the intermittent beeping of the fetal heartbeat monitor. Her midwife gently coached her in their mother tongue, Inuktitut, as the morning sun cast a cool light across the floor. Finally, a baby’s wail broke through. His shrill cry was a reminder of what Inuit midwives have reclaimed — the right of pregnant women to choose to give birth in their hometown after years of being pressured to travel south to have their babies.  As Canada tries to make amends for its brutal history of relations with its Indigenous population, midwives and other members of the community in Inukjuak, a town of around 1,800 people in a remote region of Quebec, point to the clinic as an example of a way forward. Today around three out of four pregnant women in the town give birth in its clinic, attended to by Inuit midwives.  “I feel relieved to be able to give birth at home, where my family is,” said the new mother, Susie Mina.  Reconciling with Indigenous populations is one of the most pressing issues facing Canada these days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called it a priority of his government. History curriculums have been revamped in schools; public meetings routinely begin with a recognition of the Indigenous lands they are held on; and buildings have been renamed. To many here, the Inukjuak clinic is a tangible example of what is possible. For countless generations, the Inuit of the Nunavik region in northern Quebec lived as nomads, traveling across the wind-battered landscape to follow the herds they hunted seasonally. But in the 1950s, the Canadian government pressured families to settle in permanent communities. The move fit squarely into the pattern of how Canada treated its Indigenous people, including forcibly separating Indigenous children from their families and sending them often great distances to residential schools that stripped them of their language and cultural identity. In many remote Inuit areas, the government’s national health service also began pressuring pregnant women to travel hundreds of miles south to give birth in hospitals. Inukjuak women were sent to Montreal or Moose Factory, Ontario, rather than relying on the local midwives who had traditionally provided care.  The stated reason for the practice, which began in the early 1970s, was to improve birth survival rates and reduce complications in far-flung communities with no hospitals and limited prenatal care. But for many Indigenous women, the policy turned pregnancy into an illness, and deprived them of care by traditional methods. Many also found the experience of being sent from home isolating, and sometimes traumatizing. Because they left their communities well before their due dates, they spent weeks away from their families to give birth in unfamiliar surroundings, tended by doctors and nurses who didn’t speak their first language.  In 1986, local elders who wanted to bring birth back to Nunavik persuaded a hospital in the region to begin a training program to certify Inuit women as midwives.  Eventually, three maternity clinics led by Inuit women were set up in villages on the Hudson Bay coast. In 1996, one of these clinics opened in Inukjuak, which is now a cluster of a few hundred homes, three stores, a post office and a few other buildings connected by gravel roads. It is nestled against the windswept shore of the bay, accessible to the outside world for much of the year only by an airport with a single runway. Everyone in Inukjuak knows everyone else.  In the winter, the rocky rolling hills are buried by snow. They come alive in the summer, covered by green for a few precious weeks as the daylight stretches well into the night. “It keeps coming back,” the mayor of Inukjuak, Simeonie Nalukturuk, said of the grass, wildflowers and the berries that seem to disappear for good in the winter.  The return of giving birth in Inukjuak brought its own kind of renewal, the mayor said. Before the evacuations, newborns were celebrated and greeted by every community member. After, that tradition suddenly stopped. “There was nothing to celebrate,” he said. “I think we even forgot how to celebrate the birth of our little brothers and sisters.” Now, to signal each new arrival, the maternity clinic flicks on the strand of Christmas lights hanging from its window frame. The names of the new babies, often ones that honor deceased relatives, are announced on the radio. Brenda Epoo, 49, a midwife at clinic, said the former practice of evacuating every woman was damaging. “Telling them every pregnancy is dangerous and sending them somewhere else — to the hospital where they don’t know their customs, their culture, their way of life — it’s not right,” she said. “It’s not a disease, it’s life.” Over the years, she has delivered hundreds of newborns. Some are the children of babies she also delivered.  The clinic has five midwives and three student trainees, who assess and monitor the women throughout their pregnancies and after birth. The midwives are trained to provide emergency medical interventions, though performing cesarean sections and giving epidurals are outside their skill set. Only expectant mothers deemed high risk are transferred south, with their consent, to a hospital. Across Nunavik, almost 200 babies are delivered by midwives each year, about 40 to 50 a year in Inukjuak alone. During the years of the evacuation policy, the mortality rate during and directly after birth was high for the babies of women in the Nunavik region, in part because of the limited prenatal services.  According to a study from McGill University, during the final years of the policy, the mortality rate was three times higher than it was for the same time period in Montreal.  Since the midwifery program began, that rate has dropped significantly. The latest figures from 2000-15 show that the combined fetal and neonatal mortality rate in the Nunavik villages was 7.7 per 1,000 births compared with 5.8 for Canada in total. But it’s not all about numbers.  Most of the 13,000 people who live in Nunavik speak Inuktitut as their first language. Now, it’s also the first language their newborns will hear. Susie Mina, the new mother, gave birth to her first son in Montreal because her pregnancy was deemed high risk. Her later pregnancies, attended by the midwives in Inukjuak, were very different.  “I felt more comfortable giving birth here because I didn’t have to speak English,” she said. Her midwives, she said, also understood how she felt without her having to utter a word because of their shared cultural touchstones. The simple raise of an eyebrow or the wrinkle of a nose could take the place of words. After she gave birth, Ms. Mina handed the baby to her mother, Lilly, who delivered all of her own children, including Susie, in the south. “I am so grateful that they can be born here,” said Lilly Mina. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she clutched her new grandson to her chest. When Megan Epoo, the niece of the midwife Brenda Epoo, became pregnant, her aunt served as her midwife, and, along with other women in her family, guided her through her pregnancy. Her daughter, Hailey, is now 9. On a recent day, she and a friend skipped rocks in tide pools outside a canvas tent on the land the family has camped on for generations.  First-time mothers here are often young, Megan Epoo said, and having their own mothers, aunts and sisters there for their labor is vital.  “She knows what I’ve been through, she knows my entire life,” Ms. Epoo said of her aunt. “Her advice has meaning to me.”  Ms. Epoo said being able to give birth in Nunavik was particularly significant to her because the policy of pressuring women to travel south to have their babies was part of the overall history of the treatment of Indigenous groups, which has brought generational trauma to the community.  Levels of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and death by accident are higher here than the national average. The life expectancy in Nunavik is far below the rest of Quebec and the suicide rate is troublingly high.  “I hurt when I think about it too much,” Ms. Epoo said. But, she added, “Having the privilege to give birth here is like beating the system.”']",

Mogadishu Bombing Took the Lives of the ‘Best and the Brightest’,2020-01-06,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['MOGADISHU, Somalia — They were the kind of bright, young people Somalia hoped to build its future around: hard-working university students in health sciences, in a battered country with a critical shortage of health workers. Amran Kasim Ahmed, 22, was at the top of her class and nurtured dreams of revamping Somalia’s threadbare health care system.  Abshir Mohamed Abukar, 23, was the only one of seven siblings to finish high school and attend university.  But their aspirations ended abruptly on Dec. 28, when an explosive-laden truck detonated at a busy intersection here in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital. The terrorist group Al Shabab claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed 82 people, including Ms. Ahmed and Mr. Abukar, and injured nearly 150 others, according to the government. Even in the face of increasing American airstrikes and defections, the Shabab, a militant Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda, has grown powerful in recent years, expanding its bomb-making operations and carrying out a string of daring attacks across East Africa. On Sunday, it killed a United States service member and two American military contractors in an attack on a Kenyan military base in Manda Bay, on the Indian Ocean coast.  For almost a decade now, a sense of optimism has taken hold in Somalia after a generation of chaos. A central government backed by the United Nations took hold, new businesses like swanky coffee stores opened and a budding tech scene rose despite the odds. Yet the progress has proved fragile, as the Shabab has continued to get stronger and flex its military might in recent years. The group’s relentless onslaught on both civilian and government establishments in Mogadishu has killed lawmakers, civil servants, business people, journalists and, last July, the mayor of Mogadishu, Abdirahman Omar Osman.  In the Dec. 28 attack, 16 of the dead and 18 others who were critically injured were students at Benadir University — most of them young women studying sciences in a country where precious few women have access to higher education. “We are losing the best and the brightest,” said Sahra Mire Mohamed, a lecturer at Benadir. The loss of so much promise, she said, is “a huge tragedy.” When she learned that Ms. Ahmed was among the victims, Ms. Mohamed said she went to the hospital and asked to view the body — to see for herself that one of her favorite and most promising students was really gone.  Mr. Abukar’s family hoped he would one day improve their meager earnings and help relocate them from the three-room metal shack they called home. “He was the best hope this family had,” said his father, Mohamed Abukar. “But Allah gave him to us first and he took him again.” All that remains to them is a table full of notebooks filled with his cursive handwriting and certificates celebrating his achievements. “We know that we will die one day, but you never want to believe your own child will be killed in an explosion,” the elder Mr. Abukar said. It was a week before midsemester exams began, and the students were anxious to reach campus to begin preparing. Traveling in two minibuses during the morning rush hour, they were passing through a busy intersection known as the Ex-Control Junction when the blast ripped through the traffic, blowing out a wall of a police station and tax collection center. Pieces of the victims’ bodies and blown-up textbooks mixed with the sand, stone and scraps of metal strewn around the intersection. The attack, the worst in Somalia in more than two years, left countless families, friends and colleagues struggling to comprehend how so much could be lost so senselessly — yet again. Somalia has been at war for nearly three decades, wracked first by combat among clan warlords and then by violent extremism. For most of that time, it effectively had no central government, followed by a government with a tenuous hold and limited power. To bolster security and prevent attacks, the authorities have resorted to barricading or entirely closing major roads in Mogadishu. Yet the deadly violence in the city has continued unabated, quashing the spirit of the long-suffering people and leaving them to wonder who will fall victim next. The Benadir University students who were killed and maimed at the Ex Control intersection were heading to the Dr. Shahid Campus on the outskirts of the city. The campus was named after a Somali doctor and scholar, Mohamed Adam Warsame, popularly known as Shahid, who was among the university’s founders in 2002. In December 2009, Dr. Warsame was among 25 people killed when a Shabab suicide bomber targeted a Benadir graduation. The doctor’s son Duale, who survived that day, was killed in a terrorist attack on a major hotel in Mogadishu in 2016. “It’s a recurrent tragedy,” said another son of Dr. Warsame, Rage, who is now Benadir’s dean of students. Reflecting on the past and present losses, he said that there was no option but to “be patient, work hard, and produce the next cadre of doctors and leaders.” Yet his optimism belies the growing frustration with the authorities, who many Somalis say haven’t done enough to learn from the past or improve emergency preparedness and response. The government has come under particular scrutiny recently, as floods have killed dozens of people and a locust plague has ravished crops and grazing land. With a fleet of 15 vehicles, Aamin Ambulance is the only free ambulance service attending to Mogadishu’s more than 2 million people. Yet its founder, Abdulkadir Adan, said two of its new ambulances have been stuck at Mogadishu’s port for six months because of red tape. “We’ve reached out to the local government numerous times, but nothing has happened,” Mr. Adan said. “In a city that suffers regular bomb attacks, and has many medical emergencies, we need to have all the ambulances we can.” Abdihakim Ainte has spearheaded multiple civilian efforts to help casualties and their families. It was important not to be numbed by the disasters, he said — to recall each victim as a real person, and honor the meaning and context of their lives. “We have to say: ‘Enough is enough. If you kill another student, you kill all of us,’” said Mr. Ainte, who is now working on a campaign to commemorate the Benadir students. “We can’t have the same tragedy happening to students from the same university after a decade. We can’t remain silent.” At the scene of the attack, amid the rubble and the mangled frame of a vehicle, a police officer echoed Mr. Ainte’s concerns. “I have lost so many officers fighting the terrorists, but no one remembers them,” he said. “Everyone just moves on.” For Benadir students who lost their classmates, however, carrying on as usual will be hard. A week after the attack, Salma Ali Hashi says she still cannot believe that she won’t share jokes with Ms. Ahmed on the daily commute. “We were two people united by education,” Ms. Hashi said. “I still cannot believe she’s dead.”']","Despite a growing sense of stability and optimism after decades of chaos and violence, Somalia has been unable to curb the threat posed by the terrorist group Al Shabab."
Britain’s ‘Most Prolific Rapist’ Is Jailed for Life,2020-01-06,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — A man convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting 48 young men in Manchester, and videotaping and cataloging the rapes, was sentenced on Monday to life in prison, closing a series of trials against a man whom prosecutors called “the most prolific rapist ever tried in a British court.” The man, Reynhard Sinaga, 36, was found guilty of carrying out a two-and-a-half year campaign in which he approached scores of drunk young men outside Manchester clubs and lured them back to his nearby apartment under the guise of giving them a place to sleep or recharge their phones. Instead, he gave them drinks spiked with sedatives, prosecutors said, before poking their belly buttons to make sure they were unconscious and then raping them, sometimes for hours. Apart from victims noticing that they had particularly bad hangovers the next morning, Mr. Sinaga committed the rapes without anyone noticing until a June morning in 2017 when an 18-year-old man woke up in the middle of being assaulted.  The man beat up Mr. Sinaga and escaped with his attacker’s white iPhone. On Mr. Sinaga’s digital devices, investigators said they eventually found huge volumes of photos and videos of his assaults, sometimes cataloged alongside pictures of a victim’s ID card. In most cases, prosecutors said, the victims did not know exactly what had happened to them until getting a visit from the police. Investigators found evidence of Mr. Sinaga assaulting more than 190 victims in all, they said. Detectives have so far failed to identify 70 victims and are still looking to speak to them. On Monday, at the end of Mr. Sinaga’s fourth trial, the courts lifted a media blackout that had previously kept his name from being publicly reported. Mr. Sinaga was already serving a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years before parole after being convicted in his earlier trials, which began in 2018. He was sentenced on Monday to life in prison and had his minimum term increased to 30 years.  Mr. Sinaga insisted on taking the case to trial and argued in court that the victims were only pretending to be asleep as part of a sexual role play. He accused the victims of being closeted gay men lying about the assaults, according to British news accounts of the trial. Each of Mr. Sinaga’s four trials dealt with between 10 and 13 victims. In all, he was found guilty of 159 offenses, including 136 anal rapes. “He would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught,” Ian Rushton, a deputy chief crown prosecutor for the northwest of England, said in a statement. He said Mr. Sinaga “appears to have derived further twisted pleasure from rewatching his films in court and putting victims through the trauma of giving evidence.” Born and raised in Indonesia, Mr. Sinaga came to Britain in 2007 on a student visa. He studied for a master’s degree at Manchester University in sociology, and then began studying for a doctorate in human geography in 2012 at Leeds University. Living off money given to him by his father, a banker in Indonesia, Mr. Sinaga fashioned a life of nights out and holidays that looked extravagant to his friends, according to British news accounts of trial testimony. He was openly gay, and he attended gay clubs in Manchester and used gay hookup apps, Mr. Sinaga testified. Mr. Sinaga’s friends’ only hint of his nighttime campaign was the way he boasted of making heterosexual men realize their gay fantasies. “He was straight in 2014,” he texted one friend of a victim, prosecutors said. “2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha.” In another text, he said, “Take a sip of my secret poison, I’ll make you fall in love.” But in secret, Mr. Sinaga collected the evidence that ultimately proved prosecutors’ case against him. He kept some men’s belongings as trophies, prosecutors said. He stored films of the assaults on two cellphones. He looked his victims up on Facebook afterward and tried to add them as friends. And some agreed. One was so oblivious about what had happened that he returned with his girlfriend to Mr. Sinaga’s apartment the next day, trying to prove to her that he had only been recovering from a night out and not sleeping with another woman, British news reports said. For the most part, prosecutors said, Mr. Sinaga stuck to a consistent pattern in his attacks. After midnight, he lingered outside clubs, waiting for mainly heterosexual young men who had been separated from their friends or kicked out by bouncers. Preying on their various needs — their phone batteries had died, or they had run out of money for a taxi home, or they were sick from drinking — Mr. Sinaga convinced them to follow him home, where he said they could sleep on the floor or have a few more drinks. Once there, investigators believe Mr. Sinaga was probably drugging his victims with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, which is sometimes used recreationally as a club drug. At his hearing in Manchester Crown Court on Monday, Judge Suzanne Goddard said she had considered sentencing Mr. Sinaga to a life term without the possibility of parole — an unprecedented punishment for a crime other than murder — before settling on the 30-year minimum term, British news reports said. “In my judgment you are a highly dangerous, cunning and deceitful individual who will never be safe to be released,” the judge said, “but that is a matter for the Parole Board.”']",Reynhard Sinaga had been found guilty of drugging and raping 48  men in Manchester. Detectives have so far failed to identify 70 victims and are still looking to speak to them.
Mogadishu Bombing Took the Lives of the ‘Best and the Brightest’,2020-01-06,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['MOGADISHU, Somalia — They were the kind of bright, young people Somalia hoped to build its future around: hard-working university students in health sciences, in a battered country with a critical shortage of health workers. Amran Kasim Ahmed, 22, was at the top of her class and nurtured dreams of revamping Somalia’s threadbare health care system.  Abshir Mohamed Abukar, 23, was the only one of seven siblings to finish high school and attend university.  But their aspirations ended abruptly on Dec. 28, when an explosive-laden truck detonated at a busy intersection here in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital. The terrorist group Al Shabab claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed 82 people, including Ms. Ahmed and Mr. Abukar, and injured nearly 150 others, according to the government. Even in the face of increasing American airstrikes and defections, the Shabab, a militant Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda, has grown powerful in recent years, expanding its bomb-making operations and carrying out a string of daring attacks across East Africa. On Sunday, it killed a United States service member and two American military contractors in an attack on a Kenyan military base in Manda Bay, on the Indian Ocean coast.  For almost a decade now, a sense of optimism has taken hold in Somalia after a generation of chaos. A central government backed by the United Nations took hold, new businesses like swanky coffee stores opened and a budding tech scene rose despite the odds. Yet the progress has proved fragile, as the Shabab has continued to get stronger and flex its military might in recent years. The group’s relentless onslaught on both civilian and government establishments in Mogadishu has killed lawmakers, civil servants, business people, journalists and, last July, the mayor of Mogadishu, Abdirahman Omar Osman.  In the Dec. 28 attack, 16 of the dead and 18 others who were critically injured were students at Benadir University — most of them young women studying sciences in a country where precious few women have access to higher education. “We are losing the best and the brightest,” said Sahra Mire Mohamed, a lecturer at Benadir.

Masked Men Attack Students in Rampage at University in New Delhi,2020-01-06,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — Dozens of masked men in New Delhi stormed one of India’s most prestigious universities on Sunday, attacking students and professors with rods and bricks, vandalizing dormitories and injuring at least 42 people, some of them seriously, officials said.  Some students accused the police of complicity, and videos posted on social media appeared to show officers standing by as students were beaten in front of them. The attack, which was described by students and witnesses and recorded in videos posted on social media, happened at Jawaharlal Nehru University, a leafy campus in New Delhi. Students at the university said the attackers belonged to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a Hindu nationalist student organization. The group denied involvement. Witnesses said the attackers rushed the campus between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. They shattered windows, attacked medics and yelled, “Hail Lord Ram!” — a reference to a Hindu god that has become a battle cry for far-right Hindu nationalists as India has grown more polarized under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a video of the incident, people charge down a hallway, raising bats as students scream, “Get out!” In another, Aishe Ghosh, president of the university’s student union, can barely get out words as she addresses the camera. “I have been brutally attacked,” she says, her hair matted with blood. “I am not even in a condition to talk.” Students said the attack was related, at least in part, to continuing protests among campus groups over fee increases. They also said the attackers targeted liberal leaders among the student body, and those who had been vocal about their opposition to Hindu nationalist policies endorsed by Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party.  In recent weeks, as protests swelled over a contentious citizenship law that many Indians see as discriminatory against the country’s 200 million Muslim minority, there were at least two similar attacks at other colleges.  Last month, at Jamia Millia Islamia, also in New Delhi, the police used force against student protesters and others, lobbing tear gas canisters into a library, firing into crowds and partially blinding a student. That university, like Jawaharlal Nehru University, has a history of liberal activism. But as the government has increasingly come under scrutiny for allowing excessive force against demonstrators, including detaining and torturing minors, calls have grown louder for a more forceful condemnation of the violence. By late Sunday, government officials across party lines denounced the attack at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Mr. Modi’s party characterized it as a “desperate attempt by forces of anarchy who are determined to use students as cannon fodder.” India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, called it “completely against the tradition and culture of the university.” “Condemn the violence unequivocally,” he wrote on Twitter. In a statement released shortly after the attack started, university administrators called on students to remain calm and emphasized that the police had been asked to restore order against “masked miscreants.”  But some students said the authorities stood by as the mob rampaged on their campus, breaking into dormitories with broken bottles and bats, and forcing terrified students to barricade themselves in their rooms.  Videos posted on social media showed members of the mob walking, undeterred, on the campus with iron rods, and people reported being beaten as the police watched. By midnight, hundreds of other activists from far-right Hindu groups had gathered on the streets, threatening journalists and vandalizing vehicles. As students fled through the university’s gates, some said police officers told them to chant “Hail Mother India.”  “The police were acting like accomplices,” said Ananya Pandey, 24, a former student who was visiting friends on campus when the attack occurred. In an interview with Asian News International, a local outlet, Devender Arya, a deputy police commissioner, said the authorities had entered the campus as soon as they received word from the university. He denied accusations that the police were passively or actively abetting the attacks, and promised legal action against the attackers. “The university continues to be peaceful,” he said. “As far as we are concerned, the university area is absolutely under control.” But on Sunday evening, many students said it felt unsafe to return. Hundreds protested on the streets and outside a police station, yelling out the name of B.R. Ambedkar, the Indian independence fighter who championed lower castes and helped write the Constitution, and shouting, “We will not put up with dictatorship!” “We must come out and speak for our futures,” said Vivek Kumar, a graduate student. “Today was an unprecedented attack on our existence and we will demand justice for this to the very end.” Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.']","Dozens were hurt by attackers who shouted Hindu slogans.

Iran Ends Nuclear Limits as Killing of Iranian General Upends Mideast,2020-01-05,"By Alissa J. Rubin, Ben Hubbard, Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Erlanger","['BAGHDAD — The consequences of the American killing of a top Iranian general rippled across the Middle East and beyond on Sunday, with Iran all but abandoning a landmark nuclear agreement and Iraqi lawmakers voting to expel American forces from their country. Steeling for retaliation from Iran, an American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria suspended the campaign it has waged against the Islamic State for years, as hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the street to mourn the general, Qassim Suleimani. “Iran’s nuclear program will have no limitations in production, including enrichment capacity,” the Iranian government said in an announcement Sunday that seemed to signal the de facto collapse of the 2015 agreement. Warning Iran not to attack, President Trump said the United States had pinpointed 52 targets in Iran — including cultural sites. The sites, he said, represented the 52 American hostages held at the United States Embassy in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Amid outrage in Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif declared that “targeting cultural sites is a war crime” and predicted that the “end of U.S. malign presence in West Asia has begun.” Mr. Trump also directed his anger at Iraq, warning it not expel American forces, and pointing to an air base the United States built there. “We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it,” he said.  Mr. Trump has said that the killing of General Suleimani on Friday was aimed at preventing war. But so far, it has unleashed a host of unanticipated consequences that could dramatically alter where the United States operates. Increasingly, the killing appeared to be generating effects far beyond the United States’ ability to control. That may include Iran’s nuclear future. On Sunday, the Iranian government said it was abandoning its “final limitations in the nuclear deal,” the international agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The decision leaves no restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, the statement said, including on uranium enrichment, production, research and expansion. Iran will, however, continue its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and return to the nuclear limits if the economic sanctions imposed on it are removed and Iran’s interests guaranteed, the government said. American sanctions have hit Iran’s oil-based economy particularly hard. General Suleimani was a towering figure both in Iran and across the Middle East, where he cultivated proxy militias in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Since he was killed in an American drone strike at the Baghdad airport on Friday alongside a powerful Iraqi militia leader, Iran and its partners have stepped up calls for vengeance, although they have yet to follow through on the threats.  American allies have largely kept quiet and distanced themselves from the killing so as not to put themselves in the line of fire. Lawmakers in Iraq voted on Sunday to require the government to end the presence of American troops in the country after Mr. Trump ordered the killing on Iraqi soil. The vote will not be final until it is signed by the prime minister, and it was unclear whether Iraq’s current caretaker government had the authority to end the relationship with the United States military. Few doubted, however, that the country would take whatever legal actions were necessary to compel a United States departure over the coming months. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi drafted the language and submitted the bill approved by Parliament on Sunday, leaving little doubt about his support.  Mr. Trump warned Iraq on Sunday that there would be dire consequences for expelling American forces. “We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there,” he said. “It cost billions of dollars to build, long before my time.” “If they do ask us to leave,” he added, “if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.” Although the vote in Parliament was 170-0, lawmakers were more divided on the issue of ousting American troops than that tally may suggest. Many of the 328 members of Parliament, primarily those representing the country’s ethnic Kurdish and Sunni Muslim minorities, did not attend the session and did not vote. Iraq’s Shiite Muslim majority dominates the Iraqi government. While groups that grew out of Shiite militia organizations have pushed hard for the expulsion, Sunni Muslim factions and the Kurds have wanted the United States to stay.  The legislation threads a fine needle: While using strong language demanding that the government “end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil and prevent the use of Iraqi airspace, soil and water for any reason” by foreign forces, it gives no timetable for doing so.  It would end the mission approved in 2014 that gave the United States the task of helping Iraqi forces fight the Islamic State. That agreement gave the Americans substantial latitude to launch attacks and use Iraqi airspace.  But the measure would leave in place the Strategic Framework Agreement, which allows an American troop presence in Iraq in some form, although only “at the invitation of the Iraqi government.” On Sunday, the American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria said it would pause its yearslong mission of fighting the Islamic State and training local forces in both countries. A pullout of the estimated 5,200 American troops in Iraq could cripple the fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS, possibly facilitating its resurgence. A smaller contingent of about 1,000 United States troops are in eastern Syria. The general’s killing unleashed calls for vengeance in both Iraq and Iran, and reinforced solidarity among hard-liners and moderates in Iran against the United States. After the vote in Iraq calling on the government to expel American troops, Iranian officials reacted with congratulatory messages. Hesameddin Ashena, a top adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on Twitter, “Expanding friendship with our neighbors and domestic unity are the best gifts for protecting our national security.” In Iraq, the attack was seen as a violation of the nation’s sovereignty. On Sunday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the American ambassador in Baghdad. In Iran, it was viewed as tantamount to an act of war. Hossein Dehghan, a military adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told CNN that Iran’s response would include an attack on “U.S. military targets.”  As the Middle East braced for Iranian retaliation, which analysts said was all but inevitable and American officials said they expected within weeks, Tehran and Washington ratcheted up the rhetoric. Members of Iran’s Parliament chanted, “Death to America!” en masse in the chamber on Sunday in protest over General Suleimani’s killing, television footage showed. The chants came as Mr. Trump fired off a series of Twitter ripostes to the growing anger, saying that the United States had already chosen 52 targets inside of Iran. Iran summoned the Swiss envoy representing American interests in Tehran on Sunday to protest Mr. Trump’s threat that Washington would target Iranian sites. And Mr. Trump’s tweet became a rallying cry among Iranians, many of whom shared it widely on social media with the message, “Attend the funeral for our cultural heritage.” Iran’s information and telecommunications minister, Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, denounced Mr. Trump as “a terrorist in a suit.” “Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis!” Mr. Jahromi said on Twitter. ”They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ‘the Great Iranian Nation & Culture.’” The attack on the Iranian general left America’s European allies scrambling to address the safety of their troops in the Middle East and complaining that they had been given no warning about the strike. European leaders called for a de-escalation of the tensions between Iran and the United States. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, invited Mr. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, to Brussels for talks. Mr. Borrell said that he had spoken with Mr. Zarif, urging “Iran to exercise restraint and carefully consider any reaction to avoid further escalation, which harms the entire region and its people.” Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said he would seek direct talks with Iran. Europe wants to continue the fight against the Islamic State, Mr. Maas said, and Germany is anxious about the safety of its troops training Iraqi forces.  Germany’s defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said in a statement: “Iraq cannot be allowed to sink into chaos, and certainly not under the control of extremists. Therefore, it is important not to let up now in the fight against Islamic State.” In general, the Europeans did not specifically criticize Mr. Trump for his decision, and share the American view that Iran has been a destabilizing force in the Middle East and a supporter of terrorism. At the same time, no European government praised the killing of General Suleimani, emphasizing instead the increased risks to their citizens, troops and interests. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was reported to be angry with Mr. Trump for not informing him or other allies with troops in Iraq about the decision to kill General Suleimani. While carried out by the Americans, the killing is seen as having put all European citizens and troops in Iraq and the wider region at heightened risk. Mr. Johnson, who was said to be returning early from a vacation in the Caribbean, is expected to discuss the issues with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Mr. Trump in the next few days, a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complained that the response by European allies had not been “helpful.” He told Fox News in an interview: “The Brits, the French, the Germans all need to understand that what we did, what the Americans did, saved lives in Europe as well.” Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign minister, who is scheduled to travel to Washington this week to meet Mr. Pompeo, said all countries had a right to defend themselves. Asked in an interview with the BBC whether the killing was legal, Mr. Raab said, “There is a right of self-defense.” He said he did not agree that the killing was an act of war, and described General Suleimani to Sky News, another British broadcaster, as a “regional menace.” But Mr. Raab also said that he had spoken to Iraq’s prime minister and president to urge a de-escalation of tensions in the region, and that he planned to speak to Iran’s foreign minister. In particular, the Europeans have tried to persuade Iran to keep to the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of it in May 2018, reimposing harsh economic sanctions on Tehran. Iran had slowly abandoned its adherence to parts of the deal before its announcement on Sunday. The Europeans are also working to keep the Strait of Hormuz open to shipping. About one-third of the world’s oil tankers use the waterway, which Iran has intermittently threatened to close. Last July, Iranian forces seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait, trying to pressure the world to allow its oil exports despite American sanctions. On Saturday, Britain’s defense minister, Ben Wallace, said he had ordered the country’s navy to accompany all British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz. France has also stepped up diplomatic initiatives to ease tensions. President Macron spoke with President Barham Salih of Iraq and the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi. On Sunday, Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi armed group close to Iran, warned Iraqi troops on bases that also house United States forces that they should stay at least 3,000 feet from their American counterparts starting on Sunday evening, and not allow themselves to be used as human shields.  In Lebanon, Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, another armed group backed by Iran, also called for revenge, telling his followers that United States bases, ships and soldiers in the region were “fair targets,” while American civilians were not.  Alissa J. Rubin reported from Baghdad, Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Farnaz Fassihi from New York and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

Witnesses said the attackers rushed the campus between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. They shattered windows, attacked medics and yelled, “Hail Lord Ram!” — a reference to a Hindu god that has become a battle cry for far-right Hindu nationalists as India has grown more polarized under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a video of the incident, people charge down a hallway, raising bats as students scream, “Get out!” In another, Aishe Ghosh, president of the university’s student union, can barely get out words as she addresses the camera. “I have been brutally attacked,” she says, her hair matted with blood. “I am not even in a condition to talk.” Students said the attack was related, at least in part, to continuing protests among campus groups over fee increases. They also said the attackers targeted liberal leaders among the student body, and those who had been vocal about their opposition to Hindu nationalist policies endorsed by Mr. Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party.  In recent weeks, as protests swelled over a contentious citizenship law that many Indians see as discriminatory against the country’s 200 million Muslim minority, there were at least two similar attacks at other colleges.  Last month, at Jamia Millia Islamia, also in New Delhi, the police used force against student protesters and others, lobbing tear gas canisters into a library, firing into crowds and partially blinding a student. That university, like Jawaharlal Nehru University, has a history of liberal activism. But as the government has increasingly come under scrutiny for allowing excessive force against demonstrators, including detaining and torturing minors, calls have grown louder for a more forceful condemnation of the violence. By late Sunday, government officials across party lines denounced the attack at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Mr. Modi’s party characterized it as a “desperate attempt by forces of anarchy who are determined to use students as cannon fodder.” India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, called it “completely against the tradition and culture of the university.” “Condemn the violence unequivocally,” he wrote on Twitter. In a statement released shortly after the attack started, university administrators called on students to remain calm and emphasized that the police had been asked to restore order against “masked miscreants.”  But some students said the authorities stood by as the mob rampaged on their campus, breaking into dormitories with broken bottles and bats, and forcing terrified students to barricade themselves in their rooms.  Videos posted on social media showed members of the mob walking, undeterred, on the campus with iron rods, and people reported being beaten as the police watched. By midnight, hundreds of other activists from far-right Hindu groups had gathered on the streets, threatening journalists and vandalizing vehicles. As students fled through the university’s gates, some said police officers told them to chant “Hail Mother India.”  “The police were acting like accomplices,” said Ananya Pandey, 24, a former student who was visiting friends on campus when the attack occurred.

Masked Men Attack Students in Rampage at University in New Delhi,2020-01-06,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — Dozens of masked men in New Delhi stormed one of India’s most prestigious universities on Sunday, attacking students and professors with rods and bricks, vandalizing dormitories and injuring at least 42 people, some of them seriously, officials said.

Boris Johnson’s Balancing Act With Trump and Europe on Iran,2020-01-06,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on the Caribbean island of Mustique, still basking in the glow of his recent election victory, when the news came last Friday that President Trump had ordered the killing of a powerful Iranian general — without tipping off, let alone consulting, his British ally. The British government was livid about the lack of notice, according to current and former officials, particularly because there are about 400 British troops deployed in Iraq, and Britain has historically been more closely aligned with the United States on combat operations there than any other country. But Mr. Johnson held his tongue until Sunday evening, after he returned to London. Even then, he issued a carefully worded four-paragraph statement that said he would not “lament” the killing of the general, Qassim Suleimani, warned Iran against reprisals and said nothing about Mr. Trump’s action. It was a circumspect reaction for a politician not known for his circumspection, and it underscored Mr. Johnson’s predicament as he confronts what is arguably the first foreign policy crisis of the post-Brexit era. Britain is caught between its traditional alliance with Washington — one that Mr. Johnson promised voters he would deepen with a post-Brexit trade agreement — and the new, still-undefined, relationship with Europe. Mr. Johnson is walking a tightrope that officials said could become even more treacherous if Mr. Trump’s showdown with Iran opens a new trans-Atlantic rift. “Fundamentally, we’re not aligned with the Americans on this,” said Simon Fraser, a former head of Britain’s Foreign Office, who has served in Iraq and Syria. “The risk is that the U.K. will find itself potentially exposed, if tensions arise between the major Europeans and the United States.” So far, the Europeans are also working to keep tensions in check. In a joint statement released by the leaders of France, Germany and Britain, they expressed concern about “the negative role Iran has played in the region” but called on both sides to stop “the current cycle of violence in Iraq.” British officials credited Mr. Johnson with influencing the language of that statement, which was more sympathetic toward the White House than separate statements from the French and Germans. But it is not clear that Mr. Johnson will get much credit for softening his fellow Europeans. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already expressed frustration with Europe’s response, saying, “the Brits, the French, the Germans” had not “been as helpful as I wish that they could be.” General Suleimani’s killing, he said, had bolstered European security, since the general had orchestrated assassinations in Europe. On Monday, Britain continued to walk a fine line. The prime minister’s spokesman told reporters that targeting cultural sites in Iran, as Mr. Trump threatened to do if Iran retaliated, would violate international conventions on warfare. But the official was careful not to criticize the president directly. “They are not going to give Boris Johnson any credit for trying to split the difference, even if he’s splitting it 80/20 in their favor,” said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London, of the Trump administration. “To them, you’re either a vassal or an enemy.” Mr. Shapiro has labeled Mr. Johnson’s delicate handling of the United States as “neo-poodleism,” a reference to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s unstinting support of George W. Bush during the Iraq war, which prompted critics to accuse him of acting like Mr. Bush’s poodle. In Mr. Blair’s case, Mr. Shapiro said, he was motivated by a genuine conviction that Iraq was a war worth fighting. In Mr. Johnson’s case, the loyalty is born of more pragmatic considerations. With Britain on track to leave the European Union by the end of this month, he said, Britain will find itself ever more dependent on its economic relationship with the United States. Facing a difficult trade negotiation with Washington, Mr. Johnson can ill afford to alienate Mr. Trump on Iran. There is already evidence that Mr. Johnson has trimmed his sails out of deference to the president. Last year, when Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker in the Persian Gulf, his predecessor, Theresa May, tried to muster a European-led naval force to protect ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz. When Mr. Johnson replaced her in July, the European-led initiative fell apart and Britain ended up joining a naval force led by the United States, which Germany and France refused to join. Not everybody believes Mr. Johnson will be forced to be subservient to the United States. Some noted that he had distanced himself from Mr. Trump on trade issues during the general election campaign. “The politics of Brexit are more about a desire for increased sovereignty than a preference for Atlanticism over Europeanism,” said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute. One place where Mr. Johnson has stood with the Europeans is in defending the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and Iran’s announcement Sunday that it would no longer abide by its limits to uranium enrichment seemed finally to kill it off. But critics said Europe’s efforts to salvage the deal had been weak, in part because all three countries — not just Britain — have been hamstrung by their desire to maintain good relations with Washington.  Europeans responded to this latest crisis with a flurry of meetings. On Monday, NATO held an emergency meeting of its ambassadors. On Friday, European foreign ministers will gather in Brussels. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said they would come up with a coordinated response to Iran. “This could be the first step toward the end of this agreement, which would be a great loss,” Mr. Maas told a German radio station. “And so, we will weigh things up very, very responsibly.” He also said Mr. Trump’s threat to impose sanctions on Iraq if it forced out American troops was “not very helpful.” Fears about Britain’s security mounted on Monday after the Times of London quoted an unnamed commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as saying that British soldiers could be collateral damage in Iranian reprisals on American soldiers. Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hamid Baeidinejad, disputed that report as “malicious, false propaganda.” Mr. Johnson has suggested he wants to play a mediating role in the region. On Monday, he spoke with Iraq’s prime minister, Abdul Mahdi, to try to work out a solution on foreign troops. He has also spoken to Mr. Trump and European leaders.  While he has talked about being a bridge across the Atlantic, however, diplomats are skeptical. “Frankly,” Mr. Fraser said, “the Germans and the French would rather deal with Washington on their own.” Stephen Castle and David Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London, and Steven Erlanger contributed from Brussels.']","Britain’s prime minister cannot risk criticizing the American president, whose support he needs for trade negotiations after Brexit.

China Grapples With Mystery Pneumonia-Like Illness,2020-01-06,By Sui-Lee Wee and Vivian Wang,"['BEIJING — For days, Li Bin had what felt like a cold, with a high fever of between 102 and 105, and he could not understand why he wasn’t getting better.  After four days, he went to a hospital, and a doctor told him he had a form of viral pneumonia, without offering specifics. Mr. Li, 42, was hospitalized, then transferred to another facility and quarantined with other patients who had similarly unexplained symptoms.  Mr. Li is one of 59 people in the central city of Wuhan who have been sickened by a pneumonia-like illness, the cause of which is unclear. The cases have alarmed Chinese officials, who are racing to unravel the mystery behind them in a region where the memory of an outbreak of the dangerous respiratory disease known as SARS remains fresh.  SARS originated in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003. At the time, the Chinese government tried to cover up the problem, which is exacerbating fear now about this new illness.  Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions, the Wuhan health commission has said. No deaths have been reported but seven people are critically ill. On Sunday, the city government said they had ruled out as causes SARS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), bird flu and the adenovirus.  The illness appeared just weeks before the Spring Festival, the country’s biggest holiday, when tens of millions of people travel. The authorities urged the public to be on alert for pneumonia-like symptoms like fever, body aches and breathing difficulties. Workers wearing hazmat suits disinfected and shut down the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which also sold poultry, pheasants and wild animal meats, after the city health department said it traced many of the cases to it. Viruses that caused SARS and the H7N9 strain of bird flu in humans were first detected in markets that sold animals and experts have said contact with infected animals was the likeliest source of transmission.  Health authorities around the region have responded quickly. In Hong Kong, 21 people who had visited Wuhan in recent weeks were hospitalized between Dec. 31 and noon on Monday, according to that city’s health department. Officials said they would install additional thermal imaging systems at the international airport to monitor passengers coming from Wuhan; they also added staff at the high speed rail station to check body temperatures. The authorities in Singapore placed a Chinese girl with pneumonia in isolation because she had traveled to Wuhan, then said on Sunday that doctors had found that the child had a common childhood viral illness.  Chinese health officials at first appeared to be closely guarding information about the illness. The Wuhan government confirmed on Dec. 31 that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause only after an emergency notice to city hospitals was shared on social media sites a day earlier, apparently triggering some public panic.  But more recently, the government appeared to be moving more quickly to disclose information about new cases in a sign that it has learned its lesson from SARS, said Leo Poon, a public health expert at the University of Hong Kong. “I have to emphasize this is a new disease, and no one on earth has gone through this before,” he said. Mr. Poon said a surge in cases in the coming week would suggest either that the source of the virus had not been eradicated despite the shutdown of the market or that the illness could be transmitted between humans. “I hope this pathogen is a less harmful one so it would not cause a major epidemic similar to SARS,” he said. “It would be a nightmare for all of us.” Wang Linfa, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, said he was frustrated that scientists in China were not allowed to speak to him about the outbreak. Dr. Wang said, however, that he thought the virus was likely not spreading from humans to humans because health workers had not contracted the disease. “We should not go into panic mode,” he said.  The World Health Organization said it was closely monitoring the situation and was prepared to mount a broader response, if needed. In Hong Kong, residents raced to stockpile surgical masks. On Monday, employees at several pharmacies and convenience stores said they had sold out by lunch time. Watsons, a major chain owned by the family of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, said sales for masks and hand sanitizers increased significantly this week compared with last week. The Hong Kong government on Saturday also introduced a new response system for “novel infectious diseases,” citing a desire to avoid repeats of the SARS epidemic or the 2009 swine flu outbreak. In response to the Wuhan cases, the government declared a “serious” response level, the middle tier of the new system, which officials said signaled a “moderate” risk to the local population.  In Wuhan, Mr. Li, who works for a hotel restaurant, was one of the first patients to fall ill. He came down with a fever on Dec. 23, after visiting the Huanan Seafood Market.  “It felt like a common cold,” Mr. Li said by telephone. He has since recovered and is set to come home in the next two days. None of his other family members have become sick, according to his wife. The authorities have acted swiftly to clamp down on discussion about the outbreak. Censors blocked the hashtag #WuhanSARS. The police said they were investigating eight people in Wuhan for “spreading rumors” online about the disease, an announcement that was met with anger on Sina Weibo, one of China’s most popular social media sites. “I don’t have the right to speak and I don’t even know the truth,” one user wrote. “Don’t I have the right to panic and save myself?” Vivian Wang reported from Hong Kong.

The Springs Ran Dry. Then This Australian Town Burned.,2020-01-06,"By Thomas Fuller, Isabella Kwai and Matthew Abbott","['MOGO, Australia — The lawns were always green in Mogo, a former gold-mining town in southeastern Australia where water from natural springs bubbled just beneath the surface. The lush oasis had never burned as far as anyone could remember. But Mogo, like much of the country, is facing a new reality.  Last week, strong winds swept through the town, bringing a terrifying firestorm that razed half of the main street. Many now are asking: If a swampy garden spot can burn, is anywhere safe in rural Australia? The Australian bush has always burned. But the higher temperatures that come with climate change, as well as the three years of drought and the expansion of communities deeper into wild-land areas, have put more people at much higher risk. “We’ve had townships completely under threat that were never threatened before,” Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, said on Sunday.  In all, about 1,800 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales and Victoria. By comparison, around 70 homes were hit in the two states during the last fire season. “We can’t pretend this is something we have experienced before,” Ms. Berejiklian said. “It’s not.”  [Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia’s blazes intensify.] Although there are weeks if not months to go in the fire season, Australians are already reeling from the devastation of hundreds of volatile and unpredictable blazes. While cooler and damper weather has brought a relative respite for a few days, the fires are expected to pick up later in the week, when high temperatures and strong winds are expected to return. Fiona Phillips, the member of Parliament for a district that stretches for around 150 miles along the coast and includes Mogo, estimated that 80 percent of the constituency had burned — hills and gullies, inland and coastal, lush and dry. “Everyone is impacted,” she said. The devastation, and the visceral images of communities leveled by infernos, have prompted a global outpouring of aid. The governments of New Zealand, Canada and the United States have all sent experienced personnel. American firefighters who arrived on Monday at the Sydney airport were greeted with handshakes from officials and cheers from Australians passing through. Celeste Barber, a popular Australian comedian, has helped raise nearly $20 million for firefighters through social media. Pink, the American pop star, recently pledged $500,000 of her own.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has been widely criticized for his delayed response to the fires, also picked up the pace, announcing on Monday that the government would dedicate two billion Australian dollars, or about $1.3 billion, over the next two years to help rebuild ravaged towns, support affected businesses and provide mental health services for emergency workers.  Over the weekend, he said the government would deploy 3,000 military reservists, along with aircraft and navy vessels, in one of the largest uses of military assets at home since World War II. The bush fires mirror what other places have witnessed in recent years. Areas that have also long had wildfires, like California, are burning more intensively, destroying record numbers of homes. Places like the Brazilian rainforest or the far north of Sweden, where natural fires are rare, are seeing record fires.  In the Snowy Mountains, the highest peaks in Australia, fires raged only weeks after the last snow melt, leaving many residents in the area trapped.  In Australia, the population outside big cities has grown by around 10 percent in the past decade, increasing the pool of people vulnerable to wildfire. Up and down the southeastern coast, subdivisions are sprouting as the area attracts more residents who want to live there year-round, not just visit on vacations.  They must be prepared for the worst. Life in rural Australia now means planning for long power cuts, preparing escape routes and keeping a kit of emergency supplies. “Across Australia, we’re seeing fire into systems that have not had fire since European contact,” said Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist and botanist at Curtin University. With light rains falling over many destroyed areas along the coast Sunday and Monday, many residents returned to flattened homes to gather anything that was salvageable — and in some cases to say goodbye. In Conjola Park, a three-hour drive south of Sydney, Jodie and Jason McDermott held an impromptu party at the outdoor bar in their garden. Their home was destroyed in the New Year’s Eve fires, but the backyard bar was intact, including the wooden surfboard that served as the countertop. “Here’s to the new future,” Ms. McDermott told her neighbors as they raised cold bottles of beer. The neighbors used humor and Australian stoicism to deflect the pain of losing almost everything they owned. “I had a leak in the roof — I don’t have to worry about that anymore,” said Maree Fletcher, a neighbor. Ms. McDermott said she was going to make sure that her new house didn’t have the creaking floor boards that annoyed her every time she stepped on them.  “This is sealing our memories and embracing the new,” she said. Bulldozers are coming soon to flatten the remains of their homes. Mr. McDermott said they would build their new homes where the old had stood. The fires were so intense in Conjola Park that they melted an aluminum boat. “A lot of people don’t understand the ferocity of what happened here,” said Brian Walker, a firefighter. On New Year’s Eve, he successfully protected other people’s homes as his own burned. He lost his collections of aviation memorabilia, all of his clothes — everything. “All the bits and pieces that you accrue in life,” he said. Mr. Walker spoke about the people who had reached out to help and the kind words of support that had come from a man, a friend of his son, whom he had coached years ago in a youth sports league. Then he paused. He cleared his throat and stuttered a few words. The stoicism fell away as his eyes watered. Where would he live? “I’m swinging in the breeze,” Mr. Walker said. “That’s going to be a big problem. So many people have lost everything.” Building communities like Conjola Park or Mogo tucked away in the country’s vast wilderness has been an important part of Australia’s identity, an ethos of both living as one with nature and trying to tame its endemic harshness.  Mogo, once reliant on gold and timber, has in recent decades drawn tourists with its handicraft shops and a gold-mining museum, all of which burned in last week’s fire.  A deconsecrated church that was built in the late 19th century was also razed. The structure was not insured, said Peter Williams, who ran a pottery shop out of the building. “I feel like a refugee — we’ve got nothing,” Mr. Williams said as he stared at the chaotic pile of rubble, including a handrail that is still intact but now leads nowhere. His home, also not insured, burned, too. “This was 40 years of our lives,” Mr. Williams said. “I’ve run out of tears.” Thomas Fuller reported from Mogo and Isabella Kwai from Nowra, Australia. Damien Cave contributed reporting from Sydney.']","Residents in some lush rural places thought the blazes would never reach them.

But the higher temperatures that come with climate change, as well as the three years of drought and the expansion of communities deeper into wild-land areas, have put more people at much higher risk. “We’ve had townships completely under threat that were never threatened before,” Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, said on Sunday.  In all, about 1,800 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales and Victoria. By comparison, around 70 homes were hit in the two states during the last fire season. “We can’t pretend this is something we have experienced before,” Ms. Berejiklian said. “It’s not.”  [Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia’s blazes intensify.] Although there are weeks if not months to go in the fire season, Australians are already reeling from the devastation of hundreds of volatile and unpredictable blazes. While cooler and damper weather has brought a relative respite for a few days, the fires are expected to pick up later in the week, when high temperatures and strong winds are expected to return. Fiona Phillips, the member of Parliament for a district that stretches for around 150 miles along the coast and includes Mogo, estimated that 80 percent of the constituency had burned — hills and gullies, inland and coastal, lush and dry. “Everyone is impacted,” she said. The devastation, and the visceral images of communities leveled by infernos, have prompted a global outpouring of aid. The governments of New Zealand, Canada and the United States have all sent experienced personnel. American firefighters who arrived on Monday at the Sydney airport were greeted with handshakes from officials and cheers from Australians passing through. Celeste Barber, a popular Australian comedian, has helped raise nearly $20 million for firefighters through social media. Pink, the American pop star, recently pledged $500,000 of her own.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has been widely criticized for his delayed response to the fires, also picked up the pace, announcing on Monday that the government would dedicate two billion Australian dollars, or about $1.3 billion, over the next two years to help rebuild ravaged towns, support affected businesses and provide mental health services for emergency workers.  Over the weekend, he said the government would deploy 3,000 military reservists, along with aircraft and navy vessels, in one of the largest uses of military assets at home since World War II. The bush fires mirror what other places have witnessed in recent years. Areas that have also long had wildfires, like California, are burning more intensively, destroying record numbers of homes. Places like the Brazilian rainforest or the far north of Sweden, where natural fires are rare, are seeing record fires.  In the Snowy Mountains, the highest peaks in Australia, fires raged only weeks after the last snow melt, leaving many residents in the area trapped.  In Australia, the population outside big cities has grown by around 10 percent in the past decade, increasing the pool of people vulnerable to wildfire. Up and down the southeastern coast, subdivisions are sprouting as the area attracts more residents who want to live there year-round, not just visit on vacations.  They must be prepared for the worst. Life in rural Australia now means planning for long power cuts, preparing escape routes and keeping a kit of emergency supplies. “Across Australia, we’re seeing fire into systems that have not had fire since European contact,” said Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist and botanist at Curtin University. With light rains falling over many destroyed areas along the coast Sunday and Monday, many residents returned to flattened homes to gather anything that was salvageable — and in some cases to say goodbye. In Conjola Park, a three-hour drive south of Sydney, Jodie and Jason McDermott held an impromptu party at the outdoor bar in their garden. Their home was destroyed in the New Year’s Eve fires, but the backyard bar was intact, including the wooden surfboard that served as the countertop. “Here’s to the new future,” Ms. McDermott told her neighbors as they raised cold bottles of beer. The neighbors used humor and Australian stoicism to deflect the pain of losing almost everything they owned. “I had a leak in the roof — I don’t have to worry about that anymore,” said Maree Fletcher, a neighbor. Ms. McDermott said she was going to make sure that her new house didn’t have the creaking floor boards that annoyed her every time she stepped on them.  “This is sealing our memories and embracing the new,” she said. Bulldozers are coming soon to flatten the remains of their homes. Mr. McDermott said they would build their new homes where the old had stood. The fires were so intense in Conjola Park that they melted an aluminum boat. “A lot of people don’t understand the ferocity of what happened here,” said Brian Walker, a firefighter. On New Year’s Eve, he successfully protected other people’s homes as his own burned. He lost his collections of aviation memorabilia, all of his clothes — everything. “All the bits and pieces that you accrue in life,” he said. Mr. Walker spoke about the people who had reached out to help and the kind words of support that had come from a man, a friend of his son, whom he had coached years ago in a youth sports league. Then he paused. He cleared his throat and stuttered a few words. The stoicism fell away as his eyes watered. Where would he live? “I’m swinging in the breeze,” Mr. Walker said. “That’s going to be a big problem. So many people have lost everything.” Building communities like Conjola Park or Mogo tucked away in the country’s vast wilderness has been an important part of Australia’s identity, an ethos of both living as one with nature and trying to tame its endemic harshness.  Mogo, once reliant on gold and timber, has in recent decades drawn tourists with its handicraft shops and a gold-mining museum, all of which burned in last week’s fire.  A deconsecrated church that was built in the late 19th century was also razed. The structure was not insured, said Peter Williams, who ran a pottery shop out of the building. “I feel like a refugee — we’ve got nothing,” Mr. Williams said as he stared at the chaotic pile of rubble, including a handrail that is still intact but now leads nowhere. His home, also not insured, burned, too. “This was 40 years of our lives,” Mr. Williams said. “I’ve run out of tears.” Thomas Fuller reported from Mogo and Isabella Kwai from Nowra, Australia.

3 Americans Die in Shabab Attack on Kenyan Base,2020-01-05,By Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-Neff,"['WASHINGTON — A United States service member and two American military contractors died on Sunday in an attack on a Kenyan military base that the Pentagon said was carried out by the Islamic extremist group the Shabab. The attack at the military airstrip at Manda Bay, Kenya, early Sunday involved small-arms and other hostile fire, according to a statement by the military’s Africa Command. Fighters from the Shabab, an East African terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, fought their way onto the base before Kenyan and American troops drove them back. In the past several years, Manda Bay was used by Army Green Berets as an outstation where they both trained Kenyan Rangers — who had their own training center there — and supervised them as they crossed over the border into neighboring Somalia to fight the Shabab. But recently, the Green Berets were replaced with units from both the Navy SEALs and Marine Special Operations teams. According to military officials, the base has been problematic at best, with cross-border operations rarely going ahead as planned, prompting American officials to consider ending their use of parts of the base altogether. The deaths of the three Americans, whose identities were not made public pending notification of their families, were the first United States military-related deaths in Africa since an Army Special Forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Alex Conrad, died from wounds he received during a firefight with Shabab fighters in June 2018, at a small outpost near the town of Jamaame, Somalia, about 200 miles southwest of Mogadishu, the capital. The attack in Kenya comes about a week after an explosives-laden truck blew up at a busy intersection in Mogadishu, killing at least 79 people, the latest sign of resurgent militant activity in a country plagued by an enduring strain of violent extremism. Authorities believe that attack was also carried out by Shabab fighters. American military officials said they assessed that the attack in Kenya was not related to soaring tensions between the United States and Iran after an American drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, one of Iran’s top generals. In Kenya, about 200 American soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as about 100 Pentagon civilian employees and contractors, are helping train and assist Kenyan forces, who are battling local cells of the Shabab. American officials said that local Shabab fighters most likely carried out the attack on Sunday. The Africa Command’s statement said that six contractor-operated civilian aircraft were damaged, but The Associated Press, citing an internal Kenyan police report, said the damage was much more extensive, including two American helicopters and multiple American vehicles at the airstrip. An American official said five Shabab fighters were killed in the early-morning firefight. “We will pursue those responsible for this attack and al-Shabab, who seeks to harm Americans and U.S. interests,” Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the head of the Africa Command, said in the statement. “We remain committed to preventing al-Shabab from maintaining a safe haven to plan deadly attacks against the U.S. homeland, East African and international partners.” The Pentagon is weighing whether to sharply reduce or pull out several hundred American troops stationed in West Africa as the first phase of a global reshuffling of United States forces. But Defense Department officials said it was less likely that troops would be withdrawn from Somalia because — as the recent attacks by Shabab fighters gruesomely underscore — security in the country remains fraught. General Townsend is scheduled to testify to Congress later this month during annual hearings for each of the Pentagon’s worldwide commands. He is expected to face tough questioning from lawmakers about the Pentagon’s planning for the continent. The Pentagon carried out 63 drone strikes in Somalia last year — almost all against Shabab militants, with a few against a branch of the Islamic State. That compares with 47 strikes against the Shabab in 2018.']",A service member and two contractors became the first American military-related deaths in Africa since 2018.
"A Sea of Mourners in Iran, and New Threats From Both Sides",2020-01-06,By The New York Times,"[' The latest breaking news and analysis about the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani  can be found here. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept and offered prayers over the coffin of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at the funeral in Tehran on Monday, as throngs of people filled the city’s streets to mourn.  General Suleimani was killed by the United States on Friday in Baghdad in a drone strike. American officials said the general had ordered assaults on Americans in Iraq and Syria and was planning a wave of imminent attacks.  Ayatollah Khamenei had a close relationship with the general, who was widely considered to be the second most powerful man in Iran.  The military commander was hailed as a martyr, and his successor swore revenge during the funeral ceremony, while chants of “Death to America” rang out from the crowds in the capital.  State-run news outlets reported that millions had gathered in Tehran, and images showed a sea of mourners, many wearing black and waving the Iranian flag.   “God the almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger,” said Esmail Ghaani, the Iranian general who will succeed General Suleimani as head of the Quds Force, the foreign expeditionary arm of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “Certainly actions will be taken,” he added. General Suleimani’s killing has prompted fears of escalating retaliatory actions between Iran and the United States, and of a broader regional conflict. After the attack, Iran said it would no longer abide by a 2015 agreement to suspend uranium production.  Mr. Khamenei has told advisers that any retaliation against American interests must be direct, proportional and carried out openly by Iran — a departure from the country’s usual policy of acting through proxies. He laid down those parameters at a meeting of Iran’s National Security Council hours after the general was killed, according to three Iranians familiar with the meeting. Zeinab Suleimani, General Suleimani’s daughter, said at the funeral that the United States and Israel faced a “dark day.” “You crazy Trump, the symbol of ignorance, the slave of Zionists, don’t think that the killing of my father will finish everything,” she said.  The general’s funeral was attended by a broad swath of Iranians, including reformers who oppose the government of President Hassan Rouhani but who perceived the killing as an attack on all of Iran.  “I felt like he was our safety umbrella spread above Iran,” said Amir Ali, 22, a university student, of General Suleimani. “I felt safe knowing he was out there.” An official letter from the Defense Department informing Iraq that American troops were “repositioning forces” for “movement out of Iraq” produced headlines around the world that an American withdrawal had begun. But the letter, drafted by the United States military command in Baghdad, was sent out by mistake. The furor it caused prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to call an urgent news conference to deny the reports. “It was an honest mistake,” General Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.” “There’s been no decision made to leave Iraq, period,” Mr. Esper said. “There is no decision to leave, nor did we issue any plans to leave.” But because the Iraqi Parliament voted on Sunday that American troops should leave the country, General Milley said, military officials have begun making arrangements for a withdrawal in the event that a decision is made to pull out. He said the military was “moving forces around” to consolidate their positions and that, not only were they not withdrawing, but at the moment more forces were arriving from Kuwait. The Iraqi government has begun to consider new parameters for the American military in Iraq after lawmakers voted 170-0 on Sunday in favor of expelling United States troops from their country. The troops will be limited to “training and advising” Iraqi forces, but will not be allowed to move off their bases or to fly in Iraqi airspace while plans are being made for their departure, said Brig. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf, the military spokesman for Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. The vote on Sunday was not final and many lawmakers did not attend the session. But Mr. Mahdi drafted the language and submitted the bill to Parliament, leaving little doubt about his support for the expulsion. Mr. Mahdi met with Matthew Tueller, the American ambassador to Iraq, on Monday, and “stressed the need for joint action to implement the withdrawal,” according to a statement and photo released by Mr. Mahdi’s office. He also emphasized Iraq’s efforts to prevent the current tensions between Iran and the United States from sliding into “open war.” Mr. Mahdi also made clear that Iraq wanted good relations with “all countries” but that Iraq wanted those relationships to be based on “mutual respect, and preserving its security, stability and national sovereignty.” The drone strike that killed General Suleimani on Friday also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. The attack was viewed by many in Iraq as a violation of the nation’s sovereignty, and the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that it had summoned the American ambassador. Iran reacted to Sunday’s vote with congratulatory messages.  But the Iraqi Parliament was divided over the demands from angry citizens to expel American troops. Nearly half of its members, primarily Kurds and Sunnis, did not attend Sunday’s session and did not vote. In his speech to lawmakers, Mr. Mahdi laid out two possibilities: to either quickly end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq, or to set a timeline for their expulsion. The measure approved by Parliament did not include a timeline, and only instructed the government to end the presence of foreign forces in Iraq. Officials said no decision had been made about whether any American troops would be able to stay, or under what conditions.  By Monday, there was still no timetable for the troops’ departure and no specifics about whether all American forces would be asked to leave or only some. And while Mr. Mahdi’s rhetoric was tough in his speech to the Iraqi Parliament on Sunday, by late in the evening, after speaking with President Emmanuel Macron of France by phone, his language was more modulated. In a post on Twitter describing their phone call, Mr. Mahdi suggested that he was leaving the door open to something less than a complete departure. He said he had agreed with Mr. Macron to “continue to discuss this delicate issue.”  He added that they talked about “the withdrawal of the foreign forces from Iraq in a way that would not damage the battle against ISIS and would preserve the sovereignty of Iraq and keep its relationships with the countries of the international coalition” that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq. Those goals would be difficult to achieve without some continued presence by the United States, because other countries’ troops are unlikely to stay in the absence of American military support. President Trump and other American officials have said that General Suleimani was in the midst of planning attacks on United States forces when he was killed. But the general may have also been working as a go-between in quiet efforts to reduce the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Hostility and competition for influence had grown for years between the two regional rivals, but in recent months, Iran and Saudi Arabia had taken steps toward indirect talks to defuse the situation. In an address to the Iraqi Parliament on Sunday, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said that he was supposed to meet with General Suleimani on the morning he was killed. “It was expected that he was carrying a message for me from the Iranian side responding to the Saudi message that we had sent to the Iranian side to reach agreements and breakthroughs important for the situation in Iraq and the region,” Mr. Mahdi said. The content of the messages was not immediately clear, but Mr. Mahdi’s comments suggested that the drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump may have interrupted a diplomatic back channel aimed at averting conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Saudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Esper acknowledged that striking Iranian cultural sites with no military value would be a war crime, putting him at odds with the president, who insisted such places would be legitimate targets. Mr. Trump’s threats generated condemnation at home and abroad while deeply discomfiting American military leaders who have made a career of upholding the laws of war. “We will follow the laws of armed conflict,” the defense secretary said at a news briefing at the Pentagon on Monday when asked if cultural sites would be targeted, as the president had suggested over the weekend. When a reporter asked if that meant “no” because the laws of war prohibit targeting cultural sites, Mr. Esper agreed. “That’s the laws of armed conflict.” The furor over the threat to Iranian antiquities was a classic controversy of Mr. Trump’s own creation, the apparent result of an impulsive threat and his refusal to back down in the face of criticism. While Mr. Trump declared on Saturday that the United States had identified 52 potential targets in Iran, none of them qualified as cultural sites, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified correcting the president. Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of Unesco, met with the Iranian ambassador to the organization on Monday to discuss the current situation, and issued a statement pointing to  international agreements that condemn acts of destruction of cultural heritage. “Ms. Azoulay stressed the universality of cultural and natural heritage as vectors of peace and dialogue between peoples, which the international community has a duty to protect and preserve for future generations,” Unesco said in the statement.  Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, and foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, were once seen as relative moderates.  Mr. Rouhani, for example, once advocated diplomacy and integration with the West. Mr. Zarif was the Iranian most closely associated with the negotiation of the 2015 deal that limited Iran’s nuclear program. But on Monday, each offered a fiery response to the United States in light of General Suleimani’s killing. “What the US has accomplished in its terrorist assassination of anti-ISIS heroes is to unleash global anti-US fury and a worldwide rancor — on a scale not seen in recent memory,” Mr. Zarif said in a tweet. “End of malign U.S. presence in West Asia has begun.” Mr. Rouhani said in a tweet on Monday that “those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290,” in a reference to the number of people killed when an Iranian passenger plane was shot down by an American warship in the Persian Gulf in 1988. The comparison suggested that if Mr. Trump planned to attack 52 targets, one for each American hostage held by Iran in the American embassy from 1979 to 1980, Iran had an even larger number of victims to commemorate. “Never threaten the Iranian nation,” Mr. Rouhani said. Two top Senate Democrats urged Mr. Trump early Monday to declassify the document that the administration sent to Congress formally giving notice of the airstrike that killed General Suleimani. It is unusual for an administration to classify the entirety of such a notification, and Democrats upbraided the document as insufficient. The notification to Congress is required by law. In a joint statement, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said it was “critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner.” “An entirely classified notification is simply not appropriate in a democratic society, and there appears to be no legitimate justification for classifying this notification,” they said. The House is expected to vote later this week on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act that would curtail the president’s ability to authorize a strike against Iran without Congress’s approval. The Senate could vote on similar legislation as soon as mid-January. “He was designated a terrorist by President Obama and then Obama did nothing about it except give them $150 billion,” Mr. Trump said Monday during a phone interview on Rush Limbaugh’s radio program, referring to Iranian money that was unfrozen as part of the nuclear agreement that President Barack Obama’s administration brokered in 2015. “The Obama administration was just letting them get away with murder — in the true sense, murder,” Mr. Trump continued. He did not spare his Republican predecessor either, holding him responsible for not targeting General Suleimani during his administration. “President Bush should have taken him out,” Mr. Trump added. “He’s responsible for the” roadside bombs that killed many American troops during the height of the Iraq War. The general’s killing has won Mr. Trump praise from some neoconservatives who have been critical of him, and who have advocated military action against Iran for years. Saudi Arabia is scrambling to ease tensions in the Middle East amid fears that Iran could retaliate for the killing of General Suleimani with strikes against Riyadh and other American allies in the region.  Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, sent his younger brother, Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, to Washington, where on Monday he met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and with Mr. Esper. The Saudi news media had reported that he would urge the Americans to exercise restraint. “We are very keen that the situation in the region doesn’t escalate any further,” the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, told reporters in Riyadh on Monday. “It’s certainly a very dangerous moment, and we have to be conscious of the risks and dangers, not just to the region but to wider global security, and therefore we hope that all actors take all the steps necessary to prevent any further escalation and any provocation.” While the Saudi leadership considers Iran its staunchest regional enemy, a drone and missile attack on Saudi oil processing plants in September that the United States accused Iran of orchestrating exposed the kingdom’s vulnerability — and raised questions about Mr. Trump’s willingness to defend it. The United States Embassy in Riyadh this week warned Americans in the kingdom of “the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks,” adding that Americans working near military bases and oil facilities were “at heightened risk of attack.” The Iranian government said it would no longer abide by a commitment it made under a 2015 nuclear deal that limited its enrichment of uranium. The decision to lift all restrictions on the production of nuclear fuel spelled the effective end of the nuclear deal, experts said, though Iran left open the possibility that it would return to the limits if sanctions were lifted. “It’s finished. If there’s no limitation on production, then there is no deal,” said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonprofit in Washington. The announcement came after the Iranian Supreme National Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday after General Suleimani’s assassination. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will end its final limitations in the nuclear deal, meaning the limitation in the number of centrifuges,” the government said in a statement. “Therefore Iran’s nuclear program will have no limitations in production including enrichment capacity and percentage and number of enriched uranium and research and expansion.” The announcement followed several steps by Iran to move away from the terms of the agreement, nearly two years after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States. The other parties to the deal included Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. None except the United States have left the agreement, which was a key foreign policy achievement of former Mr. Obama. Since that renunciation, the Trump administration has imposed severe sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s economy. The nuclear agreement ended some economic sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledge to use nuclear power peacefully.  Iran’s statement on Sunday did not include details about its enrichment ambitions. And the country did not say that it was expelling the inspectors who monitor its nuclear program.  Mr. Trump seemed to respond to the announcement on Monday with an all-caps post on Twitter: A senior adviser to Mr. Trump on Monday said that the president held open the possibility of renegotiating a nuclear deal with Iran. “He said he’s open to meet if Iran wants to start behaving like a normal country,” Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s White House counselor, told reporters. The European parties to the deal, including Britain, France and Germany, as well as China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, had struggled to preserve the agreement as tensions between the United States and Iran worsened. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a daily news briefing that there was still hope for the nuclear deal. He noted that Tehran had said it would continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iranian activities under the agreement, and that it could return to the pact under the right conditions. “We believe that although Iran has been compelled to reduce adherence owing to external factors, it has also demonstrated restraint,” Mr. Geng said. In a joint statement on Sunday night, Britain, France and Germany called on Iran to refrain from violence and to return to “full compliance with its commitments” under the 2015 nuclear agreement, which Tehran has seemed to all but have abandoned. The statement followed Iran’s announcement that day that it would no longer abide by the limits to uranium enrichment set out in the deal, a move that seemed to finally kill off the agreement after months during which Tehran had carefully breached less significant limits. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal in 2018. The European statement seemed somewhat forlorn, since its efforts to preserve the deal have been weak, hamstrung in part by a desire to maintain good relations with Washington. The statement did not support the drone strike on the Iranian general but did acknowledge American concerns, saying that, “we have condemned the recent attacks’’ on coalition forces in Iraq and “are gravely concerned by the negative role played by Iran in the region.’’ The statement called for “de-escalation” of tensions from all parties and reaffirmed the Europeans’ determination “to continuing the fight against Islamic State, which remains a priority.’’ And it called on Iraq “to continue to supply the necessary support to the coalition’’ — in other words, to not expel American and NATO troops.  The secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, called an emergency meeting of the alliance’s advisers on Monday afternoon. During a news conference following the meeting Mr. Stoltenberg said NATO would be suspending training operations on the ground in Iraq.  “At our meeting today, Allies expressed their strong support for the fight against ISIS and for the NATO mission in Iraq,” he said. “In everything that we do, the safety of our personnel is paramount. As such, we have temporarily suspended our training on the ground.” Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union foreign policy chief, posted on Twitter that while the bloc regretted Iran’s announcement on the deal, it would wait for independent verification from the international nuclear monitoring group to determine what actions would be taken. Peter Stano, his spokesman, said during a news briefing in Brussels said that de-escalation was the goal. “It’s in our interest as Europeans to maintain this agreement,” Mr. Stano said.  On Monday, Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, said that the Europeans would talk to Iran and planned to come up with a coordinated response. “This could be the first step toward the end of this agreement, which would be a great loss,” Mr. Maas told a German radio station. “And so we will weigh things up very, very responsibly.” Russian officials have been sharply critical of the targeted killing in Iraq but have not otherwise intimated how the Kremlin might respond, or whether Moscow, which has longstanding ties with Tehran, might play a mediating role. President Vladimir V. Putin invited Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to visit Moscow on Saturday to discuss the strike, among other issues, the Kremlin announced. Oil prices surged and stock markets in Asia fell on Monday morning, as the impact of General Suleimani’s death ricocheted around the world. The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, jumped above $70 in futures trading as markets digested a steady flow of news over the weekend. It fell back below that level, to $69.92 a barrel, when markets opened in Europe, though the price was still about 5 percent higher than before the killing last week. The sudden escalation in tensions in a region that supplies much of the world’s petroleum has roiled oil markets. The West Texas Intermediate, the American oil benchmark, rose 1.9 percent to $64.22 a barrel in futures trading. Analysts at Capital Economics have warned that the price of oil could spike to $150 a barrel if the bellicose rhetoric between the two countries turned into action. “The price of oil would soar in the event of full-blown military conflict in the Middle East,” said Alexander Kozul-Wright, a commodities economist at Capital Economics. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, fresh from winning a mandate to take Britain out of the European Union, faces a particularly vexing challenge in dealing with the escalation between the United States and Iran. In the first foreign policy crisis of the post-Brexit era, London is caught between its traditional alliance with Washington — one that Mr. Johnson wants to deepen further with a trade agreement — and the new relationship with Europe. In his first statement on Mr. Trump’s decision to strike the general, Mr. Johnson took pains to emphasize the threat posed by the Iranian military leader and said, “We will not lament his death.” But Mr. Johnson also called on all sides to avoid aggravating the situation, echoing the language used by the French and German governments. Mr. Johnson suggested he wanted to play a mediating role and noted that he had spoken to Mr. Trump, as well as to Mr. Macron of France and Ms. Merkel of Germany. The European governments have been more circumspect in their reactions to the American strike, with the Germans criticizing Mr. Trump’s threat to impose sanctions on Iraq if Baghdad were to expel American troops from bases in the country. Mr. Johnson was said to be upset that Mr. Trump had not notified him of the strike in advance, but he can ill afford a falling out with the president, given Britain’s need to initiate trade talks with Washington The United States Embassy in Israel said in a security alert on Monday that tension in the Middle East could result in rocket attacks or other dangerous situations for Americans who are abroad. “Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy strongly encourages U.S. citizens to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness, as security incidents, including rocket fire, often take place without warning,” the embassy said. The embassy said people should keep a low profile, be aware of their surroundings and monitor local media, among other suggestions.  António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, said in a statement on Monday that “Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century.” “Even nuclear nonproliferation can no longer be taken for granted,” he said. “This caldron of tensions is leading more and more countries to take unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation.”He said he was urging world leaders to stop the escalation. A United States government website was hacked over the weekend to display messages vowing revenge for General Suleimani’s death and a doctored photograph of Mr. Trump being punched in the jaw.  It was not immediately clear if the attack on the website of the Federal Depository Library Program had come from Iran. But the intrusion was consistent with the work of low-level  Iranian hackers who could be acting independently, experts said. A security analysis by United States officials found that “none of the site’s data was compromised.” James A. Lewis, a former government official and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said hackers probably targeted the first agency they could find “that had weak security.” He said the hack was probably not conducted by Iran’s more sophisticated team but instead recalled a “low-budget hack of the sort Iran’s ‘patriot hackers’ are known for, including the cheesy imagery.” Bigger agencies have better defenses and are likely to be safe, Mr. Lewis said.

"Venezuela’s Maduro Claims Control of National Assembly, Tightening Grip on Power",2020-01-05,By Julie Turkewitz,"['CARACAS — Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, moved on Sunday to consolidate his grip on power by taking control of the country’s last independent institution and sidelining the lawmaker who had staked a rival claim to the presidency. As Mr. Maduro’s security forces surrounded the National Assembly building, his supporters blocked the re-election of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the body’s head. That deprived Mr. Guaidó of the position that allowed him challenge to Mr. Maduro’s leadership. By the end of a chaotic day, Venezuela’s political turmoil had somehow found a way to worsen. The country already had two men who claim to be its rightful president and two rival legislatures. Now, one of the legislative bodies has two competing leaders. After Maduro backers elected their own man on Sunday to lead the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó’s supporters gathered at a newspaper’s headquarters, and in a dramatic roll call vote, re-elected him to the leadership position.  The political chaos comes at a time when Venezuela is facing economic collapse. Hunger is widespread, and millions have fled the country. By seizing control of the National Assembly, Mr. Maduro cemented his control over the country. But the move was immediately denounced by members of the Venezuelan opposition, who called it a “parliamentary coup d’état,” and by critics abroad.  “Maduro saw this as an opportunity to take over the only institution still widely regarded as legitimate,” said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue. “The international community will not recognize the new National Assembly.” A year ago, Mr. Guaidó declared himself head of a caretaker government, just two weeks after being elected head of the Assembly. Standing in the streets of Caracas with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Mr. Guaidó asserted that Mr. Maduro’s 2018 election was fraudulent.  Invoking an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant, he claimed the country’s leadership. That claim was quickly recognized by dozens of foreign governments, including the United States, which backed Mr. Guaidó effort to take power by imposing crippling sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government. To maintain his claim the interim presidency, Mr. Guaidó needed to be re-elected as head of the Assembly on Sunday, according to analysts inside and outside the country. His victory was expected, since the opposition controls the legislative body. But at the last minute, members of the National Guard prevented Mr. Guaidó and other supporters from entering the Assembly’s building. Video footage showed Mr. Guaidó attempting to climb over the spiked metal fence to gain entry to the building where the vote would be held.  Inside, Mr. Maduro’s party swore in as head of the Assembly a legislator named Luis Parra, a former member of the opposition who turned against Mr. Guaidó after the Assembly leader opened a corruption claim against him. There was no vote count. Mr. Parra then issued a statement calling for a “national reconciliation,” saying that his first goal was to put an end to confrontations “from those sectors that clearly wanted to destroy the Parliament today.” On national television on Sunday night, Mr. Maduro called the election of Mr. Parra “a rebellion from within the Assembly” and said “the country rejected and rejects Juan Guaidó.” The United States condemned the move.  Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for the Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Mr. Guaidó “remains Venezuela’s interim president under its Constitution.” He said that Sunday’s “phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum.” In recent weeks, the opposition and the United States government had accused Mr. Maduro of trying to block Mr. Guaidó’s re-election by bribing and harassing lawmakers. In December, Elliott Abrams, the United States special envoy to Venezuela, accused Mr. Maduro of trying to pay deputies up to $500,000 each to vote against Mr. Guaidó’s re-election. In an interview just days after Christmas, Mr. Guaidó, 36, insisted that he had the votes for re-election. But he acknowledged that Mr. Maduro was unpredictable and that anything could happen. “There is no manual,” he said, “for battling a dictatorship.” A year after Mr. Guaidó first stepped onto the national stage, garnering widespread support among Venezuelans, he appeared to be losing ground. Since February, his approval ratings had fallen about 20 points, to 42 percent, according to the Caracas polling firm Datanálisis. Venezuelans are struggling to deal with unmet expectations. And in Mr. Guaidó’s own assessment, he underestimated the government’s “ability to inflict harm” — meaning its willingness to threaten those who dissent. He cited the recent disappearance of one member of his party, Gilber Caro, who has not been seen since Dec. 20.  “The persecution is brutal,” he said. He also gravely underestimated Mr. Maduro’s hold on the armed forces, which are one of the pillars of his government, analysts said. In late April, in one of the most dramatic moments of the year, Mr. Guaidó gathered his supporters at an air base named La Carlota and called for mass military defections. It was, he said, the final stage of “Operation Liberty.” “The moment is now!” he said on Twitter. “Together we’re invincible!” But the troops failed to arrive. Mr. Maduro had spent years handing privileges and lucrative business connections to high-ranking officers to ensure their loyalty. The officers Mr. Guaidó sought to sway had everything to lose — and at best uncertain gains — if they switched sides. Manuel Cristopher Figuera, Mr. Maduro’s former head of intelligence and the highest-ranking official to defect last year, said in an interview said that two top officials who had pledged to support Mr. Maduro’s ouster ultimately reneged, helping seal Mr. Guaidó’s fate. While huge protests in the region have forced out the president of Bolivia and pushed leaders in Chile and Ecuador to respond to citizens’ demands, Venezuelans have mostly retreated from the streets. And President Trump, who once floated the possibility of a military intervention in Venezuela, has turned his attention elsewhere. “It’s not that the Maduro government is particularly strong, but it survived,” said Margarita López Maya, a longtime Venezuelan political scientist who lives in Caracas. “And this is victory for them: surviving.”  Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.']",It was the last political institution in opposition hands.

U.S. Bet Guaidó Could Transform Venezuela. It Hasn’t Happened.,2020-01-07,"By Julie Turkewitz, Lara Jakes and Ana Vanessa Herrero","['CARACAS — A charismatic, 35-year-old politician steps out before a crowd of thousands in Venezuela and claims the presidency in the biggest challenge to date to the country’s autocratic leader. Within minutes, the United States — followed by dozens of countries — throws its support behind the challenger, Juan Guaidó, backed by crippling sanctions designed to weaken the current government and reinforce his hand. That was last January — the beginning of what the Trump administration said was an all-out effort to oust Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, in which “all options,” even military ones, were on the table. But a year later, the administration’s policy has been frustrated. Mr. Guaidó is so removed from power that, this weekend, he was barred from even entering the legislature, where he was seeking re-election as the body’s leader. In one dramatic moment, captured on video, a desperate Mr. Guaidó tried to scale the spiked metal fence that surrounds the assembly building. But government forces pulled him down while inside, Mr. Maduro’s supporters elected one of their allies to lead the legislature — a move intended to deprive Mr. Guaidó of the position that gives him legal cover to stake a rival claim on the presidency. The Trump administration on Monday sought to cast the events in Caracas as a sign that Mr. Maduro’s power was waning. But at a time when the administration is already facing crises at home — an impeachment inquiry — and abroad — the repercussions of an attack that killed Iran’s most powerful general — Mr. Maduro’s actions suggest that the gamble the United States took on Mr. Guaidó is looking increasingly like a failure. “It’s impossible to overstate what a huge blow all of this is to U.S. strategy in Venezuela,” said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela program at the Washington Office on Latin America.  On Monday, Mr. Guaidó and many of his allies vowed to press on with their campaign to bring down Mr. Maduro, whose leadership has dragged Venezuela, an oil-rich nation, into the seventh year of a devastating economic crisis that has left much of the population without access to sufficient food or medicine.  The day before, in defiance of Mr. Maduro’s forces, opposition legislators gathered in the headquarters of a newspaper and, in an emotional ceremony before a Venezuelan flag, held their own vote, which they said re-elected Mr. Guaidó as head of the assembly. At a news conference in downtown Caracas, Mr. Guaidó said he would enter the country’s legislative building on Tuesday, when this year’s session begins, with his “chest forward” and “risking skin,” to assume the role of president of the assembly.  “We’re going to do our work,” he said, condemning the weekend’s “violent takeover” of the assembly as a “farce that nobody recognizes.” American officials in Washington sought to bolster that narrative. “What you saw yesterday was something the regime didn’t want to do,” Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special envoy for Venezuela issues, told reporters at the State Department. “They wanted to win the vote in the National Assembly, and they couldn’t do it. With weeks and months of effort, they couldn’t do it, and they were forced to this last desperate resort of using the military.” “So I don’t think they come out of yesterday stronger,” Mr. Abrams said. “I think they come out of yesterday weaker.” He said the United States was preparing to send more aid to support the opposition to Mr. Maduro, including funds to support an independent press, the National Assembly and other democratic institutions. Mr. Abrams also raised the threat of imposing more economic sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s government and its officials. But he also said American officials had perhaps underestimated the level of Russian and Cuban support that had helped the Venezuelan president remain in power. “We think all the time about how to do better,” Mr. Abrams said. It was a far cry from a year ago, when Mr. Guaidó, a student activist turned legislator from the coastal city of La Guaira, took the helm of the country’s national assembly, the last major institution in the country controlled by the opposition.  Days into his mandate, Mr. Guaidó invoked an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant. Mr. Maduro’s most recent election, he claimed, had been a sham. At the time, public anger at Mr. Maduro was hitting a fever pitch, and Mr. Guaidó, the son of a teacher and a taxi driver, was initially embraced by many as a fresh voice in a place where so many had failed.  But a year of high-stakes maneuvers by Mr. Guaidó — like trying to persuade the military to turn against the president and trying to bring in much-needed humanitarian aid across the border — failed to bring down Mr. Maduro, who retains firm control of the military and of the country’s resources.  Instead, Mr. Maduro appears to have tightened his grip on the country, jailing and threatening opponents. He is accused by the United Nations and human rights advocates of widespread human rights violations. Millions of Venezuelans have spent the last few years on an emotional seesaw, pinning their hopes for change on one leader after another, only to watch them fail and the opposition fracture.  On Monday, many said the events of the weekend felt like a final, brutal crash.  “I don’t have hope anymore,” said Carlos Muñoz, 29, who sells ice cream from a cart in Caracas.  A year ago, Mr. Muñoz was planning to leave Venezuela for Peru, following millions of others who have fled the country to find work or escape persecution. When Mr. Guaidó appeared, he put his plans on hold.  After Sunday, though, he made the decision to leave.  “He lost the assembly,” said Mr. Muñoz of Mr. Guaidó “That was the only thing he had.” José Caballero, 51, a taxi driver, said that he had survived every year by repeating to himself, “this is the year everything is changing, this is the year.”  “And nothing happens,” he went on, “now I don’t want to say anything like that anymore.” In public, Mr. Guaidó has remained upbeat. But in private, the toll of the last year sometimes shows.  He spent one of last days of 2019 delivering presents to children in La Guaira, trailed by two government minders on motorbikes. In a lengthy interview between toy drops, he said his wife, Fabiana Rosales, and their toddler are followed even to their daughter’s preschool.  The rented apartment they share in a middle-class neighborhood in Caracas is half-empty, the home of a man who seems unsure where he will sleep tomorrow. The television is on the floor, child’s toys are stuffed in a corner, and the walls are bare, save for a large portrait of a Venezuelan nun named María de San José, known for aiding the ill. Like many Venezuelans in the capital, he has running water about two hours a day. At one point, when he raised the topic of his mother, who left the country for medical treatment that she could not find in Venezuela, his eyes turned red and he began to cry. “Of course I miss her,” he said. Mr. Guaidó’s popularity has declined significantly in the last year, according to polling from the Caracas firm Datanálasis. But he remains the most popular politician in the country, according to the firm.  And in an interview, the firm’s director, José Gil Yepes, said Mr. Guaidó’s popularity may rise in the coming weeks, “because of all the things the government did wrong” on Sunday. Mayrely Calderón, 39, a pharmacist, was among those who remained faithful to Mr. Guaidó. “He’s the one who will help us get rid of Maduro,” she said.  Julie Turkewitz and Ana Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas. Lara Jakes reported from Washington.']","America threw its might behind Juan Guaidó when he claimed the presidency, a direct challenge to President Nicolás Maduro.

"A New Toll in Mexico’s Drug War: More Than 61,000 Vanished",2020-01-07,By Paulina Villegas,"['More than 61,000 people have been forcibly disappeared in Mexico in recent years, government officials announced on Monday, a drastic increase of an earlier estimate of the toll of the country’s endemic drug-related violence and cartel warfare.  “These are data of horror,” Karla Quintana, head of Mexico’s National Search Commission which leads the efforts to find the missing country wide, said in a news conference. Behind the numbers, “there are many painful stories from families both in Mexico and of migrants,” she said. The new figures showed a sharp increase from a prior official estimate of 40,000 disappearances from early 2018, and Ms. Quintana said it comes from updated and carefully revised information from the offices of local prosecutors.  The official tally is now 61,637 people who have disappeared since 1964, Ms. Quintana said, the vast majority since 2006, the year the crackdown on drug cartels was launched by then-president Felipe Calderón. Last year alone, during the first year of leftist government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, more than 9,000 people were forcibly disappeared, said Alejandro Encinas, under secretary of human rights. More than 500 field searches across Mexico led to the discovery of 800 clandestine graves and the unearthing of 1,124 bodies. Mexican officials said most disappearances have taken place in 10 different states in swaths of the country with a heavy presence of drug cartels. More than half of the overall reported cases were of young people between 15 and 34 years old, 74 percent of whom were men, officials said. The government announcement differed from those of past administrations, which often played down the issue of drug violence and offered little details about the extent of the issue. A longstanding history of disappearances in Latin America during anti-leftist “dirty wars” in the 1960s and ’70s left tens of thousands of political dissidents and activists either dead or disappeared in countries like Argentina and Chile. In Mexico, the number cases of disappeared people surged more recently amid raging violence as drug cartels battled each other over territory and trafficking routes. As Mexican security forces were deployed to the streets to confront the ever-growing power of organized crime groups, criminals began implementing a highly efficient and vicious strategy: disposing bodies and tossing them into graves in desolate areas, rivers and mountains, to leave no evidence behind. One of the most emblematic disappearance cases, which  shed light on the entrenched corruption of Mexican security forces who sometimes participate in crimes, occurred in 2014 when 43 students from Ayotzinapa were attacked and kidnapped by local police officers working for a local drug gang in southern Mexico. The López Obrador government has faced criticism that it lacks an adequate security strategy to deal with the country’s rampant violence, underscored by recent cases like the siege of the city of Culiacán by the Sinaloa cartel and the massacre of nine members of a Mormon sect in northern Mexico last fall.

Pedro Sánchez Will Lead Modern Spain’s First Coalition Government,2020-01-07,By Raphael Minder,"['The leader of the Socialist party in Spain, Pedro Sánchez, was narrowly approved as prime minister by Parliament on Tuesday, clearing his way to form the country’s first coalition government since the return to democracy in the 1970s. The vote ended months of political stalemate, during which Mr. Sánchez had led a caretaker administration. He will now preside over a fragile minority government from the left. Its survival could hinge on his ability to bring to an end the long-simmering dispute over Catalonia, the restive region in northeastern Spain. Last year, Spain held two national elections, in April and in November. Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists won both, but each time without a parliamentary majority. After a slightly weaker result in the November balloting, Mr. Sánchez agreed to form a coalition with Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the smaller and more radical Unidas Podemos party. It then took seven more weeks for Mr. Sánchez to garner sufficient support from smaller regional parties, particularly separatist lawmakers from Catalonia, to achieve the backing he needed to become prime minister.  Together, the Socialists and Unidas Podemos hold 155 of the 350 seats in Parliament. The novelty of a coalition government reflects in large part an increasingly volatile and fragmented political landscape, which has made it nearly impossible for any single party in Spain to emerge from an election as a clear-cut winner, as had regularly been the case until 2015, when the country’s two-party system imploded.  Spanish politics has become a five-party contest, after the recent emergence of the ultranationalist Vox party.  In previous decades, the Socialists and the conservative Popular Party alternated in office, governing sometimes with an absolute majority and at other times by striking deals in Parliament with smaller parties to pass their legislation. But Spain has now held four elections in four years, with none of them yielding an unambiguous winner. On Sunday, in the first round of voting by lawmakers, Mr. Sánchez failed to gain the absolute majority that he needed. But on Tuesday he needed only to receive more votes in favor than against. The conflict over Catalonia dominated the acrimonious parliamentary debate, particularly after a recent pledge by Mr. Sánchez that his next government would hold a fresh round of negotiations with the separatist politicians who have governed in the region since 2015.  His offer of talks provoked a blistering response from right-wing politicians, who accused Mr. Sánchez of caving in to the separatists to continue in office and of paving the way for the breakup of Spain.  Before the vote on Tuesday, Pablo Casado, the leader of the Popular Party, which is now the main opposition, repeated his earlier warning that Spain was set to have “the most radical” government in its history.  He told lawmakers that the next Socialist-led government would be at the mercy of the “blackmail” of Catalan separatists, while also having to comply with the far-left demands of Unidas Podemos.  Directly addressing Mr. Sánchez, Mr. Casado said, “Now the problem will be yours: If you meet the demands of your anti-system partners, you will break up Spain. If not, they will throw you out onto the street.” Mr. Sánchez responded by pledging that his government would end “the toxic climate” that Mr. Casado and other right-wing lawmakers were fueling and would instead work to ease nationalist tensions within Spain.  “We are all born under the same sun,” he told lawmakers, quoting Manuel Azaña, who led the Spanish Republican government that ended during the civil war of the 1930s. Mr. Casado warned that his party would take legal action against Mr. Sánchez and his government if they did not ensure the removal of Quim Torra, the president of the Catalan regional administration. Mr. Torra is appealing a court ruling that would suspend him from office for 18 months, after he was found guilty in December of civil disobedience in his show of support for jailed separatists.  Supporters of Catalan independence have also demanded parliamentary immunity for Oriol Junqueras, the leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia party, after a European Court ruling found that Spain should not have stopped him from being sworn in as a member of the European Parliament after elections in May.  Mr. Junqueras is serving a 13-year prison sentence for sedition, after being sentenced last year by the Spanish Supreme Court as one of the former members of the Catalan government that unsuccessfully sought to declare independence in October 2017. As he prepares to take office, Mr. Sánchez finds himself once again in an unwieldy relationship with the Catalan separatist lawmakers.  In June 2018, he unexpectedly became prime minister after seizing on a court ruling that found the Popular Party guilty of operating a slush fund. Mr. Sánchez sprung a vote of no confidence against Mariano Rajoy, then the prime minister, with the support of Unidas Podemos and of Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. Mr. Sánchez won and took power. In early 2019, Catalan lawmakers withdrew their support, scuttling Mr. Sánchez’s budget plan and forcing him instead to call an election that left Spain in political limbo for the rest of the year. Mr. Sánchez and his Socialist party say that their plan to return to the negotiating table with the separatists will not lead to a binding independence referendum in Catalonia. But they have agreed to submit the outcome of the negotiations to some kind of consultative vote in the region.  In the coming days, Mr. Sánchez is set to name a coalition government that will include a handful of ministers from Unidas Podemos. Mr. Iglesias, the party’s 41-year old leader, is set to become Mr. Sánchez’s deputy. The two men have a history of acrimony that they have tried to set aside with the coalition deal. In June 2018, Mr. Sánchez won plaudits for forming a government in which women outnumbered men.  One of his first priorities this time will be to draft a national budget for 2020 that can be approved by Parliament. As part of his deal with Unidas Podemos, he has pledged to raise corporate taxes and income taxes on the wealthy.  He has also promised to reverse part of a labor law that loosened collective bargaining rules and made it easier for employers to fire workers.

A Victim’s Account Fuels a Reckoning Over Abuse of Children in France,2020-01-07,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. “Under 16 Years Old,” was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity. Still, he never spent a day in jail for his actions or suffered any repercussion. Instead, he won acclaim again and again. Much of France’s literary and journalism elite celebrated him and his work for decades. Now 83, Mr. Matzneff was awarded a major literary prize in 2013 and, just two months ago, one of France’s most prestigious publishing houses published his latest work. But the publication, last Thursday, of an account by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, has suddenly fueled an intense debate in France over its historically lax attitude toward sex with minors. It has also shone a particularly harsh light on a period during which some of France’s leading literary figures and newspapers — names as big as Foucault, Sartre, Libération and Le Monde — aggressively promoted the practice as a form of human liberation, or at least defended it. A day after the publication of Ms. Springora’s book, “Le Consentement,” or “Consent,” which sold out quickly at many Paris bookstores, the fallout continued. Prosecutors in Paris announced that after “analyzing” its contents, they had opened an investigation into the case and would also look for other victims in and out of France. [Update: Gabriel Matzneff has been charged after years of writing about his own pedophilia.] In France, it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15. But it is not automatically considered rape, unlike in countries with statutory rape laws where people who are underage are considered incapable of giving consent. With changing attitudes toward sex and gender equality, France toughened laws against sex crimes in 2018 and also extended the statute of limitations for prosecution — raising it to 30 years, up from 20 years — allowing victims to press charges until the age of 48. The new law, which is not retroactive, would not apply in the case of Ms. Springora. In the days leading up to its publication, her book, “Le Consentement,” had already compelled many in France to try uncomfortably to position themselves in the face of a problem that had never been hidden.  The former host of France’s most famous literary television program struggled to explain why he and other guests — except, tellingly, the only non-French invitee — laughed with good humor at Mr. Matzneff’s preferences for minors. Most of his longtime champions have remained silent, though a few still came to his defense, including the former book editor of Le Monde. France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, said that he supported Mr. Matzneff’s victims and announced that the government would review a writer’s allowance given to him — an abrupt shift in the government’s position. In 1995, long after Mr. Matzneff had written about his past, the minister of culture at the time awarded him the Order of Arts and Letters. “All this information had been widely available, Matzneff’s contemporaries knew very well, and university studies had been conducted on these questions, but it’s taken a victim’s account to trigger this process,” said Anne-Claude Ambroise-Rendu, a historian and the author of “The History of Pedophilia.” So far, however, Ms. Springora — now 47 and the head of the publishing company Julliard — is the only one of his victims to have spoken out. After hesitating for years, she told the French news media, she decided to break her silence after being outraged that a literary prize, the Renaudot, was awarded to Mr. Matzneff in 2013. In “Le Consentement,” Ms. Springora recounts being seduced at the age of 14 by the famous writer, who was then in his 50s. Introduced to him by her own mother, Ms. Springora writes that she fell in love with Mr. Matzneff and became disenchanted only upon discovering writings in which he described relations with countless other girls and boys, including those he met on sex tours in Southeast Asia. She also relates the depression and other psychological problems she suffered from the relationship, and the years it took her to recover. “He was not a good man,” Ms. Springora writes. “He was in fact what we’re taught to dread since childhood: an ogre.” In messages to Le Parisien, Mr. Matzneff wrote that the book’s reported contents were “unjust and excessive” and spoke of the “beauty of the love that we shared, Vanessa and I.”  And in a long, rambling letter addressed to Ms. Springora and published in L’Express on Thursday, he wrote that he would not read the book because “it would hurt him too much” and accused her of seeking to “harm” and “destroy him.” Caught now in the crosscurrents of France’s changing attitudes toward sex, Mr. Matzneff is the product and longtime beneficiary of France’s May 68 movement, the social revolution started in 1968 by students and unions against France’s old order.  With the slogan, “It’s forbidden to forbid,” the movement rebelled against authority and fought against imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and homophobia. Some also argued for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings. Mr. Matzneff was one of the leading writers to advocate the legalization of sex with children. In “Les Moins de Seize Ans,"" or “Under 16 Years Old,” he writes, “To sleep with a child, it’s a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure.” First published in 1974, it was republished in 2005. Thinkers on the left, like Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, spoke in defense of the practice, or came to the defense of men accused of engaging in sex with people below the age of consent in France. Libération, the newspaper co-founded by Sartre, championed pedophiles as a discriminated minority and ran personal ads by adults seeking children for sex.  The newspaper ran “revolting” articles about pedophilia into the 1980s, and its staff included activists who fought for the right to engage in “sexual relations with children,” its editor, Laurent Joffrin, acknowledged in an editorial this week, adding that the publication now opposed the practice. Tolerance of it was not limited to the left. For years, though less aggressive than Libération, Le Monde, the centrist newspaper, published a weekly column by Mr. Matzneff and articles defending those accused of having sex with underage partners, including one in 1977 that was signed by Sartre, de Beauvoir and Barthes. While the right attacked pedophiles, some of its leaders were close to Mr. Matzneff. Pierre Verdrager, a sociologist and author of “L’Enfant Interdit,” or “Forbidden Child,” a book on the politics surrounding pedophilia in the 1970s, said that what united its defenders was the belief that France had an “aristocracy” that was not bound to ordinary norms of conduct.  While the ordinary French appeared revolted by the apologists, writers were considered part of this elite and were even expected to engage in acts of moral transgression, Mr. Verdrager said. “There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex,” Mr. Verdrager said. “And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools.” Among Mr. Matzneff’s longtime supporters, a few, like Josyane Savigneau, the former book editor of Le Monde, have defended him in public. “The witch hunt continues,” she wrote on Twitter. Bernard Pivot, who invited Mr. Matzneff several times on his televised literary show, “Apostrophes,” said that back in the 1980s “literature was more important than morality.”  “We are all the intellectual and moral products of a country and especially of a time,” he said, adding that he regretted lacking the “words that were needed” in interviewing Mr. Matzneff. In one program in 1990, the one guest to criticize Mr. Matzneff was the only foreigner present, Denise Bombardier, a Canadian writer, who called the writer “pathetic” and his writing “boring.” “Right now,” she said after listening to the host and other guests talk playfully and joke with Mr. Matzneff about his preference for underage girls, “I feel as if I’m on another planet.”']",A French author wrote for years about his predilection for children and continued to win acclaim. Now one of them has spoken out. 
Koala Mittens and Baby Bottles: Saving Australia’s Animals After Fires,2020-01-07,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['WATERHOLES, Australia — The convoy of vehicles fleeing a raging inferno in the forest of southeastern Australia ferried a copious cargo: 11 koalas, 15 kangaroos, five chickens, two possums, two dogs and a lorikeet. Susan Pulis, who runs a wildlife shelter, had rallied her friends to pack the animals in blankets and baskets and take them to safety on the coast. One friend gutted her downstairs bedroom to house five of the kangaroos. Ms. Pulis has kept the youngest joeys in quilt pouches in another’s living room. “Since the fires, they are very different,” she said of the animals, “very on edge.” As wildfires have killed at least 24 people, destroyed more than 1,400 homes and ravaged 15 million acres, they have also inflicted a grievous toll on Australia’s renowned wildlife. Hundreds of millions of animals, many found on no other continent, may have perished, according to some estimates, devastating the country’s unique ecosystems. “We will have taken many species that weren’t threatened close to extinction, if not to extinction,” said Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist and botanist at Curtin University, in Perth.  Even the animals that survived, scampering away or hunkering down, may die from dehydration or starvation, Professor Dixon added. “It’s a biological Armageddon rarely seen,” he said. Wildlife in Australia was already under threat before these fires, as humans have changed the landscape. Agribusiness is among the top contributors to deforestation, which decimates wildlife populations, scientists say.  The astronomical estimates of animal losses and the heart-rending images of singed koalas during this disastrous fire season have spread the concern worldwide. Quilters in the Netherlands have made mittens for koalas with burned paws. New Zealanders are stitching joey pouches and bat wraps. Some experts have been dubious of the high numbers that have spread widely on social media, which are based on estimates of population densities of mammals, birds and reptiles from previously published studies. The death toll is arrived at by multiplying the number of animals expected to inhabit a given area by the total acreage burned.  But it is impossible to know how many animals managed to flee, for instance. Limited access to the burned lands, as well as the difficulty of documenting individual animal deaths, complicate efforts to assess the scale of the damage. Whatever the numbers, it is clear that the devastation is immense, scientists say.  “It’s dangerous to put a number to them,” said Corey Bradshaw, a fellow in ecology at Flinders University in Adelaide, in the south. But, he added, “there’s no question there has been deaths.” At least a quarter of the koala population may have been lost in New South Wales, according to various estimates. Significant numbers of the southern brown bandicoot and the long-footed potoroo, a kind of wallaby whose entire habitat has been ravaged by fire, have also most likely been lost.  On Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia, experts said thousands of kangaroos and koalas had been killed in the fire that has now ravaged a third of the island. There are also grave fears for the fate of a subspecies of glossy black cockatoos, of which there were only about 300 to 370 remaining before the fires. It is not only wildlife that has been ravaged. In Batlow, 285 miles southwest of Sydney, a video taken by a reporter showed the scorched corpses of sheep and cows strewn along a highway. Carcasses like these have raised biological fears around the country. Buchan, a farming region in the southern state of Victoria, has also been badly affected, with farmers having to put down burned livestock at a time when drought had already made earning a living nearly impossible. Farmers in the nearby town of Bairnsdale said that a cattle sale was planned Thursday  to unload their remaining livestock, some of which may be injured. Tina Moon, a farmer in Sarsfield, a town in Victoria’s southeast, said many burned cattle in the region had to be euthanized. She said she had saved her house, but had no idea how she would make an income in the coming months.  To protect Australia’s wildlife, rescuers like Ms. Pulis, who fled the forest for the coast late last month, are battling immense changes to the country’s landscape on a tiny scale. They cannot save Australia’s wildlife on their own, but their work is reinforcing scientists’ judgment that intervention will be increasingly necessary to protect animals on a hotter, more fiery planet.  Around the country, people have banded together to help feed, find and rehabilitate survivors.  In the fire-ravaged town of Mallacoota, one man says he has rescued nine koalas, for which the community is working to build a shelter. Others have left out seed, water and grasses for dehydrated and hungry fauna. “I know it doesn’t bring back properties, but for some it can give a sense of not giving up the fight,” said Katharine Catelotti, of Sydney, whose family lost a small shack in Wollomombi, more than 300 miles north of the city, and has been putting feed out for wildlife as well as keeping a small number in her home. The task for others has been more grim. One woman told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that she was checking the pouches of dead kangaroos for joeys and marking the ones without them so that other searchers would not have to repeat her efforts.  For Ms. Pulis, evacuating her few animals — which had already been rescued, some of them more than once, from starvation, dog attacks and car accidents — was simply part of life. In 2013, she founded a wildlife shelter on Raymond Island, a town just off the coast, with the intention of rehabilitating injured and abandoned creatures. In August, she relocated to Waterholes, 30 miles inland, because of the clearing of the island’s trees, which had made it impossible for her to release the koalas into an environment where they could find sufficient food. Somehow, her property in Waterholes, threatened twice by fires this season, remains standing, a lush oasis at the end of a blackened road in the eastern Victoria region of East Gippsland, where smoldering and fallen trees, charred earth and melted road signs stretch for hundreds of miles.  “It’s a holocaust,” Ms. Pulis said as she drove toward her home on Monday for the first time since blistering heat brought through a ferocious fire front.  Cool weather and rain have since brought a reprieve. But smoke still hung in the air. As she reached the track leading to her property, Ms. Pulis began to cry.  “This was my koala feed,” she said of the scorched eucalyptus trees, which used to provide leaves for her animals. “It was absolutely alive.” At her property, Ms. Pulis tended to the stressed and dehydrated kangaroos she had been forced to leave behind. She gave each an injection to relieve their pain — they had most likely hopped so frantically away from the burning forest that they had injured themselves — and refreshed their water, which was contaminated by ash. On Saturday, as yards-high flames threatened her property for a second time, Ms. Pulis’s friend Jason Nicholson defended it with a hose and hundreds of gallons of water.  Neither could believe that it remained intact — the garden surrounding it still green, with cockatoos calling from the trees. They said they expected that wildlife, pushed out by the fires, would congregate in what was now a garden of Eden among miles of decimated forest. “The difference is here, you hear the birds,” Mr. Nicholson said. “Out there, it’s quiet. Deadly quiet.”  Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Nowra, Australia, and Damien Cave from Sydney.']","Millions of animals, many found on no other continent, may have perished, and Australians are taking care of survivors.

Iran Plane Crash Victims Came From at Least Seven Countries,2020-01-08,By Dan Bilefsky and Ian Austen,"['MONTREAL — There was the family of a prominent Iranian writer who had emigrated to Canada a few years ago. There was a newlywed couple. And there were international students and children.  The victims of a crash on Wednesday morning of a Boeing 737-800 included passengers and crew members from at least seven countries, among them at least 63 Canadians. It is unclear what caused the crash. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 went down amid tensions between the United States and Iran over the American drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Early Wednesday, Iran attacked two bases in Iraq that house United States troops.  The plane was bound for Kyiv and crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran. Everyone on board, at least 176 people, were killed.  Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said the victims included 82 Iranians and 11 Ukrainians, including nine Ukrainian crew members. Sixty-three passengers were from Canada, 10 from Sweden, four from Afghanistan, three from Germany and three from Britain, he said. For Canada, the crash was one of the worst losses of life in an aviation disaster. In 1985, a bomb exploded and killed 329 people aboard an Air India flight, most of them Canadians of Indian ancestry. Canada has one of the world’s largest shares of the Iranian diaspora; 210,000 people who identify as Iranian live in the country, and many of them fled their homeland after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Others arrived more recently, often drawn by education or employment opportunities. Iranian immigrants in Canada live largely in the suburbs of the country’s three largest cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Mahsha Alimardani, a doctoral student at Oxford University, wrote on Twitter that the route from Tehran to Toronto through Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, had become affordable for many Iranian-Canadians who did not have access to direct flights. Payman Parseyan, an Iranian immigrant in Edmonton, told the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster, that the disaster was “devastating” for the close-knit Iranian community in that city. People were glued to their televisions sets and seeking one another out in search of news about loved ones, he said. As many as 30 victims came from Edmonton.  Mr. Parseyan said they included two young girls, 9 and 14, as well as international students from Iran. Reza Akbari, president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, told The Edmonton Journal that the victims included doctors as well as a newlywed couple, Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gorji, 25, computer science students who had traveled to Iran for their wedding.  “It’s been a shock,” he told the newspaper. “I know some of these people in person. I had a chance to see them at different, parties, gatherings.”  “I can tell you pretty much every Iranian in Edmonton knew some of them,” Mr. Akbari said. “So it’s very devastating.”  The crash also took the lives of the wife and daughter of an Iranian author, Hamed Esmaeilion, a dentist celebrated as a leading writer of his generation. Husband-and-wife engineering professors at the University of Alberta, Mojgan Daneshmand and Pedram Mousavi, and their daughters Daria and Dorina Mousavi, were also killed. The university described Professor Daneshmand as a pioneering researcher in microwave sensors who had been making advances for a variety of products, including wearable health monitors. In North Vancouver, Arash Azrahimi, owner of Rosewood Photography, said several of the victims had been his customers. Two of them, he said, Mohammadhossein and Zeynab Asadilari, who were in their 20s, were children of a member of the Iranian government and had been living in Vancouver.  Other victims from Vancouver area included a couple — both of them doctors — and the wife and daughter of a bakery owner, he said.  Majid Mahichi, a Vancouver-based television producer of a Persian-language program, knew the doctor couple, Firouzeh Madini and Naser Pourshabanoshibi, for 40 years. He said they had gone to Iran to visit their parents and had one daughter, who did not travel with them. The pair moved to Canada about five years ago, Mr. Mahichi said. “They were a very happy couple,” he said. “They were so happy to have moved to Canada.” He said, “We have some friends who just wanted to visit their families — but now unfortunately, their bodies are coming back.” Laing O’Rourke, a construction company based in Britain, confirmed in an email on Wednesday that Saeed Tahmasebi Khademsadi, 35, who worked at the company office in Dartford, died in the crash. Mr. Tahmasebi, a civil engineer at Laing O’Rourke, was a doctoral candidate at Imperial College in London,  according to his LinkedIn page. Sam Zokaei, a reservoir engineer for BP, was also killed, the company confirmed. Mr. Zokaei, an Arabic and Persian speaker who was on holiday in Iran, had been with BP for the past 14 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. At a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said his government would ensure that the incident was fully investigated. “Canadians have questions, and they deserve answers,” he said. François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, said that he was in touch with the Ukrainian government and that he would keep Canadians informed as the situation became clearer. “Our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims, including many Canadians,” he wrote on Twitter. The Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned Canadians to avoid nonessential travel to Iran, citing “the volatile security situation, the regional threat of terrorism and the risk of arbitrary detention.” “Canadians, particularly dual Canadian-Iranian citizens, are at risk of being arbitrarily questioned, arrested and detained,” the travel warning says. “Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Canada will not be granted consular access to dual Canadian-Iranian citizens. Canadian-Iranian dual citizens should carefully consider the risks of traveling to Iran.” Transport Canada, the country’s transport ministry, said that Air Canada, the only Canadian air carrier that operates in the region, “had altered its routes to ensure the security of its flights into and over the Middle East.” Megan Specia and Iliana Magra contributed reporting from London, and Tracy Sherlock from Vancouver.']",The crash of a Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 reverberated around the world. Canada alone lost at least 63 people.
Iran Offers Mixed Message After Backing Away From Conflict With U.S.,2020-01-09,By Megan Specia,"['A day after President Trump backed away from further military conflict with Iran, a commander of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps declared that Iran would soon take “harsher revenge” on the United States for a drone strike last week that killed a top Iranian general. But another Iranian military leader said his country’s missile attacks targeting Americans in Iraq this week had not been intended to kill anyone.  The remarks were just some of the mixed messages put forth by Iranian leaders on Thursday after Iranian missile strikes, which hit two military bases in Iraq housing American troops. The slain commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, had led the Quds Force, a powerful branch of the corps, and his death reverberated across the country, prompting calls for revenge and the retaliatory strikes by Iran. The barrage of missiles on Wednesday took no American lives, Mr. Trump said, and appeared to have inflicted little damage on air bases in Asad and Erbil that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women. And though Tehran said afterward that it had “concluded proportionate measures” to avenge the killing of General Suleimani, officials in the region cautioned that Iran might not be done maneuvering and had not abandoned its goal to drive the United States out of the Middle East. On Thursday the commander of the Revolution Guards air force, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, described the strikes on the bases in Iraq as just the beginning of “a major operation” against the United States, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency, but he also noted that the strikes had not aimed to kill anyone. He quickly followed up with the claim that “tens of people were killed and wounded,” a point disputed by American, Iraqi and other international accounts.  A senior commander in the Revolutionary Guards, Abdollah Araghi, said on Thursday that Iran’s armed forces would “impose harsher revenge on the enemy in the near future,” according to Tasnim. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Thursday morning and warned of further action, according to the president’s office. “If the U.S. makes another mistake, it will receive a very dangerous response,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to the statement. The deputy general of the Revolutionary Guards, Ali Fadavi, also pledged vengeance, according to a separate report from the English-language version of Tasnim. “This move was one of the manifestations of our capabilities,” General Fadavi said in a speech in the central province of Isfahan on Thursday. “No country has ever made such a great move against the United States as we did. We dropped dozens of missiles into the heart of the U.S. base in Iraq and they couldn’t do a damn thing.”  The new leader of the Quds Force, Ismail Qaani, a longtime deputy of General Suleimani, released a statement on Thursday outlining his own commitment to moving forward with his predecessor’s agenda in the region, according to Tasnim. General Qaani added that the ultimate goal was to drive American forces out of the region. As the rhetoric from Iranian forces heated up, other international leaders were keen to de-escalate the situation. And many of the statements on Thursday seemed to stand in stark contrast to those made by Iranian government officials a day earlier.  The influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr called on Iran-backed militia groups not to carry out further attacks, even as he stressed that Iraqis should still seek to expel foreign troops, Reuters reported. “I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, parliamentary and international methods have been exhausted,” he was quoted as saying.  Some analysts cautioned that more military action by Iran was still a strong possibility despite the government’s vow that the retaliation had ended. Sanam Vakil, a scholar of Iran at Chatham House, a research center in London, said the possibility of strikes remained high, noting Iran’s escalatory activities in recent months to “gain limited leverage” in the long-running dispute with the United States over punishing sanctions.  “More kinetic action and reaction is inevitable,” Ms. Vakil wrote in a series of posts on Twitter outlining her perspective.  The lack of a direct back channel between Iran and the United States to ease tensions and the stalemate over the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump abruptly pulled out of last year, are also major complicating factors. “Without a real off ramp, low-level escalation” like missile attacks from proxy groups, cyberattacks and threats to Gulf shipping “will undoubtedly continue in the coming months if not through the US election,” she added. Pope Francis referred to the conflict on Thursday during an annual address to ambassadors to the Vatican. He said the tensions risked “compromising the gradual process of rebuilding in Iraq, as well as setting the groundwork for a vaster conflict that all of us would want to avert.” Francis appealed to the parties to return to “dialogue and self-restraint.” The United Nations Security Council said it would meet on Thursday, and the tensions between Iran and the United States were likely to dominate an agenda tackling international peace and security.  Charles Michel, president of the European Council, the European Union’s decision-making body, said he had spoken to Iran’s president on Thursday, according to a statement, and “expressed hopes that there will be no further attempts to increase tensions in the region leading to a de-escalation of the situation.”  The statement also noted that the European Union was dedicated to preserving the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran had negotiated with the governments of the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. In his speech on Wednesday pulling back from the brink of war, Mr. Trump appeared to open a small window for diplomacy with Iran even as he urged other countries to turn their backs on the nuclear agreement and promised further, unspecified sanctions against Iran. Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said Mr. Trump’s offer to cooperate with Iran was “unbelievable” and that negotiations between the two countries would be meaningless if the United States continued aggression against Iran. The American sanctions against Iran amounted to “economic terrorism,” he added in an interview with the Iranian state news outlet IRNA.  The United States justified the drone strike that killed General Suleimani in a letter on Wednesday to the Security Council, calling the action self-defense, according to Reuters. Under the United Nations Charter, countries are required to immediately report to the Security Council any measures taken in self-defense. In the letter, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said the United States stood “ready to engage without preconditions in serious negotiations with Iran, with the goal of preventing further endangerment of international peace and security or escalation by the Iranian regime.” Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting. ']","A day after President Trump seemed eager to de-escalate tensions, Iranian officials vowed revenge for the killing of a top general but also noted their missile strikes had not been intended to kill."
Confrontation in Congress Looms Over Iran Conflict,2020-01-08,By The New York Times,"['A classified briefing on the Iran crisis from Trump administration officials on Wednesday did little to convince Democrats that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was justified, and some Republicans were unhappy about the White House’s failure to include lawmakers in the decision-making process. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, emerged from the meeting visibly angry, complaining of hollow assurances that lawmakers would be consulted. “Drive-by notification or after-the-fact, lame briefings like the one we just received aren’t adequate,” he said. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, appeared equally dissatisfied. “I didn’t learn anything in the hearing that I hadn’t seen in newspapers already,” he said. Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, called the briefing “sophomoric and utterly unconvincing,” and Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said that the “facts provided did not support the administration’s claim that there was an imminent attack in the United States.” Still, Mr. Lee and Mr. Paul were in the minority among Republicans, most of whom came out of the hearing with praise for the administration.  “It was very well done,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. “I think they’ve done an excellent job of outlining the rationale behind both the decision to go after Suleimani and of the response to the Iranian attack yesterday.” And Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, said that the information was “crystal clear” and that the administration had made the right call in deciding to “take out Suleimani.” The briefing was attended by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, but that heavy-duty lineup did not impress many Democrats. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said the briefing reminded him of presentations from the George W. Bush administration in the run-up to the Iraq war. It was “the same kind of lies I was hearing 20 years ago when I was a member of the House,” he told MSNBC. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said on Twitter that he “did not hear evidence of a specific imminent threat that would allow an attack without congressional authorization.”  “With consequences as serious as these, that is unacceptable,” he added. “Congress needs to act.” Late Wednesday, Mr. Van Hollen tweeted the unclassified version of the intelligence sent to Congress after the Suleimani killing, saying, “From all we’ve seen, including the redacted parts here and the briefing, the facts do not show an imminent threat.” The next battle may be over presidential war powers. House members plan to vote on Thursday to force President Trump to quickly wind down military action against Iran unless he is given explicit authorization from Congress, said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi made the announcement as lawmakers breathed a sigh of relief on Capitol Hill after Mr. Trump announced he would back away from any military escalation against Tehran. But congressional Democrats, skeptical of the administration’s case for the drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, said they would press ahead with efforts to rein in the president’s war-making authority.  They said they would move forward with a measure that would require that Mr. Trump cease all military action against Iran within 30 days unless Congress votes to approve it. The measure stands little chance in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it is certain to ignite a fierce debate over Mr. Trump’s strategy on Iran, and Congress’s role in curtailing a president’s ability to wage war.  Where Republicans have generally praised Mr. Trump for his show of restraint — and for his choice of target in General Suleimani — Democrats “have serious, urgent concerns about the administration’s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward,” Ms. Pelosi said. President Trump announced new economic sanctions against Tehran but did not call for more military action against the Iranians during his first formal public remarks about the conflict since ordering the drone strike of Iran’s most important general last week.  “The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it,” Mr. Trump said. Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other military officials, the president did little to explain his reasoning for ordering the killing of General Suleimani.  “He should have been terminated long ago,” Mr. Trump said.  Early Wednesday, the Iranians retaliated by launching more than 20 ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where Americans are posted. Mr. Trump said no Americans were killed. The administration has cited vague intelligence threats against American interests to explain the decision to kill the Iranian general. But many have found its strategy and goals for Iran was conflicting and confusing. Mr. Trump was forced to walk back threats to target Iranian cultural sites after Mr. Esper made clear that such actions would be a war crime. “As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday.  The United States already has crippling sanctions in place against Iran. In June, Mr. Trump announced a new round in response to Tehran’s actions against tankers in international waters. And in the spring of 2019, the United States cut off revenues from Iranian oil experts, hitting directly at the heart of the country’s economy. There were signs Wednesday that the United States and Iran have stepped back from the edge of a war. The Iranian foreign minister said that his country had “concluded” its attacks on American forces and that it did “not seek escalation or war.” Iran fired more than 20 ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where United States troops are stationed. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted the remarks on Twitter after Iran conducted the strikes in response to the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Senior Iraqi defense officials who work with the United States command said that no Americans or Iraqis had been killed in the attacks. In a short statement released on Wednesday morning, the Joint Command in Baghdad, which includes both Iraqi troops and soldiers from the international coalition, said that neither force “recorded any losses.” Without American deaths from Iran’s missiles, Mr. Trump may not have felt the same pressure to punch back that he would have confronted with high troop casualties. General Suleimani was killed on Friday in Baghdad in a drone strike ordered by President Trump. American officials said the general, who led the foreign expeditionary Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, had been planning imminent attacks on American interests. One American official has since described that intelligence as thin. “Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense,” Foreign Minister Zarif said in his Twitter message, adding, “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.” Although Mr. Zarif, said his country had concluded its attack, officials around the region cautioned that the statement did not mean Tehran was done maneuvering, and Iran’s leadership has reiterated its goal of forcing United States troops out of the Middle East. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Wednesday that General Suleimani had “fought heroically” against jihadist groups and that Europe was safer because of his efforts.  “Our final answer to his assassination will be to kick all US forces out of the region,” he wrote. An influential Iraqi Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, said on Wednesday that the crisis Iraq was experiencing had ended and called on militia groups not to carry out attacks, Reuters reported.  Mr. al-Sadr said Iraq should still seek to expel foreign troops, but appeared to be laying his hopes in a new Iraqi government. One capable of protecting the nation’s sovereignty and independence should be formed in the next 15 days, he said.  “I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, parliamentary and international methods have been exhausted,” he said. Mr. al-Sadr’s remarks came after Iranian and American officials made statements attempting to de-escalate the conflict. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq also released a statement on Wednesday saying his government would “continue its intense attempts to prevent escalation” in the simmering conflict.  After Iranian missiles struck bases housing American troops in Iraq on Wednesday, Mr. Abdul Mahdi objected to the violation of his country’s sovereignty. His comments echoed remarks he made after an American drone strike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani on Friday, and after the United States struck an Iranian-backed militia in western Iraq in late December.  Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of the president, declared Mr. Trump’s speech on Iran “excellent.” He said Mr. Trump had briefed him the night before. “I said to the Iranian leadership and people: He’s giving you a pathway to peace — I hope you’ll take it,” Mr. Graham told reporters on Wednesday.  Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, acknowledged that Mr. Trump seemed to pulling American forces off the “path to conventional war.” But pointing to the new set of sanctions the president announced against Iran, he said, “It also doesn’t seem as if we are truly de-escalating.”  “Remember, Iran started their provocations in response to our unilateral set of sanctions,” Mr. Murphy said. “Time will tell, but I’m not sure that this is going to be effective in de-escalating the crisis.” Addressing the U.S. conflict with Iran on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called on Europeans to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as he did in May 2018. His wish is likely to go unheeded. Just a few hours before the president spoke, top European leaders repeated their commitment to the deal and urged Iran to return to compliance, even in the face of harsh American sanctions. After the killing of General Suleimani, Iran announced that it no longer would be limited by the deal, but it did not say what it would do, leaving room for both escalation and a return to compliance.  The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, both said the nuclear agreement should be preserved. To that end, Ms. von der Leyen, said Mr. Borrell has been reaching out to all signatories to the deal, including Russia and China. Iran has, in effect, been making a phased retreat from its obligations under the deal since Mr. Trump abandoned it and reimposed economic sanctions on Iran. Britain, France and Germany, together with the European Union, Russia, China and the United States negotiated the deal, but only Washington has pulled out of it. Iran has regularly complained that the Europeans are not doing enough to provide Iran the economic benefits it was promised in the deal.  Any country giving Iran financial assistance could run afoul of the sanctions and risk incurring sanctions itself. But both Russia and China have found ways to buy at least some Iranian oil. And some European countries have proposed workarounds to help Iran while complying with U.S. policy. The Europeans say that the nuclear deal is in their national interests and have pressed Iran to come back into compliance. The deal, Mr. Borrell said Wednesday, is “today more important than ever, because this is the only place where we can sit together with the Russians and Chinese to talk on a multilateral basis about the many risks that we are facing. It’s one of the most important tools of nonproliferation and regional security.” Investors signaled their relief after President Trump backed away from further confrontation with Iran. Stocks in the United States climbed to new highs shortly after the conclusion of the president’s speech, in which he said the strikes produced no American casualties and that Iran now “appears to be standing down.” Oil prices, which had spiked after the missile attacks and fallen hours later, fell further after the televised address. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down more than 3.5 percent and 4 percent shortly after midday. At the same time, the S & P 500 was up more roughly 0.7 percent to nearly 3,260. If the market holds that level until the end of the trading day, it would be a record, overtaking the previous high-water mark set on Jan. 2. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, said on Wednesday that his military had dealt the United States a “slap in the face” when it unleashed missiles at American forces stationed in Iraq. In a televised address from the holy city of Qom, Ayatollah Khamenei said incremental military actions against the United States alone were “not sufficient.” “What matters is that the presence of America, which is a source of corruption in this region, should come to an end,” he said to a hall filled with imams and others. “Death to America!,” the crowd chanted. “Death to Israel!” Ayatollah Khamenei said that “sitting at the negotiating table” with American envoys would open the door to greater American intervention in the region and that such negotiations therefore must “come to an end.” “This region,” he said, “does not accept the U.S. presence.” A 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck southern Iran just before dawn on Wednesday, the United States Geological Survey reported, in the same region as the troubled Bushehr nuclear power plant. No casualties were immediately reported, though rescue teams were working at the site, the state-run IRNA news agency said.  The quake was reported about 30 miles from the Russian-built Bushehr nuclear plant, long seen as a safety concern by Western countries. It has been plagued by construction delays and technical problems, and is on an active fault line. Two more reactors are planned for the same site. Construction on the first of those began in November. The quake struck just hours after Iran launched missiles at United States forces based in Iraq and an airliner carrying more than 170 people crashed after takeoff from Tehran, killing everyone on board.  A Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 carrying at least 170 people crashed on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing everyone aboard, according to the Iranian state news media.  The circumstances of the crash were unclear. The Iranian outlets cited technical problems with the plane, which was bound for Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. The crash came at a tense time in Iran, as conflict with the United States had the country on edge. Photographs posted by Iranian news organizations showed rescuers examining smoking rubble in a field. The state-run Iranian Students’ News Agency shared a video it said showed the predawn crash, with a distant light descending in the distance before a bright burst filled the sky upon impact.  The plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, departed Imam Khomeini International Airport at 6:12 a.m. on Wednesday and lost contact at 6:14 a.m., according to a flight tracker. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said the victims included 82 Iranians and 11 Ukrainians, including nine Ukrainian crew members. Sixty-three passengers were from Canada, 10 from Sweden, four from Afghanistan, three from Britain and three from Germany, he said. A number of international airlines announced that flights would be avoiding the airspace over Iran and Iraq after reports of strikes on bases housing American troops in Iraq. The moves also came after the apparently unrelated news of the crash of a Ukrainian passenger plane in the early hours of Wednesday near Tehran. Other airlines have canceled flights to the region.  On Tuesday, the F.A.A. barred American airliners from flying over Iran, citing the risk of commercial planes being mistaken for military aircraft.  The Dutch airline KLM said on Wednesday that it was no longer flying in Iraqi or Iranian airspace “until further notice,” citing security risks. Air France and the Australian carrier Qantas took similar measures, news agencies reported. The German carrier Lufthansa also announced the temporary cancellation of a daily flight between Frankfurt and Tehran because of the security situation, according to Reuters, but later said it would restart that route on Thursday. The European Union on Wednesday condemned Iran’s rocket attacks on Iraqi bases housing American and coalition troops, urging an end to the “spiral of violence” that has gripped the region. The bloc also urged the continuation of dialogue to calm tensions in the Middle East. “The latest rocket attacks on air bases in Iraq used by U.S. and coalition forces, among them European forces, are yet another example of escalation and increased confrontation,” said the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles. “It is in no one’s interest to turn up the spiral of violence even further.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that “the use of weapons must stop now to give space to dialogue,’’ adding, “we all are called upon to do everything possible to rekindle talks, and there cannot be enough of that.’’ Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, speaking in the British Parliament on Wednesday, echoed the calls for calm but said that the Iranian general killed by the United States last week had “blood on his hands.”  The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, also condemned the strikes and said was in touch with “all of the parties involved to encourage restraint and responsibility.” Reporting was contributed by Alissa J.

Prince Harry’s Real Declaration of Independence: From Britain’s Tabloids,2020-01-09,By Ellen Barry,"['Last fall, Prince Harry seemed to have everything a person could want: A luminous wife, a perfect baby and an extended stay in Africa, a region he has always loved. And yet, when he spoke to his old friend, the journalist Tom Bradby, he sounded traumatized, as if the events of the previous two years had dragged him back to the hell of his 13th summer, when his mother died in a car crash, speeding away from paparazzi. “Every time I see a camera, every time I hear a click, every time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,” he was quoted as saying in “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,” a documentary of their time in Africa. His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, was also grim about the life she had chosen, telling Mr. Bradby that she should have paid more attention when friends warned her about getting involved with Prince Harry. “My British friends told me, ‘I’m sure he’s great, but you shouldn’t do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life,’” she said. “I, very naïvely — I’m an American, we don’t have that there — I said, ‘What are you talking about? That doesn’t make sense.’” Much will be written, in the coming days and months, about rifts between the couple and the royal family, or of a millennial prince rejecting the old-fashioned life offered to him. But for Prince Harry, the British tabloid press was always the worm in the apple.  Other members of the family have accepted, as part of the bargain they were born into, the tabloid feeding frenzy: zoom lenses poking out of the shrubbery; school friends offered cash to betray their confidence; story lines, some of them invented, casting them as lazy, uncouth and self-indulgent. But Harry’s fury over press coverage became more visceral as his feelings for his wife and child grew. He said it openly: He blamed the media for his mother’s death. “My deepest fear is history repeating itself,” he wrote in a statement in October. “I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.” For generations, Britain’s news outlets have been locked in a power struggle with a family that values its privacy, with the media sometimes ratcheting up negative coverage in response to curtailed access. In private, editors boasted of their ability to damage the approval rating of royals who do not cooperate, as with a drumbeat of reports critical of Prince William’s work habits, branding him “Work-Shy Wills.”   Stig Abell, who served as the director of Britain’s Press Complaints Commission, a regulatory body, has described the relationship as “a hug that was always threatening to become an assault.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, from the first, made it clear that they did not feel any obligation to abide by that tradition, cherry-picking preferred news outlets and building a direct connection with the public through their Instagram feed. “The gentleman’s agreement between the royals and the British media was always based on the fact that they needed each other,” Mr. Abell said in an interview. “But we are seeing the fragmentation of media, the rise of social media, combined with the fact that they are a brand in and of themselves. They are a global phenomenon. If they don’t need the media, the question is, why would they have a relationship with the media?” Wednesday’s bombshell announcement, in which the couple said they would “step back” from their official duties, is the culmination of that logic. “This felt like the natural place it would end up,” said Mr. Abell, now the editor of The Times Literary Supplement. The Sussexes plan to withdraw from the Royal Rota, the dozen or so journalists who make up the royal press pool, and speak instead to journalists from what they term “credible media outlets focused on objective news reporting,” giving preference for “young, up-and-coming” reporters and “grass roots organizations.” The National Union of Journalists on Thursday blasted this idea, saying the public has the right to scrutinize the family, which is supported by public funds. “Who determines which media is ‘credible’ or ‘objective’?” said Michelle Stanistreet, the organization’s general secretary. “We cannot have a situation where journalists writing about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex can only do so if they have the royal seal of approval.” Emily Andrews, The Sun’s royal correspondent, told the Press-Gazette, which covers the British media industry, that courtiers in other parts of the royal household had reached out to her to say they appreciate what the tabloids do to promote their charitable work. “We dutifully turn up to royal engagements, at home and abroad, often waiting for hours in the cold, the rain and the boiling sun for them to arrive,” she said. “The royals do not always like what we write — but that’s the point.”  Prince Harry’s relationship with his wife, whom he met on a blind date in the summer of 2016, has been punctuated by conflict with the tabloids from the beginning. Responding to the of coverage of his new girlfriend — The Daily Mail ran an article headlined, “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton” — he released a highly unusual statement, accusing media outlets of allowing “racial undertones” to creep into their coverage. But if he thought this would win her more delicate treatment, he was wrong. It was war. In the run-up to the wedding, newspapers feasted on unflattering coverage of Ms. Markle’s father, a 73-year-old former Hollywood lighting director living quietly by himself in Mexico. The couple responded by allowing journalists minimal access to St. George’s Chapel for the wedding. The spiral deepened during the duchess’s pregnancy, when The Daily Mail published an emotional, handwritten letter she had written to her father, pleading with him to “please stop creating so much pain.”  When their son was born, in April of 2019, they announced they would skip the ritual photo opportunity outside the maternity ward, publishing their own photograph of the child on their Instagram feed. This was not satisfactory, said Arthur Edwards, 79, who spent decades documenting the royal family as a photographer for The Sun. “Well, we saw a picture of the baby’s fingers?” he said in an interview. “They were treating us with total disrespect. The taxpayer just forked out three million pounds for state-of-the-art décor in their home, and you can’t put out a good picture of your child?” Mr. Edwards was skeptical about Prince Harry’s comparison of his wife’s treatment with his mother’s. “Listen, it was a sad day when Diana was killed, but that’s a long while ago, it’s 25 years,” he said. “You’ve got to move on.” In October, the duchess filed a lawsuit against The Mail on Sunday, which published the letter from her father, accompanied by an agonized statement from Prince Harry. “There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,” he wrote. Mr. Edwards acknowledged that some coverage of the duchess had been “nasty,” especially at the early stage of their relationship, but said the prince’s relatives had toughed it out, accepting criticism as part of their job. “The Prince of Wales has had way worse than that. He was way down the approval rating, but you know what he did? He put down his head and worked hard, and now he is the most popular member of the family,” he said. Asked how Prince Harry would fare in the British news media, Mr. Edwards was foreboding. “He has gone down the approval ladder at a fast rate, I’m afraid,” he said. But response on social media told a different story, with many commentators celebrating their move. The couple’s new website, sussexroyal.com, attracted so much interest that, for long stretches on Wednesday afternoon, it would not load.  The photographs used to illustrate the news showed an exuberant couple on their way out of a visit to Canada’s High Commission in London, smiling radiantly, as if they had laid down a heavy burden. Mr. Abell said it all signaled that this was “a considered act.” “I think this shows they believe they hold the cards,” he said. “Play it forward, what’s the negative effect of this? A whole bunch of criticism in the press? Is that going to change anyone’s position? If they don’t want to be part of the royal family, they don’t need the consent — or the good will — of the British press.”']","The Sussexes have been preparing for years to sever their relationship with the royal press pack, which the prince still blames for his mother’s death."
"For Prince Harry and His Wife, Meghan, a Tricky Balancing Act",2020-01-09,By Sarah Lyall,"['She was too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural, the critics said. She should not have alienated the news media by refusing to join in their celebrity games. She should not have spent so much money renovating the house the royal family was kind enough to bestow upon her and her husband. And most of all, they said, Meghan Markle, a.k.a. the Duchess of Sussex, should not have inserted herself, Yoko Ono-like, into the once-close relationship between Prince Harry, her iconoclastic husband, and Prince William, his toeing-the-line older brother and a future heir to the British throne. But even as the duchess has faced lacerating criticism from Britons who like their royals to be dutiful and traditional — and from the tabloid newspapers that feed off and direct public opinion — so, too, has she had her own problems with life in her adopted country. “It’s not enough to just survive something, right?” she asked plaintively last year in the documentary “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,” talking about the British custom of keeping calm and carrying on through even the most untidy of emotional upheavals. “That’s not the point of life. You’ve got to thrive, you’ve got to feel happy,” she went on to say. “I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.” The result of this reciprocal unhappiness, it seems, was Wednesday’s extraordinary Instagram announcement from the couple that they would “carve out a progressive new role” and “step back as ‘senior members’ of the royal family.” How this would work in practice is anyone’s guess.  Other royals have left the family before, in various ways. Diana, the Princess of Wales, lost her royal title in 1996 after divorcing Prince Charles. King Edward VIII gave up his right to the throne in 1936 by announcing that he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, an unacceptably divorced American. And Prince Andrew was all but banished from the family last year after his association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light. There is no precedent for Harry and Meghan’s situation. No senior royals in the past have voluntarily said that they want to remain members of the royal family while also being somehow outside it at the same time. Except for King Edward, later the Duke of Windsor, who was exiled from home but longed to return, no senior royals have lived for any substantial time anywhere but Britain.  Harry and Meghan’s plan to live part of the time in the United Kingdom and part in North America, as their statement said, seems even more jarring.  And while the other royals who have left the family’s viselike embrace have done so reluctantly, unwilling to give up the trappings and remunerations of royalty, Harry — at least judging by his and Meghan’s Instagram statement — appears to be enthusiastic about the prospect. Not only does the couple want a new role within the monarchy, the statement said, but they want to “work to become financially independent.” That’s a radical notion indeed, in a family whose members have long enjoyed public financing. It is significant that even as Meghan and Harry went to great lengths in their statement to praise the royal family and pledge fealty to Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and to the monarchy in general, the response from the Queen’s camp was on the icy end of the temperature spectrum. Buckingham Palace does not like to be taken by surprise. “Discussions with the Duke and Duchess are at an early stage,” the palace said in its own statement — meaning, possibly, that discussions, such as they are, started very recently. “We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.” Meghan and Harry’s desire to break free from royal traditions and renounce the usual menu of royal obligations speaks directly to the challenges facing the monarchy as the reign of the queen, now 93, enters its final years. As the second son of Prince Charles, who has spent his whole life waiting to become king and is himself now a formidable 71, Harry has virtually no chance of ever becoming king himself. While Prince William, as the elder brother, has been tethered to the notion that he will succeed his father on the throne, Harry has had to find another path. He served in the British Army for 10 years, did two tours in Afghanistan and founded the Invictus Games for injured and impaired members and veterans of the armed services. Along the way, Harry developed a reputation as something of a bon vivant. His early girlfriends, at least the ones anyone knew about, were mostly young aristocratic women roughly from his own social circle. Meghan Markle, a divorced American actress with a white father and an African-American mother, represented a departure. Sometimes it can be hard to tell if the British tabloids direct public opinion or reflect it. From the beginning, they had a hard time dealing with Meghan, writing articles about her prior marriage and divorce, and about her parents’ divorce and her half-siblings, and making veiled remarks that seemed just short of racist.  Making an unusually pointed statement while they were still dating, Prince Harry condemned the “wave of abuse and harassment” and the “racial undertones of comment pieces” that Meghan had been subjected to. Their marriage, in 2018, seemed both modern and traditional, a meeting of past and present, America and Britain, Anglican and Episcopalian.  But after a honeymoon with the couple, the tabloids took a new approach of relentless criticism — of Meghan’s outfits, of her outspokenness, of her habit of jetting to America for such occasions as a star-studded baby shower, of her supposed desire to enjoy the trappings and riches of royalty without agreeing to take on the attendant responsibilities. In particular, she has been held up as inferior to the Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, who fulfills the fantasy of an anodyne royal who is practically perfect by virtue of dutifully and enthusiastically always showing up where she needs to be. As the news of Harry and Meghan’s plans exploded across the tabloids on Wednesday night, so did the condemnation. In The Daily Mail, a series of correspondents revisited a litany of complaints about Meghan’s behavior, going back to her wedding. “It emerged that Meghan had complained about the mustiness of St. George’s Chapel and wanted it sprayed with air freshener before the ceremony,” the paper reported, referring to the site of the royal wedding. “This was a young woman who was clearly not going to accept her position quietly.” If there’s one thing the tabloids hate more than an ungrateful royal bride, it’s an ungrateful royal bride who doesn’t even want to live in Britain.  ']","Others have tried to be both part of the royal family, and separate from it. None have succeeded. Can the Duke and Duchess of Sussex pull it off?"
Khamenei Wants to Put Iran’s Stamp on Reprisal for U.S. Killing of Top General,2020-01-07,By Farnaz Fassihi and David D. Kirkpatrick,"['In the tense hours following the American killing of a top Iranian military commander, the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made a rare appearance at a meeting of the government’s National Security Council to lay down the parameters for any retaliation. It must be a direct and proportional attack on American interests, he said, openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves, three Iranians familiar with the meeting said Monday. It was a startling departure for the Iranian leadership. Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Tehran had almost always cloaked its attacks behind the actions of proxies it had cultivated around the region. But in the fury generated by the killing of the military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a close ally and personal friend of the supreme leader, the ayatollah was willing to cast aside those traditional cautions.  The nation’s anger over the commander’s death was on vivid display Monday, as millions of Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran for a funeral procession and Mr. Khamenei wept openly over the coffin.  After weeks of furious protests across the country against corruption and misrule, both those who had criticized and those who had supported the government marched together, united in outrage. Subway trains and stations were packed with mourners hours before dawn, and families brought children carrying photographs of General Suleimani.  A reformist politician, Sadegh Kharazi, said he had not seen crowds this size since the 1989 funeral of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. “We are ready to take a fierce revenge against America,” Gen. Hamid Sarkheili of the Revolutionary Guard declared to the throng. “American troops in the Persian Gulf and in Iraq and Syria are within our reach.” “No negotiations or deal, only war with America,” funeral attendees chanted in a video shared with The New York Times. A renowned eulogist and member of the Revolutionary Guard, Sadegh Ahangaran, exhorted the funeral crowds to raise their voices so “damned America can hear you” and to “wave the flags in preparation for war.” The increasingly public vows of direct action on Monday constituted Iran’s latest act of defiance to President Trump. Over the weekend the president had repeatedly threatened to retaliate for any attacks against American interests by ordering airstrikes against as many as 52 potential targets, one for each American hostage held after the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran in 1979.  In response, Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, on Monday responded with his own numerology. “Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290,” he said on Twitter, a reference to the 290 people killed in 1988 in the accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by an American warship. “Never threaten the Iranian nation,” Mr. Rouhani added. Where, when and even if Iran may choose to retaliate remains a matter of speculation. As Iranian leaders weighed just what form it might take, analysts said the targets included American troops in neighboring Syria and Iraq, American bases in the Persian Gulf or American embassies or diplomats almost anywhere.  When previous attempts at direct strikes or assassinations have proved unsuccessful, some noted, Iranian-backed militants have turned to the simpler tactic of killing civilians with terrorist bombs.  This was the sequence in 2012 with the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. After failing in attempts to attack Israeli targets or kill Israeli officials in revenge for the killing of one of the group’s leaders, the militants eventually settled on the easier job of bombing a busload of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, said Afshon Ostovar, a scholar of Iran at the Naval Postgraduate School.  “We are in uncharted territory, and the truth of the matter is nobody knows how Iran is going to respond. I don’t think even Iran knows,” Mr. Ostovar said. “But I think there is a blood lust right now in the Revolutionary Guards.” In Iraq, where the Parliament had earlier called for the immediate expulsion of the 5,000 American troops stationed there, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Monday listed steps to curtail the troops’ movements.  While plans were being made for departure of the Americans, he said, they would now be limited to “training and advising” Iraqi forces, required to remain within the bases and barred from Iraqi air space. Mr. Abdul Mahdi met with Matthew Tueller, the American ambassador to Iraq, on Monday, and “stressed the need for joint action to implement the withdrawal,” according to a statement and photo released by Mr. Abdul Mahdi’s office. He also emphasized Iraq’s efforts to prevent the current tensions between Iran and the United States from sliding into “open war.” The United States military stirred a media flurry by accidentally releasing a draft letter that seemed to describe imminent plans to withdraw from Iraq. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III, the commander of the United States forces in Iraq, wrote to the Iraqi government that the American troops would be relocated “to prepare for onward movement.” “We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure,” he wrote. But Defense Department officials played down the significance of the letter. “Here’s the bottom line, this was a mistake,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, President Trump’s top military commander, told reporters at the Pentagon during a hastily called press briefing. “It’s a draft unsigned letter because we are moving forces around.” “There’s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq,” Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, told reporters. “There’s been no decision made to leave Iraq. Period.” Although the Trump administration has said that the United States killed General Suleimani because he was planning imminent attacks against American interests, there were indications Monday that he may have been leading an effort to calm tensions with Saudi Arabia.  Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said that he was supposed to meet with General Suleimani on the morning he was killed, and that he expected him to bring messages from the Iranians that might help to “reach agreements and breakthroughs important for the situation in Iraq and the region.”  In Washington, two top Senate Democrats urged President Trump early Monday to declassify the administration’s formal notification to Congress giving notice of the airstrike that killed General Suleimani.  Such notification of Congress is required by law, and to classify the entirety of such a notification is highly unusual. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a joint statement that it was “critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner.” And Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, urged Mr. Trump’s critics not to jump to conclusions. “Unfortunately, in this toxic political environment, some of our colleagues rushed to blame our own government before even knowing the facts,” he said. For its part, Iran simultaneously continued a monthslong push against the Trump administration over its demands that Tehran submit to a more restrictive renegotiation of a 2015 accord with the Western powers over its nuclear research. The Trump administration has sought to pressure Iran by devastating its economy with sweeping economic sanctions, which Iranian officials have denounced as economic warfare.  The sanctions set off the cycle of attacks and counterattacks that culminated last week in the killing of General Suleimani. Iran has also responded with carefully calibrated steps away from the deal’s limits on its nuclear program. On Sunday, Iranian officials said that they had now abandoned all restrictions on the enrichment of uranium, though they said they would continue to admit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Amid the emotion of the funeral, some called for vengeance that would remake the region. “Even if we attack all of U.S. bases and even if we kill Trump himself it’s not enough revenge,” Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh said at the funeral. “We must totally eliminate all U.S. troops from the region.” For now, Iranian officials seem to be in no rush to strike back against the United States, possibly enjoying their ability to spread anxiety throughout the West. They seem content to bask in the nationalist surge in their popularity, growing international sympathy and the push to expel American troops from Iraq. “I don’t think they want to shift the conversation yet,” said Sanam Vakil, a scholar of Iran at Chatham House, a research center in London.  But for the hard-liners who dominate the Iranian National Security Council, she said, some vigorous retaliation would be the only rational response. “A nonresponse would appear weak and invite further pressure, creating problems in domestic politics and internationally,” she said.

British Woman Who Accused Israelis of Rape in Cyprus Is Spared Prison,2020-01-07,By Lizzy Ioannidou and Iliana Magra,"['PARALIMNI, Cyprus — A British woman who was convicted last month of lying to the authorities in Cyprus when she accused a dozen Israelis of raping her in a resort town before retracting her statement will not serve any time in prison, after she was given a four-month suspended sentence on Tuesday. The woman, who said she had been pressured by the authorities to change her account, will now be allowed to return to Britain after a judge said that he was willing to give her “a second chance” in a case that has drawn international attention. The handling of her case and the guilty verdict have outraged rights groups — scores of people, including some who had traveled from Israel, protested outside the courthouse in a show of support — and her lawyers said they planned to appeal her conviction in an effort to clear her name. Dominic Raab, the British foreign minister, said that he had “very serious concerns” about her treatment in Cyprus, telling the BBC on Sunday, “I think she’s gone through a terrible ordeal.” The local news media in Cyprus reported last week that President Nicos Anastasiades had planned to pardon the woman, who has not been publicly identified, if she received a prison term, though the suspended sentence means that he will be spared from having to make such a decision. The woman, who was 19 when she made the accusation last July, had accused the Israelis, who were ages 15 to 18, of raping her in a hotel room in Ayia Napa, in southeastern Cyprus, in July. The police arrested the young men that month but later released them after the woman retracted the accusations. The judge, Michalis Papathanasiou, noting that the case drew international attention, said that he would spare the British woman from prison, citing her otherwise clean criminal record, her young age and the fact that she had spent six months in Cyprus, including one month in detention, after her arrest. “I am willing to give her a second chance,” he said. Still, he made clear that he regarded her actions as serious. “The offense of public mischief is a serious one, as it seeks to mislead the authorities and divert their attention away from the serious offense,” he told the court. The judge observed that the accusations had consequences for both the British woman, because she had not been able to attend university, and the accused Israelis, because it “restricted the freedom of 12 young men.”  The sentence was suspended for three years, meaning that the British woman could still go to prison if she committed another offense during that time frame, and she will have to pay 140 euros, about $156, to cover expenses for the state incurred during the trial. Her mother appeared pleased by the sentence — “we’re finally going home,” she told her daughter’s supporters after the hearing ended — but her lawyers said that the fight for justice was not over.  Lewis Power, one of the defense lawyers, said that the woman had been “stripped of her dignity and human rights” and that they would take their case to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. Nicoletta Charalambidou, another defense lawyer, said that because going through the justice system in Cyprus could take years, they would seek to expedite the process. The chief investigating officer in the case, Marios Christou, testified during her trial for public mischief that she had admitted reporting the episode because the young men “were recording her having sex” and “she felt insulted.” He also cited inconsistencies between her statement and video footage from the night in question.  The woman pleaded not guilty when her trial began in October, but she later testified that the police had pressured her into retracting her accusations, and the handling of the case by the authorities was condemned in Cyprus and Britain. Several women’s rights groups protested outside the Foreign Office and the Cypriot Embassy in London on Monday in support of the woman. They also urged Britain’s Foreign Office to “boycott Cyprus.”  Lucy and Verity Nevitt, the founders of the Gemini Project, a British nonprofit group that works to end sexual violence, called the woman’s treatment “inhumane.” “The message from Cypriot authorities is essentially ‘if you talk, we will silence you’,” they said in an email on Monday.  The woman’s legal team argued that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. They told the court during her trial that the police had pressured her to retract the accusations against the Israelis, although Mr. Christou, the investigating officer, testified that the police had not pressured her to change her stance. The case also raised questions in Israel over consensual sex and societal pressures on young men regarding their “manliness.” Although some in the country defended the accused in this case after they were released from police custody, many were upset to see celebrations greeting them at the airport on their return home.  More than 50 Israeli activists affiliated with the Association of Rape Crisis Centers, an Israeli nonprofit, traveled to Cyprus to show their support to the British woman, and demonstrated outside the courtroom on Tuesday while her sentence was being handed down.  Orit Sulitzeanu, the organization’s director, said in a statement from Cyprus that the court’s guilty verdict “testified to the deep lack of understanding of what sexual injury is.”  “I hope the young Israeli men will realize that they hurt the young woman badly,” she said, “even if they were not put on trial.” Lizzy Ioannidou reported from Paralimni, and Iliana Magra from London. Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Some NATO Troops Begin Leaving Iraq,2020-01-07,By Ron DePasquale,"['NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, in the aftermath of the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran in Baghdad.  The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced on Monday that the training had been temporarily suspended. For the security of NATO personnel, the organization said in a statement that it would be taking precautions — including “the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside Iraq.”  NATO, which has been running the training operation since 2018, will continue to maintain a presence in Iraq and remains committed to fighting international terrorism, an official said, while refusing to divulge details about troop movements. NATO, which has roughly 500 soldiers in Iraq, lifted some of them out of Baghdad’s Green Zone in helicopters Monday night.  General Suleimani was killed in an American drone strike at the Baghdad airport on Friday alongside a powerful Iraqi militia leader. Since then, Iran and its partners have stepped up calls for vengeance Iran attacked two American forces at two bases in Iraq early Wednesday, Iranian official news media and United States officials said. Some NATO countries, like Canada, Germany and Croatia, have announced that they are moving troops out of Iraq altogether, at least temporarily, because of security concerns.  Canada is moving some of its 500 military personnel temporarily to Kuwait, the country’s top military official, Gen. Jonathan Vance, said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Thirty of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq will be sent to Jordan and Kuwait, while others will remain positioned in the less volatile Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the German Defense and Foreign Ministries said in a joint letter to the German parliament, the Bundestag.  “When the training is able to resume, the military personnel can be reinstated,” the letter said. Croatia has moved seven of its contingent of 14 soldiers to Kuwait and sent the rest home, its Defense Ministry said. Slovakia has removed its seven soldiers. The Pentagon, for its part, has directed about 4,500 additional American troops to the region atop the roughly 50,000 already there. The new troops will act primarily as a defensive force, meant to reinforce American bases and compounds in the region and respond to a possible Iranian attack in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani.  A brigade of roughly 4,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division based out of Fort Bragg, N.C., has started deploying to Kuwait. The troops are part of the division’s global response force, kept on standby for particular emergencies. In Iraq and Syria, however, the American-led coalition halted its yearslong campaign against the Islamic State on Sunday, as United States forces braced for retaliation from Iran. About 5,200 troops in Iraq and several hundred in Syria are now focused on fortifying their outposts instead of pursuing remnants of the Islamic State and training local forces. Further complicating matters, Iraqi lawmakers voted Sunday to expel American forces from their country. The vote will not be final until it is signed by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, and it was unclear whether Iraq’s current caretaker government had the authority to end the relationship with the United States military. Although the vote in Parliament was 170-0, lawmakers were more divided on the issue of ousting American troops than that tally may suggest. Many of the 328 members of Parliament, primarily those representing the country’s ethnic Kurdish and Sunni Muslim minorities, did not attend the session and did not vote.']","The alliance, which has been training Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, said that it would begin removing some troops after the United States killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani."
"China Looms Over Taiwan’s Election, Giving a Boost to the Incumbent",2020-01-08,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Horton,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — This time last year, the political future of Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, was in ruins. She had resigned as chairwoman of her party after it suffered a humiliating defeat in regional elections. Party elders urged her not to seek re-election. The premier she appointed quit to challenge her in the party’s primary last summer. Now, with the Saturday election nearing, Ms. Tsai has made a comeback that seemed impossible only a few months ago. She mostly has China to thank. China’s undisguised belligerence toward Taiwan — in words and actions — has given Ms. Tsai’s campaign a new vigor. So have the protests in Hong Kong over China’s steady encroachment on that territory’s autonomy.  Ms. Tsai and her supporters regularly cite the tumult in Hong Kong as evidence of why Taiwan, an island democracy that has been functionally independent since 1949, cannot simply surrender to China’s demands to unite. “We know the responsibility we bear,” Ms. Tsai, 63, said at a rally in New Taipei City, where she pledged to a stadium full of cheering, flag-waving supporters to preserve Taiwan as “a beacon of democracy” in the face of efforts by China to undercut it. “Taiwan is on the front line,” she said. For Beijing, a second four-year term for Ms. Tsai would amount to a repudiation of the pressure tactics that it has wielded against Taiwan ever since she took power in 2016. As a policy failure, it would echo the overwhelming victory scored by the democratic opposition in Hong Kong’s district elections in November.  The vision of a China Dream extolled by the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, it seems, has little appeal to people when they are given the chance to vote on it.  A former deputy director of the office overseeing Taiwan affairs publicly acknowledged the failure at a policy forum in December, saying that China needed to rethink “our own working methods and approach.” Instead of enticing people in Taiwan to draw closer, Mr. Xi’s policies have pushed them farther away, and a recognition of that reality is already raising unusually public concerns in Beijing. An annual government survey in Taiwan found that barely 1 percent of Taiwanese favored unification “as soon as possible.” “Winning over the hearts of the people and doing well in work with the masses was always the Communist Party’s strong suit, our special skill,” the former deputy director, Wang Zaixi, said at the forum. “So why has it failed in the face of our Taiwan compatriots? Can you blame them?” China, of course, has loomed over elections in Taiwan ever since the former Japanese colony transitioned to democracy after decades of authoritarian rule following the arrival of Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang forces in 1945. In this campaign, China has done more than ever to make its preferences clear — and, critics say, to stoke polarization among Taiwan’s 23 million people.  Since Ms. Tsai took office in May 2016, China has largely refused to engage with her government. Instead, Beijing has issued threats against Ms. Tsai’s aims to “split” China, and flexed its military muscle. It has also restricted economic and cultural ties, including the flow of tourists — all in the hopes of undermining her political support.  At the same time, it offered incentives to Taiwanese businesses and support for her political opponents, including the Kuomintang. China’s tactics have involved what officials and analysts have described as covert efforts to spread disinformation and otherwise undercut Ms. Tsai’s administration. Those efforts spilled into the public after a man claiming to be a disillusioned operative for Chinese military intelligence detailed for the Australian authorities an extraordinary — if still largely unverified — litany of secret operations aimed at advancing China’s interests in Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong.  Those operations, he claimed, included providing support for Ms. Tsai’s opponent, Han Kuo-yu. A former legislator with a populist agenda, Mr. Han was elected mayor of Kaohsiung, the southern port city, the same race in which Ms. Tsai’s party was routed.  Mr. Han, who is 62, has fiercely denied receiving support from China, even suggesting that the accusations of Chinese skulduggery were part of a plot by Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party. The public furor, though, has put Mr. Han — with his comparatively conciliatory views toward China — on the defensive. As mayor and now as a presidential candidate, Mr. Han has called for a greater effort to smooth relations with China. In March, only months after being elected, he crossed the Taiwan Strait to visit four Chinese cities.  Mr. Han claimed the goal of his visit was to drum up sales for Kaohsiung farmers and fishermen, and Chinese state media touted an agreement for $30 million in new trade. He also met officials from the Communist government who oversee relations with Hong Kong and Macau under the formula called “one country, two systems.” When the protests erupted in Hong Kong three months later, Mr. Han was forced to declare that he would never accept such an arrangement for Taiwan. Now, in his stump speeches on the campaign trail, he barely mentions China at all, reflecting how toxic the issue has become for voters across the political spectrum. Mr. Han has focused his attacks instead on Ms. Tsai’s handling of the economy and other bread-and-butter issues that are often on voters’ minds as much as China. “Only I can make Taiwan strong,” Mr. Han said at one rally, standing in front of a sign that reflected his populist message: “Safety for Taiwan, money for the people.”  Ms. Tsai and her surrogates never miss a chance to tar him for his association with China. When the two squared off for the first time at a sort of televised debate on Dec. 18, Mr. Han railed at her for losing Taiwan’s dwindling diplomatic allies, most recently two tiny Pacific nations. The world, he said, had forgotten about Taiwan during her tenure.  She retorted: “Just now Mr. Han said the world has forgotten Taiwan. That’s probably because he’s going to China a bit too much.” Taiwan’s omnipresent neighbor is not the only factor in the election. The candidates all talk about the economy, from wildly opposed points of view. Politicians and analysts on both sides, though, agree that the upheaval in Hong Kong sharpened the focus on China’s role and reversed Ms. Tsai’s fortunes.  Last January, Mr. Xi set the tone in a speech declaring that unification between China and Taiwan was “the great trend in history” and promising a similar “one country, two systems” model for Chinese rule over the island.  The protests in Hong Kong began over extradition legislation inspired, at least in part, by a murder in Taiwan. Since then, they have evolved into a much larger struggle over the increasingly authoritarian nature of China’s rule under Mr. Xi. Many in Taiwan have sympathized with the protesters’ plight, offering moral and, in some cases, material support; for some protesters who have been arrested, the island has become a sanctuary from a judicial system they view as unjust.  Ms. Tsai’s latest campaign video warned that Mr. Xi’s formula had failed Hong Kong, especially its youth. “Only a few hundred kilometers away, countless young people are being arrested, being locked up, being mistreated, being disappeared,” the narrator says, then adds. “From the beginning, ‘one country, two systems’ has been a dictatorship.” Hong Kong was “a wake-up call” that validated Ms. Tsai’s efforts to forge deeper economic and political ties beyond China, said Lai I-Chung, the president of the Prospect Foundation, a think tank in Taipei, who is also an adviser to Ms. Tsai’s party. “What’s happening to these youngsters is resonating with the youth in Taiwan,” he said of the protest movement, which has received support from Taiwanese activists and church leaders, if not the government. “This is not something abstract.” Amber Wang contributed research from Beijing.']","China’s hostility and the protests in Hong Kong have reversed the political fortunes of President Tsai Ing-wen, raising alarms in Beijing."
Prince Harry and Meghan to ‘Step Back’ From Royal Duties in Extraordinary Retreat,2020-01-08,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — In a year of gut punches to Britain’s royal family, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, delivered a jarring blow of their own on Wednesday, announcing that they would “step back” from their official duties.  It was an extraordinary retreat by the popular prince and his American wife, who had grown increasingly isolated within the House of Windsor since their wedding in 2018. In a statement, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are also known, said they planned to divide their time between Britain and North America and would “work to become financially independent.” “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” the couple said in a post on their Instagram account. “It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment.” While the language in the statement was mild and upbeat, the change that Prince Harry and his wife are embarking on is momentous. Although he is only sixth in the line of succession to Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry has exerted an outsized hold on the public imagination ever since his days as the mischievous, ginger-haired younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. For the duke and duchess to forsake Britain and relinquish their royal duties, even for part of the year, will be a jolt to one of the nation’s most immutable institutions. It continues the convention-defying ways of Prince Harry, who enthralled millions of Britons, and angered some others, when he and Meghan, an American actress with a biracial background, decided to marry. Buckingham Palace issued a terse two-line statement Wednesday evening, suggesting the couple’s announcement had caught the royal family off guard, if not totally blindsided it. “Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,” the statement said. “We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.” Among those issues, one royal watcher said, was how a partial self-exile would work. Other members of the family have been exiled, either because of divorce, abdication or their own behavior. But no one has attempted the half-in, half-out arrangement that Prince Harry and his wife appear to be pursuing. It raises vexing questions about how they would support themselves, since British taxpayers now fund their security, among many other expenses. Prince Harry is the second prominent member of the royal family to step back from his official duties in just three months. Prince Andrew said last November that he would retire from public life after an interview with the BBC reignited questions about his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew’s calamitous interview, which revived accusations that he was involved in sex trafficking with Mr. Epstein, prompted some British newspapers to urge Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, to take a more forceful role in the family’s affairs, given that the queen is now 93. Wednesday’s announcement came amid persistent rumors that Prince Harry and Meghan had tensions with his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate, which have been eagerly dissected by the tabloid press in London. In October, during a trip to South Africa, the Sussexes opened up to the TV interviewer Tom Bradby. The duchess said she was struggling with being a royal and a new mother. Prince Harry kindled rumors of a rift by saying that he and Prince William were on “different paths at the moment.” He added, “I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.” In her annual television Christmas address, the queen made an oblique allusion to all the troubles. “The path, of course, is not always smooth,” she said, “and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy.” On Wednesday, the duke and duchess said they would continue “to fully support Her Majesty the Queen,” and would still support charities with which they are affiliated. But they said they wanted to give their 8-month-old son, Archie, “geographic balance” in his upbringing. Spending part of the year outside Britain, they said, would provide their family with “the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.” The couple did not say where in North America they planned to live, but royal watchers said they expected it to be Canada, not the United States. They spent several weeks during the holidays at a house on Vancouver Island, and the Duchess of Sussex, previously known as Meghan Markle, lived in Toronto for several years, where her television series, “Suits,” was filmed. The duchess’s mother, Doria Ragland, lives in Los Angeles, where the duchess was raised, and there have been occasional rumors that Prince Harry and his wife planned to live part of the year in Southern California. “It’s an extraordinary announcement,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “We will miss them, but I don’t think it will be all that damaging to the royal family.” Prince Harry already carries out much of his official duties in the Commonwealth, of which Canada is a member. “The queen is queen of Canada, so there is some logic in that,” Ms. Junor said. Still, there were many unanswered questions, not least how the couple planned to support themselves. “Their charitable work does not generate income, and they have a pretty extravagant lifestyle,” she said. Royal watchers described Wednesday’s announcement as “unprecedented,” though not altogether surprising, given the obvious rising tensions within the family. Some saw the couple’s decision not to spend Christmas with the queen and other members of the family at her royal residence, Sandringham, as a kind of road test for separating themselves from the family. Unlike Prince Andrew, Ms. Junor said, the Sussexes represent the future of the royal family. Their wedding, which mixed the pomp of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle with songs by a gospel choir, was a global sensation, making them arguably the most popular members of the family after the queen herself. But after a rapturous reception in the British press, the couple’s relationship with the tabloid press soon deteriorated. The papers criticized their zealous privacy, both during the duchess’s pregnancy and in their decision not to allow cameras to record the christening of Archie, a tradition among members of the family. “If the British public is paying for the refurbishment of their home, the media was right to call them out for that,” Ms. Junor said. Relations broke down completely after The Mail on Sunday published a letter the duchess sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018 asking him to stop talking to reporters and saying he had broken her heart “into a million pieces.” She sued the paper for copyright infringement and invasion of privacy. Prince Harry filed separate legal proceedings against the owners of The Sun and The Daily Mirror related to allegations that they illegally intercepted his voice mail messages, perhaps as far back as in the early 2000s. In an emotional statement released after the couple’s tour of southern Africa, Prince Harry railed against “relentless propaganda” and “continual misrepresentations” and accused the tabloids of subjecting his wife to the same cruel treatment they had inflicted on his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. She was hounded by the paparazzi for years, especially toward the end of her marriage to Prince Charles, and she died in 1997 in a car crash in Paris, as her driver tried to outrace pursuing photographers. Prince Harry has had his own tribulations over the years, from confessions of drunken partying as a youth and wearing a Nazi uniform in public, to prouder moments after his military service as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. But Ms. Junor said he had become a “rock solid” member of the family, and one of its leading representatives abroad.  In recent months, the prince, whose public image was forever fixed for millions as the somber boy walking with his father and brother behind his mother’s casket, lashed out in a way that left some royal watchers puzzled.  “I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,” Prince Harry wrote. “I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.” Laura M. Holson contributed reporting. ']","The couple said they plan to split time between Britain and North America, with Canada seen as a likely landing spot."

The papers criticized their zealous privacy, both during the duchess’s pregnancy and in their decision not to allow cameras to record the christening of Archie, a tradition among members of the family. “If the British public is paying for the refurbishment of their home, the media was right to call them out for that,” Ms. Junor said. Relations broke down completely after The Mail on Sunday published a letter the duchess sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018 asking him to stop talking to reporters and saying he had broken her heart “into a million pieces.” She sued the paper for copyright infringement and invasion of privacy. Prince Harry filed separate legal proceedings against the owners of The Sun and The Daily Mirror related to allegations that they illegally intercepted his voice mail messages, perhaps as far back as in the early 2000s. In an emotional statement released after the couple’s tour of southern Africa, Prince Harry railed against “relentless propaganda” and “continual misrepresentations” and accused the tabloids of subjecting his wife to the same cruel treatment they had inflicted on his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. She was hounded by the paparazzi for years, especially toward the end of her marriage to Prince Charles, and she died in 1997 in a car crash in Paris, as her driver tried to outrace pursuing photographers. Prince Harry has had his own tribulations over the years, from confessions of drunken partying as a youth and wearing a Nazi uniform in public, to prouder moments after his military service as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. But Ms. Junor said he had become a “rock solid” member of the family, and one of its leading representatives abroad.  In recent months, the prince, whose public image was forever fixed for millions as the somber boy walking with his father and brother behind his mother’s casket, lashed out in a way that left some royal watchers puzzled.  “I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,” Prince Harry wrote. “I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.” Laura M. Holson contributed reporting. ']","The couple said they plan to split time between Britain and North America, with Canada seen as a likely landing spot."
And You Thought Brexit Was Tough …,2020-01-08,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Like ex-spouses who have just signed divorce papers but not yet begun the ugly business of dividing their possessions, Britain and the European Union are tiptoeing around each other as the year begins, desperate to keep their dealings civil even as they gird for the unpleasantness to come. On Wednesday, a cordial Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to 10 Downing Street but offered no hint of flexibility on his campaign to negotiate a trade deal by the end of 2020. Dr. von der Leyen spoke warmly of a new beginning for “old friends,” but she made it clear she thought Mr. Johnson’s timetable for negotiating a comprehensive agreement was utterly unrealistic. She warned Britain that “the more divergence there is” between Britain’s rules and the bloc’s, “the more distant the partnership has to be.” “The truth is that our partnership cannot and will not be the same as before,” Dr. von der Leyen, a former German defense minister, said in a speech at the London School of Economics. “It cannot and will not be as close as before, because with every choice comes a consequence.” “With every decision,” she added, “comes a trade-off.”  Those trade-offs are going to come thick and fast after Britain leaves the European Union on Jan. 31. Negotiators will then have 11 months to agree on terms for trading in goods and services, as well as on regulations covering health, safety, fishing, farming, banking, aviation and transportation — replacing the latticework of rules that entwined Britain and Europe over their four decades together. If the two sides fail to strike a deal by Dec. 31 of this year, it could theoretically trigger something like the “no-deal Brexit” that Mr. Johnson threatened last fall before Parliament thwarted his efforts to withdraw from the European Union by the end of October. The more likely scenario, experts said, is a “bare bones” trade deal that will leave many of the issues to be hashed out in 2021 and beyond. Either way, for British voters who believed that Mr. Johnson’s landslide election victory last month would end the three-and-a-half-year debate over Brexit, the drama of the coming year may prove to be a rude shock. Mujtaba Rahman, a former European Commission official who works for the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said an ally of Mr. Johnson told him that one of the British government’s goals was to push the Brexit story from the front page to the business pages of newspapers in 2020. “That’s not going to happen,” he said. Part of the reason for that, Mr. Rahman said, is that Mr. Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition, setting up yet another cliffhanging drama at the end of the year if there is no deal. Moreover, his advisers appear determined to shun close alignment with the European Union in favor of an agile, less-regulated economic model that some have dubbed Singapore-on-Thames. “Instinctively, reflexively, intellectually, the people in power believe in the value of divergence,” he said. “They all think the E.U. is a bureaucratic over-regulator. This is about sovereignty and taking back democratic control.” Wednesday’s meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between Mr. Johnson and Dr. von der Leyen in their current posts. They do not know each other well, though both are alumni of the European School in Brussels, where Dr. von der Leyen was raised and where Mr. Johnson lived more briefly as a child. “Ursula and I were at school together,” Mr. Johnson said as they posed for cameras in 10 Downing Street. “Same school, but not the same time,” she corrected him. Later, in 1978, Dr. von der Leyen studied at the London School of Economics, living under an alias and Scotland Yard protection because of fears that she might be kidnapped by the left-wing terrorist Red Army Faction. Her father was a prominent German politician and she came from a wealthy family. At the commission, Dr. von der Leyen succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker, who was the public face of the European Union in its arduous negotiations with Britain since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Trained as a medical doctor, she has a reputation for being both smooth and steely in her dealings.  Mr. Johnson is trying to build bridges to European officials, having seen that his positive relationship with Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, helped him strike a critical deal on Britain’s withdrawal last fall. As is so often the case with Brexit, there is a danger of the two sides talking past each other. In Brussels, officials are preoccupied by the complexity of the looming trade talks and are pushing the British to be pragmatic. They seem baffled by Mr. Johnson’s insistence on a compressed, time-limited negotiation, which they say could inflict needless damage on Britain’s economy. Yet, in London, the Brexit project has always been driven by politics rather than economics. After his big election victory, Mr. Johnson is determined not to repeat the experience of his predecessor, Theresa May, whose leadership was destroyed by the crippling debate over withdrawal from the European Union. Government officials have been told to avoid using the word “Brexit” to underscore the idea that the Jan. 31 departure will settle the issue once and for all. Mr. Johnson wants to resolve future trade ties quickly, so he can shift his government’s focus to less toxic domestic issues like health care. Analysts also said the prime minister is calculating that if some damage to the British economy from Brexit is inevitable, it would make sense to sustain it early so that his government has four years or so to turn around the election before he faces voters in the next general election. Mr. Johnson’s main objective on Wednesday was to convince Dr. von der Leyen that there will be no extension to the transition period. But she held out hope that Britain might reconsider in July, the last milestone at which Mr. Johnson could petition for an extension. In a statement Downing Street described the talks as “positive” and said Britain wanted “a broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas,” though the British say they want a different type of negotiation to the last one where nothing was agreed until everything was. That would open the way to a series of more limited accords, were Brussels to agree. The European Union will not be ready to start talks until late February at the earliest. For even parts of a deal to be in place by December, the two sides will need to agree by late fall so the text can be legally scrubbed, translated into 23 languages and then approved by the 27 remaining member states. Based on the track record of previous negotiations, most experts have concluded it will be all but impossible to negotiate and sign a comprehensive trade agreement by the end of the year. Still, the optimists hope for an agreement on the most basic issue: a tariff-free trade deal. Other areas, like aviation, could be postponed until later, using contingency plans developed to keep planes flying had Britain withdrawn without any agreement at all last year. And the government could simply allow some major industries, like car manufacturing, to sign up to European regulations. “It is more than a daunting task,” said Lourdes Catrain, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Brussels. “I am not saying it is impossible, but I am saying that it requires a lot of resources and very clear policies.”']",Britain and the European Union now face the all-but-impossible task of drawing up a comprehensive trade deal in a year’s time.

U.K. Lawmakers Give Brexit Bill the Green Light,2020-01-09,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — After more than a year of drama, recrimination and tense, late-night votes, British lawmakers signed off on Thursday, with minimal fuss and no fanfare, on legislation to take their country out of the European Union at the end of the month. The vote in the House of Commons is not quite the final parliamentary moment of Britain’s extraordinary Brexit story — the bill will be considered next by the unelected second chamber, the House of Lords — but the suspense that surrounded many previous votes was entirely absent. [Read: Battered at the polls, pro-Europe Britons gird for the next fight.] Even if the Lords amend the bill, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party now have a large majority in the Commons and could overturn any changes — swiftly, if necessary. The legislation is almost certain to be completed and written into law next week. Only a few dozen members of Parliament attended the opening statements of the debate on Thursday — in contrast to the packed chamber for previous discussions on Brexit — but by the time the debate drew to a close hours later, most of the lawmakers had trickled into the room. They approved the bill on a vote of 330 to 231, drawing a long-awaited line under the heated debate over a Brexit plan that convulsed British politics and divided the nation. Once the exit plan has also been approved by the European Parliament, the stage will be set for Britain to reverse more than four decades of integration with its continental neighbors, a journey that began when it entered what was then called the European Economic Community in January 1973. What comes next remains far from clear — the deal set to go into effect on Jan. 31 establishes a transition period, and the two sides are preparing for negotiations on a long-term trade deal and on other future ties. Those talks are expected to revive many of the cross-Channel tensions in evidence since the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, convulsing the country’s politics. Since then two prime ministers have lost their jobs, as have many of the lawmakers whose impassioned dispute over Britain’s future brought the country to a state of political paralysis. That deadlock was broken by last month’s general election, won by Mr. Johnson with his pledge to “get Brexit done.” His critics point out that the painful job of untangling decades of European ties now merely moves to a second, more complicated, phase. But it is hard to overstate the change in the political mood from last year, when Parliament was in ferment and analysts were unable to predict when — or even whether — Brexit would take place. With the news dominated by Iran and the future of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, debates and votes on Brexit in Parliament this week have largely been ignored by a British media that once focused obsessively on parliamentary maneuvers.  Thanks to his large majority in Parliament, Mr. Johnson can easily pass all his legislation, and opposition lawmakers are powerless even to influence the coming negotiation on trade and other ties with the European Union.  Before the general election, lawmakers rejected Mr. Johnson’s timetable for scrutinizing the legislation as grossly insufficient. But on Tuesday the Brexit debate finished more than three hours ahead of its allotted time. On Thursday some of the old divisions resurfaced. “This is a great moment in our democracy,” said William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker and veteran critic of the European Union. “Now we will be able to govern ourselves.” The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said it was “time to get Brexit done,” using his Conservative party’s election slogan, and added, “this bill does so.”   By contrast Alistair Carmichael, a lawmaker with the pro-European Liberal Democrats, argued that the government’s Brexit plan “is going to leave us poorer and more isolated on the world stage.” But the tempo of the debate resembled a slowly deflating balloon, with the outcome of the vote a foregone conclusion. Big constitutional questions remain, and on Wednesday the Scottish Parliament refused to approve the government’s plan — a largely symbolic act that nonetheless illustrated the opposition to Brexit in Scotland, where there is growing pressure for another referendum on independence.  But Britain is now on course to leave the European Union 10 months after the first date — March 29, 2019 — on which it was scheduled to do so. The real effects will not be felt before January 2021, however, because Britain will be in the transition period until then, still under the European Union rulebook. On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the union’s executive arm, the European Commission, warned that this time frame was too short to complete a comprehensive trade deal, and that the cost of a clear break without an agreement in place would be new barriers to trade and a distant partnership. That warning was repeated on Thursday by Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, who said that Brussels would continue to prepare for a situation in which no deal is struck by the end of the year and tariffs and quotas are imposed. It would be impossible to agree on everything on the table this year, Mr. Barnier said, while adding that some issues would need to be decided. These include the politically sensitive question of fishing rights, and an agreement on the general tax, antitrust, social and environmental rules for manufacturers, known as “level playing field” provisions. European officials are determined to prevent Britain from gaining preferential access to continental European markets while undercutting them through lighter regulation. As for Britain’s objectives, those will be determined by Mr. Johnson’s government, and several lawmakers lamented the fact that they will have no influence over the British negotiating strategy.

Chinese Immigrant Evades Murder Verdict in Killing of Wealthy Relative in Canada,2020-01-08,By Dan Bilefsky,"['The lurid court testimony riveted Canada: A Chinese immigrant shot dead his brash, womanizing, millionaire relative at his $8 million hillside mansion in Vancouver, and then chopped up the body into 108 pieces before taking a long nap. In an unexpected ruling on Tuesday, Justice Terence Schultes at the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that Zhao Li, now 59, who was a business partner of the victim, Yuan Gang, was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and of “interfering with human remains.” Justice Schultes said that while he did not find Mr. Zhao’s testimony to be “truthful,” he had been left with reasonable doubt over whether Mr. Zhao intended to kill Mr. Yuan. Intention to kill beyond a reasonable doubt is the prerequisite for a murder verdict in Canada.  “Given the brutality of the crime and all the other circumstances, this verdict is surprising,” said Chris Johnson, a lawyer who represented the estate of Mr. Yuan, who died a few weeks before his 42nd birthday.  The defense and prosecution agreed on a judge rather than a jury trial. The trial, which took more than two years and attracted news media attention in China as well as Canada, underlined how Vancouver has become a global sanctuary for foreign money moving from Asia to North America. Mr. Yuan was a millionaire who had gamed the Canadian immigration system, building a business and acquiring Canadian real estate worth millions of dollars. Mr. Zhao, whose wife is Mr. Yuan’s cousin, was portrayed by the defense as a “well-adjusted” and law-abiding man who had been provoked by an indecent proposal from Mr. Yuan asking to marry his daughter. Mr. Zhao did not have murderous intent, his lawyer said, despite the crime’s violent aftermath, and so was guilty of manslaughter, not murder. But the prosecutor countered that Mr. Zhao had confessed the killing to the police, including that he had used a power saw to cut up the body. As the judge read aloud the decision, Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a navy blue suit, stared forward calmly, listening intently to his interpreter.  The judge said the case had hinged on Mr. Zhao’s mental state at the time of the shooting and whether he had the intent necessary for the crime to qualify as murder.  There will be a hearing next week to set a date for sentencing. He could face up to life in prison. “The verdict brings to an end what is surely one of Canada’s most gruesome killings, made all the more interesting by the fact that it happened in the wealthy and virtually crime-free enclave of West Vancouver,” Mr. Johnson said. The background of the victim and his lavish lifestyle — as well as testimony in a related civil case over his estate — offered a vivid glimpse of the lives of superrich Chinese living in Vancouver, many of whom have invested in real estate and see Canada as a refuge for cash and kin. In addition to Mr. Yuan, a playboy with a penchant for sprawling houses, luxury cars and taxidermied animals, other figures in the story were a colorful group of family members. Among them was Mr. Zhao’s glamorous daughter, Florence Zhao, known as “Flo-Z,” an aspiring fashion designer who starred in a popular reality show on YouTube, “Ultra Rich Asian Girls.” The series showcased Vancouver’s growing class of wealthy second-generation Chinese. Mr. Yuan was born in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. After becoming wealthy he moved to Canada, where he had previously married and then divorced a Chinese-Canadian woman to help gain permanent residency. While living in Canada, he became ensnared in a corruption and bribery scandal related to his previous business dealings in China.  He also went on a very expensive buying spree in Canada, purchasing two mansions, a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and a $2 million private island. But Mr. Yuan’s glittering new life took a lethal turn after he invited his poorer cousins from Montreal — Li Xiaomei; her husband, Zhao Li; and their teenage daughter, Florence — to live with him.  During the trial, Mr. Zhao testified that he had been ruthlessly bullied as a child after his father had opposed the Chinese government and was sent to a forced labor camp. The Zhaos were increasingly revolted by Mr. Yuan’s endless stream of girlfriends — as many as 100, according to testimony in a separate civil case over Mr. Yuan’s estate. On May 2, 2015, Mr. Yuan told Mr. Zhao that he wanted Florence’s hand in marriage. Mr. Zhao was irate, calling Mr. Yuan “worse than a pig or a dog,” according to his testimony at his murder trial. “Even a rabbit will not eat the grass around his nest,” he added, referring to incest. (The Zhaos were not Mr. Yuan’s blood relatives, since Ms. Li was adopted). It was at that point, Mr. Zhao said, that Mr. Yuan grabbed him. After a tussle over a hammer, he said, he shot Mr. Yuan twice. Then, Mr. Zhao said, he began to chop up the body, overcome by hallucinations: “I heard someone talking to me about a bear and how to cut up a bear,” he told the court. A more than eight-hour standoff ensued, during which the police surrounded the mansion in West Vancouver. After the killing, lawyers for the Yuan family said Mr. Zhao was a fabulist and motivated by revenge.  But during the trial, Mr. Zhao’s lawyer, Ian Donaldson, told the court that his client was a “normal, healthy” person who had been subject to “provocation.” The prosecutor countered that it was irrefutable that Mr. Zhao had killed Mr. Yuan. She also argued that his testimony that the killing was an accident was neither credible nor reliable. After the case gained exposure in the news media, seven women from China claimed that their children deserved part of Mr. Yuan’s roughly $21 million Canadian estate.  A judge ruled that five were entitled to split Mr. Yuan’s possessions. However, a taxidermied black panther, displayed at the entrance of one of his mansions, was donated to a museum.  Tracy Sherlock contributed reporting from Vancouver.']","After a trial that took more than two years, Zhao Li, who killed his millionaire cousin and then chopped up the body, was found guilty of manslaughter."
‘Armageddon Is Here’: Australian Readers Share Their Wildfire Experiences,2020-01-08,By Isabella Kwai and Tiffany May,"['Residents and tourists in Australia have been left reeling as wildfires engulf parts of the country, killing at least 24 people and destroying an area larger than Denmark. We asked readers to describe how they have grappled with one of the worst fire seasons on record. We heard from people who said they fled to the beach, where they dug trenches and prepared to jump into the water at a moment’s notice. Some said they sought refuge in camps where people brought dogs, chickens, goats and other animals. Others said they stayed behind, hosing down their homes in the hopes of saving their property from destruction.  We received more than a hundred responses from around the country. Many described struggling to breathe amid the choking smoke and being overcome with sadness and anger as they watched their communities and forests burn and pondered the toll it had on the country’s renowned wildlife.  These are their photos and stories, edited and condensed for clarity. Elizabeth Walton, Mystery Bay, New South Wales We awoke Tuesday morning in Mystery Bay to black skies at dawn amid a pyrocumulus cloud that was, I am certain, as terrifying as hearing a bomb launching overhead. We grabbed the things we had packed the night before and left for the Narooma evacuation center. The camp quickly filled with 4,000 people. They had dogs, chickens and even a goat. There were cats in cars. Ponies were being walked along the beach.  We spent Saturday preparing, as we were told to, to get ready to jump into the ocean. There were a hundred people on the beach who used tractors to dig trenches to jump into if the fires arrived. Mary Frost, Darwin, Northern Territory We survived New Year’s Eve in Mallacoota sitting in a small boat. There were four of us and my sister’s beautiful Dalmatian puppy, and we were scared for our lives. The fire brought whipping winds, bursts of thunder, lightning strikes and, very briefly, rain. There was an eerie quiet, punctuated only by the anxiety-provoking but reassuring sound of sirens. There were gas blasts, houses toppling and trees crashing or exploding.  The fire produced deafening, apocalyptic roars that will stay with me forever. Our hearts were racing. As oxygen levels dropped, there was a palpable fear that we were all going to be asphyxiated. Lucy Knight, Gunning, New South Wales I took shelter on Rosedale Beach with my three young children as the fire took hold. Our children rescued a kookaburra affected by smoke. Our family holiday house was spared but we are devastated by the damage to our beloved Rosedale. When we lost power and mobile phone service, we headed to the beach. We had wool blankets with us and sat in the water.  Anne Fogarty, Melbourne, Victoria We were camping on the southern coast of New South Wales when the fires hit. We evacuated to a center in Eden, eight kilometers (or five miles) from our campsite, throwing a few things in the car and leaving the tent and everything behind.  It was like a dystopian movie — cars lined up for fuel, shop shelves were emptied, there were electricity outages and no telecommunications.  After a sleepless night on the floor of the evacuation center we drove for 12 hours through thick smoke to Canberra with small grass fires still burning on the side of the road.  I had to buy an inhaler for the first time in 30 years. Jannah Hardefeldt, Cobargo, New South Wales For some reason I felt a sense of urgency to make a bush fire survival plan for our family. I feel it may have saved our lives. The air was thick with smoke and maybe that drove us to prepare the house. We went hard at it for about five hours, raking all the leaves and cleaning all the gutters. We cleared as much as we could, moved flammable things off the veranda and hosed down the yard.  On Monday night, the fire was 40 kilometers (25 miles) away and I was anxious. At around 1:30 a.m., we started making cups of tea and getting my grandmother and everyone else awake.  When we decided to leave, we spent five more minutes finding a basket to put the cat in. I saw fire rushing over the hill. We sprinted back to the house and everyone was ready.  Nadine Mannering, Melbourne After two days without power, safe water, phone lines or the internet, and running low on food, we decided to try to get to my parents’ place in Canberra from Wallaga Lake. We took water and some muesli bars, and we very, very luckily had a full tank of gas. Our neighbors could not leave as their car was on diesel and there was none in the area for them to fill up. Allison Cameron, Berry, New South Wales We have packed some precious sentimental items, important documents, food supplies, water and a first-aid kit — essentials to survive a few days out of home. Also, items for our pets, including food, medication, bedding and bowls.  Today we packed our car, expecting we might need to evacuate. We live in the Shoalhaven region and the fires are now quite close to us. We have been living with apocalyptic skies and air full of smoke and intense heat.  Karin Neate, Fishermans Paradise, New South Wales I lost my tiny home and months of income.  It took a full day to evacuate with my friend’s 3-year-old and two dogs. I left behind my friends who chose to fight the fires, with a 1-year-old, because there was no one else to protect their uninsured houses but them.  There is pure rage festering toward the federal government’s mismanagement and inhumane attitude.  Miranda Murray, Melbourne  My grandfather lost his farm on Kangaroo Island. He managed to shift his cattle to another part of the island two days beforehand so they were saved. That’s not the case with the animals on neighboring farms.  There were dead kangaroos, wallabies and koalas by the side of the roads. Why were the firefighters flown out so late? Stephen Muse, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory When the fire approached, we defended my mother’s house and protected neighboring properties as best we could before escaping at the last minute to the beach.

"Its Missiles Did Little Damage, but Iran Has More Potent Weapons",2020-01-09,By David D. Kirkpatrick and Ronen Bergman,"['American military and intelligence officials were stunned at the precision, scale and sheer boldness of what they later concluded was an Iranian attack. Four months ago, a swarm of low-flying armed drones and cruise missiles struck oil tanks in the central hub of the Saudi petroleum industry, catching Washington by surprise and temporarily knocking out 5 percent of the world’s oil supply. Almost no country in the region — Israel may be the exception — could have defended against it. The Iranian attack on American military posts in Iraq early Wednesday — the only direct attack on the United States or its allies claimed by Iran since the seizure of the American Embassy in 1979 — relied on ballistic missiles and inflicted little damage.  But with tensions between the United States and Iran at the highest level in four decades, the unexpected success of the September strike on the Saudi oil facilities is a stark reminder that Tehran has an array of stealthier weapons in its arsenal that could pose far greater threats if the hostilities escalate. Iran has denied responsibility for the Saudi attack. But American officials have concluded Iran was behind it, by sending the drones and missiles from Iran or southern Iraq. Iran’s conventional military has deteriorated severely during the country’s relative isolation since the Islamic revolution of 1979. But Tehran has spent those decades cultivating less conventional capabilities that are now among the most potent in the world and which are ideally suited for carrying out asymmetrical warfare against a superpower like the United States. Iran commands one of the region’s largest arsenals of ballistic and cruise missiles, a network of allied militant groups around the region with as many as 250,000 fighters, and teams of computer hackers that American officials rank among the most dangerous.  It has also developed sophisticated armed and surveillance drones. And lacking a strong conventional navy, it has sought other ways to choke off the flow of Persian Gulf oil, with a fleet of small speedboats and a stockpile of underwater mines. “Their offensive capability is drastically greater than the defensive capability that is arrayed against them,” said Jack Watling, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a London security research center. “Their ability to inflict significant damage makes the cost of war with Iran quite severe.” The ineffectual attack on Wednesday demonstrated the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles — some traveling more than 600 miles — but also their poor accuracy, with several landing well outside their presumed targets. Some analysts suggested that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may have intentionally ordered a symbolic but relatively harmless attack to show Iranian citizens a forceful response without provoking an all-out war with Washington.  “Khamenei has to calibrate the response so that it is enough for Iran not to lose face but not so much that Iran loses its head,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a scholar of Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But Tehran and its allies may still be plotting less overt forms of revenge for the American killing last week of the Iranian military commander Qassim Suleimani. Many analysts contend that Iran and its militant allies are reverting to their pattern of covert or indirect attacks that leave no clear evidence of Iranian responsibility. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, who also lost one of their leaders in the drone strike that killed General Suleimani, said Wednesday that they would seek their own revenge. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah, has said that it would do so as well. Iran has also shown a longstanding interest in assassinations, a tactic that could match the vows of Iranian officials to take “proportionate” measures to avenge General Suleimani. Several Iran experts said that killing an American official, presumably in the region, might be the eye-for-an-eye that Tehran is seeking. “I certainly would not be going out to many public places, because the risk of getting whacked or kidnapped is very high,” said Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador in Saudi Arabia. But Iran has a dismal success rate in assassinating foreign officials.  Iran has tried and failed to kill Israeli diplomats in Thailand, Georgia and India, and to bomb a rally near Paris where Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, was speaking. In 2011, American law enforcement agents broke up a particularly brazen and inept Iranian plot to hire thugs from a Mexican drug cartel for $1.5 million to blow up an Italian restaurant in Washington in order to kill a Saudi diplomat. “We almost couldn’t believe it,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Pentagon official who oversaw its Iran task forces at the time. “Everybody looking at the intelligence thought it was just crazy noise, until a first payment of $150,000 showed up in a bank account.” The September attack against Saudi Arabia presented a frightening alternative, in part because it exposed a vulnerable spot in most missile-defense systems. Most are built to defend against ballistic rockets, and almost none are equipped to detect and stop a large number of low-flying, high-speed drones and cruise missiles. Officials said that the attack demonstrated that Iran’s technology was more advanced than American intelligence agencies had expected.  “The attack on oil fields in Saudi was stunning in the depth of its audaciousness,” Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the Pentagon’s Central Command, said in a recent interview. Tal Inbar, former director of the space research center at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies, a now-closed Israeli research organization, said the precision of the attack could not have been achieved using only a GPS system. “Much better capabilities were deployed in this attack,” he said, “possibly a camera on the missile and the drones, which compares reality with a target image.” Unlike more advanced American or Chinese drones, Iranian drones cannot fire missiles from the air. But they can be loaded with explosives, as they were thought to be in the Saudi attack, to become remote-guided missiles.  Iran’s longest-range cruise missiles can strike more than 1,500 miles from Iran’s borders, reaching almost anywhere in the Persian Gulf. China, Russia and North Korea have provided Iran with technology and munitions, and Iran has produced remote-controlled drones domestically. Until recently, though, Iran has preferred to rely on its network of militant allies around the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, an array of Iraqi militias now organized as the Popular Mobilization Forces, the Houthis in Yemen, and other groups across the region. Some, like Hezbollah or the Iraqi forces, are now so large, well-equipped and institutionalized that they more closely resemble professional militaries than informal militias.  “That is what extends Iran’s power far beyond its borders,” said Afshon Ostovar, a scholar of the Iranian military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.  The Trump administration’s sweeping economic sanctions on Iran over the past year have damaged its economy and reduced its ability to fund its militant allies. But a report this week from the Center for Strategic and International Affairs concluded that the total number of fighters in the full network of Iranian-backed militias has continued to grow steadily, to an estimated range of nearly 150,000 to more than 250,000. And despite the efforts of the United States and Israel, Iran has continued to smuggle missiles of various ranges and abilities to its proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, according to Israeli and American defense officials.  The latest cycle of attacks between the United States and Iran started with a rocket attack that killed an American contractor in Iraq. The United States retaliated with a strike on an Iranian-backed militia, beginning a cycle of escalation.  But far from ending such rocket attacks, some of the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have said that even without Iranian encouragement they now intended to step up their attacks on American forces in order to drive them out of the country. “I think we are settling in for what is going to be a bumpy period of conflict,” Mr. Ostovar said.  Cyberattacks — a weapon that can cause severe damage halfway around the world with low costs and few fingerprints — may be Iran’s wild card. Cybersecurity experts and government officials have already spotted an increase in malicious activity by pro-Iranian hackers and social media users that they believe could foreshadow more serious computer attacks from Tehran. American officials and independent cybersecurity experts say that Iranian malware attacks on Saudi Arabia have been among the most damaging of such assaults in history, causing at least tens of millions of dollars in damages.  A 2012 attack that American officials attributed to Iran overwrote the hard drives of the Saudi state oil company Aramco with the image of a burning American flag. A second attack in 2016 and 2017 destroyed files of the Saudi central bank, certain government ministries and several private companies. That time, a famous photograph of a drowned Syrian refugee child appeared on computer screens. The former director national of intelligence Dan Coats ranked Iran as one of the four most dangerous sources of cyberthreats last year, along with Russia, China and North Korea. “It is capable of causing localized, temporary disruptive effects — such as disrupting a large company’s corporate networks for days to weeks — similar to its data deletion attacks against dozens of Saudi governmental and private-sector networks,” he said. One apparently low-level Iranian attack has already sought to avenge General Suleimani. Iranian hackers temporarily captured the website of the United States’ government’s Federal Depository Library Program and replaced its contents with a eulogy for the general. “Hacked by Iran Cyber Security Group Hackers,” text on the website read. “This is only small part of Iran’s cyber ability!” Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

"In Iran, Rejoicing Over Retaliation, then Relief at No U.S. Counterstrike",2020-01-09,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iran had carefully orchestrated its retaliatory response for maximum symbolism and emotional impact: The attack began around 1:20 a.m. Wednesday, correlated to the time that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was killed by an American drone strike last week. The country launched more than 20 missiles, the barrage targeting two large military bases that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women. Iranians rejoiced at the retaliation, saying it showed defiance and courage. “It’s a proud day to be Iranian,” said Amir, 42, of Tehran, in a telephone interview. He, like others, asked to be identified by first name only out of concern of being quoted in a foreign newspaper. “Time for everyone to respect our power.”  Omid Balaghati, a writer based in Tehran, posted on Twitter: “Strong politicians need to have strong military men next to them, and this is the story today.” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first public speech on Wednesday, suggested that Wednesday’s attack was not the end. “For now we slapped the Americans last night,” he said. “America’s military presence in the region must end.” For days, momentum had built for Iran to strike back. For the first time in many years, the public supported the leadership’s calls for a public confrontation with the United States. Still, in the hours after the attack, Iranians spent a restless night wondering whether Washington would strike back. President Trump said no Americans were killed in the attack, but some Iranians did not believe him. Iranian state media reported that 80 American soldiers were killed and more than 200 injured. “People believe that American soldiers were killed, but Trump is not admitting it because that would mean cornering him into war,” said Alireza, a 42-year-old engineer from Tehran, in a telephone interview.  Families stayed glued to state and satellite television and social media for live updates of the attacks and reaction from the United States. Iranians outside of the country frantically tried to reach family members at home to check on their safety and show solidarity. But by later on Wednesday, it became clear that after reaching the brink of war with the United States, both Tehran and Washington appeared to have dialed down their direct military confrontation, a de-escalation that had many Iranians expressing relief. “Iranians have been suffering for 40 years — revolution, war, immigration and sanctions. How much more can we take?” said Azadeh, 40, a business manager in Tehran, in a telephone interview. Minoo Vahabian, a 48-year-old owner of a cafe in Tehran and the mother of two, said she was confident that the Revolutionary Guards had the power to stare down America. Ms. Vahabian said Iran’s actions were justified — though the prospect of an all-out war with the United States still worried her.  “My anxiety is about my children’s future. The horizon is murky and we can’t imagine what’s coming our way,” she said. Siamak Ghasemi, an economic and political analyst, wrote in a post on Instagram “that the shadow of war has been lifted from Iran. The speeches of both Iranian and American leaders today was full of logic and wisdom and antiwar.”  The initial feelings of celebration at news of the strike, and then relief that no American counterattack seemed imminent, gave way to shock and sadness with the news that a Ukrainian Airline plane had crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s international airport Wednesday morning, killing 176 on board, including dozens of Iranian citizens. “It feels like we are getting hit on the head with a sledgehammer every morning when we wake up,” said Shima Sabet, a Tehran resident and fashion designer. “Will we ever see happiness and peace?”']","Many Iranians expressed support for the missile attack on American bases in Iraq, then spent a restless night waiting for a military response from Washington that never came.

U.S. Bet Guaidó Could Transform Venezuela. It Hasn’t Happened.,2020-01-07,"By Julie Turkewitz, Lara Jakes and Ana Vanessa Herrero","['CARACAS — A charismatic, 35-year-old politician steps out before a crowd of thousands in Venezuela and claims the presidency in the biggest challenge to date to the country’s autocratic leader. Within minutes, the United States — followed by dozens of countries — throws its support behind the challenger, Juan Guaidó, backed by crippling sanctions designed to weaken the current government and reinforce his hand. That was last January — the beginning of what the Trump administration said was an all-out effort to oust Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, in which “all options,” even military ones, were on the table. But a year later, the administration’s policy has been frustrated. Mr. Guaidó is so removed from power that, this weekend, he was barred from even entering the legislature, where he was seeking re-election as the body’s leader. In one dramatic moment, captured on video, a desperate Mr. Guaidó tried to scale the spiked metal fence that surrounds the assembly building. But government forces pulled him down while inside, Mr. Maduro’s supporters elected one of their allies to lead the legislature — a move intended to deprive Mr. Guaidó of the position that gives him legal cover to stake a rival claim on the presidency. The Trump administration on Monday sought to cast the events in Caracas as a sign that Mr. Maduro’s power was waning. But at a time when the administration is already facing crises at home — an impeachment inquiry — and abroad — the repercussions of an attack that killed Iran’s most powerful general — Mr. Maduro’s actions suggest that the gamble the United States took on Mr. Guaidó is looking increasingly like a failure. “It’s impossible to overstate what a huge blow all of this is to U.S. strategy in Venezuela,” said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela program at the Washington Office on Latin America.  On Monday, Mr. Guaidó and many of his allies vowed to press on with their campaign to bring down Mr. Maduro, whose leadership has dragged Venezuela, an oil-rich nation, into the seventh year of a devastating economic crisis that has left much of the population without access to sufficient food or medicine.  The day before, in defiance of Mr. Maduro’s forces, opposition legislators gathered in the headquarters of a newspaper and, in an emotional ceremony before a Venezuelan flag, held their own vote, which they said re-elected Mr. Guaidó as head of the assembly. At a news conference in downtown Caracas, Mr. Guaidó said he would enter the country’s legislative building on Tuesday, when this year’s session begins, with his “chest forward” and “risking skin,” to assume the role of president of the assembly.  “We’re going to do our work,” he said, condemning the weekend’s “violent takeover” of the assembly as a “farce that nobody recognizes.” American officials in Washington sought to bolster that narrative. “What you saw yesterday was something the regime didn’t want to do,” Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special envoy for Venezuela issues, told reporters at the State Department. “They wanted to win the vote in the National Assembly, and they couldn’t do it. With weeks and months of effort, they couldn’t do it, and they were forced to this last desperate resort of using the military.” “So I don’t think they come out of yesterday stronger,” Mr. Abrams said. “I think they come out of yesterday weaker.” He said the United States was preparing to send more aid to support the opposition to Mr. Maduro, including funds to support an independent press, the National Assembly and other democratic institutions. Mr. Abrams also raised the threat of imposing more economic sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s government and its officials. But he also said American officials had perhaps underestimated the level of Russian and Cuban support that had helped the Venezuelan president remain in power. “We think all the time about how to do better,” Mr. Abrams said. It was a far cry from a year ago, when Mr. Guaidó, a student activist turned legislator from the coastal city of La Guaira, took the helm of the country’s national assembly, the last major institution in the country controlled by the opposition.  Days into his mandate, Mr. Guaidó invoked an article of the Constitution that transfers power to the head of the Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant. Mr. Maduro’s most recent election, he claimed, had been a sham. At the time, public anger at Mr. Maduro was hitting a fever pitch, and Mr. Guaidó, the son of a teacher and a taxi driver, was initially embraced by many as a fresh voice in a place where so many had failed.  But a year of high-stakes maneuvers by Mr. Guaidó — like trying to persuade the military to turn against the president and trying to bring in much-needed humanitarian aid across the border — failed to bring down Mr. Maduro, who retains firm control of the military and of the country’s resources.  Instead, Mr. Maduro appears to have tightened his grip on the country, jailing and threatening opponents. He is accused by the United Nations and human rights advocates of widespread human rights violations. Millions of Venezuelans have spent the last few years on an emotional seesaw, pinning their hopes for change on one leader after another, only to watch them fail and the opposition fracture.  On Monday, many said the events of the weekend felt like a final, brutal crash.  “I don’t have hope anymore,” said Carlos Muñoz, 29, who sells ice cream from a cart in Caracas.  A year ago, Mr. Muñoz was planning to leave Venezuela for Peru, following millions of others who have fled the country to find work or escape persecution. When Mr. Guaidó appeared, he put his plans on hold.  After Sunday, though, he made the decision to leave.  “He lost the assembly,” said Mr. Muñoz of Mr. Guaidó “That was the only thing he had.” José Caballero, 51, a taxi driver, said that he had survived every year by repeating to himself, “this is the year everything is changing, this is the year.”  “And nothing happens,” he went on, “now I don’t want to say anything like that anymore.” In public, Mr. Guaidó has remained upbeat. But in private, the toll of the last year sometimes shows.  He spent one of last days of 2019 delivering presents to children in La Guaira, trailed by two government minders on motorbikes. In a lengthy interview between toy drops, he said his wife, Fabiana Rosales, and their toddler are followed even to their daughter’s preschool.  The rented apartment they share in a middle-class neighborhood in Caracas is half-empty, the home of a man who seems unsure where he will sleep tomorrow. The television is on the floor, child’s toys are stuffed in a corner, and the walls are bare, save for a large portrait of a Venezuelan nun named María de San José, known for aiding the ill. Like many Venezuelans in the capital, he has running water about two hours a day. At one point, when he raised the topic of his mother, who left the country for medical treatment that she could not find in Venezuela, his eyes turned red and he began to cry. “Of course I miss her,” he said. Mr. Guaidó’s popularity has declined significantly in the last year, according to polling from the Caracas firm Datanálasis. But he remains the most popular politician in the country, according to the firm.  And in an interview, the firm’s director, José Gil Yepes, said Mr. Guaidó’s popularity may rise in the coming weeks, “because of all the things the government did wrong” on Sunday. Mayrely Calderón, 39, a pharmacist, was among those who remained faithful to Mr. Guaidó. “He’s the one who will help us get rid of Maduro,” she said.  Julie Turkewitz and Ana Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas. Lara Jakes reported from Washington.']","America threw its might behind Juan Guaidó when he claimed the presidency, a direct challenge to President Nicolás Maduro.

"A New Toll in Mexico’s Drug War: More Than 61,000 Vanished",2020-01-07,By Paulina Villegas,"['More than 61,000 people have been forcibly disappeared in Mexico in recent years, government officials announced on Monday, a drastic increase of an earlier estimate of the toll of the country’s endemic drug-related violence and cartel warfare.  “These are data of horror,” Karla Quintana, head of Mexico’s National Search Commission which leads the efforts to find the missing country wide, said in a news conference. Behind the numbers, “there are many painful stories from families both in Mexico and of migrants,” she said. The new figures showed a sharp increase from a prior official estimate of 40,000 disappearances from early 2018, and Ms. Quintana said it comes from updated and carefully revised information from the offices of local prosecutors.  The official tally is now 61,637 people who have disappeared since 1964, Ms. Quintana said, the vast majority since 2006, the year the crackdown on drug cartels was launched by then-president Felipe Calderón. Last year alone, during the first year of leftist government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, more than 9,000 people were forcibly disappeared, said Alejandro Encinas, under secretary of human rights. More than 500 field searches across Mexico led to the discovery of 800 clandestine graves and the unearthing of 1,124 bodies. Mexican officials said most disappearances have taken place in 10 different states in swaths of the country with a heavy presence of drug cartels. More than half of the overall reported cases were of young people between 15 and 34 years old, 74 percent of whom were men, officials said. The government announcement differed from those of past administrations, which often played down the issue of drug violence and offered little details about the extent of the issue. A longstanding history of disappearances in Latin America during anti-leftist “dirty wars” in the 1960s and ’70s left tens of thousands of political dissidents and activists either dead or disappeared in countries like Argentina and Chile. In Mexico, the number cases of disappeared people surged more recently amid raging violence as drug cartels battled each other over territory and trafficking routes. As Mexican security forces were deployed to the streets to confront the ever-growing power of organized crime groups, criminals began implementing a highly efficient and vicious strategy: disposing bodies and tossing them into graves in desolate areas, rivers and mountains, to leave no evidence behind. One of the most emblematic disappearance cases, which  shed light on the entrenched corruption of Mexican security forces who sometimes participate in crimes, occurred in 2014 when 43 students from Ayotzinapa were attacked and kidnapped by local police officers working for a local drug gang in southern Mexico. The López Obrador government has faced criticism that it lacks an adequate security strategy to deal with the country’s rampant violence, underscored by recent cases like the siege of the city of Culiacán by the Sinaloa cartel and the massacre of nine members of a Mormon sect in northern Mexico last fall.

Pedro Sánchez Will Lead Modern Spain’s First Coalition Government,2020-01-07,By Raphael Minder,"['The leader of the Socialist party in Spain, Pedro Sánchez, was narrowly approved as prime minister by Parliament on Tuesday, clearing his way to form the country’s first coalition government since the return to democracy in the 1970s. The vote ended months of political stalemate, during which Mr. Sánchez had led a caretaker administration. He will now preside over a fragile minority government from the left. Its survival could hinge on his ability to bring to an end the long-simmering dispute over Catalonia, the restive region in northeastern Spain. Last year, Spain held two national elections, in April and in November. Mr. Sánchez’s Socialists won both, but each time without a parliamentary majority. After a slightly weaker result in the November balloting, Mr. Sánchez agreed to form a coalition with Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the smaller and more radical Unidas Podemos party. It then took seven more weeks for Mr. Sánchez to garner sufficient support from smaller regional parties, particularly separatist lawmakers from Catalonia, to achieve the backing he needed to become prime minister.  Together, the Socialists and Unidas Podemos hold 155 of the 350 seats in Parliament. The novelty of a coalition government reflects in large part an increasingly volatile and fragmented political landscape, which has made it nearly impossible for any single party in Spain to emerge from an election as a clear-cut winner, as had regularly been the case until 2015, when the country’s two-party system imploded.  Spanish politics has become a five-party contest, after the recent emergence of the ultranationalist Vox party.  In previous decades, the Socialists and the conservative Popular Party alternated in office, governing sometimes with an absolute majority and at other times by striking deals in Parliament with smaller parties to pass their legislation. But Spain has now held four elections in four years, with none of them yielding an unambiguous winner. On Sunday, in the first round of voting by lawmakers, Mr. Sánchez failed to gain the absolute majority that he needed. But on Tuesday he needed only to receive more votes in favor than against. The conflict over Catalonia dominated the acrimonious parliamentary debate, particularly after a recent pledge by Mr. Sánchez that his next government would hold a fresh round of negotiations with the separatist politicians who have governed in the region since 2015.  His offer of talks provoked a blistering response from right-wing politicians, who accused Mr. Sánchez of caving in to the separatists to continue in office and of paving the way for the breakup of Spain.  Before the vote on Tuesday, Pablo Casado, the leader of the Popular Party, which is now the main opposition, repeated his earlier warning that Spain was set to have “the most radical” government in its history.  He told lawmakers that the next Socialist-led government would be at the mercy of the “blackmail” of Catalan separatists, while also having to comply with the far-left demands of Unidas Podemos.  Directly addressing Mr. Sánchez, Mr. Casado said, “Now the problem will be yours: If you meet the demands of your anti-system partners, you will break up Spain. If not, they will throw you out onto the street.” Mr. Sánchez responded by pledging that his government would end “the toxic climate” that Mr. Casado and other right-wing lawmakers were fueling and would instead work to ease nationalist tensions within Spain.  “We are all born under the same sun,” he told lawmakers, quoting Manuel Azaña, who led the Spanish Republican government that ended during the civil war of the 1930s. Mr. Casado warned that his party would take legal action against Mr. Sánchez and his government if they did not ensure the removal of Quim Torra, the president of the Catalan regional administration. Mr. Torra is appealing a court ruling that would suspend him from office for 18 months, after he was found guilty in December of civil disobedience in his show of support for jailed separatists.  Supporters of Catalan independence have also demanded parliamentary immunity for Oriol Junqueras, the leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia party, after a European Court ruling found that Spain should not have stopped him from being sworn in as a member of the European Parliament after elections in May.  Mr. Junqueras is serving a 13-year prison sentence for sedition, after being sentenced last year by the Spanish Supreme Court as one of the former members of the Catalan government that unsuccessfully sought to declare independence in October 2017. As he prepares to take office, Mr. Sánchez finds himself once again in an unwieldy relationship with the Catalan separatist lawmakers.  In June 2018, he unexpectedly became prime minister after seizing on a court ruling that found the Popular Party guilty of operating a slush fund. Mr. Sánchez sprung a vote of no confidence against Mariano Rajoy, then the prime minister, with the support of Unidas Podemos and of Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. Mr. Sánchez won and took power. In early 2019, Catalan lawmakers withdrew their support, scuttling Mr. Sánchez’s budget plan and forcing him instead to call an election that left Spain in political limbo for the rest of the year. Mr. Sánchez and his Socialist party say that their plan to return to the negotiating table with the separatists will not lead to a binding independence referendum in Catalonia. But they have agreed to submit the outcome of the negotiations to some kind of consultative vote in the region.  In the coming days, Mr. Sánchez is set to name a coalition government that will include a handful of ministers from Unidas Podemos. Mr. Iglesias, the party’s 41-year old leader, is set to become Mr. Sánchez’s deputy. The two men have a history of acrimony that they have tried to set aside with the coalition deal. In June 2018, Mr. Sánchez won plaudits for forming a government in which women outnumbered men.  One of his first priorities this time will be to draft a national budget for 2020 that can be approved by Parliament. As part of his deal with Unidas Podemos, he has pledged to raise corporate taxes and income taxes on the wealthy.  He has also promised to reverse part of a labor law that loosened collective bargaining rules and made it easier for employers to fire workers. That law was passed by the previous conservative government in the midst of a banking crisis.']",The Socialist leader won approval from Parliament and will now run a fragile grouping of left-leaning parties whose survival may hinge on the separatist dispute in Catalonia.
"As Iran and U.S. Trade Blows, Afghanistan Sweats Between the 2 Powers",2020-01-08,By Mujib Mashal,"['In the days after a United States drone strike killed Iran’s top intelligence and military operative, President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan scrambled to keep his country out of a cycle of escalation between the two powers.  Now that Iranian missiles have come into play, some of the particular vulnerabilities of Afghanistan, which lies along Iran’s northeastern border and still hosts about 13,000 American military personnel on a network of bases, are on display.  “The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan assures the people and its neighbors that, according to the security agreement with the United States, the territory of Afghanistan in no circumstances will be used against another country,” Mr. Ghani said in one statement. His aides say he reiterated that message in calls with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper.  The Afghan leader’s concerns arise from the fact that President Trump in recent days warned that Iranian retaliation for the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani would be met by heavy force. Two United States military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the American air assets in Afghanistan have repeatedly come up in discussions over potential responses to Iran, though the top United States commander in Afghanistan has urged caution about such plans.  Along with a border, Afghanistan shares complicated and extensive political, cultural and economic ties with Iran.  Throughout decades of war and upheaval, millions of Afghan refugees fled to Iran, where a large Afghan population remains.  Even during 18 years of a United States presence in Afghanistan, which Iran sees as a threat to its security, the Iranian government has largely taken a pragmatic approach.  It is very engaged with the American-backed Afghan government, and has been a source of some economic support — and, covertly, of bags of cash to influential Afghans — even when its own economy has ailed. But it has also maintained communications with some cells of the Taliban insurgency, betting that the Taliban will outlast the American military presence.  The depth of Iran’s importance to Afghanistan was made clear in the public reaction of some of Afghanistan’s most influential political leaders after the killing of General Suleimani, a hardened security operator who spoke with many Afghan officials over the years and who sent thousands of Afghan refugees to fight on Iran’s side in the war in Syria.  Former President Hamid Karzai, who came to power after the American invasion and was supported by the United States during his 13 years in office, called General Suleimani a “man of dignity” as he condemned the United States’ strike against him. Mohammed Hanif Atmar, a former Afghan national security adviser who put his signature to the strategic security agreement between Afghanistan and the United States, spoke glowingly of the general as a martyr.  Even Abdullah Abdullah, the chief executive of the current United States-brokered government, went to the Iranian Embassy to pay his condolences and sign a memorial book laid out for General Suleimani, officials said.  Richard Olson, a former United States special envoy to Afghanistan, said that despite the high number of potential American military targets in Afghanistan, Iran would be more likely to strike elsewhere — possibly Iraq, Syria or Lebanon, where Iran has tighter control over proxy forces.  Instead, any American reaction launched from Afghan soil might put more pressure on Afghan officials than any demands by Iran, Mr. Olson said.  “If we get into a prolonged, low-intensity conflict with Iran — which I think is likely, unfortunately — then the U.S. may get to thinking that we are going to need to stay in Afghanistan and maintain a relatively robust military presence to threaten Iran from the rear,” he said.  “If we reach that decision,” he added, “then I think that pretty much means the end of the peace process in Afghanistan.” Mr. Olson was referring to renewed talks between the United States and Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, aimed at negotiating an American military withdrawal and the eventual opening of direct talks between the Afghan government and the insurgency.  Two Western diplomats aware of the peace process said that the United States’ strike against Iran, and Iran’s retaliation in Iraq, will surely slow down the talks, as the Taliban try to grapple with what this means for their insurgency.  While some analysts believe that the elements of the Taliban close to Iran will now feel pressured to deliver on Iran’s behalf, the diplomats said they hoped the Taliban would try to avoid being dragged deeper into another conflict at a time when they were so close to a deal. During the upheaval of the 1990s, when the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, the Shiite theocracy in Iran saw the group as an enemy force that oppressed Afghan Shiites and was hostile to Iran.  But while the United States was spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan, and cycling nearly a million American troops through in the 18 years of war, Iran changed its policy, deciding to nurture the Taliban when it was useful. General Suleimani was central to that effort, according to United States and Afghan officials, which has given Iran a hedge against the United States in Afghanistan at very little cost. Those officials say that in some cases, Iran has simply given Taliban leaders and their family members a refuge from American and Afghan forces, hosting them in Iran. One Afghan official said that General Suleimani made a point of allowing the smuggling networks that help finance the Taliban to pass unimpeded through Iran.  In other cases, Iranian support for the insurgency has been more significant. Afghan and Western officials say they know of Taliban offices in several Iranian cities. And the Taliban’s former supreme leader, Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, had started making trips to Iran from his base in Pakistan. He was returning from one of those trips when a United States drone strike killed him in 2016. With many of the Afghan leaders, General Suleimani had a history that reached back decades.   General Suleimani had a high profile within Afghanistan, and visiting Afghan officials often met with him in Iran. American officials, too, were keenly aware of General Suleimani’s interest, as some of the generals who have come to Afghanistan to lead had at other times crossed swords with General Suleimani elsewhere.  Before taking command in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller was in charge of the joint special operations command leading missions in places like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. General Miller’s predecessor in that role had described General Suleimani as his “peer competitor.” But if things continue to escalate between the United States and Iran, Afghan and American officials fear that more active Iranian intervention could change the battlefield in Afghanistan.  One major concern is whether Iran might now begin providing more sophisticated weaponry to the Taliban — particularly the kind of portable antiaircraft missiles that over 18 years of fighting had not been a factor that American and Afghan officials had to face in fighting the insurgency. After the killing of General Suleimani, a former Afghan intelligence chief, Rahmatullah Nabil, said on Twitter that it would be “no surprise” if such missile technology made its way into Taliban hands if a peace deal were to fall through.  But diplomats suggest the Taliban might be too rational to be dragged into such an escalation on the verge of a peace deal with the United States — unless they conclude that the United States is not leaving Afghanistan and needs to be forced out.

Russia and Turkey Make Joint Call for Cease-Fire in Libya,2020-01-08,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Russia and Turkey have called for a cease-fire in Libya to begin this weekend, stepping in on Wednesday to try to resolve a conflict that Western powers and the United Nations have struggled to end. Analysts say the Russians and Turks are seeking to exploit a diplomatic void left by Europe’s failure to end the fighting in Libya. A German-led effort to hold an international conference on Libya has come to nothing, and the United Nations Security Council has not called for a cease-fire. The Russian and Turkish foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling for the cease-fire on Wednesday after President Vladimir V. Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met and presided over the inauguration of the TurkStream gas pipeline in Istanbul. It is not clear how much Russia and Turkey can influence events on the ground, but Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have met regularly to discuss military deployments in Syria, and have declared Libya a priority. Russia and Turkey support different sides in the conflict. Russian contract soldiers have been deployed for months in support of the commander in eastern Libya, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is trying to take control of the capital, Tripoli. General Hifter’s forces seized the coastal city of Surt on Monday. Turkey has been supporting forces loyal to the United Nations-backed government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in Tripoli. Turkey announced last week that it would deploy troops to coordinate and train Libyan forces.  The deployment remains small, with 35 Turkish troops in Libya so far, led by a lieutenant general who will command an operations center, Turkish news outlets have reported. The two presidents appear to have made the decision between themselves and presented it almost as a snub to European and other powers that have supported different sides in the conflict. The Russian-Turkish statement said the cease-fire would begin at “00:00 hours on Jan. 12” and would be “supported by the necessary measures” to stabilize conditions on the ground. The cease-fire, it said, is aimed at supporting a resumption of United Nations-backed negotiations between the warring parties. But as Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan met in Istanbul, European officials mounted their own effort to forge a cease-fire. General Hifter traveled to Rome where he held talks with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy. At the same time, Mr. al-Sarraj flew to Brussels to meet with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.  Turkey has supported rebel factions that rose up against the former Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 and has provided assistance to the Tripoli government alongside Italy. Russia became involved in Libya only last year, in the absence of the United States in the country. It has joined Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in backing General Hifter. The cease-fire announced by the Russian and Turkish leaders may not be the dramatic breakthrough that Libya so desperately needs, analysts say, but more an attempt by Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan to set the terms of any future peace talks by elbowing aside their European rivals. “What we’re seeing is competition over who defines the international framework for any negotiations to end the conflict,” said Wolfram Lacher, a Libya scholar at the German Institute for International and Security. “Putin and Erdogan are mounting a challenge to the European claim to leadership on Libya.” The European peace effort is hampered by internal division. While most countries support the Government of National Accord — the official title for the government — France is viewed as being sympathetic to Mr. Hifter. The discovery of a cache of French-owned missiles at a military base in Libya last summer stoked suspicions that Paris had provided Mr. Hifter with military support, despite a United Nations arms embargo. And although ministers from many European countries, as well as the United States, complain about the interference of foreign countries in the Libyan conflict, they have been reluctant to openly criticize Mr. Hifter’s Arab military backers, most notably the United Arab Emirates. “The Europeans and Americans let this conflict drag on from April until it reached a stalemate,” Mr. Lacher said. “That allowed the Russians to step in, with a few hundred mercenaries on the ground, and make a difference. The question now is whether they are willing to raise their investment to the level that would make them king makers in Libya, along with the Turks. That is not clear yet.” Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Cairo.

A Victim’s Account Fuels a Reckoning Over Abuse of Children in France,2020-01-07,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — The French writer Gabriel Matzneff never hid the fact that he engaged in sex with girls and boys in their early teens or even younger. He wrote countless books detailing his insatiable pursuits and appeared on television boasting about them. “Under 16 Years Old,” was the title of an early book that left no ambiguity. Still, he never spent a day in jail for his actions or suffered any repercussion. Instead, he won acclaim again and again. Much of France’s literary and journalism elite celebrated him and his work for decades. Now 83, Mr. Matzneff was awarded a major literary prize in 2013 and, just two months ago, one of France’s most prestigious publishing houses published his latest work. But the publication, last Thursday, of an account by one of his victims, Vanessa Springora, has suddenly fueled an intense debate in France over its historically lax attitude toward sex with minors. It has also shone a particularly harsh light on a period during which some of France’s leading literary figures and newspapers — names as big as Foucault, Sartre, Libération and Le Monde — aggressively promoted the practice as a form of human liberation, or at least defended it. A day after the publication of Ms. Springora’s book, “Le Consentement,” or “Consent,” which sold out quickly at many Paris bookstores, the fallout continued. Prosecutors in Paris announced that after “analyzing” its contents, they had opened an investigation into the case and would also look for other victims in and out of France. [Update: Gabriel Matzneff has been charged after years of writing about his own pedophilia.] In France, it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15. But it is not automatically considered rape, unlike in countries with statutory rape laws where people who are underage are considered incapable of giving consent. With changing attitudes toward sex and gender equality, France toughened laws against sex crimes in 2018 and also extended the statute of limitations for prosecution — raising it to 30 years, up from 20 years — allowing victims to press charges until the age of 48. The new law, which is not retroactive, would not apply in the case of Ms. Springora. In the days leading up to its publication, her book, “Le Consentement,” had already compelled many in France to try uncomfortably to position themselves in the face of a problem that had never been hidden.  The former host of France’s most famous literary television program struggled to explain why he and other guests — except, tellingly, the only non-French invitee — laughed with good humor at Mr. Matzneff’s preferences for minors. Most of his longtime champions have remained silent, though a few still came to his defense, including the former book editor of Le Monde. France’s culture minister, Franck Riester, said that he supported Mr. Matzneff’s victims and announced that the government would review a writer’s allowance given to him — an abrupt shift in the government’s position. In 1995, long after Mr. Matzneff had written about his past, the minister of culture at the time awarded him the Order of Arts and Letters. “All this information had been widely available, Matzneff’s contemporaries knew very well, and university studies had been conducted on these questions, but it’s taken a victim’s account to trigger this process,” said Anne-Claude Ambroise-Rendu, a historian and the author of “The History of Pedophilia.” So far, however, Ms. Springora — now 47 and the head of the publishing company Julliard — is the only one of his victims to have spoken out. After hesitating for years, she told the French news media, she decided to break her silence after being outraged that a literary prize, the Renaudot, was awarded to Mr. Matzneff in 2013. In “Le Consentement,” Ms. Springora recounts being seduced at the age of 14 by the famous writer, who was then in his 50s. Introduced to him by her own mother, Ms. Springora writes that she fell in love with Mr. Matzneff and became disenchanted only upon discovering writings in which he described relations with countless other girls and boys, including those he met on sex tours in Southeast Asia. She also relates the depression and other psychological problems she suffered from the relationship, and the years it took her to recover. “He was not a good man,” Ms. Springora writes. “He was in fact what we’re taught to dread since childhood: an ogre.” In messages to Le Parisien, Mr. Matzneff wrote that the book’s reported contents were “unjust and excessive” and spoke of the “beauty of the love that we shared, Vanessa and I.”  And in a long, rambling letter addressed to Ms. Springora and published in L’Express on Thursday, he wrote that he would not read the book because “it would hurt him too much” and accused her of seeking to “harm” and “destroy him.” Caught now in the crosscurrents of France’s changing attitudes toward sex, Mr. Matzneff is the product and longtime beneficiary of France’s May 68 movement, the social revolution started in 1968 by students and unions against France’s old order.  With the slogan, “It’s forbidden to forbid,” the movement rebelled against authority and fought against imperialism, capitalism, racism, sexism and homophobia. Some also argued for abolishing age-of-consent laws, saying that doing so would liberate children from the domination of their parents and allow them to be full, sexual beings. Mr. Matzneff was one of the leading writers to advocate the legalization of sex with children. In “Les Moins de Seize Ans,"" or “Under 16 Years Old,” he writes, “To sleep with a child, it’s a holy experience, a baptismal event, a sacred adventure.” First published in 1974, it was republished in 2005. Thinkers on the left, like Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, spoke in defense of the practice, or came to the defense of men accused of engaging in sex with people below the age of consent in France. Libération, the newspaper co-founded by Sartre, championed pedophiles as a discriminated minority and ran personal ads by adults seeking children for sex.  The newspaper ran “revolting” articles about pedophilia into the 1980s, and its staff included activists who fought for the right to engage in “sexual relations with children,” its editor, Laurent Joffrin, acknowledged in an editorial this week, adding that the publication now opposed the practice. Tolerance of it was not limited to the left. For years, though less aggressive than Libération, Le Monde, the centrist newspaper, published a weekly column by Mr. Matzneff and articles defending those accused of having sex with underage partners, including one in 1977 that was signed by Sartre, de Beauvoir and Barthes. While the right attacked pedophiles, some of its leaders were close to Mr. Matzneff. Pierre Verdrager, a sociologist and author of “L’Enfant Interdit,” or “Forbidden Child,” a book on the politics surrounding pedophilia in the 1970s, said that what united its defenders was the belief that France had an “aristocracy” that was not bound to ordinary norms of conduct.  While the ordinary French appeared revolted by the apologists, writers were considered part of this elite and were even expected to engage in acts of moral transgression, Mr. Verdrager said. “There was an aristocracy of sexuality, an elite that was united in putting forth new attitudes and behavior toward sex,” Mr. Verdrager said. “And they were also grounded in an extreme prejudice toward ordinary people, whom they regarded as idiots and fools.” Among Mr. Matzneff’s longtime supporters, a few, like Josyane Savigneau, the former book editor of Le Monde, have defended him in public. “The witch hunt continues,” she wrote on Twitter. Bernard Pivot, who invited Mr. Matzneff several times on his televised literary show, “Apostrophes,” said that back in the 1980s “literature was more important than morality.”  “We are all the intellectual and moral products of a country and especially of a time,” he said, adding that he regretted lacking the “words that were needed” in interviewing Mr. Matzneff. In one program in 1990, the one guest to criticize Mr. Matzneff was the only foreigner present, Denise Bombardier, a Canadian writer, who called the writer “pathetic” and his writing “boring.” “Right now,” she said after listening to the host and other guests talk playfully and joke with Mr. Matzneff about his preference for underage girls, “I feel as if I’m on another planet.”']",A French author wrote for years about his predilection for children and continued to win acclaim. Now one of them has spoken out. 
Going Rogue: Prince Harry and Meghan Caught the Palace Off Guard,2020-01-09,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, failed to get clearance from Queen Elizabeth II before announcing their unorthodox plan to become part-time, financially independent royals and divide their time between Britain and North America. But the couple had been planning the move for months before it popped up, out of the blue, on their Instagram account on Wednesday evening, electrifying social media, interrupting the BBC’s coverage of Brexit and elbowing aside news about the risk of war between the United States and Iran. Soon after the couple issued a statement saying they planned to “step back” from their royal duties, they elaborated their thinking on a new, slickly produced website. The site was quietly designed by a firm in Canada with no input from Buckingham Palace, according to people with ties to the royal family. It has swiftly come to symbolize what palace officials regard as a rogue operation by Prince Harry and Meghan, one that now threatens the unity of the House of Windsor and the future of two of its most popular members. Yet the botched announcement is also a human story — of a recently married prince at odds with his older brother, Prince William; his American actress wife, isolated and unhappy in her cloistered new life; and a young couple enmeshed in a bitter feud with Britain’s aggressive tabloid press. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are also known, felt forced to disclose their plans prematurely after they learned that the Sun, a tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, got wind of the internal discussions about their status and was preparing a story, two people with ties to the family said. The uproar disrupted plans for Prince Charles, the duke’s father, and other family members to meet later this month to discuss how the couple might take on different roles — a conversation that has diplomatic, financial and tax ramifications. Still undecided is whether they can keep living rent-free in Frogmore Cottage, a recently refurbished house on the estate of Windsor Castle, owned by the queen. “We look forward to sharing details of this exciting next step in due course, after collaboration with Her Majesty the Queen,” as well as his father, brother, “and all relevant parties,” the duke and duchess said in characteristically upbeat language posted on Instagram and their site. That seems highly optimistic in the wake of headlines like the one in Thursday’s Daily Mirror: “They didn’t even tell the Queen.” The latest drama began just before Christmas, according to one person with knowledge of the family. Prince Harry, who was vacationing with his wife and 8-month-old son, Archie, in Canada, called his father to propose a new arrangement, in which he and his wife would relinquish some of their duties, live part of the year outside Britain and seek to support themselves. Prince Charles, this person said, asked for a written proposal from the couple, which would then form the basis for a longer conversation. The queen conveyed to Prince Harry that he would need his father’s support for her to give her blessing. Neither of those things happened, though the couple’s site presents several details about their new lives, as if they have been settled with the family. The site’s genesis, people with knowledge of the family said, was in the couple’s new charity, Sussex Royal, which they created after Prince Harry broke away from a charity he shared with his brother. Sussex Royal, which has no connection to their official duties, has consumed much of their energy in recent months. To design its site, the couple hired Article, a Toronto-based digital firm that designed The Tig, a now-defunct lifestyle blog that the duchess began in her acting days. When the Sussex Royal site went live Wednesday, it wound up being used as the vehicle for the announcement. That caught the couple’s communications team in Buckingham Palace by surprise, since they had no involvement in its creation. The duchess also works with Sunshine Sachs, a public relations firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles. An official there said the firm was not involved in either the announcement or the creation of the site. With gauzy photos and corporate-style language, the site sets out the couple’s rationale for scaling back their duties, defends their sources of funding and serves notice that they will no longer engage with the news media in the way Buckingham Palace traditionally has. Among its features is an explanation of who pays for their upkeep, complete with a graphic showing how money flows from the crown estate through the Treasury and back to the queen. But it raises as many questions as it answers. The couple say, for example, that they will forgo money from the Sovereign Grant, the public purse that pays for lodgings and offices for the royal family. But they note that it accounts for only 5 percent of their expenses. The other 95 percent comes from Prince Charles, through the proceeds he gets from the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast private estate established by King Edward III in 1337. It is not clear that Prince Harry would be entitled to the same income from his father if he were not a full-time royal.  The same is true for their tenancy in Frogmore Cottage, which the queen offered to the couple after tensions between Prince Harry and his brother prompted him to request that they move out of Kensington Palace, Prince William’s official residence. The couple came under criticism after reports the cottage was renovated in 2019 at a cost of 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million) in public funds.  The duke and duchess said their security was provided by Britain’s Home Office and suggested that would continue. But the site says nothing about who would pay for their security in Canada or the United States, the two countries that could be potential second homes. Nor does the site offer details about their plan to “work to become financially independent.” Royal watchers said each could sign multi-million-dollar book deals or earn tens of thousands of dollars on the lecture circuit. But to do that, they would likely be asked to share behind-the-scenes details about the royal family that would make their positions untenable. The duchess could resume her acting career, though that would set an even more startling precedent for a member of the royal family. As Meghan Markle, she starred in the legal drama, “Suits,” which was filmed in Toronto, which the couple are rumored to be considering as one landing spot. Other family members who have tried to make money, like Prince Edward, the queen’s youngest son, and his wife, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have had to give up their jobs after minor scandals. Prince Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, brought greater embarrassment on the family after getting involved in dubious moneymaking ventures and falling into debt. “It’s very commendable that somebody in that position wants to try to earn their own living,” Philip Hammond, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, told BBC radio. But he said the intense news media scrutiny would “make it actually quite difficult for them to do so.” The website also sets out new rules for engagement with the news media, which are sure to antagonize the tabloids. It says the couple will effectively boycott the “Royal Rota,” a four-decade-old arrangement that provides pooled access to the public activities of the royal family.  Four of the seven papers in the group are tabloids; Prince Harry’s contempt for them is palpable on the site. “Britain’s Royal Correspondents are regarded internationally as credible sources of both the work of members of the Royal Family as well as of their private lives,” the site says. “This misconception propels coverage that is often carried by outlets around the world, amplifying frequent misreporting.” The couple said they wanted to cultivate younger journalists and experts on the issues that animate their charitable work. Journalists who are members of the royal press said the real motive was to cut out newspapers with whom Prince Harry has long feuded over coverage. The vitriolic press reaction to the couple’s news suggests that keeping the tabloids at arm’s length may not shield them. “We’ve known for a long time that Harry hates the media, and the tabloids in particular,” said Valentine Low, a royal correspondent at the Times of London. “It’s ridiculous to think that this will spare them. The tabloids will not feel constrained.”']","The queen had yet to give her approval to their idea of becoming part-time royals, but word of the plan was about to leak."
Koala Mittens and Baby Bottles: Saving Australia’s Animals After Fires,2020-01-07,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['WATERHOLES, Australia — The convoy of vehicles fleeing a raging inferno in the forest of southeastern Australia ferried a copious cargo: 11 koalas, 15 kangaroos, five chickens, two possums, two dogs and a lorikeet. Susan Pulis, who runs a wildlife shelter, had rallied her friends to pack the animals in blankets and baskets and take them to safety on the coast. One friend gutted her downstairs bedroom to house five of the kangaroos. Ms. Pulis has kept the youngest joeys in quilt pouches in another’s living room. “Since the fires, they are very different,” she said of the animals, “very on edge.” As wildfires have killed at least 24 people, destroyed more than 1,400 homes and ravaged 15 million acres, they have also inflicted a grievous toll on Australia’s renowned wildlife. Hundreds of millions of animals, many found on no other continent, may have perished, according to some estimates, devastating the country’s unique ecosystems. “We will have taken many species that weren’t threatened close to extinction, if not to extinction,” said Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist and botanist at Curtin University, in Perth.  Even the animals that survived, scampering away or hunkering down, may die from dehydration or starvation, Professor Dixon added. “It’s a biological Armageddon rarely seen,” he said. Wildlife in Australia was already under threat before these fires, as humans have changed the landscape. Agribusiness is among the top contributors to deforestation, which decimates wildlife populations, scientists say.  The astronomical estimates of animal losses and the heart-rending images of singed koalas during this disastrous fire season have spread the concern worldwide. Quilters in the Netherlands have made mittens for koalas with burned paws. New Zealanders are stitching joey pouches and bat wraps. Some experts have been dubious of the high numbers that have spread widely on social media, which are based on estimates of population densities of mammals, birds and reptiles from previously published studies. The death toll is arrived at by multiplying the number of animals expected to inhabit a given area by the total acreage burned.  But it is impossible to know how many animals managed to flee, for instance. Limited access to the burned lands, as well as the difficulty of documenting individual animal deaths, complicate efforts to assess the scale of the damage. Whatever the numbers, it is clear that the devastation is immense, scientists say.  “It’s dangerous to put a number to them,” said Corey Bradshaw, a fellow in ecology at Flinders University in Adelaide, in the south. But, he added, “there’s no question there has been deaths.” At least a quarter of the koala population may have been lost in New South Wales, according to various estimates. Significant numbers of the southern brown bandicoot and the long-footed potoroo, a kind of wallaby whose entire habitat has been ravaged by fire, have also most likely been lost.  On Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia, experts said thousands of kangaroos and koalas had been killed in the fire that has now ravaged a third of the island. There are also grave fears for the fate of a subspecies of glossy black cockatoos, of which there were only about 300 to 370 remaining before the fires. It is not only wildlife that has been ravaged. In Batlow, 285 miles southwest of Sydney, a video taken by a reporter showed the scorched corpses of sheep and cows strewn along a highway. Carcasses like these have raised biological fears around the country. Buchan, a farming region in the southern state of Victoria, has also been badly affected, with farmers having to put down burned livestock at a time when drought had already made earning a living nearly impossible. Farmers in the nearby town of Bairnsdale said that a cattle sale was planned Thursday  to unload their remaining livestock, some of which may be injured. Tina Moon, a farmer in Sarsfield, a town in Victoria’s southeast, said many burned cattle in the region had to be euthanized. She said she had saved her house, but had no idea how she would make an income in the coming months.  To protect Australia’s wildlife, rescuers like Ms. Pulis, who fled the forest for the coast late last month, are battling immense changes to the country’s landscape on a tiny scale. They cannot save Australia’s wildlife on their own, but their work is reinforcing scientists’ judgment that intervention will be increasingly necessary to protect animals on a hotter, more fiery planet.  Around the country, people have banded together to help feed, find and rehabilitate survivors.  In the fire-ravaged town of Mallacoota, one man says he has rescued nine koalas, for which the community is working to build a shelter. Others have left out seed, water and grasses for dehydrated and hungry fauna. “I know it doesn’t bring back properties, but for some it can give a sense of not giving up the fight,” said Katharine Catelotti, of Sydney, whose family lost a small shack in Wollomombi, more than 300 miles north of the city, and has been putting feed out for wildlife as well as keeping a small number in her home. The task for others has been more grim. One woman told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that she was checking the pouches of dead kangaroos for joeys and marking the ones without them so that other searchers would not have to repeat her efforts.  For Ms. Pulis, evacuating her few animals — which had already been rescued, some of them more than once, from starvation, dog attacks and car accidents — was simply part of life. In 2013, she founded a wildlife shelter on Raymond Island, a town just off the coast, with the intention of rehabilitating injured and abandoned creatures. In August, she relocated to Waterholes, 30 miles inland, because of the clearing of the island’s trees, which had made it impossible for her to release the koalas into an environment where they could find sufficient food. Somehow, her property in Waterholes, threatened twice by fires this season, remains standing, a lush oasis at the end of a blackened road in the eastern Victoria region of East Gippsland, where smoldering and fallen trees, charred earth and melted road signs stretch for hundreds of miles.  “It’s a holocaust,” Ms. Pulis said as she drove toward her home on Monday for the first time since blistering heat brought through a ferocious fire front.  Cool weather and rain have since brought a reprieve. But smoke still hung in the air. As she reached the track leading to her property, Ms. Pulis began to cry.  “This was my koala feed,” she said of the scorched eucalyptus trees, which used to provide leaves for her animals. “It was absolutely alive.” At her property, Ms. Pulis tended to the stressed and dehydrated kangaroos she had been forced to leave behind. She gave each an injection to relieve their pain — they had most likely hopped so frantically away from the burning forest that they had injured themselves — and refreshed their water, which was contaminated by ash. On Saturday, as yards-high flames threatened her property for a second time, Ms. Pulis’s friend Jason Nicholson defended it with a hose and hundreds of gallons of water.  Neither could believe that it remained intact — the garden surrounding it still green, with cockatoos calling from the trees. They said they expected that wildlife, pushed out by the fires, would congregate in what was now a garden of Eden among miles of decimated forest. “The difference is here, you hear the birds,” Mr. Nicholson said. “Out there, it’s quiet. Deadly quiet.”  Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Nowra, Australia, and Damien Cave from Sydney.']","Millions of animals, many found on no other continent, may have perished, and Australians are taking care of survivors.

How Rupert Murdoch Is Influencing Australia’s Bushfire Debate,2020-01-08,By Damien Cave,"['WOMBEYAN CAVES, Australia — Deep in the burning forests south of Sydney this week, volunteer firefighters were clearing a track through the woods, hoping to hold back a nearby blaze, when one of them shouted over the crunching of bulldozers. “Don’t take photos of any trees coming down,” he said. “The greenies will get a hold of it, and it’ll all be over.”  The idea that “greenies” or environmentalists would oppose measures to prevent fires from ravaging homes and lives is simply false. But the comment reflects a narrative that’s been promoted for months by conservative Australian media outlets, especially the influential newspapers and television stations owned by Rupert Murdoch. And it’s far from the only Murdoch-fueled claim making the rounds. His standard-bearing national newspaper, The Australian, has also repeatedly argued that this year’s fires are no worse than those of the past — not true, scientists say, noting that 12 million acres have burned so far, with 2019 alone scorching more of New South Wales than the previous 15 years combined.  And on Wednesday, Mr. Murdoch’s News Corp, the largest media company in Australia, was found to be part of another wave of misinformation. An independent study found online bots and trolls exaggerating the role of arson in the fires, at the same time that an article in The Australian making similar assertions became the most popular offering on the newspaper’s website. It’s all part of what critics see as a relentless effort led by the powerful media outlet to do what it has also done in the United States and Britain — shift blame to the left, protect conservative leaders and divert attention from climate change. “It’s really reckless and extremely harmful,” said Joëlle Gergis, an award-winning climate scientist at the Australian National University. “It’s insidious because it grows. Once you plant those seeds of doubt, it stops an important conversation from taking place.” News Corp denied playing such a role. “Our coverage has recognized Australia is having a conversation about climate change and how to respond to it,” the company said in an email. “The role of arsonists and policies that may have contributed to the spread of fire are, however, legitimate stories to report in the public interest.” Yet, for many critics, the Murdoch approach suddenly looks dangerous. They are increasingly connecting News Corp to the spread of misinformation and the government’s lackluster response to the fires. They argue that the company and the coalition led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison are responsible — together, as a team — for the failure to protect a country that scientists say is more vulnerable to climate change than any other developed nation.  Editors and columnists for News Corp were among the loudest defenders of Mr. Morrison after he faced blowback for vacationing in Hawaii as the worst of the fire season kicked off in December.  In late December, the Oz, as the News Corp-owned paper is known here, heavily promoted an interview with the government’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, warning that “top-down” pressure from the United Nations to address climate change would fail — followed by an opinion piece from Mr. Taylor on New Year’s Eve. Other News Corp outlets followed a similar playbook. Melbourne’s Herald Sun, for example, pushed news of the bushfires to Page 4 on New Year’s Eve, even as they threatened to devastate towns nearby and push thick smoke into the city. Days later, residents in a town nearly flattened by the fires heckled and snubbed Mr. Morrison during a visit to assess the damage. A new hire for Mr. Murdoch’s Sky News channel, Chris Smith, branded them “ferals” — slang for unkempt country hobos.  As is often the case at Murdoch outlets around the world, there have been exceptions to the company line — an article about the Australian golfer Greg Norman’s declaration that “there is climate change taking place”; an interview with an international expert who explained why this year’s fires are unique.  But a search for “climate change” in the main Murdoch outlets mostly yields stories condemning protesters who demand more aggressive action from the government; editorials arguing against “radical climate change policy”; and opinion columns emphasizing the need for more backburning to control fires — if only the left-wing greenies would allow it to happen.  The Australian Greens party has made clear that it supports such hazard-reduction burns, issuing a statement online saying so.  Climate scientists do acknowledge that there is room for improvement when it comes to burning the branches and dead trees on the ground that can fuel fires. But they also say that no amount of preventive burning will offset the impact of rising temperatures that accelerate evaporation, dry out land and make already-arid Australia a tinderbox.  Even fire officials report that most of the off-season burns they want to do are hindered not by land-use laws but by weather — including the lengthier fire season and more extreme precipitation in winter that scientists attribute to climate change.  Still, the Murdoch outlets continue to resist. “On a dry continent prone to deadly bushfires for centuries, fuel reduction through controlled burning is vital,” said an editorial published Thursday in The Australian. It went on to add: “Changes to climate change policy, however, would have no immediate impact on bushfires” — a stance that fits hand in glove with government officials’ frequent dismissals of the “bogey man of climate change.” It’s that echoing between officialdom and Murdoch media that has many people so concerned.  “Leaders should be held to account and they should be held to account by the media,” said Penny D. Sackett, a physicist, astronomer and former chief scientist for Australia. Timothy Graham, a lecturer at Queensland University of Technology who conducted the study of Twitter accounts exaggerating the role of arson in Australia’s fires, said media companies also needed to be cognizant of the disinformation ecosystem and stop contributing to the problem. That includes mainstream outlets, like ABC News, sharing inaccurate maps that exaggerate the reach of the fires.  But in the case of the arson issue, he said, scores of bots and trolls — many of which previously posted support for President Trump — have joined conservative media like the Murdoch outlets in promoting the idea that Australia’s fires are not a “climate emergency” but an “arson emergency.” “Maybe 3 to 5 percent of fires could be attributed to arson, that’s what scientists tell us — nevertheless, media outlets, especially those that tend to be partisan, jump on that,” Dr. Graham said.  Of course, it is often hard to know just how much influence any media company has. Gerard Henderson, a columnist for The Australian, said he didn’t think there was much need to address climate change because it was already a focal point across the rest of the media. “It’s hard to distract from climate change because it’s spoken about constantly,” he said. But there are signs that the Murdoch message is making headway — at least in terms of what people make a priority. Many firefighters working the smoky hills south of Sydney hesitated to state their views on climate change this week (some said senior leaders had told them to avoid the issue). But they were quick to argue for more backburning.  Similarly, in Bairnsdale, Tina Moon, whose farm was devastated by the fires, said she was mostly furious about the government’s failure to clear the land around her property. “I don’t think it’s climate change,” she said. Livia Albeck-Ripka contributed reporting from Bairnsdale, Australia.']","Critics see a concerted effort to shift blame, protect conservative leaders and divert attention from climate change."
"Missile Strike Damage Appears Limited, but Iran May Not Be Done",2020-01-08,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — Over an intense half-hour before dawn on Wednesday, Iran bombed targets in Iraq, striking in and around two large military bases that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women.  But when the barrage of 22 missiles was over, the damage appeared to be to the bases’ infrastructure, not to people.  In a short statement released on Wednesday morning, the Joint Command in Baghdad, which includes both Iraqi and international representatives, said that neither coalition nor Iraqi forces had “recorded any losses.”  Of the 22 missiles, the majority were aimed at Al-Asad, an air base in the desert of western Anbar, an entirely Sunni Muslim area. Of the 17 missiles aimed at the base, two fell outside it near the city of Hit, but did not explode, officials said.  Five of the missiles were aimed at an air base in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, and hit the headquarters building. Damage assessments were ongoing on Wednesday.  Iran announced that the missile strike had “concluded proportionate measures” against the United States in response for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani by an American drone strike on Friday.  But officials around the region cautioned that the statement did not mean Iran was done maneuvering. More broadly, Iran has remained focused on the goal of forcing the expulsion of United States troops from Iraq.  President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, in his meeting with the country’s Council of Ministers on Wednesday morning, hinted at that larger strategic goal in comments that were clearly directed at the United States — and which referred to the fact that General Suleimani’s hand had been severed in the strike that killed him.  “You cut off the hand of Qassim Suleimani from his body, and we will cut off your feet from the region,” Mr. Rouhani said.  Iran has long viewed the American presence on its doorstep, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, as a threat. And it has worked for decades to have leaders in those countries reduce or eliminate the American presence altogether.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reached out to the prime minister of the Kurdish regional government in Iraq, Masrour Barzani, to update him on events. Mr. Barzani and his father, Massoud Barzani, have been staunch allies of the United States, and the air base in Erbil was the staging ground for the United States Special Operations mission that killed the head of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in October.  Mr. Barzani, for his part, said in a Twitter post that in his call early Wednesday with Mr. Pompeo, he had “suggested ways to de-escalate and contain the situation.” Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, released a statement similar to Mr. Barzani’s, saying the government would “continue its intense attempts to prevent escalation.” Referring to the Iranian bombing, he objected to the violation of Iraq’s sovereignty, as he had after the killing of General Suleimani and after American strikes on an Iranian-backed militia in western Iraq in late December.  Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","Iran said its bombings in Iraq had “concluded proportionate measures” against the United States, but officials around the region said that did not mean it was done maneuvering."
Furor in Iran and Abroad After Tehran Admits Downing Ukrainian Jetliner,2020-01-11,"By Anton Troianovski, Andrew E. Kramer and Farnaz Fassihi","['KYIV, Ukraine — Iran’s stunning admission that its forces errantly downed a Ukrainian jetliner — reversing three days of denial — did little to quell growing fury inside the country and beyond on Saturday as the deadly tragedy turned into a volatile political crisis for Tehran’s leaders and overshadowed their struggle with the United States. Ukrainian officials criticized Iran’s conduct, suggesting that the Iranians would not have admitted responsibility if investigators from Ukraine had not found evidence of a missile strike in the wreckage of the crash, which killed all 176 people aboard.  Protests erupted in Tehran and other Iranian cities as dumbfounded citizens found a new reason to mistrust Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, and other officials. Protest videos even showed some shouting, “Khamenei is a murderer!” and anti-riot police tear-gassing violent demonstrators.  Mr. Khamenei said he had ordered subordinates to be honest about Iran’s responsibility for the disaster. Both he and President Hassan Rouhani said they had not learned the true cause until an internal military investigation was completed on Friday. But that assertion raised new questions about how the two top leaders in the hierarchy — Mr. Khamenei is the commander in chief — could not have known.  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his first reaction to Iran’s announcement, said his country would “insist on a full admission of guilt” by Tehran. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, home to many of those aboard the destroyed jetliner, demanded a “full and complete investigation” and said “Iran must take full responsibility.” Both spoke by phone with Mr. Rouhani.  Contradictions and miscues complicated Iran’s message even as it took responsibility for the downing of the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, a Boeing 737-800 that was only a few years old. Iran’s military, in its initial admission early Saturday, said the flight’s crew had taken a sharp, unexpected turn that brought it near a sensitive military base — an assertion that was immediately disputed by the Ukrainians.  Hours later, an Iranian commander who accepted full responsibility agreed that the Ukrainians were right. “The plane was flying in its normal direction without any error and everybody was doing their job correctly,” said the commander, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who leads the airspace unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — a powerful, hard-line military force. “If there was a mistake, it was made by one of our members.”  [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] The Ukrainians further accused Iran of recklessly permitting commercial flights during a security emergency and of violating universally accepted procedures for a post-crash investigation. Bulldozers had heaped debris from the plane into piles on the ground.  “Everything was done absolutely inappropriately,” Oleksiy Danilov, the Ukrainian security official overseeing the crash inquiry, said in an interview with The New York Times, referring to how Iranian authorities had handled the site of the crash.  Within Iran, as citizens vented anger toward their government, officials offered a mix of contrition and an insistence that Iran was not solely to blame. Mr. Rouhani called the error an “unforgivable mistake.” General Hajizadeh, whose forces were responsible, said he had wished death upon himself because of the blunder.  [Read: Iran’s only female Olympic medalist has defected from the country over “lies” and “injustice.”] Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, wrote in an apology posted on Twitter: “Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster.”  But the official expressions of remorse did nothing to mollify angry Iranians who only a few days earlier were united in outraged grief over the American killing of a storied Revolutionary Guards leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Now they were once again out en masse protesting their government.  Some protest images posted on Iranian social media even showed torn photos of General Suleimani. “Death to liars!” and “Death to the dictator!” shouted Iranians gathered in squares in the capital, Tehran, videos shared on social media showed. “You have no shame!” shouted several young men, and the crowd joined in a chorus. In another tense spillover from the protests, the Iranian authorities briefly seized Britain’s Tehran ambassador, Rob Macaire, for what news accounts in Iran called his “involvement in provoking suspicious acts” at a protest. Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, denounced the seizure as a “flagrant violation of international law.” Many protesters carried candles and placed flowers at the gates of the universities and other public places in Tehran. Conservatives and supporters of the government accused the authorities of intentionally misleading the public about what had brought down the plane. Its passengers included many young Iranians on their way to Canada for graduate study.  Criticism directed at Iran’s leadership came from all factions inside the country. Even hard-line conservatives who exalt the military questioned its competence and what they called the deliberate decisions by senior military officials to misinform the public. Hamideh Zarabadi, a member of Parliament from the conservative city of Qazvin, said Iran should hold a state funeral for the victims, prepare 176 coffins “and write on each of them, 80 million times, damn to war.”  Ms. Zarabadi’s comments were a slap at Mr. Khamenei and conservatives who had until Friday boasted about war with the United States and their plan for “maximum pressure” to avenge Mr. Suleimani’s death. Mehdi Karroubi, a leader of the opposition Green Movement who has been under house arrest since 2011, issued a statement telling Mr. Khamenei that he no longer had the moral qualifications to be supreme leader. And the editor in chief of the official Tasnim News Agency, Kian Abdollahi, said that lying to the public was as catastrophic as the plane tragedy and that all officials who lied must be prosecuted. The criticism of Iran over the crash threatens to eclipse whatever international sympathy Iran has garnered in its escalating confrontation with the Trump administration, which has faced widespread criticism over stoking a violent confrontation with Iran’s leaders.  In Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an outspoken Iran critic who was among the first American officials to accuse the country of shooting down the Ukrainian jetliner, posted a message on Twitter that clearly alluded to the outrage in Iran on Saturday.  “The voice of the Iranian people is clear,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. “They are fed up with the regime’s lies, corruption, ineptitude and brutality.” Later Mr. Trump, in his own Twitter message, warned against what he called “another massacre” of protesters in Iran, an apparent reference to the deadly repression of demonstrators there in November. “The world is watching,” he wrote.   The plane went down in fiery destruction just a few minutes after departing Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport Wednesday morning, only hours after Iranian military forces fired a barrage of missiles at bases in Iraq housing American troops in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani by a United States military drone in Baghdad on Jan. 3.  Iran’s aerial defense forces, worried about possible American reprisals for the missile attack, were on alert — even though commercial aviation in Iran was allowed to proceed normally.  For three days after the crash, Iranian officials not only denied that their military forces were responsible, but blamed what they called the aircraft’s mechanical problems and said suggestions of Iranian culpability were American propaganda. Satellite surveillance and video clips of the plane strongly suggested that Iran’s own air defense missile system had blasted the plane out of the sky. The Iranians reversed themselves early Saturday. The newly critical language by Ukrainian officials in the aftermath of Iran’s admission stood in sharp contrast to more cautious statements in recent days. It partly reflected the frustrations in a country that had been thrust in the middle of the conflict between the United States and Iran.  Mr. Danilov, the Ukrainian security official, said Iran had been forced into conceding that its military had brought down the jet because the evidence of a missile strike had become overwhelmingly clear to international investigators.  He said Ukrainian experts on the ground in Iran had gathered such evidence since their arrival on Thursday despite apparent Iranian efforts to complicate the investigation, including by sweeping debris into piles rather than carefully documenting it. “When a catastrophe happens, everything is supposed to stay in its place,” he said. “Every element is described, every element is photographed, every element is fixed in terms of its location and coordinates. To our great regret, this was not done.” Mr. Zelensky’s office posted on Facebook photos of plane wreckage and a Canadian man’s passport showing small piercings — consistent with the hypothesis that shrapnel from a surface-to-air missile hit the plane. “We expect Iran to assure its readiness for a full and open investigation, to bring those responsible to justice, to return the bodies of the victims, to pay compensation, and to make official apologies through diplomatic channels,” Mr. Zelensky said in a post on his Facebook page. “We hope that the investigation will continue without artificial delays and obstacles.” Mr. Rouhani, in a statement cited by the Fars News Agency, offered condolences to the victims’ families and said that “the terrible catastrophe should be thoroughly investigated.” The Iranian expressions of remorse were met with frustration by Ukrainian aviation officials who had been struggling since the crash to get meaningful information from Iran about what had happened. “Even in the statement of Iran there is a hint that our crew was acting independently, or that it could have acted differently,” said the airline director, Yevhenii Dykhne.  The crew received no warning before leaving Tehran, Ukrainian officials said. The plane took off as Ukrainian flights from Iran had dozens of times before, and followed the same departure routes as other airliners leaving that morning, Ihor Sosnovsky, the vice president for flight operations, told journalists.  “There was no deviation from any routes that some are hinting at,” he said. The crew maintained normal radio contact with the tower in Tehran, he said, and followed a standard departure procedure for the airport. After reaching an elevation of 6,000 feet, they were instructed to make a slight northerly turn. In the last communication, he said, one of the pilots read back this instruction from the tower, saying, “Turn and climb.” Addressing criticism that the airline should not have sent a plane to Iran at all, in light of tensions in the region, the airline officials said it was Iran’s responsibility to close airspace if it had intended to fire missiles. Mr. Danilov said Iran had no choice but to admit to shooting down the plane because the facts had become apparent to Ukrainian experts on the ground and to the international community. The “cherry on top” in Ukraine’s inquiry, he said, came on Friday evening Iran time, when Ukrainian investigators found fragments of the top part of the airplane cabin that had been pierced by what appeared to be the shrapnel of a missile warhead.  “As we saw it, Iran had to face the reality that there’s no way they’ll get out of this,” Mr. Danilov said. In the hours immediately after the crash, Mr. Danilov said, Iran was resistant to letting Ukraine conduct its own investigation. He said the possibility that international aviation authorities might shut down passenger flights to Tehran also placed enormous pressure on Iran.  “They said: ‘Sorry, this was a technical error, either due to the pilots or the technical condition of the airplane.’ We said: ‘Let us have a look.’ They said: ‘We won’t let you,’” Mr. Danilov said. “It took rather concerted efforts of our diplomats and our consul working there in order to make sure everything went well for our specialists.” Mr. Zelensky spoke by phone to President Emmanuel Macron of France, and both agreed that French specialists would help decode the plane’s black box flight recorders.  Mr. Hajizadeh, the Iranian official who accepted responsibility for the missile strike, said the plane had been misidentified as a cruise missile and was shot down with a short-range missile that exploded near the plane. Asked why Iranian airspace was not shut to commercial air traffic while Iran’s defense forces were on alert for attacks, Mr. Hajizadeh had no clear answer. “I wish I was dead,” Mr. Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by local news outlets. “I accept all responsibility for this incident.” Anton Troianovski reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, Andrew E.

Iran Offers Mixed Message After Backing Away From Conflict With U.S.,2020-01-09,By Megan Specia,"['A day after President Trump backed away from further military conflict with Iran, a commander of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps declared that Iran would soon take “harsher revenge” on the United States for a drone strike last week that killed a top Iranian general. But another Iranian military leader said his country’s missile attacks targeting Americans in Iraq this week had not been intended to kill anyone.  The remarks were just some of the mixed messages put forth by Iranian leaders on Thursday after Iranian missile strikes, which hit two military bases in Iraq housing American troops. The slain commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, had led the Quds Force, a powerful branch of the corps, and his death reverberated across the country, prompting calls for revenge and the retaliatory strikes by Iran. The barrage of missiles on Wednesday took no American lives, Mr. Trump said, and appeared to have inflicted little damage on air bases in Asad and Erbil that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women. And though Tehran said afterward that it had “concluded proportionate measures” to avenge the killing of General Suleimani, officials in the region cautioned that Iran might not be done maneuvering and had not abandoned its goal to drive the United States out of the Middle East. On Thursday the commander of the Revolution Guards air force, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, described the strikes on the bases in Iraq as just the beginning of “a major operation” against the United States, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency, but he also noted that the strikes had not aimed to kill anyone. He quickly followed up with the claim that “tens of people were killed and wounded,” a point disputed by American, Iraqi and other international accounts.  A senior commander in the Revolutionary Guards, Abdollah Araghi, said on Thursday that Iran’s armed forces would “impose harsher revenge on the enemy in the near future,” according to Tasnim. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Thursday morning and warned of further action, according to the president’s office. “If the U.S. makes another mistake, it will receive a very dangerous response,” Mr. Rouhani said, according to the statement. The deputy general of the Revolutionary Guards, Ali Fadavi, also pledged vengeance, according to a separate report from the English-language version of Tasnim. “This move was one of the manifestations of our capabilities,” General Fadavi said in a speech in the central province of Isfahan on Thursday. “No country has ever made such a great move against the United States as we did. We dropped dozens of missiles into the heart of the U.S. base in Iraq and they couldn’t do a damn thing.”  The new leader of the Quds Force, Ismail Qaani, a longtime deputy of General Suleimani, released a statement on Thursday outlining his own commitment to moving forward with his predecessor’s agenda in the region, according to Tasnim. General Qaani added that the ultimate goal was to drive American forces out of the region. As the rhetoric from Iranian forces heated up, other international leaders were keen to de-escalate the situation. And many of the statements on Thursday seemed to stand in stark contrast to those made by Iranian government officials a day earlier.  The influential Iraqi Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr called on Iran-backed militia groups not to carry out further attacks, even as he stressed that Iraqis should still seek to expel foreign troops, Reuters reported. “I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, parliamentary and international methods have been exhausted,” he was quoted as saying.  Some analysts cautioned that more military action by Iran was still a strong possibility despite the government’s vow that the retaliation had ended. Sanam Vakil, a scholar of Iran at Chatham House, a research center in London, said the possibility of strikes remained high, noting Iran’s escalatory activities in recent months to “gain limited leverage” in the long-running dispute with the United States over punishing sanctions.  “More kinetic action and reaction is inevitable,” Ms. Vakil wrote in a series of posts on Twitter outlining her perspective.  The lack of a direct back channel between Iran and the United States to ease tensions and the stalemate over the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump abruptly pulled out of last year, are also major complicating factors. “Without a real off ramp, low-level escalation” like missile attacks from proxy groups, cyberattacks and threats to Gulf shipping “will undoubtedly continue in the coming months if not through the US election,” she added. Pope Francis referred to the conflict on Thursday during an annual address to ambassadors to the Vatican. He said the tensions risked “compromising the gradual process of rebuilding in Iraq, as well as setting the groundwork for a vaster conflict that all of us would want to avert.” Francis appealed to the parties to return to “dialogue and self-restraint.” The United Nations Security Council said it would meet on Thursday, and the tensions between Iran and the United States were likely to dominate an agenda tackling international peace and security.  Charles Michel, president of the European Council, the European Union’s decision-making body, said he had spoken to Iran’s president on Thursday, according to a statement, and “expressed hopes that there will be no further attempts to increase tensions in the region leading to a de-escalation of the situation.”  The statement also noted that the European Union was dedicated to preserving the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran had negotiated with the governments of the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. In his speech on Wednesday pulling back from the brink of war, Mr. Trump appeared to open a small window for diplomacy with Iran even as he urged other countries to turn their backs on the nuclear agreement and promised further, unspecified sanctions against Iran. Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said Mr. Trump’s offer to cooperate with Iran was “unbelievable” and that negotiations between the two countries would be meaningless if the United States continued aggression against Iran. The American sanctions against Iran amounted to “economic terrorism,” he added in an interview with the Iranian state news outlet IRNA.  The United States justified the drone strike that killed General Suleimani in a letter on Wednesday to the Security Council, calling the action self-defense, according to Reuters. Under the United Nations Charter, countries are required to immediately report to the Security Council any measures taken in self-defense. In the letter, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said the United States stood “ready to engage without preconditions in serious negotiations with Iran, with the goal of preventing further endangerment of international peace and security or escalation by the Iranian regime.” Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.

Civilian Planes Shot Down: A Grim History,2020-01-09,By Ron DePasquale,"['A Ukrainian airliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing at least 176 people. American officials believe that the Iranians brought down the airliner by mistake, with two missiles fired from an Iranian air defense system, the SA-15. Here are some of the most prominent passenger jets to be shot down — whether accidentally or, in some cases, deliberately: MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when it was blown out of the sky over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people. In June, an international investigative team charged four people, including three with ties to Russian intelligence. Moscow has consistently denied any involvement in the disaster, but Western countries and experts have blamed Russian-backed separatists. Seventy-eight people, most of them Russian émigrés to Israel, died when the flight from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk exploded and plunged into the Black Sea off the Russian coast.  Four minutes earlier, two long-range antiaircraft missiles were fired during a Ukrainian air defense exercise off the Black Sea’s Crimean coast. Ukraine’s president later said that he accepted investigators’ finding that his country’s military had accidentally destroyed the Russian airliner. A United States Navy warship in the Persian Gulf shot down an Iranian passenger plane that the Navy said it mistook for a jet fighter, killing all 290 people onboard. The Iran Air Airbus A300 was flying over the Strait of Hormuz while the warship, the Vincennes, a 9,600-ton missile cruiser, was being engaged by Iranian gunboats.  The Americans, who were following radar readings, wrongly thought they saw a hostile F-14 jet fighter, and downed the plane with a surface-to-air missile. [Read more about Iran Air Flight 655.] A Soviet fighter jet shot down KAL 007 after the airliner strayed off course and over Soviet territory, killing 269 passengers and crew members and prompting several theories.  The Soviet Union contended the jet was on a spying mission, which the United States denied. The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union searched the Sea of Okhotsk for the black box recorder but said they were unable to find it.  The episode evoked the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 902 in 1978, which had a different fate: All but two passengers on that flight survived.  The crash of Itavia Flight 870, known as the Ustica affair, killed all 81 people aboard and produced legions of conspiracy theories in Italy. The airliner was entering the final leg of a routine trip from Bologna, Italy, to Palermo, Sicily, when it suddenly plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea near the small island of Ustica. In 2013, Italy’s highest court ruled that the government had to compensate the families of some of the victims, implicitly acknowledging the most widely accepted theory behind the crash: that a missile fired by a warplane had hit the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-9. The court did not say where that missile came from. In similar episodes, rebel forces in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, brought down two aircraft within five minutes of their takeoff from Kariba.  Both were apparently hit by Soviet‐made Strela heat‐seeking missiles. Altogether, more than 100 people died in the two episodes. A Boeing 727-200 en route from Tripoli, Libya, to Cairo via Benghazi, Libya, was shot down by Israeli fighter aircraft over the Sinai Desert. Just five of the 113 passengers survived.  Israel said that the plane had flown over Israeli military concentrations along the Suez Canal and over a military airfield in Sinai, which was then occupied by Israel, which claimed it downed the plane to thwart a possible act of terrorism. Bulgarian fighter jets shot down a wayward plane that was traveling from London to Tel Aviv and had crossed into Bulgarian airspace during a storm, killing all 58 people on board. Under international pressure, Bulgaria — then part of the Soviet bloc — eventually gave Israel $200,000. Chinese fighter jets shot down a British-made DC-3 Skymaster operated by Cathay Pacific Airlines, the airline based in Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ten of the 18 people on board died. China later apologized, saying it mistook the flight traveling from Bangkok for a Taiwanese fighter jet and that it would consider paying compensation. A few days later, the episode grew more complicated when United States Navy aircraft searching for survivors clashed with Chinese military planes and shot down two of them.  Five Japanese military planes shot down a Chinese-American owned DC-2, known as Kweilin, soon after it had left Hong Kong for Chongqing. China and Japan were at war at the time. Fourteen people died; many of them had machine-gun wounds. The American pilot survived.

Oman’s New Sultan Vows to Continue Country’s Peacemaking Path,2020-01-11,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Persian Gulf nation of Oman named a new leader on Saturday, an Oxford-educated veteran of public service who pledged to continue his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy between global foes. The new leader, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, succeeds Sultan Qaboos, a towering figure who ruled Oman for nearly 50 years. He oversaw its development and pioneered a foreign policy based on good relations with a range of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States and Iran. Qaboos’s death was announced earlier Saturday. He was 79. The peaceful transition of power in Oman took place amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which has threatened to ignite a new war in the Middle East. Sultan Haitham, 65, has had a long career in public life, working in the foreign ministry, assisting with programs aimed at diversifying the country’s economy away from oil, and most recently serving as culture minister. He is a cousin of the late sultan. He comes to power as a number of conflicts swirl in the Middle East and as his government faces growing economic stress at home. In an address on Omani state television, Sultan Haitham vowed to continue his predecessor’s practice of not interfering in the affairs of other countries while working for peace between them. “We will continue to assist in resolving disputes peacefully,” he said. Oman, a country of 4.6 million on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an island of neutrality in a region rife with sectarian and political conflicts. While an oil producer, it is less wealthy than other Gulf states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and has maintained good relations with countries shunned by its Arab neighbors, such as Israel and Iran. It shares borders with Yemen, where a war involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — two of its other neighbors — continues to rage, and it has hosted peace talks with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. It has longstanding ties to Western nations like Britain and the United States, but also with Iran.  Those links have at times made it a useful friend to the United States, such as when it brokered the release of three American hikers jailed in Iran in 2011. A few years later, it hosted covert talks between the United States and Iran that paved the way for an international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Michael Stephens, a research fellow for the Middle East at the Royal United Services Institute, said he expected the new sultan to largely stick with his predecessor’s foreign policy to keep the country safe. “Oman is in this mixing bowl where they can’t really lean either way because of their historical relationships and their geographic position,” he said. “Oman survives by being quiet, not by being noisy, and I don’t see why he would tear up that playbook.” The new sultan’s greatest challenges could be at home, where economic stagnation combined with low oil prices have led to large government deficits and rising unemployment among the country’s large youth population. Sultan Haitham has helped lead efforts to diversify Oman’s economy, though with limited success. Experts see him continuing that effort. “Sultan Qaboos created a modern economy from scratch. Sultan Haitham will now need to reform that economy in order to ‘right the ship,’” said Elana DeLozier, a research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Oman suffers from significant economic challenges, and these can foster social problems if left unresolved,” she added. “The economy will be the primary challenge domestically for the new sultan in the near term.” Qaboos had no children and, despite nearly five decades in power, never publicly named or groomed a successor. That led to concern that his death could unleash a messy transition or even a power struggle between members of the Al Said dynasty, which has ruled Oman since 1744 and once stretched as far as Zanzibar. But there were no hints of any discord on Saturday, when the handover proceeded as planned, with much of the process aired live on state television. After tens of thousands of Omanis turned out for Qaboos’s funeral, a family council convened to choose his successor. Under Omani law, if the council did not agree in a few days, it had to open a letter with Qaboos’s choice, which was written before his death. But the council skipped directly to that step on Saturday, opening the envelope to find Sultan Haitham’s name. Some diplomats and analysts who work on Persian Gulf matters assumed that the process had been worked out by the family behind the scenes beforehand, with some even suggesting that the sultan’s death had been kept secret for days until the succession plan was in place. But the swift transition to Sultan Haitham appeared to lay to rest concerns about a tricky transition. Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, who studies Gulf politics at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said Saturday’s transition sent a message of continuity both to Omanis and to other countries that may have hoped the new sultan would adopt policies more to their liking. While a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a grouping of Arab monarchies, Oman has often charted its own course. When Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthi rebels in Yemen’s war, Oman stayed out. Oman also declined to join a Saudi- and Emirati-led boycott of Qatar. Sultan Haitham was educated at Oxford before returning to Oman to hold a number of positions under the previous sultan. He served in top jobs at the foreign ministry, sometimes chaired cabinet meetings and was appointed in 2013 as the head of a national development committee. As he took the reins of power, condolence messages streamed in for Qaboos from across the globe, including from parties locked in struggles against each other, reflecting Oman’s emphasis on nonalignment. Saudi Arabia lauded him for modernizing his country, while the Houthi rebels, who are fighting Saudi Arabia in Yemen’s war, praised his efforts to end the conflict. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran wrote on Twitter that Qaboos’s death was a loss for the region and encouraged its new leader to take “inspiration from the past.” From the United States, former president George W. Bush issued a statement calling Qaboos “a stable force in the Middle East and a strong U.S. ally.”']","Sultan Haitham bin Tariq took power after the death of Sultan Qaboos, who ruled the country for 50 years, and he pledged to follow his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy.

Prince Harry’s Real Declaration of Independence: From Britain’s Tabloids,2020-01-09,By Ellen Barry,"['Last fall, Prince Harry seemed to have everything a person could want: A luminous wife, a perfect baby and an extended stay in Africa, a region he has always loved. And yet, when he spoke to his old friend, the journalist Tom Bradby, he sounded traumatized, as if the events of the previous two years had dragged him back to the hell of his 13th summer, when his mother died in a car crash, speeding away from paparazzi. “Every time I see a camera, every time I hear a click, every time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,” he was quoted as saying in “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,” a documentary of their time in Africa. His wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, was also grim about the life she had chosen, telling Mr. Bradby that she should have paid more attention when friends warned her about getting involved with Prince Harry. “My British friends told me, ‘I’m sure he’s great, but you shouldn’t do it, because the British tabloids will destroy your life,’” she said. “I, very naïvely — I’m an American, we don’t have that there — I said, ‘What are you talking about? That doesn’t make sense.’” Much will be written, in the coming days and months, about rifts between the couple and the royal family, or of a millennial prince rejecting the old-fashioned life offered to him. But for Prince Harry, the British tabloid press was always the worm in the apple.  Other members of the family have accepted, as part of the bargain they were born into, the tabloid feeding frenzy: zoom lenses poking out of the shrubbery; school friends offered cash to betray their confidence; story lines, some of them invented, casting them as lazy, uncouth and self-indulgent. But Harry’s fury over press coverage became more visceral as his feelings for his wife and child grew. He said it openly: He blamed the media for his mother’s death. “My deepest fear is history repeating itself,” he wrote in a statement in October. “I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.” For generations, Britain’s news outlets have been locked in a power struggle with a family that values its privacy, with the media sometimes ratcheting up negative coverage in response to curtailed access. In private, editors boasted of their ability to damage the approval rating of royals who do not cooperate, as with a drumbeat of reports critical of Prince William’s work habits, branding him “Work-Shy Wills.”   Stig Abell, who served as the director of Britain’s Press Complaints Commission, a regulatory body, has described the relationship as “a hug that was always threatening to become an assault.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, from the first, made it clear that they did not feel any obligation to abide by that tradition, cherry-picking preferred news outlets and building a direct connection with the public through their Instagram feed. “The gentleman’s agreement between the royals and the British media was always based on the fact that they needed each other,” Mr. Abell said in an interview. “But we are seeing the fragmentation of media, the rise of social media, combined with the fact that they are a brand in and of themselves. They are a global phenomenon. If they don’t need the media, the question is, why would they have a relationship with the media?” Wednesday’s bombshell announcement, in which the couple said they would “step back” from their official duties, is the culmination of that logic. “This felt like the natural place it would end up,” said Mr. Abell, now the editor of The Times Literary Supplement. The Sussexes plan to withdraw from the Royal Rota, the dozen or so journalists who make up the royal press pool, and speak instead to journalists from what they term “credible media outlets focused on objective news reporting,” giving preference for “young, up-and-coming” reporters and “grass roots organizations.” The National Union of Journalists on Thursday blasted this idea, saying the public has the right to scrutinize the family, which is supported by public funds. “Who determines which media is ‘credible’ or ‘objective’?” said Michelle Stanistreet, the organization’s general secretary. “We cannot have a situation where journalists writing about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex can only do so if they have the royal seal of approval.” Emily Andrews, The Sun’s royal correspondent, told the Press-Gazette, which covers the British media industry, that courtiers in other parts of the royal household had reached out to her to say they appreciate what the tabloids do to promote their charitable work. “We dutifully turn up to royal engagements, at home and abroad, often waiting for hours in the cold, the rain and the boiling sun for them to arrive,” she said. “The royals do not always like what we write — but that’s the point.”  Prince Harry’s relationship with his wife, whom he met on a blind date in the summer of 2016, has been punctuated by conflict with the tabloids from the beginning. Responding to the of coverage of his new girlfriend — The Daily Mail ran an article headlined, “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton” — he released a highly unusual statement, accusing media outlets of allowing “racial undertones” to creep into their coverage. But if he thought this would win her more delicate treatment, he was wrong. It was war. In the run-up to the wedding, newspapers feasted on unflattering coverage of Ms. Markle’s father, a 73-year-old former Hollywood lighting director living quietly by himself in Mexico. The couple responded by allowing journalists minimal access to St. George’s Chapel for the wedding. The spiral deepened during the duchess’s pregnancy, when The Daily Mail published an emotional, handwritten letter she had written to her father, pleading with him to “please stop creating so much pain.”  When their son was born, in April of 2019, they announced they would skip the ritual photo opportunity outside the maternity ward, publishing their own photograph of the child on their Instagram feed. This was not satisfactory, said Arthur Edwards, 79, who spent decades documenting the royal family as a photographer for The Sun. “Well, we saw a picture of the baby’s fingers?” he said in an interview. “They were treating us with total disrespect. The taxpayer just forked out three million pounds for state-of-the-art décor in their home, and you can’t put out a good picture of your child?” Mr. Edwards was skeptical about Prince Harry’s comparison of his wife’s treatment with his mother’s. “Listen, it was a sad day when Diana was killed, but that’s a long while ago, it’s 25 years,” he said. “You’ve got to move on.” In October, the duchess filed a lawsuit against The Mail on Sunday, which published the letter from her father, accompanied by an agonized statement from Prince Harry. “There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,” he wrote. Mr. Edwards acknowledged that some coverage of the duchess had been “nasty,” especially at the early stage of their relationship, but said the prince’s relatives had toughed it out, accepting criticism as part of their job. “The Prince of Wales has had way worse than that. He was way down the approval rating, but you know what he did? He put down his head and worked hard, and now he is the most popular member of the family,” he said. Asked how Prince Harry would fare in the British news media, Mr. Edwards was foreboding. “He has gone down the approval ladder at a fast rate, I’m afraid,” he said. But response on social media told a different story, with many commentators celebrating their move. The couple’s new website, sussexroyal.com, attracted so much interest that, for long stretches on Wednesday afternoon, it would not load.  The photographs used to illustrate the news showed an exuberant couple on their way out of a visit to Canada’s High Commission in London, smiling radiantly, as if they had laid down a heavy burden. Mr. Abell said it all signaled that this was “a considered act.” “I think this shows they believe they hold the cards,” he said. “Play it forward, what’s the negative effect of this? A whole bunch of criticism in the press? Is that going to change anyone’s position? If they don’t want to be part of the royal family, they don’t need the consent — or the good will — of the British press.”']","The Sussexes have been preparing for years to sever their relationship with the royal press pack, which the prince still blames for his mother’s death."
"For Prince Harry and His Wife, Meghan, a Tricky Balancing Act",2020-01-09,By Sarah Lyall,"['She was too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural, the critics said. She should not have alienated the news media by refusing to join in their celebrity games. She should not have spent so much money renovating the house the royal family was kind enough to bestow upon her and her husband. And most of all, they said, Meghan Markle, a.k.a. the Duchess of Sussex, should not have inserted herself, Yoko Ono-like, into the once-close relationship between Prince Harry, her iconoclastic husband, and Prince William, his toeing-the-line older brother and a future heir to the British throne. But even as the duchess has faced lacerating criticism from Britons who like their royals to be dutiful and traditional — and from the tabloid newspapers that feed off and direct public opinion — so, too, has she had her own problems with life in her adopted country. “It’s not enough to just survive something, right?” she asked plaintively last year in the documentary “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,” talking about the British custom of keeping calm and carrying on through even the most untidy of emotional upheavals. “That’s not the point of life. You’ve got to thrive, you’ve got to feel happy,” she went on to say. “I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried. But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.” The result of this reciprocal unhappiness, it seems, was Wednesday’s extraordinary Instagram announcement from the couple that they would “carve out a progressive new role” and “step back as ‘senior members’ of the royal family.” How this would work in practice is anyone’s guess.  Other royals have left the family before, in various ways. Diana, the Princess of Wales, lost her royal title in 1996 after divorcing Prince Charles. King Edward VIII gave up his right to the throne in 1936 by announcing that he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, an unacceptably divorced American. And Prince Andrew was all but banished from the family last year after his association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light. There is no precedent for Harry and Meghan’s situation. No senior royals in the past have voluntarily said that they want to remain members of the royal family while also being somehow outside it at the same time. Except for King Edward, later the Duke of Windsor, who was exiled from home but longed to return, no senior royals have lived for any substantial time anywhere but Britain.  Harry and Meghan’s plan to live part of the time in the United Kingdom and part in North America, as their statement said, seems even more jarring.  And while the other royals who have left the family’s viselike embrace have done so reluctantly, unwilling to give up the trappings and remunerations of royalty, Harry — at least judging by his and Meghan’s Instagram statement — appears to be enthusiastic about the prospect. Not only does the couple want a new role within the monarchy, the statement said, but they want to “work to become financially independent.” That’s a radical notion indeed, in a family whose members have long enjoyed public financing. It is significant that even as Meghan and Harry went to great lengths in their statement to praise the royal family and pledge fealty to Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and to the monarchy in general, the response from the Queen’s camp was on the icy end of the temperature spectrum. Buckingham Palace does not like to be taken by surprise. “Discussions with the Duke and Duchess are at an early stage,” the palace said in its own statement — meaning, possibly, that discussions, such as they are, started very recently. “We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.” Meghan and Harry’s desire to break free from royal traditions and renounce the usual menu of royal obligations speaks directly to the challenges facing the monarchy as the reign of the queen, now 93, enters its final years. As the second son of Prince Charles, who has spent his whole life waiting to become king and is himself now a formidable 71, Harry has virtually no chance of ever becoming king himself. While Prince William, as the elder brother, has been tethered to the notion that he will succeed his father on the throne, Harry has had to find another path. He served in the British Army for 10 years, did two tours in Afghanistan and founded the Invictus Games for injured and impaired members and veterans of the armed services. Along the way, Harry developed a reputation as something of a bon vivant. His early girlfriends, at least the ones anyone knew about, were mostly young aristocratic women roughly from his own social circle. Meghan Markle, a divorced American actress with a white father and an African-American mother, represented a departure. Sometimes it can be hard to tell if the British tabloids direct public opinion or reflect it. From the beginning, they had a hard time dealing with Meghan, writing articles about her prior marriage and divorce, and about her parents’ divorce and her half-siblings, and making veiled remarks that seemed just short of racist.  Making an unusually pointed statement while they were still dating, Prince Harry condemned the “wave of abuse and harassment” and the “racial undertones of comment pieces” that Meghan had been subjected to. Their marriage, in 2018, seemed both modern and traditional, a meeting of past and present, America and Britain, Anglican and Episcopalian.  But after a honeymoon with the couple, the tabloids took a new approach of relentless criticism — of Meghan’s outfits, of her outspokenness, of her habit of jetting to America for such occasions as a star-studded baby shower, of her supposed desire to enjoy the trappings and riches of royalty without agreeing to take on the attendant responsibilities. In particular, she has been held up as inferior to the Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, who fulfills the fantasy of an anodyne royal who is practically perfect by virtue of dutifully and enthusiastically always showing up where she needs to be. As the news of Harry and Meghan’s plans exploded across the tabloids on Wednesday night, so did the condemnation. In The Daily Mail, a series of correspondents revisited a litany of complaints about Meghan’s behavior, going back to her wedding. “It emerged that Meghan had complained about the mustiness of St. George’s Chapel and wanted it sprayed with air freshener before the ceremony,” the paper reported, referring to the site of the royal wedding. “This was a young woman who was clearly not going to accept her position quietly.” If there’s one thing the tabloids hate more than an ungrateful royal bride, it’s an ungrateful royal bride who doesn’t even want to live in Britain.  ']","Others have tried to be both part of the royal family, and separate from it. None have succeeded. Can the Duke and Duchess of Sussex pull it off?"
Civilian Planes Shot Down: A Grim History,2020-01-09,By Ron DePasquale,"['A Ukrainian airliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing at least 176 people. American officials believe that the Iranians brought down the airliner by mistake, with two missiles fired from an Iranian air defense system, the SA-15. Here are some of the most prominent passenger jets to be shot down — whether accidentally or, in some cases, deliberately: MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when it was blown out of the sky over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people. In June, an international investigative team charged four people, including three with ties to Russian intelligence. Moscow has consistently denied any involvement in the disaster, but Western countries and experts have blamed Russian-backed separatists. Seventy-eight people, most of them Russian émigrés to Israel, died when the flight from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk exploded and plunged into the Black Sea off the Russian coast.  Four minutes earlier, two long-range antiaircraft missiles were fired during a Ukrainian air defense exercise off the Black Sea’s Crimean coast. Ukraine’s president later said that he accepted investigators’ finding that his country’s military had accidentally destroyed the Russian airliner. A United States Navy warship in the Persian Gulf shot down an Iranian passenger plane that the Navy said it mistook for a jet fighter, killing all 290 people onboard. The Iran Air Airbus A300 was flying over the Strait of Hormuz while the warship, the Vincennes, a 9,600-ton missile cruiser, was being engaged by Iranian gunboats.  The Americans, who were following radar readings, wrongly thought they saw a hostile F-14 jet fighter, and downed the plane with a surface-to-air missile. [Read more about Iran Air Flight 655.] A Soviet fighter jet shot down KAL 007 after the airliner strayed off course and over Soviet territory, killing 269 passengers and crew members and prompting several theories.  The Soviet Union contended the jet was on a spying mission, which the United States denied. The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union searched the Sea of Okhotsk for the black box recorder but said they were unable to find it.  The episode evoked the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 902 in 1978, which had a different fate: All but two passengers on that flight survived.  The crash of Itavia Flight 870, known as the Ustica affair, killed all 81 people aboard and produced legions of conspiracy theories in Italy. The airliner was entering the final leg of a routine trip from Bologna, Italy, to Palermo, Sicily, when it suddenly plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea near the small island of Ustica. In 2013, Italy’s highest court ruled that the government had to compensate the families of some of the victims, implicitly acknowledging the most widely accepted theory behind the crash: that a missile fired by a warplane had hit the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-9. The court did not say where that missile came from. In similar episodes, rebel forces in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, brought down two aircraft within five minutes of their takeoff from Kariba.  Both were apparently hit by Soviet‐made Strela heat‐seeking missiles. Altogether, more than 100 people died in the two episodes. A Boeing 727-200 en route from Tripoli, Libya, to Cairo via Benghazi, Libya, was shot down by Israeli fighter aircraft over the Sinai Desert. Just five of the 113 passengers survived.  Israel said that the plane had flown over Israeli military concentrations along the Suez Canal and over a military airfield in Sinai, which was then occupied by Israel, which claimed it downed the plane to thwart a possible act of terrorism. Bulgarian fighter jets shot down a wayward plane that was traveling from London to Tel Aviv and had crossed into Bulgarian airspace during a storm, killing all 58 people on board. Under international pressure, Bulgaria — then part of the Soviet bloc — eventually gave Israel $200,000. Chinese fighter jets shot down a British-made DC-3 Skymaster operated by Cathay Pacific Airlines, the airline based in Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ten of the 18 people on board died. China later apologized, saying it mistook the flight traveling from Bangkok for a Taiwanese fighter jet and that it would consider paying compensation. A few days later, the episode grew more complicated when United States Navy aircraft searching for survivors clashed with Chinese military planes and shot down two of them.  Five Japanese military planes shot down a Chinese-American owned DC-2, known as Kweilin, soon after it had left Hong Kong for Chongqing. China and Japan were at war at the time. Fourteen people died; many of them had machine-gun wounds. The American pilot survived.

Brazil’s Top Court Strikes Down Ban on Netflix Film Portraying Jesus as Gay,2020-01-09,By Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Netflix to continue showing a short film depicting Jesus as a gay man, reversing a lower court’s ruling that the film be taken down because it did “irreparable damage” to the nation’s Christians. The film, a satire called The First Temptation of Christ, ignited controversy among conservative politicians and clergy when it was released in December. The uproar escalated when, on Christmas Eve, the production company responsible for the film was the target of a firebomb attack.  This week’s rulings are yet another flash point in the country’s culture wars, which have grown increasingly bitter since the election of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in 2018. In striking down the lower court’s ban, the president of Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday that freedom of expression was a fundamental right in a democracy. “A piece of satire is not going to undermine the values of Christian faith, which has been around for more than 2,000 years,” the court’s president, Justice José Antonio Dias Toffoli, wrote. Netflix had appealed the lower court ruling, saying that it would fight for artistic expression, “which goes to the heart of great storytelling.”  On Tuesday, a judge in Rio de Janeiro had banned the film in response to a lawsuit filed by Centro Dom Bosco, a Brazilian Christian organization, which has denounced the film as blasphemous. The judge, Benedicto Abicair, concluded that keeping the film online was “more likely to cause grave and irreparable damage” than removing it from the public domain. He said the ruling would benefit Brazil’s “majority Christian” society.  Brazil, home to more Catholics than any other country in the world, also has a fast-growing conservative evangelical population that has gained more political clout in recent years. Many had celebrated the lower court’s ban.

"Happy Birthday, Trump Tells Kim. Not Enough, North Korea Says.",2020-01-11,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Saturday that President Trump had sent birthday greetings to its leader, Kim Jong-un, but added that the rapport between the two leaders would not help resolve their countries’ nuclear standoff. Ever since his first summit meeting with Mr. Kim, in Ju\u200bne 2018, Mr. Trump has repeatedly flaunted his “good relationship” with the North’s leader, \u200b calling Mr. Kim “smart” and even going so far as to say that he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.”  The two leaders \u200bhave also \u200bexchanged personal letters and dispatched special envoys to each other’s capitals, \u200bbut talks on how to denuclearize the North remains deadlocked. On Saturday, Kim Kye-gwan, a senior aide to Mr. Kim, confirmed that Mr. Trump had sent a personal letter to Mr. Kim for his birthday\u200b. (Mr. Kim is believed to have turned 36 on Wednesday. \u200b) \u200b He also acknowledged that the “personal relations” between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were “not bad,” but said Mr. Kim “would not discuss the state affairs on the basis of such personal feelings. \u200b” “Although Chairman Kim Jong-un has good personal feelings about President Trump, they are, in the true sense of the word, ‘personal,’” the official said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.  Chung Eui-yong, \u200bthe n\u200bational security adviser for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea\u200b, told reporters on Friday that \u200bMr. Trump \u200basked Seoul this past week to relay his birthday greetings to \u200bMr. \u200bKim\u200b. But Kim Kye-gwan said that a \u200bletter from Mr. Trump\u200b had already been delivered to Pyongyang directly from the Americans, \u200bcalling South Korea “presumptuous” for seeking to act as an intermediary between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. North Korea also hardened its position\u200b toward Washington on Saturday\u200b, calling the past one and a half years of on-and-off negotiations a “lost time.” The denuclearization talks collapsed when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump met in Vietnam in February 2018 for a second summit meeting and Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim’s offer to dismantle one of the North’s nuclear fuel-production facilities if Washington lifted international sanctions. Mr. Trump insisted on a more comprehensive rollback of North Korea’s nuclear program. Mr. Kim said recently that he no longer expected the United States to ease sanctions. Instead, he vowed to expand his country’s nuclear force, warning that North Korea \u200bno longer felt bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests. “There will never be such negotiations as that in Vietnam, in which we proposed exchanging a core nuclear facility of the country for the lift of some U.N. sanctions,” Kim Kye-gwan said on Saturday. “We know well about the way we should go and will go on our way.”']","A senior aide said the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had “good personal feelings” about President Trump, but that did not affect policy.

Two U.S. Service Members Killed in Afghanistan,2020-01-11,By Fahim Abed,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Two American service members were killed and two others were wounded in a roadside bomb explosion in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement. They were the first American military fatalities in Afghanistan this year. The victims were in an American military vehicle that struck a roadside bomb in Kandahar Province, where they had been conducting operations as part of the American-led NATO mission known as Resolute Support, according to the statement. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yusuf Ahmadi, claimed responsibility for the attack. The identities of the two killed service members were withheld pending notification of the next of kin. It was not clear which branch of the military they were from. Twenty American service members were killed in Afghanistan last year. More than 2,400 Americans troops have died in combat since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, according to the website icasualties.org. The previous American combat death in Afghanistan was in late December last year in northern Kunduz province, where Sgt. First Class Michael J. Goble, 33, of Washington Township, N.J., was killed by a roadside bomb. He was assigned to the First Battalion, Seventh Special Forces Group. The attack on American service members comes as the leaders of the Taliban are considering whether to comply with the American demand that they reduce violence in the country as a condition for reaching a preliminary peace agreement..    President Trump abruptly called off peace talks in September, after a Taliban attack killed an American soldier and 11 others. He announced the resumption of negotiations in November, during his first visit to Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Afghan officials said the United States conducted drone strikes in western Afghanistan, in Herat Province, targeting and killing a commander of a Taliban splinter group. The commander, Mullah Nangyalay, had ended his relationship with the main Taliban a couple years ago.  It was unclear whether that strike killed any civilians. Government officials said they are investigating reports of civilians casualties. Asad Timory contributed reporting from Herat, Afghanistan.

Oman’s New Sultan Vows to Continue Country’s Peacemaking Path,2020-01-11,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Persian Gulf nation of Oman named a new leader on Saturday, an Oxford-educated veteran of public service who pledged to continue his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy between global foes. The new leader, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, succeeds Sultan Qaboos, a towering figure who ruled Oman for nearly 50 years. He oversaw its development and pioneered a foreign policy based on good relations with a range of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States and Iran. Qaboos’s death was announced earlier Saturday. He was 79. The peaceful transition of power in Oman took place amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which has threatened to ignite a new war in the Middle East. Sultan Haitham, 65, has had a long career in public life, working in the foreign ministry, assisting with programs aimed at diversifying the country’s economy away from oil, and most recently serving as culture minister. He is a cousin of the late sultan. He comes to power as a number of conflicts swirl in the Middle East and as his government faces growing economic stress at home. In an address on Omani state television, Sultan Haitham vowed to continue his predecessor’s practice of not interfering in the affairs of other countries while working for peace between them. “We will continue to assist in resolving disputes peacefully,” he said. Oman, a country of 4.6 million on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an island of neutrality in a region rife with sectarian and political conflicts. While an oil producer, it is less wealthy than other Gulf states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and has maintained good relations with countries shunned by its Arab neighbors, such as Israel and Iran. It shares borders with Yemen, where a war involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — two of its other neighbors — continues to rage, and it has hosted peace talks with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. It has longstanding ties to Western nations like Britain and the United States, but also with Iran.  Those links have at times made it a useful friend to the United States, such as when it brokered the release of three American hikers jailed in Iran in 2011. A few years later, it hosted covert talks between the United States and Iran that paved the way for an international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Michael Stephens, a research fellow for the Middle East at the Royal United Services Institute, said he expected the new sultan to largely stick with his predecessor’s foreign policy to keep the country safe. “Oman is in this mixing bowl where they can’t really lean either way because of their historical relationships and their geographic position,” he said. “Oman survives by being quiet, not by being noisy, and I don’t see why he would tear up that playbook.” The new sultan’s greatest challenges could be at home, where economic stagnation combined with low oil prices have led to large government deficits and rising unemployment among the country’s large youth population. Sultan Haitham has helped lead efforts to diversify Oman’s economy, though with limited success. Experts see him continuing that effort. “Sultan Qaboos created a modern economy from scratch. Sultan Haitham will now need to reform that economy in order to ‘right the ship,’” said Elana DeLozier, a research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Oman suffers from significant economic challenges, and these can foster social problems if left unresolved,” she added. “The economy will be the primary challenge domestically for the new sultan in the near term.” Qaboos had no children and, despite nearly five decades in power, never publicly named or groomed a successor. That led to concern that his death could unleash a messy transition or even a power struggle between members of the Al Said dynasty, which has ruled Oman since 1744 and once stretched as far as Zanzibar. But there were no hints of any discord on Saturday, when the handover proceeded as planned, with much of the process aired live on state television. After tens of thousands of Omanis turned out for Qaboos’s funeral, a family council convened to choose his successor. Under Omani law, if the council did not agree in a few days, it had to open a letter with Qaboos’s choice, which was written before his death. But the council skipped directly to that step on Saturday, opening the envelope to find Sultan Haitham’s name. Some diplomats and analysts who work on Persian Gulf matters assumed that the process had been worked out by the family behind the scenes beforehand, with some even suggesting that the sultan’s death had been kept secret for days until the succession plan was in place. But the swift transition to Sultan Haitham appeared to lay to rest concerns about a tricky transition. Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, who studies Gulf politics at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said Saturday’s transition sent a message of continuity both to Omanis and to other countries that may have hoped the new sultan would adopt policies more to their liking. While a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a grouping of Arab monarchies, Oman has often charted its own course. When Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthi rebels in Yemen’s war, Oman stayed out. Oman also declined to join a Saudi- and Emirati-led boycott of Qatar. Sultan Haitham was educated at Oxford before returning to Oman to hold a number of positions under the previous sultan. He served in top jobs at the foreign ministry, sometimes chaired cabinet meetings and was appointed in 2013 as the head of a national development committee. As he took the reins of power, condolence messages streamed in for Qaboos from across the globe, including from parties locked in struggles against each other, reflecting Oman’s emphasis on nonalignment. Saudi Arabia lauded him for modernizing his country, while the Houthi rebels, who are fighting Saudi Arabia in Yemen’s war, praised his efforts to end the conflict. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran wrote on Twitter that Qaboos’s death was a loss for the region and encouraged its new leader to take “inspiration from the past.” From the United States, former president George W. Bush issued a statement calling Qaboos “a stable force in the Middle East and a strong U.S. ally.”']","Sultan Haitham bin Tariq took power after the death of Sultan Qaboos, who ruled the country for 50 years, and he pledged to follow his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy.

"In Poland, a Stubborn Defender of Judicial Independence",2020-01-10,By Joanna Berendt,"['WARSAW — Judge Igor Tuleya has been labeled an enemy of the state by the Polish government, threatened with violence, forced to evacuate his courtroom for fear of anthrax attacks and demonized in the right-wing media as a communist stooge. After someone smeared excrement on the door of his Warsaw apartment, his landlord deemed him too much trouble and evicted him. In Poland’s yearslong struggle over the rule of law, its judges have often found themselves at the ramparts — frequently vilified but also leading the efforts to stop the nationalist government’s campaign to tighten control over the judiciary. In the last two years, at least 20 judges have reported political harassment, while hundreds of judges and lawyers currently face threats of disciplinary proceedings widely regarded as politically motivated. At the center of the dispute is Judge Tuleya, whose rulings — branded “political” by Poland’s governing Law and Justice Party — have been cited by the authorities as one of the reasons they need to bring the country’s judiciary to heel. The overhaul has already triggered a process in Brussels that could see the country become the first European Union country to lose its voting rights. Judge Tuleya, 49, like many of his colleagues, said he has no choice but to resist, no matter the professional or personal cost. “Next year, some of us might be removed from office and those who will remain will be harassed into obedience,” he said during an interview at the District Court in Warsaw, where he is a judge trying criminal cases. “We will go back to the times of communism, when the judiciary was under the heel of politicians. We need to stand our ground while we still can.” These days Judge Tuleya, along with some of his peers from the Polish judges’ association, Iustitia, spends more and more time outside the courtroom, traveling the country to help educate the public about the consequences of the government’s threats to judicial independence.  In court, Judge Tuleya, who is single and known for his serious demeanor, always wears a suit underneath his scarlet robes. Outside the courtroom, though, he prefers a military green parka and funky T-shirts with bold statements like “Judge Not Dead,” “Free Courts, Free People” and the increasingly popular slogan of the protest movement: “Konstytucja,” or Constitution. He believes that the actions of Law and Justice have given birth to a “civic judge,” a new type of a justice who is “not isolated from the world but engages with the public outside the courtroom.” “Perhaps this is not a model known in older democracies in Europe, but I don’t think it’s at odds with their standards,” he said. “It may be new and it’s very needed here.” Those efforts at public outreach seem to be the target of a draft law proposed by Law and Justice in December that seeks to punish judges who criticize the government’s campaign to overhaul the judiciary and who engage in unspecified “political activities.”  “None of the changes they have made in the last four years have made the courts more efficient, transparent or friendlier toward citizens,” Judge Tuleya said. “All they have meant to do is fill key positions with loyalists.” On Saturday, Polish judges led by Judge Tuleya, among others, will be joined by their peers from about 20 European countries in the March of a Thousand Scarlet Robes in Warsaw to protest the new bill. The authorities see those demonstrations as a misguided and self-serving expression of solidarity among the judges. President Andrzej Duda said recently that the judges resist the changes only because they do not want “their privileges and power over the people taken away.” Judge Tuleya first gained prominence in 2013, when he issued his ruling in the trial of Dr. Miroslaw Garlicki, a distinguished heart surgeon whom the Law and Justice-led government accused of taking bribes, sexual harassment and killing a patient. Prosecutors painted him as the epitome of a corrupt, immoral post-communist elite that needed to be expunged from Polish society. By the time Judge Tuleya reached his verdict, Law and Justice had been voted out of power. But his ruling offered a scathing indictment of the government’s actions while in power. While he did find Dr. Garlicki guilty of accepting cash and gifts from his patients, he cleared the doctor of all other charges. He said the methods used by law enforcement and prosecutors — at the behest of political leaders — were reminiscent of the “deepest Stalinist times.” Those methods included late-night interrogations, threats and unfounded detentions of witnesses. Ever since that ruling, pro-government media outlets have waged a sustained campaign to discredit Judge Tuleya. When Law and Justice regained power in 2015, government officials pointed to the ruling as evidence of corruption in the judiciary.  Judge Tuleya says he now faces threats and verbal attacks on the street on a weekly basis. He watches as people on Twitter discuss murdering him. On two occasions, anthrax scares forced the evacuation of thousands of people in the District Court building where he works. Despite the efforts of Judge Tuleya and others, Law and Justice has been largely successful in its efforts to dominate the judicial system. Experts say officials now have full control of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Office of the Attorney General and the National Council of the Judiciary.  However, a push to purge the Supreme Court failed after the lead justice, Malgorzata Gersdorf, refused to resign and the European Commission threatened penalties if a newly imposed mandatory retirement age was put into effect. It was not the first time that opponents of the government had turned to the European Union as a last resort. And Judge Tuleya is one of several jurists who have reached out to the European Court of Justice to rule on whether the judicial overhaul violates European rules. A motion he filed is still pending. Even as he challenges the government, Judge Tuleya is facing six separate disciplinary inquiries — including one for turning to the European court for help. It is hardly the position Judge Tuleya expected to find himself when he decided to study law at the University of Warsaw. It was 1989, the Iron Curtain had just come crashing down and Poland was free for the first time in decades.  He considered medical school, but ended up choosing a career in the law, he said. Inspired by the character of Mitch McDeere, the protagonist of the John Grisham novel “The Firm,” he first planned on working as a sleek lawyer, but ended up on the bench instead. The judge, who was born in the industrial city of Lodz in central Poland and raised in Warsaw, began his career in 1996 and quickly made a name for himself during trials of people who had committed grievous crimes during the Stalinist era. His first scrape with many of the same people now running the government came in 2003, when he refused a request from politicians to waive a law protecting journalistic sources in a corruption affair that brought down the government at the time. Despite the government’s stream of claims that Judge Tuleya is biased and a political agent, he says no one from the ruling party has ever asked to remove him from cases concerning them, implying that they expect a fair hearing in his court, despite their rhetoric. “They could have done it but never did,” he said. “Those claims that judges are politicians are sheer manipulation.”  The judge warned that there is no room for constructive policy criticism at this point, because the government treats all such expressions of concern as political attacks. “But it is not just our right as judges to speak up when the rule of law is being threatened, it is also our duty,” he said. “I’ve had to face harsh consequences because of my rulings. I have survived them all and I now feel free to speak my mind.”']","Judge Igor Tuleya has faced threats, fake anthrax attacks and denunciations in the right-wing news media as he fights the government’s campaign to control the courts."
Evidence That Plane Was Shot Down in Iran May Upset U.S.-Canada Relations,2020-01-10,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — New evidence indicating that an Iranian surface-to-air missile caused the plane crash this week that killed 63 Canadians is likely to undermine Canada’s already acrimonious relationship with Iran. But the disaster also threatens to damage Ottawa’s crucial but fraught partnership with Washington. On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said that his country had intelligence showing that Iran had downed the Ukrainian jetliner, which was carrying 63 Canadians among its some 176 passengers and crew, but he stressed that he wanted a thorough investigation before reaching any conclusions.  “The families of the victims and all Canadians want answers,” he said. “I want answers.” If it is determined that it was an Iranian missile, Mr. Trudeau will have to grapple with the question of whether the United States, Canada’s most important ally, played a role in provoking the events that ultimately resulted in the loss of Canadians’ lives. The plane crashed on Wednesday morning, only hours after Iran had launched a barrage of 22 missiles against two military bases housing American troops in Iraq. The Iranian attack was in retaliation for the United States killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, one of the most powerful figures in Iran’s leadership.  In a sign of the tricky diplomatic challenges that could lie ahead, reporters at a news conference in Ottawa on Thursday repeatedly grilled Mr. Trudeau as to whether the United States was partly responsible for what happened, by creating a volatile situation.  “I think that’s one of the many questions that people will be thinking about and trying to find answers to,” Mr. Trudeau said.  Richard Johnston, a professor in the department of political science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said the circumstances of the plane crash would complicate Canada’s relationship with the United States.  “Many Canadians are suspicious of President Trump and this is not going to help,” Professor Johnston said. “And it could help fan an already simmering backlash against the president.” Professor Johnston said he expected Mr. Trudeau to try to avoid antagonizing Mr. Trump, given the economic importance of Canada’s relationship with the United States. A crucial new trade agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico is awaiting approval in the Canadian Parliament and the United States Senate. As the circumstances surrounding the crash remained murky on Thursday, it appeared to be Iran, not the United States, that was coming under fire on social media for the deaths of so many Canadians. “I have no words. Disturbing that the Iranian government may have killed our friends and fellow Canadians,” Payman Parseyan, a leading member of Edmonton’s tight-knit Iranian immigrant community, wrote on Twitter. Canada suspended its training mission in Iraq and decided to move some soldiers from the country after the killing of General Suleimani. Wednesday’s crash was one of the worst losses of Canadian life in an aviation disaster since 1985, when a bomb exploded and killed 329 people aboard an Air India flight, most of them Canadians of Indian ancestry.  Among those Canadians who perished in the crash outside Tehran were a family of four, newlyweds, international students and children. Relations between Canada and the United States have been strained for many months. Mr. Trump called Mr. Trudeau “two-faced” after the prime minister was caught on video apparently gossiping about the American president with other world leaders at a NATO reception at Buckingham Palace last month.

Northern Ireland Breaks a Three-Year Political Stalemate,2020-01-10,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — After three years of political paralysis, Northern Ireland’s two main parties reached an agreement on Friday to restore the region’s power sharing government and revive its political institutions. The government in Northern Ireland is led by Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, which supports unification with the Republic of Ireland, and the Democratic Unionist Party, or D.U.P., which wants to maintain close ties to Britain. It collapsed in 2017 amid sectarian rifts over cultural and social issues. The power-sharing deal announced Friday followed nine months of negotiations. Although neither party was entirely satisfied, they both concluded that restoration of the coalition government would be better than facing yet another election. In last month’s general election, voters punished the two parties for the long political gridlock as a new centrist party and smaller nationalist parties siphoned some of their support.  “We now have the basis to restore power sharing, and we’re up for that,” Mary Lou McDonald, the president of Sinn Fein, said at a news conference on Friday.  “There’s no doubt there are serious challenges ahead: the impact of Brexit, austerity and other pressing issues. But the biggest and most significant challenge will be ensuring we have genuine power sharing built on equality, respect and integrity,” she said. Arlene Foster, the leader of the D.U.P., said that while the deal was not perfect, it offered the basis for a “fair and balanced way” forward. The legislature’s absence has created a leadership void that has strained public services, pushing the regional health service, in particular, to the brink of collapse. Although Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, locally elected ministers make decisions on health, social care and education policies. In their absence, civil servants have been forced to manage daily affairs, leaving broader matters neglected.  Britain’s exit from the European Union on Jan. 31 had added pressure on the parties to restore the government. The withdrawal agreement effectively draws a border down the Irish Sea, leaving the region more closely aligned in trade with the European Union than with the United Kingdom. This has enraged unionists, who support the preservation of the political union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. They have called the arrangement a great “betrayal” that undermines the Good Friday peace accord that ended the region’s dirty guerrilla war. The deadlock in Northern Ireland stemmed from the introduction of an Irish-language act that would have given Gaelic the same status as English, a measure that had the D.U.P. up in arms. The power-sharing agreement does not include the Irish-language act. But it does establish a “language commissioner” who will “celebrate and support all aspects of Northern Ireland’s rich cultural and linguistic heritage.” “I was impressed that a consensus of sorts was reached on cultural issues, but let’s see how well Stormont functions now,” said Daniel Keohane, an Irish political analyst, referring to the Northern Ireland legislature. “There are a lot of issues to be addressed, like health care and investment, and the impasse of the last few years shows how difficult local politics can be.” One of the main priorities under the new agreement will be to reform the region’s health service and settle an ongoing pay dispute with thousands of nurses, who have demanded pay parity with the rest of Britain. It also calls for a mental health action plan to confront the region’s suicide rate. The business community breathed a collective sigh of relief when details of the agreement emerged on Friday. With Brexit approaching, “the need for a strong voice from Northern Ireland has never been more important,” said Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry. “After three years of underinvestment and political stalemate,” she added, ”this bold and ambitious deal is what Northern Ireland needs to get back onto its feet.” ']",The pressure of an impending Brexit pushed the warring parties into a deal that restores the power sharing government. But can they work together effectively? 
A Distant Missile Strike Spreads Grief Across Canada,2020-01-11,By Ian Austen,"['Like most Canadians, when I saw the first bulletins about a jetliner going down near Tehran’s airport, I had no inkling that the tragedy would reach Canada in a significant way. But it has been hard felt, particularly in Edmonton, from where I’m writing this week’s Canada Letter. The city, its comparatively small Iranian community and the University of Alberta are bearing an extraordinary share of the grieving. At least 27 people from Edmonton, and at least 10 of them connected to the university, died after Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was apparently struck by an Iranian missile in what is believed to have been an accident. A total of 57 Canadians were among the 176 passengers and crew who perished. (The figure was revised Friday evening from 63.) [Read: Iranian Missile Accidentally Brought Down Ukrainian Jet, Officials Say, Citing Early Evidence] That grim count may even understate how Canada has been affected.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this week that a flight to Toronto that was supposed to connect with the ill-fated airliner in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was short 138 passengers. [Read: Iran Plane Crash Victims Came From at Least Seven Countries] If the assessment of Canada and other nations is correct, Flight 752 will join a grim list of civilian airliners shot down, deliberately or unintentionally.  [Read: Civilian Planes Shot Down: A Grim History] Mr. Trudeau is demanding that Canada be part of the investigation to ensure that its findings are honest. As I write this, Iran has rejected that it’s to blame. The history of relations between Canada and Iran could also complicate matters.  Canada and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 2012. John Baird, then the foreign minister in the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, cited several reasons for the rupture. They include an attack by a mob on the British embassy in Tehran the previous year, Iran’s support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, its noncompliance with United Nations resolutions on its nuclear program and the country’s human rights record. Mr. Baird also said Iran “routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide.” When Canada pulled out of Iran in 2012, it didn’t have an ambassador to send home from Tehran because Iran had expelled Canada’s representative in 2007. While no reason was given, it was widely believed to be linked to Canada’s strong protests against the killing of Zahra Kazemi, a photojournalist, in an Iranian prison in 2003. Ms. Kazemi was a citizen of both Canada and Iran. This was not the first break in relations. Most famously, Canada shut its mission in Tehran in 1980, after Kenneth D. Taylor, the Canadian ambassador, helped shelter six Americans who fled the United States embassy after it was overrun by Iranian militants the previous year. Along with John Sheardown, the chief immigration officer, who also sheltered some of the Americans, Mr. Taylor issued Canadian passports to the Americans and safely slipped then out of Iran by saying they were a film crew from Canada. Mr. Trudeau took office in 2015 promising to renew relations with Iran. While the relationship thawed somewhat, it never reached the stage of reopening embassies in the two capitals. That step seems even further off now. And as my colleague Dan Bilefsky wrote, this week’s tragedy may also challenge relations between Canada and the United States. [Read: Evidence That Plane Was Shot Down in Iran May Upset U.S.-Canada Relations] While Mr. Trudeau did not blame President Trump for the downing of the Ukrainian airliner, some Canadians and some of Mr. Trump’s political opponents in Washington are arguing that he may bear some responsibility for creating a volatile situation. My report about Edmonton won’t be published in time for this edition of the newsletter. But I’ve found that, at least for now, Alberta’s capital is more focused on getting through its grief than assigning blame.

Plane Crash Leaves Iranian Diaspora in Canada Grief-Stricken,2020-01-11,By Ian Austen,"['EDMONTON, Alberta — The fume hoods in the lab set up by Saba Saadat were silent on Friday, its computers and microscopes switched off. Sobs occasionally punctuated the silence. Prof. Meghan Riddell, the leader of the cell biology lab, comforted a weeping student while two teary-eyed technicians stood by. Ms. Saadat, a biology student, had been one of the most promising students at the University of Alberta.  “She was a Ph.D. disguised as an undergraduate,” said Professor Riddell, herself in tears. “That girl could think.” Ms. Saadat was among the 176 people who died when a flight leaving the Iranian capital, Tehran, bound for Ukraine crashed on Wednesday. Also killed were her sister, a recent graduate in psychology who was heading to graduate school, and their mother, an obstetrician and gynecologist. In all, 57 Canadians died and a number of other victims appear to have been Iranian students studying in Canada.  Although the crash has spread grief throughout the Iranian diaspora in Canada, the tragedy has disproportionately struck the city of Edmonton, capital of the oil-rich province of Alberta. About 27 residents of Edmonton were on board the airliner, and at least 10 of them were, like Ms. Saadat, students or faculty at the University of Alberta. The anguish has only been deepened by evidence that it was an Iranian missile that brought down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. Reminders of the losses were everywhere as the university’s sports center was readied for a public memorial service on Sunday. Flowers, chocolates, photographs and candles were set outside the offices of the faculty members who perished, in departments where students studied and on the steps of Alberta’s sandstone legislature.  Flags have been lowered throughout the city of just under one million people. A railway bridge spanning a deep river valley that defines Edmonton geographically has been lit with red and white lights — the colors of the Canadian flag — in memorial. In this multicultural nation, Iranians are comparative newcomers: Most arrived after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Today, by some counts, Canada has the third-largest number of expatriate Iranians in the world and its universities are a top destination for Iranian graduate students. Iranian-Canadians are an accomplished group academically and professionally. In Edmonton, as across Canada, they include physicians, dentists, engineers and academics. “It’s a gift to Canada, and you know what, it’s the regime’s loss in Iran,” said Payman Parseyan, the past president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, speaking of the contributions the immigrants have made to Canada. “They’ve suppressed the people, the people are upset with the government and so they leave. The best minds learn to get out.” Mr. Parseyan, a 30-year-old former municipal police officer who now inspects oil and gas line construction, refers to himself as Persian rather than Iranian to distance himself from the government in power in his homeland.  His parents, both geologists, brought Mr. Parseyan to Canada when he was 8, along with his two siblings. After briefly staying with distant relatives in Toronto, they took a four-day train trip to Edmonton, a city about which they knew nothing. He acknowledged that for most Iranians looking to leave, Canada is a second choice after the United States as the preferred destination. The frigid weather, particularly in Edmonton, can be a deterrent.  Perhaps in reaction to the theocracy that rules Iran, Mr. Parseyan said that most Iranians in Edmonton are secular. The heritage society, a volunteer group, generally brings them together around Iranian holidays as well as for Edmonton’s annual ethnic festival, a major event in a city of many nationalities.  In a suburban shopping center featuring food from Japan, Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Korea, Mahnuash Jannesar, the co-owner of the Persia Palace, a combined grocery and restaurant, said that as photos of the victims began appearing in the news media, she recognized about half of them as customers.  While she hadn’t been aware of the names of many of them before their deaths, she did know Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, two regular customers who were professors of engineering and who died in the crash with their two children. It was the loss of the students who came to her shop that most grieved Ms. Jannesar, she said.  “They came to Canada for a future; there is no future in Iran,” she said. “It’s so sad.” At the silenced university lab, Professor Riddell said that Ms. Saadat was so knowledgeable and capable that she relied on her to supervise the work of graduate students who were passing through. Their last exchanges by email were mainly over Ms. Saadat’s application for medical school. Now, Professor Riddell is turning her attention to presenting a paper Ms. Saadat had planned to deliver to an academic conference next month. “The data stays forever, and the data leads to the next project,” Professor Riddell said.  Reza Akbari, the current president of the heritage society, paused as he considered how some of the victims were like himself 15 years ago: teenagers or people in their early 20s leaving Iran to study in Canada and begin a new life. His voice rose with anger when he recalled seeing the first passenger lists and finding the names of friends on it. Crying for what he said was the first time since the news of the plane’s destruction, he contrasted Iran’s lack of any statement of sympathy for the victims with the national outpouring of consolation from Canadians. “There hasn’t been a single condolence sent or acknowledgment, a single message from any government officials of Iran. It’s like: come on, guys. These are people,” said Mr. Akbari, who is a sales representative for Diageo, the spirits and beer conglomerate.  “After this incident happened,” he added, “the amount of support we’ve seen from Canada versus our motherland is something collectively as Canadians we can be proud of. As an Iranian, I’m sad.”']","Of the 176 victims, 57 Canadians died on the flight that crashed on its way from Tehran to Ukraine.

Bomb Blast Claimed by ISIS Kills at Least 15 in Pakistan Mosque Used by Taliban,2020-01-10,By Salman Masood and Zia ur-Rehman,"['LAHORE, Pakistan — A bomb blast inside a mosque in southwestern Pakistan, believed to be frequented by senior Taliban figures, killed at least 15 people on Friday and wounded at least 18 more, according to police officials.  Several of the wounded were in critical condition, and hospital authorities feared the death toll could climb further. The blast tore through a mosque during evening prayers in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan Province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to the SITE intelligence group. A local leader of a religious political party in Pakistan, who is familiar with Taliban networks in the country and spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear for his safety, said that the mosque was sometimes used by a Taliban leader, Mawlawi Abdul Hakeem, but he was not present at the time of the attack. The Taliban and the Islamic State have battled each other for control of territory in Afghanistan, and Afghan Taliban leaders have long used sanctuaries across the border in Pakistan. But Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, said that no Taliban leader was present and no meeting was taking place at the mosque when it was struck with the bombing.  The head cleric of the mosque and a police officer were among those killed. Paramilitary troops reached the mosque soon after the bombing and cordoned off the area for further investigations.  Pakistani civil and military leaders condemned the bombing, calling it an act of terrorism. “Those who targeted innocents in a mosque can never be true Muslim,” said Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Pakistan army chief, as quoted by a military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor. Quetta has a history of sectarian and militant-related violence. Sunni militant groups there have in the past targeted the country’s minority Shiite Muslims. And a secessionist group, the Baluchistan Liberation Army, has waged a low-level insurgency for years. The secessionists are demanding more autonomy and a greater share in the region’s natural resources, such as gas and oil. On August 16, 2019, a bomb exploded near Quetta at a mosque frequented by the Taliban’s supreme leader, Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada. He was not in the mosque during the explosion but one of his brothers was killed.  Salman Masood reported from Lahore, Pakistan, and Zia ur-Rehman from Karachi, Pakistan.']","The bomb, which tore through Friday evening prayers at a mosque in Quetta, Pakistan, also injured at least 18 more, with many in critical condition.

A Distant Missile Strike Spreads Grief Across Canada,2020-01-11,By Ian Austen,"['Like most Canadians, when I saw the first bulletins about a jetliner going down near Tehran’s airport, I had no inkling that the tragedy would reach Canada in a significant way. But it has been hard felt, particularly in Edmonton, from where I’m writing this week’s Canada Letter. The city, its comparatively small Iranian community and the University of Alberta are bearing an extraordinary share of the grieving. At least 27 people from Edmonton, and at least 10 of them connected to the university, died after Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was apparently struck by an Iranian missile in what is believed to have been an accident. A total of 57 Canadians were among the 176 passengers and crew who perished. (The figure was revised Friday evening from 63.) [Read: Iranian Missile Accidentally Brought Down Ukrainian Jet, Officials Say, Citing Early Evidence] That grim count may even understate how Canada has been affected. Many Iranians who do not hold Canadian citizenship study in the country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this week that a flight to Toronto that was supposed to connect with the ill-fated airliner in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was short 138 passengers. [Read: Iran Plane Crash Victims Came From at Least Seven Countries] If the assessment of Canada and other nations is correct, Flight 752 will join a grim list of civilian airliners shot down, deliberately or unintentionally.  [Read: Civilian Planes Shot Down: A Grim History] Mr. Trudeau is demanding that Canada be part of the investigation to ensure that its findings are honest. As I write this, Iran has rejected that it’s to blame. The history of relations between Canada and Iran could also complicate matters.  Canada and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 2012. John Baird, then the foreign minister in the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, cited several reasons for the rupture. They include an attack by a mob on the British embassy in Tehran the previous year, Iran’s support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, its noncompliance with United Nations resolutions on its nuclear program and the country’s human rights record. Mr. Baird also said Iran “routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide.” When Canada pulled out of Iran in 2012, it didn’t have an ambassador to send home from Tehran because Iran had expelled Canada’s representative in 2007. While no reason was given, it was widely believed to be linked to Canada’s strong protests against the killing of Zahra Kazemi, a photojournalist, in an Iranian prison in 2003. Ms. Kazemi was a citizen of both Canada and Iran. This was not the first break in relations. Most famously, Canada shut its mission in Tehran in 1980, after Kenneth D. Taylor, the Canadian ambassador, helped shelter six Americans who fled the United States embassy after it was overrun by Iranian militants the previous year. Along with John Sheardown, the chief immigration officer, who also sheltered some of the Americans, Mr. Taylor issued Canadian passports to the Americans and safely slipped then out of Iran by saying they were a film crew from Canada. Mr. Trudeau took office in 2015 promising to renew relations with Iran. While the relationship thawed somewhat, it never reached the stage of reopening embassies in the two capitals. That step seems even further off now. And as my colleague Dan Bilefsky wrote, this week’s tragedy may also challenge relations between Canada and the United States. [Read: Evidence That Plane Was Shot Down in Iran May Upset U.S.-Canada Relations] While Mr. Trudeau did not blame President Trump for the downing of the Ukrainian airliner, some Canadians and some of Mr. Trump’s political opponents in Washington are arguing that he may bear some responsibility for creating a volatile situation. My report about Edmonton won’t be published in time for this edition of the newsletter. But I’ve found that, at least for now, Alberta’s capital is more focused on getting through its grief than assigning blame. Amber Bracken, a photojournalist based in Edmonton, went to far northern Quebec to tell the story of a program that has returned control of childbirth to its Inuit communities while improving the health outcomes for newborns.  No one contests that Zhao Li fatally shot his business partner at a Vancouver mansion and then chopped up his remains into 108 pieces. But the verdict at his murder trial this week was something of a surprise, Dan Bilefsky reports.  Eugene Levy on the end of “Schitt’s Creek”: “Isn’t that the perfect way to go? We’re on an upward trajectory, and we will be still on an upward trajectory when this series actually wraps.”  Dozens of Iranian Canadians say they’ve been detained recently while trying to cross the border.  Judge John Hodgman of The New York Times Magazine has rendered his verdict on how Montrealers eat pizza and the city’s bagels. Readers in Australia have shared some harrowing tales of their experiences during the current wildfires. Here’s some advice on how to stop putting things off in 2020, from a professor at the University of Calgary, among others.

Could ‘Megxit’ Be a Royal Fairy Tale for Canada?,2020-01-11,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Some have suggested they could become king and queen of Canada. Tim Hortons, the quintessentially Canadian coffee chain, offered them “free coffee for life.” Others recommended Ottawa, the nation’s sleepy capital, as a possible home, noting that, if they squinted hard enough, they could pretend the Parliament buildings were palaces. Prince Harry and his wife, the former Meghan Markle, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, electrified the world this week with their announcement that they planned to step back from official royal duties and live part-time in North America.  But even before they have revealed which country they would like to make home, many Canadians were already giddy at the prospect they could be moving to Canada — part of the loose federation of nations known as the British Commonwealth — and injecting some glamour into the sprawling, bone-chillingly cold country. It is “the fairy tale ending we all deserve,” Anne T. Donahue, a Toronto-based writer, gushed in The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper. She called their decision “a power move” for the royal couple to “stop putting up with the nonsense” and take ownership of their own lives. “So Harry and Meghan might be moving to Canada. Let’s be honest, wouldn’t you?” added the conservative-leaning National Post. Canadians are excited at this opportunity to live up to their “national reputation as polite host,” it wrote, extolling the potential economic benefits for Toronto if they decide to live there. But Tim Hortons may have best captured the national mood with its appeal to the couple. “No pressure, Meghan and Harry,” it wrote on Twitter. “But if you do choose to move to Canada, free coffee for life. Think about it.” Rumors that Canada, which features Prince Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, on its coinage and its $20 bills, was their preferred refuge from Britain were stoked this week after the couple’s statement announcing their plans conspicuously mentioned “North America” rather than the United States. Also, a Toronto-based digital firm designed their website explaining their plans.  And after the announcement, the duchess returned to Canada, according to the BBC, where she had reportedly left their 8-month old baby, Archie, after spending Christmas and New Year’s Day in British Columbia.  [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] During their recent six-week vacation, the couple enchanted local residents on Vancouver Island by interrupting a hike to gallantly help a couple trying to take a selfie, according to local news reports. They were also turned away by an upmarket seafood restaurant serving caviar and steamed clams amid security concerns. Even without Canada’s historical connection to its former colonial ruler, the duchess, an American, has close ties to the country and many Canadian friends. For seven years, during her previous career as an actress, she lived in Toronto while filming the popular legal drama “Suits.”  The Canadian media’s relative lack of intrusiveness could also offer a welcome reprieve from the voracious British tabloid press, which has dubbed the entire endeavor “Megxit.” Perhaps mindful of the couple’s potential to burnish Canada’s brand, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — himself a member of political royalty as the son of a former prime minister — welcomed them on Twitter in December around their vacation period.  “Prince Harry, Meghan, and Archie, we’re all wishing you a quiet and blessed stay in Canada,” he wrote. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here.” Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the British monarchy at Carleton University in Ottawa, suggested that this sometimes self-deprecating country was greeting a potential royal migration as a “vindication of the Canadian way of life.”  Such is the enthusiasm for the couple in Canada that a poll released this week showed that 60 percent of Canadians supported appointing Prince Harry as governor general, the crown’s representative in Canada’s system of constitutional monarchy. “It’s a big source of national pride that the royal couple would want to be here,” Mr. Lagassé said. “It makes Canadians feel better about themselves.”  He even floated a view that, hypothetically, the federal Parliament could make Harry and Meghan king and queen of Canada — relying on recent rulings in Canadian courts on the issue of royal succession, and various loopholes in Canadian law. But he stressed that a majority of Canadians would be unlikely to support that, given the reticence, he said, about revisiting constitutional debates that risk dividing the country.  In any case, he added, support for the monarchy generally remained lukewarm at best in a country where many viewed constitutional ties to the crown as a historical relic rather a necessity. Nevertheless, pundits and citizens alike have been quick to offer advice on everything from how the couple should dress for braving the Canadian winter to where they should live. One frequent tip: Prince Harry could find favor by taking up hockey. “They’d do well to ditch the crowns, scepters and garlands of invaluable gems and jewels, and dress the part of your average Canuck,” the self-described anti-monarchist Canadian John Semley wrote in Britain’s Guardian newspaper. “I’m talking red-and-black flannel shirts.” Other than Toronto, popular suggestions for potential royal abodes include Vancouver, where rainy weather and picturesque natural landscapes could remind the couple of England. But others warned they should avoid Montreal, given that monarchists were rare in Quebec, a proud majority French province that was ceded in 1763 after Britain vanquished France in the Seven Years’ War. The queen has also avoided visiting Quebec City since 1964, when protesters showed her their backs. Not everyone is thrilled by the prospect of the couple moving to Canada. \u200bPublic attitudes toward the royals could become frosty quickly if Canadians had to pay for the hefty cost of their security, Mr. Lagassé said. Moreover, while the pair say they want to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada.  Even though Prince Harry’s grandmother is the personification of the Canadian state, he said, that does not confer legal rights for her progeny in Canada. It is perhaps a sign of possible things to come that Tim Hortons’s offer of free coffee to the couple also spurred a backlash on social media, after a union said workers in Winnipeg had been locked out by the company after their demand for a salary increase. The royal couple “can afford to buy the company,” one woman wrote on Twitter. “Your employees can’t afford rent.” For all the royal hoopla, Canadians could be rejoicing prematurely if the couple decides to go to the United States to be closer to the duchess’s family.  After all, Prince Harry may heed the words of his grandfather Prince Philip, who had this to say about Canada during a trip there in 1976: “We don’t come here for our health. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves.”']","The possibility that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, might settle in Canada has unleashed a frenzy of excitement and offers of free coffee — but also some dissent."

U.K. Lawmakers Give Brexit Bill the Green Light,2020-01-09,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — After more than a year of drama, recrimination and tense, late-night votes, British lawmakers signed off on Thursday, with minimal fuss and no fanfare, on legislation to take their country out of the European Union at the end of the month. The vote in the House of Commons is not quite the final parliamentary moment of Britain’s extraordinary Brexit story — the bill will be considered next by the unelected second chamber, the House of Lords — but the suspense that surrounded many previous votes was entirely absent. [Read: Battered at the polls, pro-Europe Britons gird for the next fight.] Even if the Lords amend the bill, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party now have a large majority in the Commons and could overturn any changes — swiftly, if necessary. The legislation is almost certain to be completed and written into law next week. Only a few dozen members of Parliament attended the opening statements of the debate on Thursday — in contrast to the packed chamber for previous discussions on Brexit — but by the time the debate drew to a close hours later, most of the lawmakers had trickled into the room. They approved the bill on a vote of 330 to 231, drawing a long-awaited line under the heated debate over a Brexit plan that convulsed British politics and divided the nation. Once the exit plan has also been approved by the European Parliament, the stage will be set for Britain to reverse more than four decades of integration with its continental neighbors, a journey that began when it entered what was then called the European Economic Community in January 1973. What comes next remains far from clear — the deal set to go into effect on Jan. 31 establishes a transition period, and the two sides are preparing for negotiations on a long-term trade deal and on other future ties. Those talks are expected to revive many of the cross-Channel tensions in evidence since the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, convulsing the country’s politics. Since then two prime ministers have lost their jobs, as have many of the lawmakers whose impassioned dispute over Britain’s future brought the country to a state of political paralysis. That deadlock was broken by last month’s general election, won by Mr. Johnson with his pledge to “get Brexit done.” His critics point out that the painful job of untangling decades of European ties now merely moves to a second, more complicated, phase. But it is hard to overstate the change in the political mood from last year, when Parliament was in ferment and analysts were unable to predict when — or even whether — Brexit would take place. With the news dominated by Iran and the future of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, debates and votes on Brexit in Parliament this week have largely been ignored by a British media that once focused obsessively on parliamentary maneuvers.  Thanks to his large majority in Parliament, Mr. Johnson can easily pass all his legislation, and opposition lawmakers are powerless even to influence the coming negotiation on trade and other ties with the European Union.  Before the general election, lawmakers rejected Mr. Johnson’s timetable for scrutinizing the legislation as grossly insufficient. But on Tuesday the Brexit debate finished more than three hours ahead of its allotted time. On Thursday some of the old divisions resurfaced. “This is a great moment in our democracy,” said William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker and veteran critic of the European Union. “Now we will be able to govern ourselves.” The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said it was “time to get Brexit done,” using his Conservative party’s election slogan, and added, “this bill does so.”   By contrast Alistair Carmichael, a lawmaker with the pro-European Liberal Democrats, argued that the government’s Brexit plan “is going to leave us poorer and more isolated on the world stage.” But the tempo of the debate resembled a slowly deflating balloon, with the outcome of the vote a foregone conclusion. Big constitutional questions remain, and on Wednesday the Scottish Parliament refused to approve the government’s plan — a largely symbolic act that nonetheless illustrated the opposition to Brexit in Scotland, where there is growing pressure for another referendum on independence.  But Britain is now on course to leave the European Union 10 months after the first date — March 29, 2019 — on which it was scheduled to do so. The real effects will not be felt before January 2021, however, because Britain will be in the transition period until then, still under the European Union rulebook. On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the union’s executive arm, the European Commission, warned that this time frame was too short to complete a comprehensive trade deal, and that the cost of a clear break without an agreement in place would be new barriers to trade and a distant partnership. That warning was repeated on Thursday by Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, who said that Brussels would continue to prepare for a situation in which no deal is struck by the end of the year and tariffs and quotas are imposed. It would be impossible to agree on everything on the table this year, Mr. Barnier said, while adding that some issues would need to be decided. These include the politically sensitive question of fishing rights, and an agreement on the general tax, antitrust, social and environmental rules for manufacturers, known as “level playing field” provisions. European officials are determined to prevent Britain from gaining preferential access to continental European markets while undercutting them through lighter regulation. As for Britain’s objectives, those will be determined by Mr. Johnson’s government, and several lawmakers lamented the fact that they will have no influence over the British negotiating strategy. ']","A House of Commons, once bitterly split on how and whether to leave the European Union, agreed with little drama on withdrawal at the end of the month."
"In Iran, Rejoicing Over Retaliation, then Relief at No U.S. Counterstrike",2020-01-09,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iran had carefully orchestrated its retaliatory response for maximum symbolism and emotional impact: The attack began around 1:20 a.m. Wednesday, correlated to the time that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was killed by an American drone strike last week. The country launched more than 20 missiles, the barrage targeting two large military bases that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women. Iranians rejoiced at the retaliation, saying it showed defiance and courage. “It’s a proud day to be Iranian,” said Amir, 42, of Tehran, in a telephone interview. He, like others, asked to be identified by first name only out of concern of being quoted in a foreign newspaper. “Time for everyone to respect our power.”  Omid Balaghati, a writer based in Tehran, posted on Twitter: “Strong politicians need to have strong military men next to them, and this is the story today.” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first public speech on Wednesday, suggested that Wednesday’s attack was not the end. “For now we slapped the Americans last night,” he said. “America’s military presence in the region must end.” For days, momentum had built for Iran to strike back. For the first time in many years, the public supported the leadership’s calls for a public confrontation with the United States.

"In Iran, Rejoicing Over Retaliation, then Relief at No U.S. Counterstrike",2020-01-09,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iran had carefully orchestrated its retaliatory response for maximum symbolism and emotional impact: The attack began around 1:20 a.m. Wednesday, correlated to the time that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was killed by an American drone strike last week. The country launched more than 20 missiles, the barrage targeting two large military bases that house thousands of Iraqi and American servicemen and women. Iranians rejoiced at the retaliation, saying it showed defiance and courage. “It’s a proud day to be Iranian,” said Amir, 42, of Tehran, in a telephone interview. He, like others, asked to be identified by first name only out of concern of being quoted in a foreign newspaper. “Time for everyone to respect our power.”  Omid Balaghati, a writer based in Tehran, posted on Twitter: “Strong politicians need to have strong military men next to them, and this is the story today.” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first public speech on Wednesday, suggested that Wednesday’s attack was not the end. “For now we slapped the Americans last night,” he said. “America’s military presence in the region must end.” For days, momentum had built for Iran to strike back. For the first time in many years, the public supported the leadership’s calls for a public confrontation with the United States. Still, in the hours after the attack, Iranians spent a restless night wondering whether Washington would strike back. President Trump said no Americans were killed in the attack, but some Iranians did not believe him.

"Its Missiles Did Little Damage, but Iran Has More Potent Weapons",2020-01-09,By David D. Kirkpatrick and Ronen Bergman,"['American military and intelligence officials were stunned at the precision, scale and sheer boldness of what they later concluded was an Iranian attack. Four months ago, a swarm of low-flying armed drones and cruise missiles struck oil tanks in the central hub of the Saudi petroleum industry, catching Washington by surprise and temporarily knocking out 5 percent of the world’s oil supply. Almost no country in the region — Israel may be the exception — could have defended against it. The Iranian attack on American military posts in Iraq early Wednesday — the only direct attack on the United States or its allies claimed by Iran since the seizure of the American Embassy in 1979 — relied on ballistic missiles and inflicted little damage.  But with tensions between the United States and Iran at the highest level in four decades, the unexpected success of the September strike on the Saudi oil facilities is a stark reminder that Tehran has an array of stealthier weapons in its arsenal that could pose far greater threats if the hostilities escalate. Iran has denied responsibility for the Saudi attack. But American officials have concluded Iran was behind it, by sending the drones and missiles from Iran or southern Iraq. Iran’s conventional military has deteriorated severely during the country’s relative isolation since the Islamic revolution of 1979. But Tehran has spent those decades cultivating less conventional capabilities that are now among the most potent in the world and which are ideally suited for carrying out asymmetrical warfare against a superpower like the United States. Iran commands one of the region’s largest arsenals of ballistic and cruise missiles, a network of allied militant groups around the region with as many as 250,000 fighters, and teams of computer hackers that American officials rank among the most dangerous.  It has also developed sophisticated armed and surveillance drones. And lacking a strong conventional navy, it has sought other ways to choke off the flow of Persian Gulf oil, with a fleet of small speedboats and a stockpile of underwater mines. “Their offensive capability is drastically greater than the defensive capability that is arrayed against them,” said Jack Watling, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a London security research center. “Their ability to inflict significant damage makes the cost of war with Iran quite severe.” The ineffectual attack on Wednesday demonstrated the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles — some traveling more than 600 miles — but also their poor accuracy, with several landing well outside their presumed targets. Some analysts suggested that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may have intentionally ordered a symbolic but relatively harmless attack to show Iranian citizens a forceful response without provoking an all-out war with Washington.  “Khamenei has to calibrate the response so that it is enough for Iran not to lose face but not so much that Iran loses its head,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a scholar of Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But Tehran and its allies may still be plotting less overt forms of revenge for the American killing last week of the Iranian military commander Qassim Suleimani. Many analysts contend that Iran and its militant allies are reverting to their pattern of covert or indirect attacks that leave no clear evidence of Iranian responsibility. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, who also lost one of their leaders in the drone strike that killed General Suleimani, said Wednesday that they would seek their own revenge. Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah, has said that it would do so as well. Iran has also shown a longstanding interest in assassinations, a tactic that could match the vows of Iranian officials to take “proportionate” measures to avenge General Suleimani. Several Iran experts said that killing an American official, presumably in the region, might be the eye-for-an-eye that Tehran is seeking. “I certainly would not be going out to many public places, because the risk of getting whacked or kidnapped is very high,” said Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador in Saudi Arabia. But Iran has a dismal success rate in assassinating foreign officials.  Iran has tried and failed to kill Israeli diplomats in Thailand, Georgia and India, and to bomb a rally near Paris where Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, was speaking. In 2011, American law enforcement agents broke up a particularly brazen and inept Iranian plot to hire thugs from a Mexican drug cartel for $1.5 million to blow up an Italian restaurant in Washington in order to kill a Saudi diplomat. “We almost couldn’t believe it,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Pentagon official who oversaw its Iran task forces at the time. “Everybody looking at the intelligence thought it was just crazy noise, until a first payment of $150,000 showed up in a bank account.” The September attack against Saudi Arabia presented a frightening alternative, in part because it exposed a vulnerable spot in most missile-defense systems. Most are built to defend against ballistic rockets, and almost none are equipped to detect and stop a large number of low-flying, high-speed drones and cruise missiles. Officials said that the attack demonstrated that Iran’s technology was more advanced than American intelligence agencies had expected.  “The attack on oil fields in Saudi was stunning in the depth of its audaciousness,” Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the Pentagon’s Central Command, said in a recent interview. Tal Inbar, former director of the space research center at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies, a now-closed Israeli research organization, said the precision of the attack could not have been achieved using only a GPS system. “Much better capabilities were deployed in this attack,” he said, “possibly a camera on the missile and the drones, which compares reality with a target image.” Unlike more advanced American or Chinese drones, Iranian drones cannot fire missiles from the air. But they can be loaded with explosives, as they were thought to be in the Saudi attack, to become remote-guided missiles.  Iran’s longest-range cruise missiles can strike more than 1,500 miles from Iran’s borders, reaching almost anywhere in the Persian Gulf. China, Russia and North Korea have provided Iran with technology and munitions, and Iran has produced remote-controlled drones domestically. Until recently, though, Iran has preferred to rely on its network of militant allies around the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, an array of Iraqi militias now organized as the Popular Mobilization Forces, the Houthis in Yemen, and other groups across the region. Some, like Hezbollah or the Iraqi forces, are now so large, well-equipped and institutionalized that they more closely resemble professional militaries than informal militias.  “That is what extends Iran’s power far beyond its borders,” said Afshon Ostovar, a scholar of the Iranian military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.  The Trump administration’s sweeping economic sanctions on Iran over the past year have damaged its economy and reduced its ability to fund its militant allies. But a report this week from the Center for Strategic and International Affairs concluded that the total number of fighters in the full network of Iranian-backed militias has continued to grow steadily, to an estimated range of nearly 150,000 to more than 250,000. And despite the efforts of the United States and Israel, Iran has continued to smuggle missiles of various ranges and abilities to its proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, according to Israeli and American defense officials.  The latest cycle of attacks between the United States and Iran started with a rocket attack that killed an American contractor in Iraq. The United States retaliated with a strike on an Iranian-backed militia, beginning a cycle of escalation.  But far from ending such rocket attacks, some of the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have said that even without Iranian encouragement they now intended to step up their attacks on American forces in order to drive them out of the country. “I think we are settling in for what is going to be a bumpy period of conflict,” Mr. Ostovar said.  Cyberattacks — a weapon that can cause severe damage halfway around the world with low costs and few fingerprints — may be Iran’s wild card. Cybersecurity experts and government officials have already spotted an increase in malicious activity by pro-Iranian hackers and social media users that they believe could foreshadow more serious computer attacks from Tehran. American officials and independent cybersecurity experts say that Iranian malware attacks on Saudi Arabia have been among the most damaging of such assaults in history, causing at least tens of millions of dollars in damages.  A 2012 attack that American officials attributed to Iran overwrote the hard drives of the Saudi state oil company Aramco with the image of a burning American flag. A second attack in 2016 and 2017 destroyed files of the Saudi central bank, certain government ministries and several private companies. That time, a famous photograph of a drowned Syrian refugee child appeared on computer screens. The former director national of intelligence Dan Coats ranked Iran as one of the four most dangerous sources of cyberthreats last year, along with Russia, China and North Korea. “It is capable of causing localized, temporary disruptive effects — such as disrupting a large company’s corporate networks for days to weeks — similar to its data deletion attacks against dozens of Saudi governmental and private-sector networks,” he said. One apparently low-level Iranian attack has already sought to avenge General Suleimani. Iranian hackers temporarily captured the website of the United States’ government’s Federal Depository Library Program and replaced its contents with a eulogy for the general. “Hacked by Iran Cyber Security Group Hackers,” text on the website read. “This is only small part of Iran’s cyber ability!” Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

"Behind Campus Attack in India, Some See a Far-Right Agenda",2020-01-10,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — For decades, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party and its affiliates have struggled to control one of India’s most fertile ideological recruiting grounds: university campuses. That project erupted in violence last weekend, as masked men and women stormed the New Delhi campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, one of India’s premier liberal institutions.  Witnesses said police officers stood by as students were attacked with rods and bricks. Some assailants shouted slogans associated with Mr. Modi’s governing party and its parent organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or R.S.S., which for decades has aspired to turn India into a Hindu nation. “They pelted stones at us, stones half the size of bricks,” said Sucharita Sen, a geography professor, who was struck in the head and needed stitches. She was bleeding profusely, she said, adding: “I saw the face of terror.” Mr. Modi’s government initially condemned the violence. But some ministers, along with others in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, tried to justify it. “For too long, Leftists have been treated with kid gloves,” the party’s branch in the state of Karnataka said on Twitter. “No wonder this ‘good for nothing breed’ has grown like a Weed.” As protests continue across India against Mr. Modi’s contentious citizenship law, universities have become targets, with far-right groups accused of attacking places seen as hot spots for “antinational” activism. Some analysts saw the well-orchestrated attack on Sunday as something more: a watershed in the ascendant Hindu nationalist movement’s fight for control over the influential university, and over Indian higher education more broadly. “For the Modi government, J.N.U. has been a symbol of the territory they haven’t been able to capture,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an author who has studied the R.S.S. for years. “They are projecting it as a symbol of everything that is bad in this country, and that is why they need to destroy it.” Mr. Mukhopadhyay said the attack was a precursor to shutting down the university and “trying to reshape it.”  The university is named for Jawaharlal Nehru, one of India’s founding fathers, who resisted the idea of establishing a religious state. Over the years, the campus cultivated a reputation for supporting resistance movements led by minorities and questioning revisionist histories of India pushed by far-right Hindus. Since Mr. Modi became prime minister in 2014, the Hindu right’s battle for influence over young minds has intensified. Observers say that by 2016, Jawaharlal Nehru University had become a much more frequent topic of debate among high-ranking officials in the governing party, who questioned the morality of the students and their education.  Students and faculty at the university said freedoms there had eroded since the election of Mr. Modi, whose government has appointed R.S.S.-affiliated administrators to the university. In the hours after Sunday’s attack, staunch supporters of Mr. Modi’s party called for the university to be closed. While leftist ideas have long prevailed at the university and many of India’s other leading campuses, the R.S.S. has worked to inculcate its far-right ideology at a much younger age. It runs its own network of schools, and encourages children to join programs for physical training interspersed with Hindu religious rituals.  At the university level, the R.S.S. oversees the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, one of India’s oldest and largest student unions. That group at first denied involvement in the Sunday attack, blaming it on “commie goons.” But Anima Sonkar, a secretary for the group, said in a television interview on Monday that two armed men seen in a video of the assault were members of the organization. She said they had carried weapons for “self-defense,” traveling in groups and carrying rods, and in one case, acid. Since protests began in India last month over the Citizenship Amendment Act passed by Parliament — which many see as blatantly discriminatory toward Muslims and a threat to the nation’s secular foundation — most eruptions of violence have been blamed on the police, who have been accused of torturing teenage demonstrators, lobbing tear gas canisters into a college library and killing protesters.  But the attack at Jawaharlal Nehru University, where a number of rallies against the law have been held, suggested that extremist outfits had started mobilizing against protesters, with the complicity of the authorities. Students interviewed on campus immediately after the attack said the police did nothing as the mob assaulted people and chanted politically charged slogans, including “Hail Lord Ram,” a reference to a Hindu deity. That phrase has become a battle cry for Hindu nationalists. No arrests have been made in the mob attack, though a criminal complaint has been filed against “unknown persons.” In an interview, Shalini Singh, a police official leading a fact-finding team, said, “What the students have told me is confidential,” declining to comment further. The police have said that they quickly stopped the attack, though students said it went on for well over an hour. At a rally last month, Pinky Chaudhary, president of the Hindu Raksha Dal, another far-right group, incited members to target students at the university. “The grave of J.N.U. will be dug on the soil of Hindustan,” members of his group shouted, using a Hindu nationalist name for India. In an interview, Mr. Chaudhary claimed responsibility for some of the violence on Sunday. He said his organization had sent around 250 activists to the campus — as reinforcements, he said — after the attack began, and that they threw bricks at students who they believed opposed the citizenship law. “The students of J.N.U. are communists and they had to be taught a lesson,” he said.  The police said the group was being investigated.  Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a prominent public intellectual, said the Modi government was legitimizing force against people seen as disruptive to its nationalist project, including minorities, secularists and protesters. “There is no getting away from the fact that hunting down your own citizens as antinational is now part of the ideological construct of this government,” he wrote in a column for The Indian Express. “The state will, directly or through proxies, encourage violence against anyone who is not in tune with it.” The violence on Sunday was related, at least in part, to monthslong protests among student groups at the university over fee increases. Members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the R.S.S., opposed those protests. Leftist campus groups pushed back, some say forcefully, by cutting off computer servers and blocking class registration. By last weekend, students said, the dispute had evolved beyond the fee issue. Fights broke out, buildings were vandalized, and people on both sides reported injuries. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad promised to retaliate on Sunday evening, according to students. Indian news outlets traced WhatsApp exchanges to the group, with one message calling on members to “thrash the antinationals.” On Sunday, a couple of hundred people assembled outside a dormitory for what they called a peace march and a discussion of the recent violence. Anoushka Barua, a graduate student, said dozens of people with their faces covered rushed out of a nearby hostel chanting “Hail Lord Ram.” Four other students said they heard the same slogan. Witnesses said the mob threw rocks, hitting Professor Sen and others. Ms. Barua said students and faculty were “running for their lives” as the attackers chased people into dormitories. In one hostel, they shattered windows and sprayed a cough-inducing irritant as a security guard watched, according to students who were there and a video of the attack. Bharat Sharma, a student studying German, said he was hanging out with friends at a hostel when he heard people shouting, “You communists, come out!” For 15 minutes, he said, the attackers tried to break down his door; he speculated that it was because he had hung a poster of Bob Marley outside. They broke a window, he said, allowing them to peer into the room. “We said, ‘We are common students, neither leftists nor rightists,’ ” Mr. Sharma recalled telling them. He said the attackers left after one of them recognized his friend and said, “They are not commies. They are not it. Leave them.” After an hour or so, the mob dispersed, witnesses said. Injured students were rushed to a trauma center. Hundreds of far-right activists stayed near the campus, threatening journalists, vandalizing an ambulance and yelling, “The traitors of the country, shoot the rascals!” Surya Prakash, a blind student who was among those beaten in their dormitory rooms, said the experience had shaken him to the core. “I feel a phobia now, of people coming to kill me when I hear the door bang,” he said. “We were simply studying.” Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.']","Hindu nationalists view Jawaharlal Nehru University, where a mob rampaged last weekend, as “a symbol of everything that is bad in this country,” one analyst said.

"Defying the Rabbis, Tel Aviv Rolls Out Sabbath Bus Service",2020-01-10,By David M. Halbfinger,"['TEL AVIV — The ritual Friday-night scramble for a parking space was well underway, but for once, Rob and Netta Geist Pinfold watched it unfold with a smile.  It was late on the Sabbath eve in central Tel Aviv, and swarms of residents who had driven to dinner were cruising for the most precious real estate in the cram-packed capital of secular Israel: a legal spot on the street. The Geist Pinfolds had let their car gather dust for the night. They’d ridden to Ramat Aviv and back in a minibus. And it hadn’t cost them a shekel. Nor were they alone. Some 10,000 Israelis have been riding for free on Friday nights and Saturdays since a new Sabbath-only transit network was rushed into service in November by Tel Aviv and three neighboring municipalities. What is revolutionary about the minibuses is not that they’re free, but that they’re running at all. For an otherwise modern metropolis, known for its start-ups and billion-dollar exits, its beaches and bustling night life, Tel Aviv has long been — literally — slowed down by the statutory shutdown of public transportation from before sundown on Friday until after sundown on Saturday. Religious Jews abstain from driving and from spending money on the Sabbath, and public transportation has been banned in most places since an agreement before Israel’s founding — known as the status quo — struck a balance between religious and secular interests.  In heavily religious West Jerusalem, where Sabbath observance is the rule, the pause in bus service inconveniences relatively few. Not so in Tel Aviv, where Friday nights bring crowds to the cafes and bars lining Rabin Square and Rothschild Boulevard, and the clubs and eateries of bohemian Florentin overflow into the wee hours with hipsters whose beards rival any Hasid’s. The weekly transit shutdown amounts to an annoying and costly speed bump on the way to the party. Those determined to go out, or to get to and from their jobs pouring drinks or waiting tables, have options — taxis, private shuttles or even the electric scooters that charge by the minute. But taxis charge extra on the Sabbath. Private shuttles, which are licensed by the state, run only on a few main arteries. And scooting while inebriated is ill-advised; one minibus passenger rolled up a sleeve to show his scar from a drunken mishap. “We waited for this so long,” said Sofia Rabinovich, 18, a student at Tel Aviv University who once depended on her boyfriend to drive her to see friends downtown or in Jaffa. The excitement about what amounts to a slapdash, stopgap transit system captures how Tel Aviv is at once Israel’s most modern city and also strangely backward.  [Read: Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul.] It is trying to become more worldly, to make itself more livable to residents and more inviting to visitors. Its skyline is rising, with a 91-story tower under construction. The trenches for a light-rail network have been dug, though it is likely to be inadequate the moment it opens. A rapid-transit subway system is at least on the drawing boards.  But the city that launched a thousand killer apps still has plenty of catching up to do with metropolises not known as nearly so innovative. The new bus service was spearheaded by Tel Aviv’s longtime mayor, 75-year-old Ron Huldai, an old-time Israeli socialist and hard-charging former fighter pilot and air force general. He said Zionism was meant to create “a center for the Jews, and not a center for the Jewish religion.” He wants his city to be a “model for democracy and pluralism.”  Mr. Huldai said he had wanted to expand Sabbath transit since taking office in 1998. “The first 10 years I didn’t have money to do it,” he said. “The second 10, the minister of transportation kept promising that he was going to do it. Finally, I lost my patience, and we did it.” A loophole made it legal. The Sabbath ban covers only public transportation for which riders pay a fare. Nothing prevented a city from using municipal funds to run buses where passengers rode free. The low cost made it feasible. Running 19-seat minibuses across the metro area from early Friday evening until 2 a.m. on Saturday, and then starting again at 9 a.m. on Saturday, required only $3.6 million a year, shared with the cities of Ramat Hasharon, Giv’atayim and Kiryat Ono.  Still, it wasn’t until September, after Israel’s second parliamentary election of the year resulted in another deadlock, that Mr. Huldai gave the project the go-ahead.  The stalemate, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultra-Orthodox allies remained unable to form a government, had created an opening. Nonreligious voters had risen up against the influence of the ultra-Orthodox, and ultra-Orthodox lawmakers were not looking for another fight, at least until they were assured of another term in power. “I’m secular,” Mr. Huldai said. “But sometimes, God is working for us.” In another twist, Tel Aviv’s lefties were using against the right-wing government in Jerusalem a strategy that Israel long ago perfected against the Palestinians. “It’s the old Zionist way — creating facts on the ground,” said Tomer Persico, a scholar who advocates religious freedom in Israel. There were objections, of course.  Bezalel Smotrich, the transportation minister, said he was “pained” by the bus service. Moshe Gafni, of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, called it a “disaster on a national scale.” Shopkeepers for whom Saturday is their only day off complained that their nonreligious customers — suddenly able to ride to open malls — would desert them. From the left, Mr. Persico worried that Tel Aviv’s gambit would set off a “secular arms race,” with cities that cater to affluent nonreligious Israelis accelerating the sorting of the country’s population by providing services like Sabbath buses that poorer and more religious areas would not have.  But the throngs of passengers making use of the minibuses in Tel Aviv on a recent Friday had little interest in such quibbles. As the vehicles kept rolling by, because there were no empty seats, the clusters of partyers, restaurant workers and young couples on date night who were willing to wait as much as an hour for a ride attested to a larger-than-expected, pent-up demand.  Ridership was just as robust the next morning, with passengers carrying portable grills, strollers or folding chairs for outings in the sunshine. “The paradox is, I like having it quiet on Shabbat,” said Linda Lovitch, an Elmira, N.Y., native who has lived in Israel for 36 years. She said she attends synagogue and lights candles, but resented being denied public transportation out of deference to the more religious. “Why shouldn’t I get to go to the beach or to Jaffa or anywhere else?” she said, returning from the gym. “If people want it, why shouldn’t they have it? That’s democracy.” For Vicky Purmishar, the minibuses arrived just in time.  Her 79-year-old mother was hospitalized with a degenerative brain disorder in November. It took her sight and left her unable to walk or eat without choking. The nurses couldn’t sit with her for a half-hour at every meal, so Ms. Purmishar, 48, an only child raising two sons, visited twice a day to help her mother eat. Ms. Purmishar does not drive, and said she could not afford cabs from Ramat Hasharon. Climbing into a minibus outside Ichilov Hospital on a Saturday afternoon, she said the free rides may well have saved her mother’s life. “It’s like God sent me a way to come here,” she said.

Iran Says It Unintentionally Shot Down Ukrainian Airliner,2020-01-11,By Farnaz Fassihi,"[""Iran’s military announced early Saturday that it had accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, blaming human error because of what it called the plane’s sharp, unexpected turn toward a sensitive military base. After days of tension since the jet crashed near Tehran on Wednesday, the same day that Iranian missiles struck American bases in Iraq, the admission was a stunning reversal. Iran initially maintained that mechanical issues had brought the Boeing airliner down, killing all 176 people aboard.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,” President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter soon after the military released its statement. He offered condolences to the victims’ families and said investigations were underway. The military said the person responsible would face legal consequences.  International pressure had been building on Iran to take responsibility. American and allied intelligence assessments had already concluded that Iranian missiles brought down the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, most likely by accident, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. “The little credibility that the Islamic Republic had among its supporters suffered a major blow tonight,” said Rouzbeh MirEmbrahim, an independent Iran analyst in New York and a consultant with the United Nations. “This tragedy undermines the image Iran has cultivated as a military power and weakened it significantly both regionally and internationally.” On social media, Iranians began expressing anger toward the military soon after the announcement, many of them using the term “harshest revenge,” which officials had repeatedly promised in the wake of the American drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a powerful Revolutionary Guards commander, last week. “They were supposed to take their harsh revenge against America, not the people,” wrote Mojtaba Fathi, a journalist. [Read: Iran’s only female Olympic medalist has defected from the country over “lies” and “injustice.”] The Iranian military's statement said the plane “took the flying posture and altitude of an enemy target” as it came close to an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base. It said that “under these circumstances, because of human error,” the plane “came under fire.” The military said it would undertake “major reform in operations of all armed forces” to make sure that such an error never happened again. It said Revolutionary Guards officials had been ordered to appear on state media and give the public a full explanation. In a statement of his own, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tried to place some of the blame on the United States, saying on Twitter that the disaster was “caused by U.S. adventurism.” The military’s statement said there had been information suggesting the United States was “preparing to aerially target sensitive defense and key sites and multiple targets in our country, and this led to even more sensitive defense posture by our antiaircraft units.” The State Department had no immediate comment late Friday about Iran’s admission of responsibility.  Suspicions that an Iranian missile had brought down the plane were raised immediately after the crash Wednesday morning — just hours after Iran fired missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American forces. The Iranians asked the National Transportation Safety Board to help with the investigation, and the State Department granted waivers to allow the American agency to help. A senior administration official said Friday that he thought the Iranians wanted American investigators there to keep up the appearance that they did not know what had caused the crash. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss these matters publicly, said the Iranian military had poor command and control, and that this was reflected in what had happened with the airplane. Communications among officials and between units are often lacking, he said, and confusion can be the norm. Western analysts often overestimate the capability of parts of the Iranian military, he said. State television in Iran aired footage that it said showed two flight recorder units recovered from the crash site. Processing their data could take more than a month, and the investigation could take up to two years, Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said Friday.  The military announcement came as something of a surprise. As late as Friday night, officials were weighing whether to blame faulty jet equipment in acknowledging that Iranian missiles brought down the jet, according to four Iranians familiar with the deliberations. Until Saturday, Ukraine’s main intelligence agency, known as the S.B.U., said only that it had narrowed the cause of the crash to a missile strike or a terrorist act and that it could not confirm Western intelligence that an Iranian missile system was likely to blame.  An Iranian report released on Thursday said that the plane, bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was in flames before it hit the ground but sent no distress signal.  Video verified by The New York Times and published on Thursday appeared to show a missile fired from Iranian territory hitting the plane. The video showed a small explosion as the plane flew above Parand, a city near the airport — where it stopped transmitting its signal before it crashed. The plane turned back toward the airport before it exploded and crashed, other videos verified by The Times showed. When Iran began firing missiles early on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani by the United States in Baghdad, international airlines rerouted flights away from Iran, and the Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the airspace in the region.  After the crash, experts raised questions about why the Iranian authorities had not stopped flights in and out of Tehran.  In Iran, a debate over how much blame the government bears threatened to destroy the national solidarity that followed the country’s conflict with the United States. Many Iranians said that their anger over the lack of accountability at the highest levels of government had quickly returned. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States and its allies had intelligence showing that the passenger jet had been shot down. He was the first American official to publicly confirm the intelligence assessments. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, citing a preliminary review of the evidence, called for a full investigation “to be convinced beyond all doubt.” The jetliner was carrying 57 Canadians among its 176 passengers and crew. “We recognize that this may have been done accidentally,” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. “The evidence suggests very clearly a possible and probable cause for the crash.” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made clear on Friday that Western governments had not initially shared the evidence underpinning their assessments that Iran had brought down the Ukrainian jet, though later a spokeswoman said that American officials had handed over more information. Ukrainian officials also analyzed the plane’s flight pattern on Friday and determined it had stayed within the normal corridor for flights out of Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said at a news conference. “Our goal is to ascertain the undeniable truth,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement on Friday. “We believe this is the responsibility of the whole international community before the families of the dead and the memory of the victims of the catastrophe.” Reporting was contributed by Niraj Chokshi, Anton Troianovski, Julian E. Barnes, Karen Zraick, Edward Wong and Michael Levenson.""]","“The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,” President Hassan Rouhani said, as Iran reversed its claims that mechanical failure was to blame."
"In Rare Mexico School Shooting, Student Kills a Teacher and Wounds Others",2020-01-10,By Kirk Semple and Paulina Villegas,"['MEXICO CITY — An 11-year-old boy wielding two guns opened fire in his private school in northern Mexico on Friday morning, killing a teacher and wounding at least six other people, before killing himself, officials said. The wounded included one teacher and five students, Adelaido Flores, a regional public security coordinator in the northern border state of Coahuila, said in an interview with Milenio TV. Officials said the boy had been a well-behaved student who earned good grades. But Coahuila’s governor, Miguel Ángel Riquelme, said at a news conference that the boy had given what now appears to have been an ominous signal of his plan.  “He told some of his classmates that ‘today is the day,’” the governor said.  Shortly after the boy uttered that phrase, the governor said, he asked permission to go to the bathroom. Fifteen minutes later, when the boy hadn’t returned to class, the teacher went looking for him and found the boy emerging from the bathroom with two guns, Mr. Riquelme said.  The boy then opened fire, killing the teacher and wounding the others, the governor said.  Mr. Riquelme speculated that the boy may have been influenced by a violent video game called Natural Selection. He had spoken about it with other students, and on Friday was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the game’s name.  “He had indeed mentioned the video game, which I believe he tried to recreate today,” the governor said. The website for the game describes its latest iteration, Natural Selection 2, as “an immersive, multiplayer shooter that pits aliens against humans in a strategic and action-packed struggle for survival.” The game is manufactured by Unknown Worlds, a company based in San Francisco.  Unknown Worlds did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  Jorge Zermeño, the mayor of the city of Torreón, where the shooting occurred, told reporters that the boy lived with his grandmother but suffered “some family trouble.” As investigators swarmed the school Friday morning, officials offered no further information about the circumstances or possible motive. While Mexico has suffered from endemic violence for years, school shootings are extremely rare. In January 2017, a 15-year-old boy opened fire in a school in the northern city of Monterrey, wounding a teacher and several students, before shooting himself. The boy later died at the hospital, and the teacher died of her wounds two months later. In May 2014, a 15-year-old boy shot a 13-year-old classmate in a classroom at their school in the State of Mexico. The victim died of his wounds the next day.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who recently completed his first year in office, has struggled to articulate a coherent crime-fighting strategy, and has failed to curb spiraling violence driven by organized crime groups.  He took office in December 2018 promising to remove the military from the streets in the fight against drug trafficking organizations and instead address the roots of crime by tackling poverty through social development programs and investment — a strategy he refers to as “hugs, not bullets.” But in the first 11 months of last year, there were more than 31,000 homicides, with some experts predicting that the year-end total would set a record. ']",The governor said the 11-year-old boy may have been influenced by a violent video game.
What to Know About Taiwan’s Presidential Election,2020-01-10,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — Voters in Taiwan are widely expected to deliver a victory on Saturday to President Tsai Ing-wen, in defiance of China’s pressure campaign against the island democracy. If she wins a second term, as polls indicate she will, Ms. Tsai will have made a dramatic comeback from 2018, when her party was battered in local elections. In the 14 months since, she has rallied her party’s leadership behind her and rebuilt public support by overseeing economic growth, despite Beijing’s efforts to isolate her government. Ms. Tsai’s rise has been driven in part by concerns about Chinese encroachment. Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has lured away some of the few countries that formally recognize Taiwan, as well as stepping up military air patrols and sending carriers through the Taiwan Strait.  But according to surveys, voters believe Ms. Tsai is better able to defend Taiwan’s sovereignty than her challengers. The issue took on increased importance last year as Hong Kong saw huge protests against China’s increasing sway over that city. Ms. Tsai’s main opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the opposition Kuomintang party, is a former lawmaker who surged to prominence in 2018, when he was elected mayor of Kaohsiung, a longtime stronghold of Ms. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party. But Mr. Han’s star has dimmed in recent months, amid disunity in his party and increased scrutiny of his more accommodating views of the Chinese government. Here’s a look at the race, the stakes involved, the issues dominating the campaign and the likely outcomes: In many ways, victory for Ms. Tsai would serve as a rebuke of Beijing’s decades-long strategy to win control of Taiwan.  Taiwan has had de facto independence since 1949, but China’s ruling Communist Party claims it as Chinese territory and has pushed for unification. Ms. Tsai has been more resistant to China’s efforts to increase its influence over Taiwan than the Kuomintang opposition has been. Beijing has tried to punish her by ending contact with her government, by poaching from Taiwan’s handful of formal diplomatic allies and by reducing the number of Chinese tourists who cross the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese leader, Mr. Xi, who has overseen a turn toward greater authoritarianism, last year drew a harder line on Taiwan, saying that unification with the island was an inevitable goal. He threatened military force should it seek formal independence.  Mr. Xi said Taiwan’s freedoms would be guaranteed under a version of the “one country, two systems” political framework that Beijing has used in Hong Kong since Britain handed back the former colony in 1997.  But that is an unpopular proposal in Taiwan, where polls show that the population would rather maintain the status quo.  Ms. Tsai quickly dismissed Mr. Xi’s call for unification last January, in a speech that gained her broad support in Taiwan. The antigovernment protests in Hong Kong since June, which have brought to light deep public anger there over the erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule, have also helped to boost Ms. Tsai’s popularity. Ms. Tsai’s campaign recently released a video highlighting the resentment of Beijing that has spilled into the open in Hong Kong. It promoted her party as a defender against the threat to life in Taiwan posed by China’s authoritarian rule: “We choose to stand with democracy,” the narrator said. Her administration has also highlighted concerns about Chinese efforts to influence the election, pointing to the spreading of disinformation during the campaign that appears aimed at undermining Ms. Tsai’s party.  Adding to concerns about Chinese infiltration was the account of a man who told the authorities in Australia that he had worked as a Chinese intelligence operative in Taiwan to help curry support for Mr. Han. Mr. Han denied the assertions, which remain unverified, but the case drew more attention to his views on China. Mr. Han, Ms. Tsai’s main rival, was once seen as a formidable opponent, but his prospects have dimmed. He has cultivated an image as a political maverick unafraid to challenge Taiwan’s political elites, which initially brought him immense support. He pushed for warmer ties with China, arguing that the economy would benefit, and he traveled to the mainland for meetings with Chinese officials.  That stance has won him tacit support from China. But it increasingly became a liability during the second half of 2019, as the protests in Hong Kong ensured that concerns about Beijing’s reach stayed front-and-center. Mr. Han’s campaign has also been weakened by divides between his supporters and some of the traditional elite in his party, the Kuomintang, or K.M.T. In contrast, Ms. Tsai was able to unify her party, the D.P.P., behind her. She named her chief primary rival as her running mate. “Even before the Hong Kong situation erupted, the D.P.P. had regained momentum, and by early June they were making themselves ready for the general election,” said Titus C. Chen, an associate professor of political science at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung. “They united among themselves at a moment when the K.M.T. fell apart.” Mr. Han, who had previously led an government-owned company that handles farm product distribution in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, won the Kaohsiung mayoral race amid a surge in popularity that his supporters called the “Han wave.” His party won in several key cities in 2018, and the election was a broad rout for the Democratic Progressive Party. Ms. Tsai resigned as party leader to take responsibility for the losses. But the past eight months have seen a long, steady slide in Mr. Han’s popularity. He is facing a recall drive from Kaohsiung residents who criticized him for running for president so soon after becoming mayor. He has spent much of the race battling accusations ranging from sleeping late to failing to energetically fight a dengue fever outbreak in Kaohsiung.  “He had a pretty miserable campaign,” said Nathan Batto, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica, a state-funded research institution in Taipei. The final election polls showed him trailing Ms. Tsai by double-digit margins. Mr. Han’s electoral success in Kaohsiung had much to do with his campaign’s emphasis on economic issues, like stagnant wages. He tried to return to such themes during the presidential campaign. But in his short time running the city, he has done little to show that he was the candidate who could bring about growth. Taiwan’s economy performed strongly last year, with final figures expected to show that growth exceeded that of regional competitors like South Korea and Hong Kong. Despite China’s efforts to undermine tourism in Taiwan, the island has seen its arrivals grow, thanks to more visitors from Japan and Southeast Asia. And economists say Taiwan has benefited from the trade war between the United States and China, as it absorbs some manufacturing and investment from companies that want to avoid any new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. “It may have much less to do with D.P.P. economic policy, but people here attribute that performance to D.P.P. government preparations,” Professor Chen said.']",President Tsai Ing-wen’s prospects in the vote Saturday have been buoyed by a stronger economy and her promises to stand up to China. 
Fires Threaten Australian Towns That Have Already Burned Once,2020-01-10,"By Damien Cave, Livia Albeck-Ripka and Matthew Abbott","['BATLOW, Australia — Surrounded by hills burned black as soot, with homes flattened and cattle decimated, Australians in the country’s east on Friday confronted a new round of  supercharged bush fires as high winds drove the fires back toward towns that had already burned at least once before. Areas of Victoria State and South Australia were under evacuation orders. In Batlow, an apple-growing town in New South Wales that barely survived a day of 50-foot flames last Saturday, residents who had only just been allowed to return scrambled to figure out what was lost and how to protect what remained. “It’s like the fire is a sentient being,” said Sulari Gentill, a novelist with a husband and a son who are volunteer firefighters in Batlow. “It feels like it’s coming to get us.” The sheer relentlessness of the fires — which have burned more than 15 million acres, killed at least 24 people and destroyed about 2,000 homes — is increasingly pushing Australia beyond crisis mode into a jumble of contemplation, anger and traumatized fatigue.  This is especially true in the dozens of places enduring repeated threats, where firefighters and beleaguered residents are caught in a smoky, delirious in-between. Neighbors hug and shake their heads, wondering why one house went up in flames and the one next door did not, then ask who has enough water to share for a spray-down of the roof. They smile at the chirp of a bird, a sign of normalcy not heard by some since the terrible fires of New Year’s Eve, then struggle to determine the day of the week, saying they feel jet-lagged. For many, the fires have become villains that stick around long enough to reveal their personalities. Firefighters swear at them for their cunning unpredictability, while those who have seen them firsthand marvel at their destructive power. Linda Carney, a resident of Buchan, a small town about 200 miles east of Melbourne, described how she watched from her veranda as the “dirty great glow in the sky” approached her home. A firestorm from a few days ago combined several blazes right in front of her. It threw off a column “like an atom bomb,” she said, “then dropped the ash back down.” “We didn’t have time to get scared,” said her husband, Robert Carney.  Ms. Carney added: “You don’t even think about being scared.”  On Friday morning, though, as dangerous conditions were forecast across Victoria, she admitted she was nervous. “It’s really smoky; I can’t see a thing,” she said. They had already lost their house to the fires. They are sleeping on their property in a horse trailer to protect their dogs, horses and cattle. They are not alone in their hardy determination to stay. Many others report remaining in place or returning to towns that are scorched and still at risk out of concern for animals or fear of looters, or to see and deal with damage.  In addition to the houses burned to the ground are many others with lesser havoc — a shed or cars reduced to steel skeletons, cherished mementos gone up in flames, water pipes and wires melted into tangled knots. “We’ve got no electricity, no water,” Marjukka Niemi said as she picked up free food and water at a community center in Batlow on Friday morning. “We’re trying to freeze water bottles in other people’s freezers.” Another community center, in Sarsfield, Victoria, offered food, water and the opportunity to have a “chat” and a “cuppa,” slang for a cup of tea. Residents of the town, where dozens of houses were flattened by fire last month, streamed into the center on Friday. “People just want to talk; they are traumatized,” said Rod Thomas, a local volunteer. He said he planned to stay in Sarsfield to defend his house. “I’m ready for it,” he said, adding, “fire is fairly haphazard.” By early afternoon, the fires had nonetheless begun to surge. Winds pushed beyond 55 miles an hour in some areas as heat scratched into the back of the throat. On Kangaroo Island, where ecologists worry that the fires may kill off unique and endangered wildlife, officials reported that half of the island had burned, up from a third earlier this week.  Farther north and west on the mainland, temperatures climbed close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit across a wide swath of the Snowy Mountains, which stretch across hundreds of miles from New South Wales south to Victoria, creating conditions that were similar to what occurred over the New Year’s Eve weekend.  Calls reporting spot fires in Batlow started to come in. New South Wales fire officials reported that a pair of blazes nearby were about to merge, and that lightning strikes had started new fires farther north. The authorities in Victoria also added several towns to emergency notices, with about a dozen deemed to be too dangerous for anyone to stay — including Buchan, where the Carneys had hunkered down. On the road leading to the town, Mason Johnson had been trying to make his way home to deliver hay and materials to build a yard for stranded cattle when his engine gave out.  With Buchan having been burned already, Mr. Johnson said he doubted it would take another hit. But now, stuck on a stretch of road with unburned trees and a highly unpredictable fire, he was getting anxious. “It’s not going anywhere,” he said of his truck.  Officials nonetheless suggested the day’s conditions might not prove quite as challenging as they did a week ago, with an expected wind shift and a drop in temperatures. Additional emergency resources have also been deployed.  Across rural New South Wales, the army has become more visible, with water deliveries to residents and bulldozers lined up to help to create containment zones. Planes and helicopters soared through the haze in advance of the fires’ peak, dropping fire retardant on vulnerable areas. Prime Minister Scott Morrison also announced Friday that there would be a thorough review of the fires and the government’s response. But he stopped short of pledging to act more aggressively on cutting heat-trapping emissions or making plans to accelerate Australia’s efforts to adapt to climate change.  With protests against him Friday evening in Sydney and several other Australian cities, Mr. Morrison appeared on a conservative radio show for an interview, where he was told by the host that he was already doing too much to address climate change. It was a sign of the political divisions that have made Australia a climate change laggard despite its extreme vulnerability to global warming.  But in towns where the smell of smoke is overpowering, where street signs are melted and orchards charred, politics mattered less than the moment: The fires were all that anyone could talk about. “It feels evil,” said Brigitte Mitterer, who lives in Clifton Creek, a town in Victoria that has already been hit by fire and was again, in the possible  fire line Friday afternoon and evening. “We’re all on edge,” said Deb Wiltshire, 52, the owner of a cafe in Batlow that is now closed because of fire damage. “You think it’s over and done, then you get told it’s on its way back.” Damien Cave reported from Batlow, Australia, and Livia Albeck-Ripka from Buchan, Australia.']",

"In Plane Crash, a Day of Blame: Ukraine Weighs In and Iran Mulls Announcement",2020-01-10,,"['Ukraine’s main intelligence agency, the S.B.U., or Security Service of Ukraine, said on Friday that it had narrowed down the possible causes of the airplane crash in Iran to either a missile strike or a terrorist act.  The S.B.U said in a statement that it’s unclear whether the SA-15 missile system that Western officials say likely brought down the plane shortly after takeoff from Tehran was actually responsible. The agency’s statement came shortly after Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said at a news conference in Kyiv that Ukrainian officials “will come to our conclusions,” but “we don’t want to come to them right now.”  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday morning Washington time after he requested that the United States and other Western countries release the evidence that a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran had been shot down. Mr. Zelensky said in a post on Facebook early Friday that the possibility that a missile had downed the Ukraine International Airlines plane on Wednesday, killing all 176 aboard, “cannot be ruled out but is not currently confirmed.” Hours later, Mr. Zelensky’s spokeswoman said that the president had met with U.S. Embassy officials in Kyiv and received “important data that will be studied by our specialists” and that later in the day he spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The jet crashed hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at American targets in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of a powerful branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and was bracing for a possible American response. Mr. Zelensky has pledged to get to the bottom of what happened, cutting short a trip to Oman immediately after the crash and dispatching a team of 45 Ukrainian experts to Tehran. On Friday, Mr. Zelensky made it clear that Western governments, allies in his country’s conflict with Russia, had not initially shared the evidence that led them to believe that the Ukrainian jet had been shot down by Iran. Mr. Prystaiko said the extent of Iran’s cooperation with Ukrainian officials on the ground was “adequate.” Ukrainian officials analyzed the plane’s flight pattern on Friday and determined it had stayed completely within the normal corridor for flights out of the airport, he said. “The plane was within the corridor departing from within the international airport, so there was nothing to indicate the flight was in danger,” he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain both said Iran had probably shot down the plane by accident. President Trump said he suspected that the downing of the plane had been the result of “a mistake on the other side.” An American official told The New York Times that the United States had a high level of confidence that a Russian-made Iranian air defense system had fired two surface-to-air missiles at the plane. The crash of the Ukrainian jet has presented Mr. Zelensky, a 41-year-old comedian who swept to a stunning victory in the presidential election last spring, with the most urgent crisis of his short tenure.  “Our goal is to ascertain the undeniable truth,” Mr. Zelensky said in his statement on Friday. “We believe this is the responsibility of the whole international community before the families of the dead and the memory of the victims of the catastrophe.” The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office issued a public request for help from Canada, seeking information from intelligence agencies about a possible missile strike. Secretary Pompeo confirmed on Friday that the United States and its allies have intelligence that the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed in Iran had been shot down. “We do believe that it’s likely that the plane was shot down by an Iranian missile,” Mr. Pompeo said at a briefing at the White House announcing new sanctions against Iran. “We’re going to let the investigation play out before we make a final determination. It’s important that we get to the bottom of it.” Mr. Pompeo was the first American official to publicly confirm the intelligence assessments. American and allied officials said on Thursday that they had intelligence that surface-to-air missiles fired by Iranian military forces shot down the Boeing 737 minutes after it took off from Tehran, headed for Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Mr. Pompeo said that he had spoken with his Canadian counterpart and with Ukrainian President Zelensky by phone on Friday, but noted that an investigation was ongoing. “When we get the results of that investigation, I am confident we and the rest of the world will take appropriate action,” he said. The Trump administration also plans to issue sanctions waivers to American companies or others who can help the investigation, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said at the briefing. Iran’s Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said on Friday that Iran would issue a statement on Saturday announcing the cause of the crash of the Ukrainian jetliner. The report offered no hint of what that cause might be. “There will be a meeting with domestic and international representatives related to the crash tomorrow and after studying preliminarily, the cause of the crash will be announced,” Fars News said in a news alert citing what it described as a source from the Joint Armed Forces. Iran has maintained that there was no evidence that the plane was struck by a missile and doubled down on that assertion on Friday, despite western officials pointing to intelligence suggesting the passenger jet was accidentally hit by a missile. Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization chief, Ali Abedzadeh, speaking during a Friday news conference, urged caution and said that nothing could be determined until the data from the black boxes was analyzed and said statements made by other nations were politically motivated. But, he added, what could be said was that the plane had not been hit by a missile and was likely on fire before it crashed. He also urged nations with intelligence on the crash, namely the United States and Canada, to share that information with Iran.  “We cannot just give you speculation,” Mr. Abedzadeh said in footage televised and translated on Iranian state television. “So far what I can tell you is that the plane has not been hit by a missile, and we have to look for the cause of the fire.” Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said during the same news conference that it could take more than a month to process the data recovered from the flight recorders and that the investigation could take up to two years. He also noted that Ukraine, France, Canada, and Russia have all said they are willing to assist Iran with the data extraction, and Tehran will send the black box to one of these countries if it fails to retrieve the data. Normally, Iran has the capacity to download black box data, but Mr. Rezaeifar said that since the devices had been damaged, it would be difficult to extract information. “We need special software and hardware which are available in our country, but if we fail to extract the data due to the damages of the black box, we will get help from other countries,” he said. The black box will begin to be evaluated on Friday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported, “to assess and check whether it is possible to reconstruct and analyze the information inside the country.” State television aired footage that it said showed the two black boxes that were recovered from the crash site. Footage verified by The New York Times appears to show a missile fired from Iranian territory hitting a plane near Tehran’s airport, the area where a Ukrainian jet crashed on Wednesday. As investigators work to determine an official cause of the accident, the video offered new clues about the crash, which came hours after a violent confrontation between Iran and the United States.  A small explosion occurred when what appears to be a missile hit the plane above Parand, a city near the airport, but the plane did not explode, the video showed. The jet continued flying for several minutes and turned back toward the airport, The Times has determined.  The plane, which by then had stopped transmitting its signal, flew toward the airport ablaze before it exploded and crashed quickly, other videos verified by The Times showed. Visual and audio clues in the footage also matched flight path information and satellite imagery of the area near where the plane crashed. The Trump administration slapped another round of sanctions on Iran on Friday, seeking to further deter what it called Tehran’s support for terrorist activities. Given that Iran is already under heavy sanctions from the United States, the newest round is unlikely to have any major economic effect but could help deter investment from countries including China and Russia, analysts said. Secretaries Mnuchin and Pompeo announced the new sanctions in a briefing at the White House. The sanctions apply to industries including steel, construction, mining and textiles, as well as to eight senior officials said by the United States to have had a role in the missile strikes by Iran this week. “The president has been very clear we will continue to apply economic sanctions until Iran stops its terrorist activities and commit that it will never have nuclear weapons,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The move was the first substantive response by the United States following the missile strikes on bases housing American forces in Iraq, and was seen by analysts as an additional signal of de-escalation by the administration. [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for New American Security, a research organization, said the sanctions would do negligible additional damage to Iran’s economy because the bulk of its revenue streams have been cut off already. The new sanctions, he said, largely, tighten enforcement of existing sanctions by targeting companies that are engaging in prohibited trade with Iran. “When it comes to putting materially more economic pressure on Iran, the Trump administration is something of a victim of its own success — and I think we are reaching the end of the road for what ‘maximum pressure’ can achieve when it comes to Iran’s economy,” Mr. Harrell said. “Trump has already succeeded in cutting off the vast majority of Iran’s cash-earning exports, particularly oil, and has caused a sharp drop in Iranian GDP.” The aftermath of the plane crash in Iran has the potential to open a fresh rift between Ukraine and its most important Western allies.  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has already turned into an unwilling player in United States domestic politics as a result of the Trump administration’s pressure campaign seeking assistance in the 2020 presidential race. Now, he is stuck in the middle of an even more volatile American crisis: the conflict with Iran. On the one hand, Mr. Zelensky needs Iranian cooperation to deliver the full-fledged investigation of the disaster that he has pledged to his public. On the other, Mr. Zelensky needs the data collected by Western intelligence — not to mention his continued reliance on Western support in Ukraine’s conflict with Russia. “He could end up in a situation of being caught between two fires,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, Mr. Zelensky’s former national security adviser, who resigned in September. “It’s a very complicated situation.” Mr. Zelensky was caught flat-footed on Thursday when American officials went public with intelligence findings about the crash, and it was clear that the United States and its Western allies had not briefed Kyiv. In an interview with The New York Times, Pavlo Klimkin, a former foreign minister of Ukraine, described the failure by Western officials to share their intelligence earlier as a moral setback in Kyiv’s relationship with its partners. “We lost our plane, we lost our citizens,” Mr. Klimkin said. “Of course we want to expect of our friends to be with us in this important moment in the sense of sharing information, in the sense of solidarity, in the sense of simply working together.” On Friday, American and Ukrainian officials raced to dispel any appearance of a rift. But Anatoliy Hrytsenko, a former Ukrainian defense minister, said that any recalcitrance from Western countries would create suspicions in Ukraine that they were using the tragedy as a cudgel in their conflict with Iran. “Western leaders must give us these intelligence findings,” Mr. Hrytsenko said. “If we assume the worst and they don’t do this, then a big question mark arises: Is this really about determining the cause of a plane crash or is this now geopolitics?” France’s aviation investigation authority said on Friday that it had been invited by Iran to take part in the investigation into the crash of an Ukrainian plane near Tehran this week.  A spokesman for the authority, known by its French acronym B.E.A., or Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses, said France was getting involved because the jetliner’s engine had been designed by CFM, a joint venture between GE Aviation, an American company, and Safran Aircraft Engines, a French one.  “No further assistance has been requested at this point in time,” the spokesman said, adding that Iranian aviation authorities were the lead investigator in the case. Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, did not say on Friday whether the country had proof that the jetliner had been shot down by Iranian missiles, but said that France was “available” to help with the investigation.  “Before the speculation, we must establish the truth in conditions of utmost transparency,” Mr. Le Drian told RTL, a French radio station. France, one of the signatories of the Iranian nuclear deal, is now trying to salvage it by acting as a go-between for Iran and the United States. While many of the passengers onboard the Ukrainian plane that crashed near Tehran on Wednesday were Iranians, there were citizens of at least seven other nations on the flight when it plunged to the ground killing everyone. Among the dead were at least 63 Canadians, many of them university students. Dozens are believed to be from the city of Edmonton, members of the Iranian community told local news outlets. At least 10 were students or staff at the University of Alberta, according to a statement from David H. Turpin, the president of the university. “These individuals were integral to the intellectual and social fabric of our university and the broader community,” Mr. Turpin said. “We are grieving for lost colleagues, classmates, teachers, and mentors, as well as loved ones, family, friends, and roommates.” “We will feel their loss — and the aftermath of this tragedy — for many years to come,” he added. Sweden’s prime minister said he spoke with the leaders of Canada and Britain following reports that the plane may have accidentally been shot down by an Iranian missile, and said that the country would do all it could to aid in the investigation after the “serious information” emerged. A number of Swedish nationals were also onboard the Ukraine International Airlines flight when it crashed. “We will do everything we can to find out what happened,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden said in a statement. “My thoughts go to the victims, their families and close relatives at this difficult time. You are not alone. We share your sorrow.” Although no German citizens were among the victims, the mayor of Werl, a town in western Germany, told the German news agency DPA on Friday that a 30-year-old Afghan woman who had been granted asylum in the country and had been living in the town since 2017 was killed. Her 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son had also died in the crash. The mayor, Michael Grossmann, said the woman’s brother, who also lives in the town, had confirmed the deaths, but gave no further details. The Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany posted an online tribute to a Paniz Soltani, a young Iranian woman who had been completing her doctoral studies at the institute.

"Far-Right Trolls, Not Grannies, Drive Outrage Over German Satire",2020-01-11,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The spoof on a classic German children’s song was intended to poke fun at the generation gap between climate-conscious young Germans and their purportedly gas-guzzling grandparents.  But after one of the nation’s largest public broadcasters posted the song on its Facebook page, some offended grandparents complained. The far right caught on, and its online trolls fomented a controversy to promote their own agenda. The broadcaster took down the item and apologized. Its journalists accused their bosses of caving in and said that they themselves had become targets of death threats. Those events over the last two weeks in Germany are verging on a national scandal centered on, of all things, a satirical ditty called “Granny Is an Old Environmental Swine.”  Observers note the controversy is similar to others in recent years fanned by a small number of right-wing trolls seeking to disrupt public consensus on the fight against climate change and the country’s mainstream media. [Read: Germany shooting is deadliest yet in upsurge of far-right attacks in the country.] Small though its beginnings may be, the fight has added to concerns about the breakdown of the country’s social fabric, as well as about the growing ability of right-wing networks online to sow discord over social issues. “In the same way that the Nazis were quick to use the radio for their propaganda purposes, the extreme right was very quick in learning how to use the internet to promote their agenda,” said Miro Dittrich, an analyst of far-right activity online for the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which promotes pluralism and human rights. To do so, a relatively small number of right-wing trolls tweeted and retweeted comments condemning the broadcaster, WDR, making the issue appear more important than it was. As a result politicians weighed in and WDR felt it had to respond. This week, the director of WDR, Tom Buhrow, held a closed-door meeting with journalists to reassure them that it stood behind their independence and would continue to support satirical productions as it had in the past.  But the incident has exposed Germany’s steep learning curve when it comes to social media.  Unlike in the United States, where President Trump uses Twitter consistently as his megaphone, in Germany less than half of the country’s 82 million people are active on social media, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center.  Users include many politicians and journalists, especially on Twitter, who may jump on a trending topic without knowing how it rose to the top of their lists, said Philip Kreissel, of the #Iamhere organization, which tracks and counters hate speech on social media.  The far right has quickly learned that it can have an outsize impact by maintaining a hyperactive presence on social platforms.  “This is a strategic decision by the far right to use social media in this way,” said Mr. Kreissel, who studied the case, which trended under the German term #Umweltsau. “They know they can make us believe they are a lot of people when they post a lot. Pretty simple, but many people don’t expect that kind of thing.” Tracing the history of the song and its response online shows how a small group of actors seized upon it to grab headlines and push it to the forefront of public discussion. In November, a version of the tune was performed by actors in a live comedy show on a WDR station and posted online without generating much attention or objection, as Luca Hammer, a social media analyst, pointed out on Twitter.  In the original children’s song, a granny is praised as “clever” for her ability to drive her motorcycle in a chicken coop and attach a steering wheel to her cooking pot.  The satirical version stands this portrayal on its head, denouncing the grandmother’s love of her gas-guzzling motorbike and piling it on with the suggestion that she swaps her bike for an S.U.V. that she uses to plow over a couple of grandfathers. But when another of the broadcaster’s stations, WDR2, picked up the song, it had a children’s choir sing it. It posted a video to its Facebook page on Dec. 27, comments were posted, and calls came in from people, many of them grandparents who felt offended. One woman, Karin Sohrt, who identified herself as a grandmother, born in 1950, now living in Berlin, pointed out the contrast between her childhood and children today.  When she grew up, riding the bus was considered a luxury, apartments were heated with coal, and clothes were constantly recycled and reused. It was today’s youth who should be ashamed. “You are the environmental swines,” she wrote.   WDR deleted the post of the song on the same day, citing the uproar.  But members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, had already picked up the topic, and started circulating it to accounts that anti-hate speech groups have identified as belonging to right-wing extremists, Mr. Kreissel said. The next day, the station issued a statement expressing regret for having offended anyone, saying that was not its intention. “It was much more about using satire to address the generational conflict created by the Fridays for Future movement,” it said, referring to protests by young people against climate change. Armin Laschet, governor of North Rhine-Westphalia and a member of the conservative Christian Democrats, condemned the song as an unacceptable manipulation of young people, who were being pitted against older generations. The song “crossed the boundaries of style and respect of older people,” he said in a post on Twitter. By that time, the number of hateful postings had escalated and the broadcaster responded by hosting a call-in show for listeners addressing the controversy.  Among them was Mr. Buhrow, the director, who said, “It was a mistake. I apologize for it without ifs, ands or buts.” Instead of calming the situation, his comments only inflamed it.  In an open letter to Mr. Buhrow, dozens of journalists working for the broadcaster called his decision to delete the clip of the song “negligent,” saying it was no more an affront to grandparents than the alcoholic father in the Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone” was to dads. “The outrage over the song follows well-known patterns used by far-right trolls, who know their allegations are absurd,” the letter said. “They abuse our society’s meaningful reflex of wanting to harm no one to ‘hack’ the debate, attract attention and shift what is considered acceptable to think and say to their advantage.”  In the wake of the dispute, some of the journalists said they had received death threats online.  Two days later, in a video statement, Mr. Buhrow pledged to “do everything possible to protect our employees.” He said, “I ask myself what is wrong with our country when an unsuccessful video can lead to death threats.”  The uproar over the satire is not the first time journalists in Germany have been the target of online hate campaigns, which started with the arrival of more than one million migrants in late 2015 and has grown since. But those who track online activity of right-wing groups worry the public still underestimates their reach. “I think there is still not enough awareness about the power of right-wing mobilization on the internet and how it has developed,” said Mr. Dittrich of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation. “The phenomenon is nothing new,” he added, “but the question is whether the broadcaster learned from it.”']",A song about a grandmother and her gas-guzzling motorcycle fuels a national debate in Germany. At the wheel were right-wing actors who wanted it that way.
Going Rogue: Prince Harry and Meghan Caught the Palace Off Guard,2020-01-09,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, failed to get clearance from Queen Elizabeth II before announcing their unorthodox plan to become part-time, financially independent royals and divide their time between Britain and North America. But the couple had been planning the move for months before it popped up, out of the blue, on their Instagram account on Wednesday evening, electrifying social media, interrupting the BBC’s coverage of Brexit and elbowing aside news about the risk of war between the United States and Iran. Soon after the couple issued a statement saying they planned to “step back” from their royal duties, they elaborated their thinking on a new, slickly produced website. The site was quietly designed by a firm in Canada with no input from Buckingham Palace, according to people with ties to the royal family. It has swiftly come to symbolize what palace officials regard as a rogue operation by Prince Harry and Meghan, one that now threatens the unity of the House of Windsor and the future of two of its most popular members. Yet the botched announcement is also a human story — of a recently married prince at odds with his older brother, Prince William; his American actress wife, isolated and unhappy in her cloistered new life; and a young couple enmeshed in a bitter feud with Britain’s aggressive tabloid press. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are also known, felt forced to disclose their plans prematurely after they learned that the Sun, a tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, got wind of the internal discussions about their status and was preparing a story, two people with ties to the family said. The uproar disrupted plans for Prince Charles, the duke’s father, and other family members to meet later this month to discuss how the couple might take on different roles — a conversation that has diplomatic, financial and tax ramifications. Still undecided is whether they can keep living rent-free in Frogmore Cottage, a recently refurbished house on the estate of Windsor Castle, owned by the queen. “We look forward to sharing details of this exciting next step in due course, after collaboration with Her Majesty the Queen,” as well as his father, brother, “and all relevant parties,” the duke and duchess said in characteristically upbeat language posted on Instagram and their site. That seems highly optimistic in the wake of headlines like the one in Thursday’s Daily Mirror: “They didn’t even tell the Queen.” The latest drama began just before Christmas, according to one person with knowledge of the family. Prince Harry, who was vacationing with his wife and 8-month-old son, Archie, in Canada, called his father to propose a new arrangement, in which he and his wife would relinquish some of their duties, live part of the year outside Britain and seek to support themselves. Prince Charles, this person said, asked for a written proposal from the couple, which would then form the basis for a longer conversation. The queen conveyed to Prince Harry that he would need his father’s support for her to give her blessing. Neither of those things happened, though the couple’s site presents several details about their new lives, as if they have been settled with the family. The site’s genesis, people with knowledge of the family said, was in the couple’s new charity, Sussex Royal, which they created after Prince Harry broke away from a charity he shared with his brother. Sussex Royal, which has no connection to their official duties, has consumed much of their energy in recent months. To design its site, the couple hired Article, a Toronto-based digital firm that designed The Tig, a now-defunct lifestyle blog that the duchess began in her acting days. When the Sussex Royal site went live Wednesday, it wound up being used as the vehicle for the announcement. That caught the couple’s communications team in Buckingham Palace by surprise, since they had no involvement in its creation. The duchess also works with Sunshine Sachs, a public relations firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles. An official there said the firm was not involved in either the announcement or the creation of the site. With gauzy photos and corporate-style language, the site sets out the couple’s rationale for scaling back their duties, defends their sources of funding and serves notice that they will no longer engage with the news media in the way Buckingham Palace traditionally has. Among its features is an explanation of who pays for their upkeep, complete with a graphic showing how money flows from the crown estate through the Treasury and back to the queen. But it raises as many questions as it answers. The couple say, for example, that they will forgo money from the Sovereign Grant, the public purse that pays for lodgings and offices for the royal family. But they note that it accounts for only 5 percent of their expenses. The other 95 percent comes from Prince Charles, through the proceeds he gets from the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast private estate established by King Edward III in 1337. It is not clear that Prince Harry would be entitled to the same income from his father if he were not a full-time royal.  The same is true for their tenancy in Frogmore Cottage, which the queen offered to the couple after tensions between Prince Harry and his brother prompted him to request that they move out of Kensington Palace, Prince William’s official residence. The couple came under criticism after reports the cottage was renovated in 2019 at a cost of 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million) in public funds.  The duke and duchess said their security was provided by Britain’s Home Office and suggested that would continue. But the site says nothing about who would pay for their security in Canada or the United States, the two countries that could be potential second homes. Nor does the site offer details about their plan to “work to become financially independent.” Royal watchers said each could sign multi-million-dollar book deals or earn tens of thousands of dollars on the lecture circuit. But to do that, they would likely be asked to share behind-the-scenes details about the royal family that would make their positions untenable. The duchess could resume her acting career, though that would set an even more startling precedent for a member of the royal family. As Meghan Markle, she starred in the legal drama, “Suits,” which was filmed in Toronto, which the couple are rumored to be considering as one landing spot. Other family members who have tried to make money, like Prince Edward, the queen’s youngest son, and his wife, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have had to give up their jobs after minor scandals. Prince Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, brought greater embarrassment on the family after getting involved in dubious moneymaking ventures and falling into debt. “It’s very commendable that somebody in that position wants to try to earn their own living,” Philip Hammond, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, told BBC radio. But he said the intense news media scrutiny would “make it actually quite difficult for them to do so.” The website also sets out new rules for engagement with the news media, which are sure to antagonize the tabloids. It says the couple will effectively boycott the “Royal Rota,” a four-decade-old arrangement that provides pooled access to the public activities of the royal family.  Four of the seven papers in the group are tabloids; Prince Harry’s contempt for them is palpable on the site. “Britain’s Royal Correspondents are regarded internationally as credible sources of both the work of members of the Royal Family as well as of their private lives,” the site says. “This misconception propels coverage that is often carried by outlets around the world, amplifying frequent misreporting.” The couple said they wanted to cultivate younger journalists and experts on the issues that animate their charitable work. Journalists who are members of the royal press said the real motive was to cut out newspapers with whom Prince Harry has long feuded over coverage. The vitriolic press reaction to the couple’s news suggests that keeping the tabloids at arm’s length may not shield them. “We’ve known for a long time that Harry hates the media, and the tabloids in particular,” said Valentine Low, a royal correspondent at the Times of London. “It’s ridiculous to think that this will spare them. The tabloids will not feel constrained.”']","The queen had yet to give her approval to their idea of becoming part-time royals, but word of the plan was about to leak."

"In Statement, Queen ‘Supportive’ of Prince Harry and Meghan’s ‘New Life’",2020-01-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II, seeking to defuse a spiraling crisis in the British royal family, said on Monday that she would allow Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to make a transition to being part-time royals, splitting their time between Britain and Canada and supporting themselves. “My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life as a young family,” the queen said in a statement after an extraordinary family meeting at her country home, Sandringham.  “Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family,” the queen said, “we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.” The strikingly personal statement did not answer a host of thorny questions, including who would pay for the couple’s upkeep, whether they could achieve financial independence without unacceptably commercializing the monarchy or even whether they will keep their royal titles, given the queen’s pointed use of their first names. But it was clearly calculated as a show of support and an exercise in damage control after the couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, abruptly announced a self-imposed exile from royal life. While the queen acknowledged the complexity of the issues involved, she made clear she wanted the crisis settled soon, saying she had asked for “final decisions to be reached in the coming days.” The statement came after one of the most-anticipated royal meetings in recent memory. The queen gathered her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, to hash out the arrangement, which could set a precedent for future generations of royals in a more streamlined royal family.  The British news media lost no time in breathlessly labeling the session the “Sandringham showdown” or “Sandringham summit,” depending on which tabloid one picked up — and dispatching TV crews to camp outside the gates of the 20,000-acre estate in Norfolk, where the queen spends the Christmas holidays. By whatever label, the queen’s gathering was a watershed moment in the life of the royal family, the capstone to a turbulent week in which, at times, the family appeared to be coming apart at the seams. “It’s as good an outcome as we could have hoped for,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “It’s the right decision under the circumstances.” By putting in place a transitional period, during which the duke and duchess can spend time in Britain and Canada, Ms. Junor said, Buckingham Palace may have wanted to give the couple space to make reasoned decisions — even, perhaps, to reconsider what officials at the palace viewed as a precipitous and ill-considered announcement.  “I suspect there is a hope that with the pressure released from them, they may change their minds and come back into the fold,” she said. Royal watchers said Buckingham Palace was also scrambling to regain control of the narrative, after days in which the palace seemed to be reacting to events and the news coverage grew ever more toxic, particularly about tensions between Harry and William. On Monday, representatives of both princes issued a statement denying a report in The Times of London that William’s “bullying” of Harry and Meghan had triggered their decision to step away from the royal family. The report cited “a source that knows the couple well.”  “Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a U.K. newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge,” the statement said, using the formal titles for the princes. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health,” the statement continued, “the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.” The report came hours after another anonymously sourced story, in The Times’s sister newspaper, The Sunday Times, portrayed William as frustrated but regretful about his brother’s tribulations. “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore; we’re separate entities,” William is said to have told a friend, according to The Sunday Times. “I’m sad about that,” he continued. “All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we’re all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the team.” The choice of Sandringham for the family meeting was freighted with history and symbolism. Unlike Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, which are owned by the state, Sandringham is owned personally by the queen, having been purchased in 1862 as a country house for the Prince of Wales. The estate, with its Jacobean-style gabled roofs, sprawling gardens, and tidal mud flats, has long been a favorite refuge for English monarchs. The queen’s grandfather, George V, described it as “dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world.” He died there in 1936. George VI, the queen’s father, died there in February 1952, while his daughter was away on a royal tour in Kenya. The queen now stays at Sandringham from before Christmas until February to mark the anniversary of his death and her accession to the throne. She plays host at a Christmas lunch at the house, which is one of a handful of times the entire royal family is together. Prince Harry and Meghan missed that gathering this year, having decided to spend the holiday in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning briefly with her husband to make their announcement, the duchess flew back to Canada last week to be with Archie, whom they had left with a friend. She had been expected to take part in the family meeting via conference call from Canada, people with ties to the palace said, but the palace did not confirm on Monday whether she did.  The British press has been scathing in its coverage of the couple, particularly the duchess, an American actress who was once celebrated here as a breath of fresh air for the stodgy House of Windsor. The tabloids took offense on behalf of the queen, saying she had been blindsided by the duke and duchess.    Critics traced the over-the-top tone of the coverage back to a decision the queen made in 1969 to allow a documentary crew backstage access in Buckingham Palace and elsewhere to film a movie of the daily lives of the royal family. The decision to turn the family members into public figures, these critics said, planted the seeds of celebrity coverage, which has grown over the decades into the breathless headlines about Princess Diana and, now, Prince Harry and Meghan. “The Queen went for the celebrity royal family because she thought it would make the family more relevant,” said Simon Jenkins, a columnist and former editor of The Times and the Evening Standard. “Now she’s paying the price for it.” The struggles of Prince Harry and his wife, Mr. Jenkins said, were ultimately not very important, particularly in a country that will exit from the European Union in less than three weeks. But he acknowledged it was a “terrific story.” “The rebellious younger son tears loose from the family and throws out the playbook,” Mr. Jenkins said. “The whole concept of the ‘Firm’ depends on the family sticking together.

"Happy Birthday, Trump Tells Kim. Not Enough, North Korea Says.",2020-01-11,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Saturday that President Trump had sent birthday greetings to its leader, Kim Jong-un, but added that the rapport between the two leaders would not help resolve their countries’ nuclear standoff. Ever since his first summit meeting with Mr. Kim, in Ju\u200bne 2018, Mr. Trump has repeatedly flaunted his “good relationship” with the North’s leader, \u200b calling Mr. Kim “smart” and even going so far as to say that he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.”  The two leaders \u200bhave also \u200bexchanged personal letters and dispatched special envoys to each other’s capitals, \u200bbut talks on how to denuclearize the North remains deadlocked. On Saturday, Kim Kye-gwan, a senior aide to Mr. Kim, confirmed that Mr. Trump had sent a personal letter to Mr. Kim for his birthday\u200b. (Mr. Kim is believed to have turned 36 on Wednesday. \u200b) \u200b He also acknowledged that the “personal relations” between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were “not bad,” but said Mr. Kim “would not discuss the state affairs on the basis of such personal feelings. \u200b” “Although Chairman Kim Jong-un has good personal feelings about President Trump, they are, in the true sense of the word, ‘personal,’” the official said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.  Chung Eui-yong, \u200bthe n\u200bational security adviser for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea\u200b, told reporters on Friday that \u200bMr. Trump \u200basked Seoul this past week to relay his birthday greetings to \u200bMr. \u200bKim\u200b. But Kim Kye-gwan said that a \u200bletter from Mr. Trump\u200b had already been delivered to Pyongyang directly from the Americans, \u200bcalling South Korea “presumptuous” for seeking to act as an intermediary between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. North Korea also hardened its position\u200b toward Washington on Saturday\u200b, calling the past one and a half years of on-and-off negotiations a “lost time.” The denuclearization talks collapsed when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump met in Vietnam in February 2018 for a second summit meeting and Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim’s offer to dismantle one of the North’s nuclear fuel-production facilities if Washington lifted international sanctions. Mr. Trump insisted on a more comprehensive rollback of North Korea’s nuclear program. Mr. Kim said recently that he no longer expected the United States to ease sanctions. Instead, he vowed to expand his country’s nuclear force, warning that North Korea \u200bno longer felt bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests. “There will never be such negotiations as that in Vietnam, in which we proposed exchanging a core nuclear facility of the country for the lift of some U.N. sanctions,” Kim Kye-gwan said on Saturday. “We know well about the way we should go and will go on our way.”']","A senior aide said the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had “good personal feelings” about President Trump, but that did not affect policy.

Two U.S. Service Members Killed in Afghanistan,2020-01-11,By Fahim Abed,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Two American service members were killed and two others were wounded in a roadside bomb explosion in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement. They were the first American military fatalities in Afghanistan this year. The victims were in an American military vehicle that struck a roadside bomb in Kandahar Province, where they had been conducting operations as part of the American-led NATO mission known as Resolute Support, according to the statement. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yusuf Ahmadi, claimed responsibility for the attack. The identities of the two killed service members were withheld pending notification of the next of kin. It was not clear which branch of the military they were from. Twenty American service members were killed in Afghanistan last year. More than 2,400 Americans troops have died in combat since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, according to the website icasualties.org. The previous American combat death in Afghanistan was in late December last year in northern Kunduz province, where Sgt. First Class Michael J. Goble, 33, of Washington Township, N.J., was killed by a roadside bomb. He was assigned to the First Battalion, Seventh Special Forces Group. The attack on American service members comes as the leaders of the Taliban are considering whether to comply with the American demand that they reduce violence in the country as a condition for reaching a preliminary peace agreement..    President Trump abruptly called off peace talks in September, after a Taliban attack killed an American soldier and 11 others. He announced the resumption of negotiations in November, during his first visit to Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Afghan officials said the United States conducted drone strikes in western Afghanistan, in Herat Province, targeting and killing a commander of a Taliban splinter group. The commander, Mullah Nangyalay, had ended his relationship with the main Taliban a couple years ago.  It was unclear whether that strike killed any civilians.

Oman’s New Sultan Vows to Continue Country’s Peacemaking Path,2020-01-11,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Persian Gulf nation of Oman named a new leader on Saturday, an Oxford-educated veteran of public service who pledged to continue his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy between global foes. The new leader, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, succeeds Sultan Qaboos, a towering figure who ruled Oman for nearly 50 years. He oversaw its development and pioneered a foreign policy based on good relations with a range of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States and Iran. Qaboos’s death was announced earlier Saturday. He was 79. The peaceful transition of power in Oman took place amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which has threatened to ignite a new war in the Middle East. Sultan Haitham, 65, has had a long career in public life, working in the foreign ministry, assisting with programs aimed at diversifying the country’s economy away from oil, and most recently serving as culture minister. He is a cousin of the late sultan. He comes to power as a number of conflicts swirl in the Middle East and as his government faces growing economic stress at home. In an address on Omani state television, Sultan Haitham vowed to continue his predecessor’s practice of not interfering in the affairs of other countries while working for peace between them. “We will continue to assist in resolving disputes peacefully,” he said. Oman, a country of 4.6 million on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an island of neutrality in a region rife with sectarian and political conflicts. While an oil producer, it is less wealthy than other Gulf states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and has maintained good relations with countries shunned by its Arab neighbors, such as Israel and Iran. It shares borders with Yemen, where a war involving Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — two of its other neighbors — continues to rage, and it has hosted peace talks with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. It has longstanding ties to Western nations like Britain and the United States, but also with Iran.  Those links have at times made it a useful friend to the United States, such as when it brokered the release of three American hikers jailed in Iran in 2011. A few years later, it hosted covert talks between the United States and Iran that paved the way for an international agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Michael Stephens, a research fellow for the Middle East at the Royal United Services Institute, said he expected the new sultan to largely stick with his predecessor’s foreign policy to keep the country safe. “Oman is in this mixing bowl where they can’t really lean either way because of their historical relationships and their geographic position,” he said. “Oman survives by being quiet, not by being noisy, and I don’t see why he would tear up that playbook.” The new sultan’s greatest challenges could be at home, where economic stagnation combined with low oil prices have led to large government deficits and rising unemployment among the country’s large youth population. Sultan Haitham has helped lead efforts to diversify Oman’s economy, though with limited success. Experts see him continuing that effort. “Sultan Qaboos created a modern economy from scratch. Sultan Haitham will now need to reform that economy in order to ‘right the ship,’” said Elana DeLozier, a research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Oman suffers from significant economic challenges, and these can foster social problems if left unresolved,” she added. “The economy will be the primary challenge domestically for the new sultan in the near term.” Qaboos had no children and, despite nearly five decades in power, never publicly named or groomed a successor. That led to concern that his death could unleash a messy transition or even a power struggle between members of the Al Said dynasty, which has ruled Oman since 1744 and once stretched as far as Zanzibar. But there were no hints of any discord on Saturday, when the handover proceeded as planned, with much of the process aired live on state television. After tens of thousands of Omanis turned out for Qaboos’s funeral, a family council convened to choose his successor. Under Omani law, if the council did not agree in a few days, it had to open a letter with Qaboos’s choice, which was written before his death. But the council skipped directly to that step on Saturday, opening the envelope to find Sultan Haitham’s name. Some diplomats and analysts who work on Persian Gulf matters assumed that the process had been worked out by the family behind the scenes beforehand, with some even suggesting that the sultan’s death had been kept secret for days until the succession plan was in place. But the swift transition to Sultan Haitham appeared to lay to rest concerns about a tricky transition. Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, who studies Gulf politics at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said Saturday’s transition sent a message of continuity both to Omanis and to other countries that may have hoped the new sultan would adopt policies more to their liking. While a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a grouping of Arab monarchies, Oman has often charted its own course. When Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthi rebels in Yemen’s war, Oman stayed out. Oman also declined to join a Saudi- and Emirati-led boycott of Qatar. Sultan Haitham was educated at Oxford before returning to Oman to hold a number of positions under the previous sultan. He served in top jobs at the foreign ministry, sometimes chaired cabinet meetings and was appointed in 2013 as the head of a national development committee. As he took the reins of power, condolence messages streamed in for Qaboos from across the globe, including from parties locked in struggles against each other, reflecting Oman’s emphasis on nonalignment. Saudi Arabia lauded him for modernizing his country, while the Houthi rebels, who are fighting Saudi Arabia in Yemen’s war, praised his efforts to end the conflict. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran wrote on Twitter that Qaboos’s death was a loss for the region and encouraged its new leader to take “inspiration from the past.” From the United States, former president George W. Bush issued a statement calling Qaboos “a stable force in the Middle East and a strong U.S. ally.”']","Sultan Haitham bin Tariq took power after the death of Sultan Qaboos, who ruled the country for 50 years, and he pledged to follow his predecessor’s quiet diplomacy.

"In Statement, Queen ‘Supportive’ of Prince Harry and Meghan’s ‘New Life’",2020-01-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II, seeking to defuse a spiraling crisis in the British royal family, said on Monday that she would allow Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to make a transition to being part-time royals, splitting their time between Britain and Canada and supporting themselves. “My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life as a young family,” the queen said in a statement after an extraordinary family meeting at her country home, Sandringham.  “Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family,” the queen said, “we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.” The strikingly personal statement did not answer a host of thorny questions, including who would pay for the couple’s upkeep, whether they could achieve financial independence without unacceptably commercializing the monarchy or even whether they will keep their royal titles, given the queen’s pointed use of their first names. But it was clearly calculated as a show of support and an exercise in damage control after the couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, abruptly announced a self-imposed exile from royal life. While the queen acknowledged the complexity of the issues involved, she made clear she wanted the crisis settled soon, saying she had asked for “final decisions to be reached in the coming days.” The statement came after one of the most-anticipated royal meetings in recent memory. The queen gathered her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, to hash out the arrangement, which could set a precedent for future generations of royals in a more streamlined royal family.  The British news media lost no time in breathlessly labeling the session the “Sandringham showdown” or “Sandringham summit,” depending on which tabloid one picked up — and dispatching TV crews to camp outside the gates of the 20,000-acre estate in Norfolk, where the queen spends the Christmas holidays. By whatever label, the queen’s gathering was a watershed moment in the life of the royal family, the capstone to a turbulent week in which, at times, the family appeared to be coming apart at the seams. “It’s as good an outcome as we could have hoped for,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “It’s the right decision under the circumstances.” By putting in place a transitional period, during which the duke and duchess can spend time in Britain and Canada, Ms. Junor said, Buckingham Palace may have wanted to give the couple space to make reasoned decisions — even, perhaps, to reconsider what officials at the palace viewed as a precipitous and ill-considered announcement.  “I suspect there is a hope that with the pressure released from them, they may change their minds and come back into the fold,” she said. Royal watchers said Buckingham Palace was also scrambling to regain control of the narrative, after days in which the palace seemed to be reacting to events and the news coverage grew ever more toxic, particularly about tensions between Harry and William. On Monday, representatives of both princes issued a statement denying a report in The Times of London that William’s “bullying” of Harry and Meghan had triggered their decision to step away from the royal family. The report cited “a source that knows the couple well.”  “Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a U.K. newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge,” the statement said, using the formal titles for the princes. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health,” the statement continued, “the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.” The report came hours after another anonymously sourced story, in The Times’s sister newspaper, The Sunday Times, portrayed William as frustrated but regretful about his brother’s tribulations. “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore; we’re separate entities,” William is said to have told a friend, according to The Sunday Times. “I’m sad about that,” he continued. “All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we’re all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the team.” The choice of Sandringham for the family meeting was freighted with history and symbolism. Unlike Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, which are owned by the state, Sandringham is owned personally by the queen, having been purchased in 1862 as a country house for the Prince of Wales. The estate, with its Jacobean-style gabled roofs, sprawling gardens, and tidal mud flats, has long been a favorite refuge for English monarchs. The queen’s grandfather, George V, described it as “dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world.” He died there in 1936. George VI, the queen’s father, died there in February 1952, while his daughter was away on a royal tour in Kenya. The queen now stays at Sandringham from before Christmas until February to mark the anniversary of his death and her accession to the throne. She plays host at a Christmas lunch at the house, which is one of a handful of times the entire royal family is together. Prince Harry and Meghan missed that gathering this year, having decided to spend the holiday in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning briefly with her husband to make their announcement, the duchess flew back to Canada last week to be with Archie, whom they had left with a friend. She had been expected to take part in the family meeting via conference call from Canada, people with ties to the palace said, but the palace did not confirm on Monday whether she did.  The British press has been scathing in its coverage of the couple, particularly the duchess, an American actress who was once celebrated here as a breath of fresh air for the stodgy House of Windsor. The tabloids took offense on behalf of the queen, saying she had been blindsided by the duke and duchess.

Ex-Judge Reveals Secrets of How Cuba Suppresses Dissent,2020-01-13,By Frances Robles,"['A former high-ranking judge in Cuba has joined an antigovernment activist in revealing information from secret government documents that show the government is holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest incarceration rate in the world. The revelations by Edel González Jiménez, who spent more than 15 years on the bench and once supervised 65 other judges, are believed to be the first public challenge to the Cuban government by a top member of the judiciary. “The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people,” he said during a news conference on Monday in Madrid, where he was joined by members of an organization that works on behalf of political prisoners in Cuba and by members of the European Parliament. “I have a lot of fear about the future. Every day Cubans face more fear. I don’t want blood on the streets of Cuba, I don’t want these imprisonments.”  Choking back tears, Mr. González told the audience that his wife had advised him not to speak out, but that he had gone against her wishes because he felt it was his duty to challenge the government. Mr. González said that Cuba’s judiciary was often controlled by state security forces that can manufacture cases against political opponents — a statement that critics will readily agree with, but that is surprising coming from a man who insisted that he remains a faithful member of the Communist Party of Cuba and a believer in Fidel Castro’s project. His avowed support of the government makes his words significantly troubling for a country that frequently paints dissidents as mercenaries on Washington’s payroll. “I am not looking for problems,” Mr. González, who left Cuba in 2018 and now lives in Peru, said in an earlier interview. “But I decided: Enough with cowardice.”  Mr. González was joined at the news conference by Javier Larrondo, a longtime anti-Castro activist who runs an organization called Prisoners Defenders in Madrid, in publicly announcing his call for the Cuban government to respect civil rights.  “This is an important blow to the regime,” Mr. Larrondo said. Documents reviewed by The New York Times showed that approximately 92 percent of those accused in the more than 32,000 cases that go to trial in Cuba every year are found guilty.  Nearly 4,000 people every year are accused of being “antisocial” or “dangerous,” terms the Cuban government uses to jail people who pose a risk to the status quo, without having a committed a crime. Such measures are often used against young black men to stifle potential social uprisings, said Orlando Gutiérrez, an activist in Miami. Those accused of being a threat are subjected to summary trials and have no right to a defense or to present evidence, Mr. González said. The records show that 99.5 percent of the people accused of this are found guilty. Mr. Larrondo released Cuban court documents showing that dozens of men received sentences between two and four years in prison for offenses falling broadly under the category of “antisocial” — a phrase that can be applied to people who are unemployed, do not belonging to civic organizations associated with the state, behave disorderly and harass tourists, and associate with similarly “antisocial” people. In case after case, the description of the crime is identical, suggesting that the police cut and pasted the language in the investigative report. Arianna López Roque, 29, said that when her husband, Mitzael Díaz Paseiro, was sentenced to three and a half years for being “dangerous” in Mr. González’s judicial district, the court was “completely militarized.” He was not permitted to have a defense lawyer and only members of his immediate family were allowed to attend. “The court in Cuba is manipulated by the dictatorship,” she said. “You don’t have the opportunity to defend yourself in any manner against what they say.” Mr. González said that in ordinary criminal cases, judges are independent and free of government influence. But he said that cases against dissidents like Mr. Díaz are orchestrated by the state security apparatus, because judges, fearful of losing their jobs, go along with evidence that is often flagrantly concocted, he said. The records show that Cuba’s prison system holds more than 90,000 prisoners. The Cuban government has only publicly released the figure once, in 2012, when it claimed that 57,000 people were jailed.  “What is important is what is behind those numbers,” Mr. González said. “People are in prison for stealing flour, because they are pizza makers and the government has set up a system where the only way to get flour is by buying in the black market from someone who stole it from the state.” Still, Mr. González insisted on Monday that there was time for Cuba to resolve its problems internally, and he warned against any outside interference. “We will not allow anybody to impose anything, that should be clear to all countries. Cubans can manage this alone without any kind of interference,” he said. Mr. González also cautioned against coming to the conclusion that the high number of prisoners in Cuba was proof of a failed society and judiciary. Other countries, he said, had fewer prisoners, but that reflected a high level of “impunity” and failure to prosecute common and violent crime, while Cuba instead “maintains social order.” Officials at the Cuban Embassy in Washington and the Cuban judiciary did not respond to requests for comment, as is customary. Eloy Viera Cañive, an independent legal analyst in Cuba, said the Communist Party and Ministry of Interior always have the last word in Cuba’s judiciary. “This is a police state, and the Ministry of Interior has a lot of influence, even on judges,” Mr. Viera said. “True independence is impossible.” Mr. González had a humble upbringing in Caibarién, a coastal town in central Cuba, where his mother was a restaurant cook and his father managed a government transportation warehouse. In 1973, his uncles were among 11 fishermen on state-owned vessels attacked at sea by anti-Castro fighters from abroad, who were trying to force the men to defect. The attackers set fire to the boats, killed one man, and cut the throat of one of his uncles, who survived, even after being left adrift to die. The episode marked the family, turning them against those who tried to topple the Cuban government. “We have always had a vocation of supporting the system,” he said.  After Fidel Castro fell ill in 2006, his brother Raúl Castro assumed the presidency. In a seismic shift for a country where hundreds of people have served long prison sentences for speaking out against the Communist Party, he organized community town halls and let it be known that Cubans were welcome to voice their opinions about vexing food shortages and other disappointments.  Although Raúl Castro stepped down from the presidency in 2018, he retained a great measure of control by remaining the head of Cuba’s Communist Party. That is, in part, why Mr. González is convinced that his announcement might actually be perceived as the kind of constructive criticism Raúl Castro encouraged.  Mario Félix Lleonart, a Baptist minister from the central province of Villa Clara who left Cuba as a political refugee in 2016, laughed out loud at the thought that Mr. González could return to his old job. The two met 20 years ago when the minister’s wife was a secretary at the civil courthouse, and Mr. González was assigned to find out more about her political activities. Mr. González was surprisingly respectful and professional, the minister recalled.  “Edel was a brilliant student of law and the government kept promoting him,” he said. “But as he continued rising, his curiosity rose too. He realized his country was not in order.” Last year, Mr. González’s former boss, Rubén Remigio Ferro, president of the Cuban Supreme Court, told the state newspaper, Granma that although the administration of justice on the island is improving, “deficiencies” still exist, such as trial delays, misguided decisions and a lack of professionalism. President Miguel Díaz-Canel told judges while inaugurating the new judicial calendar last week that the courts must “remain a system that is distinguished first and foremost by its ethics, its transparency and the honest behavior of its members.” Mr. González is betting that public criticism from someone who believes in the system the Castros built will trigger dialogue between longtime enemies of the Cuban government and loyal insiders who wish to see improvements in areas such as human rights. He also hopes, eventually, to return to the island, where his 14-year-old daughter lives, to reclaim his job in Villa Clara. “My wife says I’m too much of a dreamer,” Mr. González said. Raphael Minder contributed reporting.']","Edel González Jiménez says he is not a defector, but a firm believer in the Cuban system who wants to see it reformed. "
U.S. Rejects Extradition Request for Driver in Fatal U.K. Accident,2020-01-12,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The United States has rejected Britain’s request for the extradition of an American woman who fled the country after she was involved in an accident in which a teenager died last year. The State Department called the request “highly inappropriate,” deepening the diplomatic stalemate over the case. The woman, Anne Sacoolas, who is the wife of a former American diplomat, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December after the Northamptonshire Police suspected her of traveling on the wrong side of the road.  The authorities said she was behind the wheel when her car collided with the motorcycle ridden by Harry Dunn, 19, in August in Brackley, a town about 60 miles northwest of London and close to a Royal Air Force base that hosts a United States Air Force communication station. [Update: U.S. refuses extradition in fatal crash, prompting anger in the U.K.] As the police sought to question Ms. Sacoolas, who was 42 at the time, she fled the country, spurring a diplomatic tug of war between Britain and the United States and enraging Mr. Dunn’s relatives. A campaign by his parents seeking her return to Britain has led them all the way to the White House. The British authorities began extradition proceedings in December, soon after the Crown Prosecution Service authorized the police to charge Ms. Sacoolas. The request from Britain for the United States to send her back to face charges was announced by the Home Office on Friday.  In an email on Saturday, the State Department called it “highly inappropriate” because of Ms. Sacoolas’s diplomatic status at the time of the crash as the wife of an American diplomat.  The State Department said that it would continue looking for “options moving forward,” but that an extradition request for “an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse.”  Amy Jeffress, Ms. Sacoolas’s lawyer, said Friday, “Anne is devastated by this tragic accident and would do anything she could to bring Harry back.” She added that the United States government had made clear it would not extradite her client because of diplomatic immunity, saying, “We remain willing to work with the U.K. authorities to identify a path forward.” Mr. Dunn’s family welcomed the British government’s request for Ms. Sacoolas’s extradition, however, calling it an “important development,” Radd Seiger, their spokesman, said in an email on Sunday.  “Despite the unwelcome public comments currently emanating from the U.S. administration that Anne Sacoolas will never be returned, Harry’s parents, as victims, will simply look forward to the legal process unfolding, as it must now do confident in the knowledge that the rule of law will be upheld,” Mr. Seiger said. He added that “no one, whether diplomat or otherwise, is above the law.” Mr. Seiger, who was in the United States as part of the family’s Justice for Harry campaign, said the family was used “to treating anything that the Trump administration says publicly with a pinch of salt.” In October, President Trump stunned Mr. Dunn’s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, when he invited them to the Oval Office for a meeting. Fifteen minutes into their meeting, he told them that Ms. Sacoolas was waiting in a room nearby and wanted to meet with them, they said. They declined. Mr. Trump has described the crash as “a terrible accident,” but suggested that it would be difficult for Americans driving on the opposite side of the road in Britain. “You know those are the opposite roads, that happens,” he said. “I won’t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to driving on our system, and then you’re all of a sudden on the other system when you’re driving, it happens.” Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington.']","The State Department called the request for Anne Sacoolas, whose husband was working as an American diplomat in Britain, “highly inappropriate.”"
A Distant Missile Strike Spreads Grief Across Canada,2020-01-11,By Ian Austen,"['Like most Canadians, when I saw the first bulletins about a jetliner going down near Tehran’s airport, I had no inkling that the tragedy would reach Canada in a significant way. But it has been hard felt, particularly in Edmonton, from where I’m writing this week’s Canada Letter. The city, its comparatively small Iranian community and the University of Alberta are bearing an extraordinary share of the grieving. At least 27 people from Edmonton, and at least 10 of them connected to the university, died after Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was apparently struck by an Iranian missile in what is believed to have been an accident. A total of 57 Canadians were among the 176 passengers and crew who perished. (The figure was revised Friday evening from 63.) [Read: Iranian Missile Accidentally Brought Down Ukrainian Jet, Officials Say, Citing Early Evidence] That grim count may even understate how Canada has been affected.

[Read: Civilian Planes Shot Down: A Grim History] Mr. Trudeau is demanding that Canada be part of the investigation to ensure that its findings are honest. As I write this, Iran has rejected that it’s to blame. The history of relations between Canada and Iran could also complicate matters.  Canada and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 2012. John Baird, then the foreign minister in the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, cited several reasons for the rupture. They include an attack by a mob on the British embassy in Tehran the previous year, Iran’s support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, its noncompliance with United Nations resolutions on its nuclear program and the country’s human rights record. Mr. Baird also said Iran “routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide.” When Canada pulled out of Iran in 2012, it didn’t have an ambassador to send home from Tehran because Iran had expelled Canada’s representative in 2007. While no reason was given, it was widely believed to be linked to Canada’s strong protests against the killing of Zahra Kazemi, a photojournalist, in an Iranian prison in 2003. Ms. Kazemi was a citizen of both Canada and Iran. This was not the first break in relations. Most famously, Canada shut its mission in Tehran in 1980, after Kenneth D. Taylor, the Canadian ambassador, helped shelter six Americans who fled the United States embassy after it was overrun by Iranian militants the previous year. Along with John Sheardown, the chief immigration officer, who also sheltered some of the Americans, Mr. Taylor issued Canadian passports to the Americans and safely slipped then out of Iran by saying they were a film crew from Canada. Mr. Trudeau took office in 2015 promising to renew relations with Iran. While the relationship thawed somewhat, it never reached the stage of reopening embassies in the two capitals. That step seems even further off now. And as my colleague Dan Bilefsky wrote, this week’s tragedy may also challenge relations between Canada and the United States. [Read: Evidence That Plane Was Shot Down in Iran May Upset U.S.-Canada Relations] While Mr. Trudeau did not blame President Trump for the downing of the Ukrainian airliner, some Canadians and some of Mr. Trump’s political opponents in Washington are arguing that he may bear some responsibility for creating a volatile situation. My report about Edmonton won’t be published in time for this edition of the newsletter. But I’ve found that, at least for now, Alberta’s capital is more focused on getting through its grief than assigning blame. Amber Bracken, a photojournalist based in Edmonton, went to far northern Quebec to tell the story of a program that has returned control of childbirth to its Inuit communities while improving the health outcomes for newborns.

"France Summons African Leaders, Threatening Troop Pullout",2020-01-12,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — France has called five African presidents to a meeting on Monday to disavow rising anti-French hostility in their countries, work out how to stop the rapid advance of armed Islamist extremists in their region and determine whether France will remain deeply engaged in that fight. France could withdraw its 4,500 soldiers, President Emmanuel Macron has said, if the leaders of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania do not answer questions to his satisfaction. That warning came as the United States also considers pulling troops from the region. Many analysts say the French and Americans are making empty threats when they talk about leaving the Sahel, a semiarid area stretching more than 2,000 miles across West and Central Africa that is plagued by violent groups loosely affiliated with the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. But their warnings illustrate the allied nations’ frustration with extremist gains, and with one another. France, the five countries’ former colonial ruler, initially intervened in 2013 to oust rebels and Islamist militants who had taken control of northern Mali in the wake of Libya’s descent into chaos. The militants regrouped, and now extremist-related violence is rising fast, doubling every year since 2015. Mali suffers attack after attack. This month children were killed in Burkina Faso when their school bus ran over a roadside bomb, the latest in a long list of recent deadly episodes in that country. Seventy-one soldiers died last month in Niger’s deadliest ever attack on a military camp. “The militants have got the upper hand,” said Héni Nsaibia, a researcher at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nonprofit organization. On the other side, the national armies fighting these militants — trained and funded by France, the United States and the European Union — have themselves committed grave atrocities. Ethnic militias, some with government support, carry out massacres, which have pushed more people into the militants’ arms. However, many people in these countries increasingly blame the French. Urban Malians are demanding the departure of Operation Barkhane, the French counterterrorism force, while protesters in the capital, Bamako, chant slogans against France and have burned the French flag.  Demonstrations have also taken place in neighboring Niger, where France and the United States have military bases, and in Burkina Faso, where their footprint is much lighter, but where violent attacks on civilians and soldiers have prompted France to intervene in the past year. At the summit meeting on Monday in Pau, a town in southern France, Mr. Macron has said he will be asking the African nations, known as the G5 Sahel countries, to clarify their governments’ stances on both the French presence and those who oppose it. “I can’t have French troops on the ground in the Sahel when there is ambiguity toward anti-French movements and sometimes comments made by politicians and ministers,” he said on a trip to Britain in early December, adding that whether France stayed would depend on the presidents’ responses to his concerns. Most analysts think Mr. Macron is unlikely to make good on his threat to leave, and French officials say privately that they expect to be in the region indefinitely. Mr. Macron’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, is seen as being firmly invested in the French intervention, which he first drove as defense minister under the previous president, François Hollande. French troops have been killed in Operation Barkhane, including 13 in a helicopter crash in November, and two who died in May while rescuing hostages held by militants. But the overall toll has not risen enough to spur demands from the French public that the soldiers be brought home. If it happened, a French withdrawal would have a far greater impact than an American one, as France has a far greater presence in these nations.  Without Barkhane, countries would collapse in on themselves, causing uncontrolled terrorism and hugely increased migration to Europe, Gen. François Lecointre, head of France’s armed forces, told CNEWS, a television channel, in July. But some experts say that these threats are much exaggerated, and that pulling out could force the region’s elite to find political and social solutions to a crisis entangled in disputes over access to land and resources. “It’s they who have the solutions, not the French,” said Marc-Antoine Pérouse de Montclos, a French political scientist specializing in Africa. How contrite the African leaders are willing to be with Mr. Macron is not just a matter of pride and posturing, but of retaining power. They will be carefully calibrating what they say publicly, and what they say to the French in private. In effect, critics say France is helping shore up governments that lack confidence in their own armies, either doubting their ability to fight extremists or worrying about the possibility of military coups. Yet the presidents also have to satisfy voters unhappy with the presence of the former colonial power. The president of Burkina Faso, Roch Marc Kaboré, hit back at Mr. Macron’s “summons” to Pau, where the official agenda includes seeking more international support for Sahel countries and reassessing France’s role there. Calling for mutual respect, Mr. Kaboré, who plans to run for re-election in November, said in a televised address last month that the “tone and the terms” used posed problems. When France sent troops to Mali seven years ago, officials argued that if they did not intervene, Mali would become another Afghanistan. French ministers still present their fight in the region as a crucial piece of the global war against terrorism.  But none of the militant groups in the Sahel have ever carried out attacks outside the region and, with weak links to the international terrorist groups they pledge allegiance to, they seem more focused on local disputes. Mr. Pérouse de Montclos, the French author of “Une Guerre Perdue: France Au Sahel” (“A Lost War: France in the Sahel”) said France would be better off getting out. “The official narrative is that we are fighting terrorist groups, but actually we are protecting corrupt regimes, and some of them are quite authoritarian,” he said. “This foreign military presence is also used as a kind of a life insurance for these regimes.” Mr. Macron should use the opportunity to announce the end of a mission that was never meant to last this long, Mr. Pérouse de Montclos said, forcing the Sahel leaders to handle the situation. At the moment, however, these leaders have other priorities. Burkinabe politicians are “all focused on the election” rather than protecting citizens from further suffering, said Mahamoudou Savadogo, a researcher working on violent extremism in the Sahel. The human cost of failing to resolve the crisis is heavy. In Burkina Faso, more than half a million people have fled their homes because of the violence.  A report released last week by Human Rights Watch documented Islamist groups’ killing of more than 250 civilians in nine months there, including several dozen in a camp in Arbinda, where one witness survived by hiding behind a clay stove while 22 of her neighbors were killed. “Two terrorists opened my door but didn’t see me. Then they entered my neighbor’s hut, killing her,” the report quoted her as saying. “They argued about whether to kill her baby … but eventually shot him.” Adam Nossiter contributed reporting from Paris.']","Facing hostility in five former colonies over a stalled fight against extremists, President Emmanuel Macron has taken a harsh public stance.

Plane Crash Leaves Iranian Diaspora in Canada Grief-Stricken,2020-01-11,By Ian Austen,"['EDMONTON, Alberta — The fume hoods in the lab set up by Saba Saadat were silent on Friday, its computers and microscopes switched off. Sobs occasionally punctuated the silence. Prof. Meghan Riddell, the leader of the cell biology lab, comforted a weeping student while two teary-eyed technicians stood by. Ms. Saadat, a biology student, had been one of the most promising students at the University of Alberta.  “She was a Ph.D. disguised as an undergraduate,” said Professor Riddell, herself in tears. “That girl could think.” Ms. Saadat was among the 176 people who died when a flight leaving the Iranian capital, Tehran, bound for Ukraine crashed on Wednesday. Also killed were her sister, a recent graduate in psychology who was heading to graduate school, and their mother, an obstetrician and gynecologist. In all, 57 Canadians died and a number of other victims appear to have been Iranian students studying in Canada.  Although the crash has spread grief throughout the Iranian diaspora in Canada, the tragedy has disproportionately struck the city of Edmonton, capital of the oil-rich province of Alberta. About 27 residents of Edmonton were on board the airliner, and at least 10 of them were, like Ms. Saadat, students or faculty at the University of Alberta. The anguish has only been deepened by evidence that it was an Iranian missile that brought down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. Reminders of the losses were everywhere as the university’s sports center was readied for a public memorial service on Sunday. Flowers, chocolates, photographs and candles were set outside the offices of the faculty members who perished, in departments where students studied and on the steps of Alberta’s sandstone legislature.  Flags have been lowered throughout the city of just under one million people. A railway bridge spanning a deep river valley that defines Edmonton geographically has been lit with red and white lights — the colors of the Canadian flag — in memorial. In this multicultural nation, Iranians are comparative newcomers: Most arrived after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Today, by some counts, Canada has the third-largest number of expatriate Iranians in the world and its universities are a top destination for Iranian graduate students. Iranian-Canadians are an accomplished group academically and professionally. In Edmonton, as across Canada, they include physicians, dentists, engineers and academics. “It’s a gift to Canada, and you know what, it’s the regime’s loss in Iran,” said Payman Parseyan, the past president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, speaking of the contributions the immigrants have made to Canada. “They’ve suppressed the people, the people are upset with the government and so they leave. The best minds learn to get out.” Mr. Parseyan, a 30-year-old former municipal police officer who now inspects oil and gas line construction, refers to himself as Persian rather than Iranian to distance himself from the government in power in his homeland.  His parents, both geologists, brought Mr. Parseyan to Canada when he was 8, along with his two siblings. After briefly staying with distant relatives in Toronto, they took a four-day train trip to Edmonton, a city about which they knew nothing. He acknowledged that for most Iranians looking to leave, Canada is a second choice after the United States as the preferred destination. The frigid weather, particularly in Edmonton, can be a deterrent.  Perhaps in reaction to the theocracy that rules Iran, Mr. Parseyan said that most Iranians in Edmonton are secular. The heritage society, a volunteer group, generally brings them together around Iranian holidays as well as for Edmonton’s annual ethnic festival, a major event in a city of many nationalities.  In a suburban shopping center featuring food from Japan, Taiwan, India, Pakistan and Korea, Mahnuash Jannesar, the co-owner of the Persia Palace, a combined grocery and restaurant, said that as photos of the victims began appearing in the news media, she recognized about half of them as customers.  While she hadn’t been aware of the names of many of them before their deaths, she did know Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, two regular customers who were professors of engineering and who died in the crash with their two children. It was the loss of the students who came to her shop that most grieved Ms. Jannesar, she said.  “They came to Canada for a future; there is no future in Iran,” she said. “It’s so sad.” At the silenced university lab, Professor Riddell said that Ms. Saadat was so knowledgeable and capable that she relied on her to supervise the work of graduate students who were passing through. Their last exchanges by email were mainly over Ms. Saadat’s application for medical school. Now, Professor Riddell is turning her attention to presenting a paper Ms. Saadat had planned to deliver to an academic conference next month. “The data stays forever, and the data leads to the next project,” Professor Riddell said.  Reza Akbari, the current president of the heritage society, paused as he considered how some of the victims were like himself 15 years ago: teenagers or people in their early 20s leaving Iran to study in Canada and begin a new life. His voice rose with anger when he recalled seeing the first passenger lists and finding the names of friends on it. Crying for what he said was the first time since the news of the plane’s destruction, he contrasted Iran’s lack of any statement of sympathy for the victims with the national outpouring of consolation from Canadians. “There hasn’t been a single condolence sent or acknowledgment, a single message from any government officials of Iran. It’s like: come on, guys. These are people,” said Mr. Akbari, who is a sales representative for Diageo, the spirits and beer conglomerate.  “After this incident happened,” he added, “the amount of support we’ve seen from Canada versus our motherland is something collectively as Canadians we can be proud of. As an Iranian, I’m sad.”']","Of the 176 victims, 57 Canadians died on the flight that crashed on its way from Tehran to Ukraine.

"A New Home for French Socialists, on Paris’s Periphery",2020-01-12,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['IVRY-SUR-SEINE, France — Maybe it was the equivalent of moving from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Queens or Staten Island or even New Jersey. For decades, the headquarters of the Socialist Party, which held France’s presidency until just a couple of years ago, was ensconced in the heart of Paris — a stroll to the nation’s top schools; the Orsay and Louvre museums; the National Assembly and, across the Seine, the Élysée Palace. A constellation of Michelin-starred restaurants shined from every direction. Today, its new home, in a converted pharmaceutical factory, shares a block with a scrap metal dealer and a beverage wholesaler, just behind the railroad tracks of the commuter transit system that services the “banlieue,’’ or suburb, of Ivry-sur-Seine. A party stalwart grumbled that his “GPS couldn’t find the street,” but even some locals seemed lost. “Really?” Kamrul Islam said when informed that France’s Socialist Party was a two-minute walk from his Hawaiian-style poke bowl restaurant, adding that he was less interested in politics than food. “Before it was tacos in France, now it is time for poke. I don’t know how many years we’re going to survive with the poke bowls. But we’re not going to change anything until we see it is bad.” For years, the Socialist Party survived on a poke bowl of increasingly free-market economics and liberal social policies, but did not change despite growing popular discontent with the two-party system in which it had secured a comfortable spot. Mirroring the decline of Social Democrats across Europe, France’s Socialists failed to capitalize on anger over globalization and rising inequality, ceding those issues especially to far-right populists.  Since 2017, the Socialist Party has suffered a series of electoral defeats so disastrous that its very survival remains in doubt. The biggest beneficiary, of course, has been President Emmanuel Macron himself, a former investment banker and brief interloper with Socialists before he jettisoned them in 2017 to create his own centrist party. But since then, Mr. Macron, too, has struggled to connect with the working-class voters who used to form the core of Socialist supporters. Instead he has earned a reputation as the president of the rich and faced the wrath of the Yellow Vest movement in a country of widening social cleavages. Some Socialists say those failings still leave them an opening. The optimists cast the party’s move from Paris’s Seventh Arrondissement a year ago because of financial constraints not as a retreat but as a chance at rebirth — an opportunity to shed their image of being limousine liberals and the “gauche caviar.”  Their new home in Ivry-sur-Seine, an eastern, working-class suburb, gentrifying in pockets, which remains a stronghold of the French Communist Party, represented that aspiration, they say. “The symbol we sought was to be able to say that we are, once again, among those we’re called to represent,” said Olivier Faure, the party’s secretary general, adding that the party’s former supporters had “sometimes felt abandoned once we were in power.” In an interview in his glass-walled office, Mr. Faure, 51, unfurled a map to bring back his party to relevance. He said his party would focus on the destructive effects of globalization and free markets on people and the environment. Just as his party had represented workers in the past, it needed to address the needs of those toiling in an “Uberized economy,” who “in reality are slaves of algorithms and management methods that are extremely brutal.” Like all parties in France, from the extreme left to the extreme right, the Socialists were keenly aware of the rising importance of the environment as an electoral issue. To Mr. Faure, the biggest victims of climate change were globalization’s losers, and his party must make it its mission to defend them. Focusing on these issues, he said, would lead to “the renewal of social democrats on one condition — that they integrate these changes into their vision and become once again a disruptive force, and not simply the nice guides of the free-market revolution.” It was during the tenure of the last Socialist president, François Hollande, who served from 2012 to 2017, that there was a “break” between the party and its working-class supporters, Mr. Faure said. The party’s traditional base “felt betrayed” by Mr. Hollande’s business-friendly policies — Mr. Macron was a senior adviser, then economy minister — and especially a labor law that made it easier to hire and fire people, he added. The party’s push on socially liberal issues, like gay marriage, made it better known as the choice of the urban “bobo,” or bohemian bourgeois. The Socialists slipped into an “intellectual laziness” abetted by France’s two-party system, which pitted the left against the right, he said. They failed to realize that “gradually there were many French who were switching off and who no longer saw a place on the right or on the left.” Today, with the Socialists in disarray, France’s dominant parties are instead Mr. Macron’s La République en Marche and the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. But the Socialists are not alone in their pain. What happened to them has occurred elsewhere in Europe — Germany, Italy and increasingly even in Britain, where Social Democrats and the Labour party had dominated after the end of the Cold War, but steadily slipped into crisis. “They failed to grasp the consequences of globalization,” said Alain Bergounioux, a historian who is an expert on Socialism. Today, he added, the party’s place in the nation’s political spectrum has shrunk: Many working-class voters drifted to the extreme right, while Mr. Macron and the ascendant Greens were grabbing left-leaning middle-class voters. Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, who served as the party’s secretary general between 2014 and 2017, said that to regain relevance France’s left would need to undergo a more radical makeover, with the Socialists establishing formal ties with ideological allies.  A new party on the left would succeed only by offering a new vision that, he said, should focus on fighting for the “integrity of the individual’’ facing bewildering changes, like climate change, the digital economy and medical revolutions. “It’s not the concept of workers’ emancipation from the 1960s,” he said, “but one that says that, in our age of revolutions, the integrity of human beings must be defended.” The future seemed limitless when the party moved into its old headquarters — at 10 rue de Solférino in the Seventh Arrondissement — months before the Socialists won the presidency for the first time, with François Mitterrand in 1981. Back then, the choice of location had a different message: “To show that the left was ready to govern,” Mr. Faure said. Not that there weren’t critics. For a party devoted to defending the working class, an address in one of the capital’s richest neighborhoods sounded dissonant.  There was also the building’s inconvenient past: a vast M-shaped building once owned by a princess who was known for holding one of Paris’s most sought-after salons and for keeping a pet elephant. Its sale by the party, to a French developer, brought nearly 46 million euros, or about $51 million, which it used to pay off debts and buy its new headquarters for €7 million, renovations included. Many party officials grumbled openly about the move. Julien Dray, a legendary party fixer whose exploits have been the basis of the hit series, “Baron Noir,” told the French media that his “GPS couldn’t find the street” where the new headquarters is. “It’s true,” Mr. Dray said in a recent interview in Paris. He added: “We panicked and rushed to sell to reduce costs. But symbolically that hurt us a lot. It gave the impression that the Socialist Party didn’t believe in itself.” Mr. Cambadélis, the former leader who was behind the sale of the former headquarters, said there was no other option. He said he would have preferred moving to a more modest area at least within Paris. Many party members were depressed that their new home was just outside the highway ringing Paris, called Périphérique, he said. “We were becoming peripheral,” he said. In Ivry-sur-Seine, the party still appeared to be searching for its place in a banlieue undergoing change. A housing project that once symbolized the power of French Communists was being demolished.  But the Communists were still in charge and, during lunch on a recent Thursday, its local leaders huddled at a corner table at O’Papillon, a fancy restaurant a block from the new Socialist headquarters. So far, the Socialists have kept a low profile in their new neighborhood, according to many locals, who said they saw very little foot traffic in and out of the new headquarters. “The Socialists are in a very bobo part of Ivry, with a lot of artist lofts,” said Benjamin Gozlan, a painter and illustrator who was born in and still lives in Ivry-sur-Seine. “They held a reception after they moved in. But they really haven’t made any waves.”']","Short of cash, the Socialist Party has moved its headquarters from a Parisian mansion once owned by a princess to a converted factory in the suburbs."
British Police Said Watch Out for Extremists — Like Climate Activists,2020-01-13,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Be on the lookout, the British counterterrorism police warned, for young people being radicalized by extremists like neo-Nazis, militant Islamists, Satanists, white supremacists — and climate-change activists. The counterterrorism police reversed course soon after it came to light that they had published a brochure that lumped the group Extinction Rebellion, not to mention animal rights activists, together with terrorist organizations, retracting the document. But on Monday, a top government official refused to find fault with it. “Everything has to be based in terms of risk to the public, security risks, security threats, and that is based on information from the police and various intelligence that we all receive,” Priti Patel, the home secretary, said in an interview with LBC radio.  “That’s the proper thing to do,” said Ms. Patel, one of the farthest-right members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet. “You develop your policing approach accordingly.” Asked whether she believed that Extinction Rebellion was a terrorist organization, the home secretary did say, however, “No, they’re obviously a protest organization.” Extinction Rebellion has held many demonstrations around the world, defying bans on protesting in central London and elsewhere, and annoying countless commuters, business owners, customers and, yes, police officers. But it advocates nonviolent civil disobedience, not terrorism, attempting, in its own words, “to halt mass extinction and minimize the risk of social collapse.” The 12-page brochure on extremism was produced by an arm of Counter Terrorism Policing, a national alliance of police forces, that covers southeastern England, the region that includes London. It was brought to light by The Guardian on Friday and it has since been recalled, the Guardian reported on Sunday.  On Monday, a spokeswoman for Ms. Patel said: “As the Home Secretary said, Extinction Rebellion is not an extremist group. The police have said that inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in the guidance was an error and it will be reviewed.” The brochure, said its goal was to help the public “recognize when young people or adults may be vulnerable to extreme or violent ideologies,” whether a person is “vulnerable to extremism,” and if that person should be referred to the government’s Prevent program. The program tries to keep people from “being drawn into terrorism.” For each group or movement it identified, the brochure asked “Why are they a threat?” For Extinction Rebellion, it answered: “An anti-establishment philosophy that seeks system change underlies its activism; the group attracts to its events school-age children and adults unlikely to be aware of this. While nonviolent against persons, the campaign encourages other lawbreaking activities.” The brochure adds: “While concern about climate change is not in itself extreme, activists may encourage vulnerable people to perform acts of violence, or commit such acts themselves.” It is not clear what that refers to. Extinction Rebellion advocates civil disobedience, leading to arrests for disruption, not destruction. Last April, some of its members stripped down in the visitors’ gallery in Parliament and glued their bare backsides to the bulletproof glass separating them from the startled lawmakers. Eight activists affiliated with the group were arrested in October on suspicion of obstructing trains after they suspended some underground lines in London by gluing themselves to trains or walking on top of them, enraging morning commuters.  The subway action was one of many during a two-week streak of the organization’s protests in London in which more than 1,400 activists arrested after, among other actions, shutting down roads and bridges around Parliament. The Metropolitan Police were heavily criticized after announcing a ban on the organization’s protests in the center of the capital — which Extinction Rebellion later defied.  “After nine days of disruption, we felt it is entirely proportionate and reasonable to impose this condition because of the cumulative impact of these protests,” Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said in a statement in October.  The counterterrorism police guide included assorted white power groups, “extreme Satanism” and Al Muhajiroun, “a proscribed terrorist group seeking the establishment of an Islamic State and Shariah law in the U.K.” In addition to Extinction Rebellion, it listed “animal rights extremism,” warning of people who watch “animal liberation” videos, and who strongly oppose wearing fur, hunting foxes and eating meat. The guide said that “activists may encourage vulnerable people to perform acts of violence, or commit such acts themselves.” But there was less reaction to that part of the brochure than to the inclusion of Extinction Rebellion, which was received with indignation and disbelief.  “How dare they,” Extinction Rebellion said in a statement. “Wouldn’t it be nice if they focused on the real extremists, the fossil fuel companies and those that do their bidding.”  Rob Cooper, former chief superintendent of police in the counties of Devon and Cornwall, said in a statement that he found it “astonishing that police in the Southeast of England regarded Extinction Rebellion as an extremist group.” Kath Barnes, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, which released the document, quickly disavowed it. “We do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organization,” she said in a statement. “The inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in this document was an error of judgment and we will now be reviewing all of the contents as a result.” The document also included Animal Rights Extremism as a threat, saying that while animal welfare concern “is not in itself extreme,” acts of violence might be committed or encouraged by activists who are “increasingly targeting a younger, more health-conscious audience for recruitment.”']",The counterterrorism police quickly disavowed a brochure grouping Extinction Rebellion with militant white supremacists and Islamists.

American Held in Egypt Prison Dies After a Hunger Strike,2020-01-13,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — An American imprisoned in Egypt for six years on what he insisted were false charges, and whose case had been championed by Vice President Mike Pence, died on Monday after a long hunger strike, the State Department said. Moustafa Kassem, 54, a dual Egyptian-American citizen from New York, was arrested in central Cairo in August 2013 during a bloody crackdown following the military takeover that brought to power Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, then an army general and now the president of Egypt.  Mr. Kassem insisted he had no links to opposition politics and had been wrongfully detained by Egyptian soldiers who snatched his American passport and stomped it on the ground. After years in dire conditions at a high-security prison, where he said his diabetes and a heart ailment went largely untreated, he was sentenced to 15 years in September 2018.  Soon after that, Mr. Kassem went on the first of several hunger strikes, refusing solid food for months on end to protest what he called his unjust imprisonment.  “Moustafa was as apolitical as it gets,” said Mohamed Soltan, an Egyptian-American human rights campaigner who spent four months in prison with Mr. Kassem, and was released in 2015. “He was just a bystander who got picked up\xa0— wrong place, wrong time. It’s ridiculous that he has died.” Tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned on political charges in Egypt since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2013, including at least seven Americans currently being held. Mr. Kassem was the first of these Americans to die in custody. The death last year of Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected president ousted by Mr. el-Sisi who collapsed in court after years of ill health, brought fresh attention to persistent accusations of gross medical negligence by Egypt’s prison authorities. Mr. Kassem was transferred to a hospital in central Cairo last Friday after he began to refuse to take liquids, said Mr. Soltan, who works for the Freedom Initiative, a prisoners’ rights group that represented Mr. Kassem. He died Monday afternoon, leaving behind a wife and two children.  His case had been a focus at the top levels of the Trump administration. On a trip to Cairo in September 2018, Mr. Pence pressed his case with Mr. el-Sisi, as well as that of another imprisoned American, Ahmed Etiwy.  Mr. el-Sisi promised to give “very serious attention” to the matter, Mr. Pence told reporters, “I told him we’d like to see those American citizens restored to their families and restored to our country,” the vice president said.  Egypt is the second-biggest recipient of United States military aid after Israel, receiving $1.3 billion a year. Mr. Trump has regularly lavished praise on Mr. el-Sisi, hailing him for doing a “fantastic job” and calling him “my favorite dictator,” even as the Egyptian leader has overseen Egypt’s harshest crackdown on freedom of speech and political opposition in decades.  For years, Mr. Kassem pinned his hopes for release on the hope that American officials could use that aid leverage to obtain his freedom. But he became disillusioned, relatives said.  “Moustafa saw his blue passport as a shield, his bulletproof armor, which carried the protection and the force of the United States government behind it,” his brother, Mustafa Ahmed, wrote in an article for The New York Times in October 2018. In April 2017, Mr. Trump pressed the Egyptians to release Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker imprisoned in Egypt. She was quickly brought to the White House amid considerable fanfare. The following year, days after he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment along with 700 other defendants, Mr. Kassem wrote to Mr. Trump to petition him for help.  “Like you, I’m from New York,” he said in the handwritten letter, which was smuggled out of the maximum security Tora prison. “I am going on hunger strike knowing full well that I may not survive it,” he wrote.  The letter finished: “I am putting my life in your hands.” The Working Group on Egypt, a bipartisan group of foreign affairs experts, raised Mr. Kassem’s case in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June, warning that he was a diabetic with a heart condition who was in imminent danger of death.  Mr. Pompeo responded that the well-being of detained American citizens was a “top priority” for him.  “I am deeply saddened to learn today the death of U.S. citizen Moustafa Kassem who’d been imprisoned in Egypt,” the State Department’s assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, David Schenker, said at a Monday news briefing. “His death in custody was needless, tragic and avoidable.”  The issue of medical negligence in Egyptian prisons came to the fore last June, when Mr. Morsi collapsed in a soundproof cage during a legal hearing and died. Mr. Morsi’s family, who had complained for years about inadequate medical treatment in prison, blamed Mr. el-Sisi for his death.  The death put pressure on the Egyptian authorities to improve conditions in prisons, and in November they led foreign reporters on a stage-managed tour of the Tora prison complex south of Cairo, where many political prisoners are held. Prisoner advocacy groups say that in reality little has changed.  In August,  Human Rights Watch said that Khaled Hassan, an Egyptian-American limousine driver imprisoned on terrorism charges, had tried to kill himself in his cell.  On Monday, the Egyptian National Action Group, an opposition group, said that over 300 detainees in the maximum security wing of Tora prison had been on hunger strike since Jan. 5, when a 47-year-old inmate died in detention because of inadequate medical care.']","Moustafa Kassem, detained in Cairo in 2013 and suffering from serious medical problems, had protested his innocence.

"Fire in Bound Brook, N.J., Destroys New Luxury Complex",2020-01-13,By Tiffany May,"['An enormous fire on Sunday engulfed several buildings in Bound Brook, N.J., sowing panic as tall plumes of smoke shot into the air. No injuries were reported, but the fierce blaze set off multiple alarms, and Doppler radars detected a shift in weather patterns as a result of the smoke. Residents were also able to see the flames from a distance. Bound Brook, a borough in Somerset County with a population of about 10,000 people, has been experiencing a building boom, with new downtown developments going up in the wake of the completion of a flood-control project. The low-lying area had been hit by heavy flooding in recent decades, including in 1999, when Hurricane Floyd left Main Street under 12 feet of water and sent about a third of the city’s residents to emergency shelters. One building struck by the overnight fire was part of Meridia, a new luxury complex with residential units and retail space. The fire then spread to another residential complex under construction, as well as at least two houses and a store. The Bound Brook police warned on Facebook that the fire might spread farther because it was so difficult to contain.  The blaze caused NJ Transit to suspend service on the Raritan Valley Line in both directions, and the agency  said on Twitter that train service could remain suspended during the morning commute. Bus service was being provided to the affected communities. Another apartment fire in the community last summer injured a building superintendent and displaced more than a dozen tenants.   ']","The blaze, which spread to several other buildings, sowed panic in the downtown area and led transit officials to curtail train service."
"Death Sentence Overturned for Pervez Musharraf, Ex-Leader of Pakistan",2020-01-13,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani high court on Monday overturned a death sentence that was handed down to Pervez Musharraf in a treason trial last month, most likely putting an end to the legal case against the country’s former military dictator. Monday’s ruling, by a three-member bench of the High Court, found that the special court that issued the sentence was unconstitutional. Several lawyers and analysts said that the current government, which includes many Musharraf loyalists, was unlikely to reconstitute the special court for a new trial. The three judges, in the eastern city of Lahore, said that the case against Mr. Musharraf was politically motivated and that the crimes he was accused of committing —\xa0high treason and subverting the Constitution — were “a joint offense” that “cannot be undertaken by a single person.” Mr. Musharraf, 76, was accused of subverting the country’s Constitution in 2007 when he fired much of the judiciary and imposed a state of emergency in an attempt to block a political opposition movement. The movement had greatly weakened him, and he resigned the following year under a threat of impeachment. Even when originally announced in December, the death sentence was largely seen as symbolic —\xa0the first time in the country’s history that a former military ruler had been held accountable for actions taken while in office. It was not expected to be carried out in a country where the military, which still wields immense power, was expected to protect its former chief. Soon after the death sentence was announced, the Pakistani Army criticized the verdict and called for a legal review. Mr. Musharraf’s legal team challenged the sentence in the Lahore High Court this month. The treason trial was initiated in 2013 by the prime minister at the time, Nawaz Sharif, whose earlier government Mr. Musharraf had toppled in a bloodless coup. Mr. Musharraf —\xa0who is now in Dubai in a self-imposed exile —\xa0claimed that the charges against him were politically motivated.  Mr. Musharraf also maintained that he was not alone in the imposition of the state of emergency in 2007 and had been aided by senior government and military officials.  He did not appear in the initial proceedings of the treason case, and his security convoy was mysteriously directed to a military hospital before one 2014 hearing. Despite his complaints of chest pains, many believed that the military was protecting him from prosecution. He was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment in 2016, and although he vowed to return and face the legal cases, he did not do so. The death sentence announced in December was handed down in absentia.']",A panel of judges ruled that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and that the crime he was accused of could not be “undertaken by a single person.”
Could ‘Megxit’ Be a Royal Fairy Tale for Canada?,2020-01-11,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Some have suggested they could become king and queen of Canada. Tim Hortons, the quintessentially Canadian coffee chain, offered them “free coffee for life.” Others recommended Ottawa, the nation’s sleepy capital, as a possible home, noting that, if they squinted hard enough, they could pretend the Parliament buildings were palaces. Prince Harry and his wife, the former Meghan Markle, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, electrified the world this week with their announcement that they planned to step back from official royal duties and live part-time in North America.  But even before they have revealed which country they would like to make home, many Canadians were already giddy at the prospect they could be moving to Canada — part of the loose federation of nations known as the British Commonwealth — and injecting some glamour into the sprawling, bone-chillingly cold country. It is “the fairy tale ending we all deserve,” Anne T. Donahue, a Toronto-based writer, gushed in The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper. She called their decision “a power move” for the royal couple to “stop putting up with the nonsense” and take ownership of their own lives. “So Harry and Meghan might be moving to Canada. Let’s be honest, wouldn’t you?” added the conservative-leaning National Post. Canadians are excited at this opportunity to live up to their “national reputation as polite host,” it wrote, extolling the potential economic benefits for Toronto if they decide to live there. But Tim Hortons may have best captured the national mood with its appeal to the couple. “No pressure, Meghan and Harry,” it wrote on Twitter. “But if you do choose to move to Canada, free coffee for life. Think about it.” Rumors that Canada, which features Prince Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, on its coinage and its $20 bills, was their preferred refuge from Britain were stoked this week after the couple’s statement announcing their plans conspicuously mentioned “North America” rather than the United States. Also, a Toronto-based digital firm designed their website explaining their plans.  And after the announcement, the duchess returned to Canada, according to the BBC, where she had reportedly left their 8-month old baby, Archie, after spending Christmas and New Year’s Day in British Columbia.  [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] During their recent six-week vacation, the couple enchanted local residents on Vancouver Island by interrupting a hike to gallantly help a couple trying to take a selfie, according to local news reports. They were also turned away by an upmarket seafood restaurant serving caviar and steamed clams amid security concerns. Even without Canada’s historical connection to its former colonial ruler, the duchess, an American, has close ties to the country and many Canadian friends. For seven years, during her previous career as an actress, she lived in Toronto while filming the popular legal drama “Suits.”  The Canadian media’s relative lack of intrusiveness could also offer a welcome reprieve from the voracious British tabloid press, which has dubbed the entire endeavor “Megxit.” Perhaps mindful of the couple’s potential to burnish Canada’s brand, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — himself a member of political royalty as the son of a former prime minister — welcomed them on Twitter in December around their vacation period.  “Prince Harry, Meghan, and Archie, we’re all wishing you a quiet and blessed stay in Canada,” he wrote. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here.” Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the British monarchy at Carleton University in Ottawa, suggested that this sometimes self-deprecating country was greeting a potential royal migration as a “vindication of the Canadian way of life.”  Such is the enthusiasm for the couple in Canada that a poll released this week showed that 60 percent of Canadians supported appointing Prince Harry as governor general, the crown’s representative in Canada’s system of constitutional monarchy. “It’s a big source of national pride that the royal couple would want to be here,” Mr. Lagassé said. “It makes Canadians feel better about themselves.”  He even floated a view that, hypothetically, the federal Parliament could make Harry and Meghan king and queen of Canada — relying on recent rulings in Canadian courts on the issue of royal succession, and various loopholes in Canadian law. But he stressed that a majority of Canadians would be unlikely to support that, given the reticence, he said, about revisiting constitutional debates that risk dividing the country.  In any case, he added, support for the monarchy generally remained lukewarm at best in a country where many viewed constitutional ties to the crown as a historical relic rather a necessity. Nevertheless, pundits and citizens alike have been quick to offer advice on everything from how the couple should dress for braving the Canadian winter to where they should live. One frequent tip: Prince Harry could find favor by taking up hockey. “They’d do well to ditch the crowns, scepters and garlands of invaluable gems and jewels, and dress the part of your average Canuck,” the self-described anti-monarchist Canadian John Semley wrote in Britain’s Guardian newspaper. “I’m talking red-and-black flannel shirts.” Other than Toronto, popular suggestions for potential royal abodes include Vancouver, where rainy weather and picturesque natural landscapes could remind the couple of England. But others warned they should avoid Montreal, given that monarchists were rare in Quebec, a proud majority French province that was ceded in 1763 after Britain vanquished France in the Seven Years’ War. The queen has also avoided visiting Quebec City since 1964, when protesters showed her their backs. Not everyone is thrilled by the prospect of the couple moving to Canada. \u200bPublic attitudes toward the royals could become frosty quickly if Canadians had to pay for the hefty cost of their security, Mr. Lagassé said. Moreover, while the pair say they want to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada.  Even though Prince Harry’s grandmother is the personification of the Canadian state, he said, that does not confer legal rights for her progeny in Canada. It is perhaps a sign of possible things to come that Tim Hortons’s offer of free coffee to the couple also spurred a backlash on social media, after a union said workers in Winnipeg had been locked out by the company after their demand for a salary increase. The royal couple “can afford to buy the company,” one woman wrote on Twitter. “Your employees can’t afford rent.” For all the royal hoopla, Canadians could be rejoicing prematurely if the couple decides to go to the United States to be closer to the duchess’s family.  After all, Prince Harry may heed the words of his grandfather Prince Philip, who had this to say about Canada during a trip there in 1976: “We don’t come here for our health.

China Reports First Death From New Virus,2020-01-11,By Amy Qin and Javier C.

The Xinhua news agency cited the health commission in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness first appeared, in reporting the death. The health commission said the patient, a 61-year-old man, died on Thursday night. Forty-one people have been found to have the new virus, a coronavirus, and seven patients are still in severe condition, the health commission said, according to the Xinhua report. Two patients have been discharged, it said. There is no evidence that the virus can be spread between humans, according to the commission. The initial cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, birds and other animals. More than 700 people who had close contact with patients, including 419 medical workers, have been put under observation, the commission said, adding that no additional cases have been found. Reports of the virus — a mysterious, pneumonialike illness — first appeared last month and have since aroused fears around the region, where memories of the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, which began in China and killed more than 800 people worldwide, still linger.

Experts have said the minimum incubation period for some viral infections is 15 days, suggesting that it may be another week before authorities can determine the full extent of the illness. Reports of the man’s death came just before the Spring Festival, China’s biggest holiday, which begins Jan. 25, and a time when hundreds of millions people travel across the country.

Forty-six of those patients have already been discharged and the rest are in stable condition, the authority added.

"Iran, United by Loss of General, Is Divided Over Plane Crash",2020-01-11,By Farnaz Fassihi and David D. Kirkpatrick,"['The American killing of a legendary Iranian general seemed for a moment to sweep away months of violent protests against corruption and misrule, drowning it all in nationalist outrage. But now the crash of a civilian airliner over Tehran on Wednesday is threatening to dissolve that unity in an agonizing debate over whether the Iranian authorities bear the blame. All 176 people on board were killed, including many young Iranians headed for graduate study in Canada. The United States, Canada and other Western governments concluded that Iran’s own missile defense systems accidentally shot down the plane, but Tehran continued on Friday to dismiss the crash as a mechanical failure that happened to occur just as Iran was bracing for a potential American airstrike. Many Iranians said that their anger over the lack of accountability at the highest levels of their government has quickly returned. “Our lives have no value,” Yalda, a 45-year-old graphic artist in Tehran, said in a telephone interview, asking not to be identified fully for fear of arrest. “They shot down the plane and not only do they not apologize but they are lying about it.” By late Friday, government officials were considering acknowledging that Iranian defense systems brought down the jet, according to four Iranians familiar with the deliberations. Tehran may argue instead, they said, that faulty equipment onboard the plane had failed to signal properly.  The plane crash is only the latest in a series of deadly episodes for which Iranian critics have blamed their government. Fifty-six people were killed Tuesday in stampede in a narrow side street during a funeral procession for the military leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in his hometown, Kerman.  As many as 600 others were killed this fall by security forces suppressing antigovernment protests. The demonstrations, which began over a sharp increase in gasoline prices, turned into protests about corruption and self-dealing by the authorities in Tehran. The protesters said Iran’s government had plunged Iran into an economic crisis even before American sanctions began to bite. But the magnitude and timing of the crash, as well as official dissembling about it, have given it special resonance at a moment when Iranian leaders are rallying the public to endure more hardship in their continuing standoff with Washington. Heading into next month’s parliamentary elections, the disaster is also almost certain to become a campaign issue. “This will be a big test for the government, and if there is a sense of blurring evidence or hiding something, that is going to hurt the legitimacy of the current system for sure,” said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a scholar of Iran at the Royal United Services Institute. “We are talking about a very large number of civilians.” The government has struggled in vain to contain the embarrassment. After insisting the day after the crash that mechanical failure was to blame, the Iranian authorities abruptly shifted on Friday to pledging complete openness. Officials promised to invite investigators from several nations, including France, the United States and the home country of the airline, Ukraine. Even while pledging a transparent inquiry, though, government officials were still denying on Friday that Iranian missiles could have played any role. State media outlets said the conclusion of the Western governments was an American lie cooked up to sap Iran’s resolve, and some nationalists on social media argued the same. “One day the story of the Ukrainian airline crash will be taught in schools for lessons in psychological warfare,” Mohammad Keshvari, the chief executive of an Iranian information technology company, argued on Twitter. As speculation circulated on Iranian social media late Friday that the government might acknowledge some role in the crash, the groundswell of anger appeared to be growing. The hashtag #cheaplife began surging on Iranian social media soon after the Western assessment of the crash began to emerge. Some compared the government statements about the crash to false official statements that a barrage of Iranian missiles had killed 80 American troops in Iraq on Wednesday. (Pentagon officials say none died.) “The Islamic Republic is being modest saying it killed 80 in the harsh revenge operation,” tweeted Dariush Zand, a 27-year-old activist living in Turkey. “In reality they killed 176.” Some complained about the absence of official mourning for those who died on the plane. Pictures of General Suleimani had sprung up everywhere, memorials for him went on through the night, and mosques erected small shrines in his honor. But there were no public condolences or flags at half-staff to honor those who died in the plane. “Nobody trusts the government,” said Sara, a 42-year-old translator in Tehran. “Lie on top of lie. They were not transparent about the number of people killed in the protests in November, they were not transparent about what brought the plane down. The only thing they are transparent about is their propaganda for Suleimani.” Some said they felt indignant that only reports from the West had prompted the inquiries. “If America and Canada hadn’t revealed the truth, Iran would continue to lie,” said Mehdi, a 37-year-old journalist in Tehran. “We can’t process this.” For many, the crash has an added poignancy because the plane was carrying many of Iran’s best and brightest. A large number of the passengers were graduates of top science and engineering schools headed for fellowships, graduate school or teaching jobs in Canada. Fourteen were graduates of Iran’s elite Sharif University of Technology, a top supplier of M.I.T. and Stanford recruits. “We see ourselves in them,” said Solmaz Sharif, an Iranian journalist who emigrated to the United States a decade ago. They were “the people who immigrated hoping for a better life and worked hard to create that life and still loved Iran and went back to visit. Only to be killed.” In the heat of the recent clashes with Washington, though, other Iranians insisted that the United States was as much to blame for bringing down the passenger jet as for killing General Suleimani. “The possibility of US maliciously jamming the Boeing plan’s system is stronger than the Revolutionary Guards mistakenly targeting a passenger plane,” tweeted Mahziyar Khaki, a cleric from Qom. Ramin Ghorbani, another Iranian Twitter user, changed his profile to a picture of General Suleimani. “Looks like the Americans are responsible for the plane crash,” Mr. Ghorbani wrote. “It’s a plan to divert public attention from General Suleimani’s martyrdom and find an excuse to impose more sanctions on us.” Government officials pleaded for a return to the solidarity that followed the killing of General Suleimani. “This was an extremely difficult week for Iranians,” tweeted Gholamhossein Mohamadi, the head of Tehran municipality’s communication department. “The only way out of this crisis is national unity.” But Amir Ali, a 46-year-old owner of an advertising agency in Tehran, said even families were becoming divided over the blame for the crash. “Everyone is confused and shocked,” he said. “Unfortunately, there is a lot of disagreement.”']",A debate of how much blame the government bears for the downing of a Ukrainian jetliner threatens to destroy a moment of national solidarity.
Iran Cracks Down as Protests Over Downing of Airliner Grow,2020-01-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and David D. Kirkpatrick,"['A top Iranian military commander made a rare public appeal for forgiveness on Sunday as security forces fired on protesters and outrage over the mistaken downing of a jetliner reignited opposition on the streets and stirred dissent within the government’s conservative base.  It was the second day of protests after the military acknowledged early Saturday that it had launched the missiles that brought down a Ukraine International Airlines jet near the Iranian capital on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. The disaster unfolded amid escalating tensions with the United States over the killing of a revered Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. For the first three days after the crash, Iran denied growing international accusations that it had shot the plane down, and looked as if it was engaged in a cover-up. The Iranian authorities insisted that the jetliner had gone down for mechanical reasons, and refused to cooperate with investigators. They also began to remove some evidence from the scene. But then, as the uproar mounted, Iranian leaders admitted that they had shot the aircraft down, citing human error.  That admission limited the blowback from abroad — but threw a match on the volatile situation at home. Anti-government protests that had quieted when General Suleimani was killed in a drone strike in Iraq rekindled across the country. Still, analysts argued that this latest wave of internal unrest could ultimately strengthen those in Iran who are pressing to confront the United States. Already, they were seeking to blame Washington for the protests.  [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] On Sunday, the unrest spread outside Tehran, the capital, to at least a dozen cities. Security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets and eventually live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in Tehran. By late Sunday night, several people had been wounded, witnesses said. Unlike previous waves of opposition, some of the outrage this time has come from conservatives who ordinarily support the government, as well as from the usual critics. Headlines in hard-line newspapers demanded resignations, and the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Hossein Salami, issued a very rare public apology. In a televised address, he all but begged Iranians to return to the nationalist zeal that only days earlier had seemed to fill the country, after General Suleimani’s killing. Iran responded to his death by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where American forces were stationed. “We achieved a great victory,” General Salami said, though the missile barrage injured no one and did little serious damage. “But the crash of the airplane has tarnished it.” He said he wished he, too, had “crashed and burned” on the jet. The editor in chief of the Revolutionary Guard’s Tasnim news agency, Kian Abdollahi, said that attempts by government officials to lie about what had happened were as great a “catastrophe” as the crash itself. “Officials who misled the media are guilty too,” he said on Twitter. “We are all ashamed before the people.” Analysts say the uproar, however, is unlikely to dampen the Iranian appetite for confrontation with the West. Iranian hard-liners habitually suspect that American covert operations are behind domestic protests, and the unvarnished pleasure the White House seemed to take in the events unfolding in Iran over the weekend may only harden that view, analysts said. “We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage,” President Trump tweeted on Sunday.  Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said that even as they took tough measures to suppress protests at home, Iranian leaders might lash out against Washington, covertly or otherwise.  “They believe that the U.S. and its allies in the region are fueling and exploiting internal discontent in Iran,” he said. “The game will return to Iran’s comfort zone: indirect attacks against the United States and its allies in ways that would allow plausible deniability and minimal risks of reprisal.” Over the last year, the Trump administration has hit Iran with a so-called “maximum pressure campaign” of painful economic sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran to submit to new restrictions on its military activities and nuclear program. Iranian officials  describe it as economic warfare.  If hawks in Washington view the protests as evidence of success, that could work against Iranians who favor compromise with the United States — and strengthen hard-liners who favor confrontation, said Sanam Vakil, a scholar at Chatham House.  “Security-focused conservatives are thinking they can’t come to the table now because it would be weak,” she said. General Salami of the Revolutionary Guards, in his apology and plea for unity on Sunday, appeared eager to rally Iranians once again against their perennial rival since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “We are at war with the United States,” he said. “We do not consider the conflict with the United States over. We are the soldiers of the people, and we will sacrifice ourselves for you.” “Iran has risen,” he said, noting that its military had dared fire missiles toward American forces on bases in Iraq — even if it did so without much chance of damage or casualties. “Iran is proud and the whole world has seen our power.” By acknowledging belatedly that Iran’s own military had brought down the jet, Iranian leaders avoided the prospect of greater international isolation. European and other governments that had sought to trade with Iran or mediate its dispute with Washington had all begun to cite evidence that Iranian forces shot down the plane.  Canada, the final destination of most passengers on the downed jet, lost 57 citizens. At a memorial event on Sunday at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the crash “truly a Canadian tragedy.” “I want to assure all families and all Canadians: We will not rest until there are answers,” he said. “We will not rest until there is justice and accountability.” The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said Sunday that two of its air accident investigators had obtained visas from Iran and would arrive in Tehran on Monday. It said  two experts in downloading and analyzing flight data and voice recorder information would follow. In Tehran, the scale of the domestic backlash may have caught the government by surprise. Uniformed members of the security forces and pro-government militia men were deployed in large numbers in cities around the country, apparently in an unsuccessful effort to discourage a second day of protests. By the end of the night, at least several people had been shot in the back by security forces, according to witnesses and videos. Several protesters in Tehran said in interviews that a circle of militiamen had closed in and beaten them. “The city is a security zone and special forces units are at every square,” Siamak Ghasemi, an economist living in Tehran, wrote on his Instagram page. The wrong group, he said, was being punished: “It’s as if civilians had brought down a military plane.” Despite the heavy security presence, large crowds turned out. In many places, they chanted caustic slogans. Some denounced the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is a capital offense in Iran.  “The supreme leader is a murderer; his regime is obsolete,” demonstrators chanted in Azadi Square in Tehran. “Our enemy is right here,” others chanted in a video circulating on social media. “They lie to us that it’s America.”  The protests in several cities were centered at universities and dominated by students, perhaps because many of those killed in the plane crash were recent graduates heading for further study in Canada. “They killed our geniuses and replaced them with clerics,” young men and women chanted in the city of Shiraz. Dozens of prominent film directors, artists and performers issued statements condemning the government’s handling of the crash and pulling their work from a prestigious competition. “We are not citizens,” Iran’s best-known actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, wrote on her Instagram page; she has six million followers. “We are hostages, millions of hostages.”  A member of the Tehran city council issued a stinging statement of resignation: “Today we are faced with systematic lies, cover-ups and lack of accountability. In the current environment I have no hope for reform.” And the only female Iranian athlete to win an Olympic medal also chose Sunday to announce that she had defected. “I am one of the millions of oppressed women in Iran who they have been playing with for years,” the athlete, Kimia Alizadeh, wrote on Instagram. She won a bronze medal in taekwondo in 2016. Officials appeared to be scrambling to get behind the outpouring of public grief for those killed on the plane. A billboard in downtown Tehran that had displayed a photo of General Suleimani was taken down. In its place was a black banner with the names of the victims and a verse about grief. In Tabriz and Tehran, some protesters could be seen tearing up photos of General Suleimani that had been hanging from poles. Iranian media reported that local officials, prayer leaders and Revolutionary Guard commanders were visiting the families of victims to offer apologies and condolences. Like the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Guards, though, Ayatollah Khamenei did his best to shift public attention back to the conflict with the Washington.

"Ontario Alert Warned of a Nuclear ‘Emergency,’ Then Backed Down",2020-01-12,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — Millions of people in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, were greeted by a screeching alarm on their cellphones on Sunday morning and an ambiguous “emergency alert” about an “incident” at one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants. But after about 90 minutes of puzzling and fretting by Canadians over a possible nuclear Armageddon, the warbling siren sounded out again from phones across Ontario with another alert taking it all back.  “The previous alert was issued in error,” the second message read. “There is no danger to the public or environment.” The false alarm over a possible emergency at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, which sits on the shore of Lake Ontario to the east of Toronto, is the latest embarrassment for Canada’s national emergency alert system, which was expanded to phone from broadcast warnings just over a year and a half ago. The warning in Ontario didn’t set off a panic, unlike an erroneous message about a ballistic missile threat in Hawaii in January 2018. But it did appear to add to public frustration about a system that some people have criticized for crying wolf or for creating needless disturbances. On social media, a number of people reacted with good humor. “This is embarrassing because I had JUST finished organizing my neighborhood into a band of foraging mutants,” Jonathan Kay, a journalist in Toronto, wrote on Twitter with the first warning attached.  Sylvia Jones, who is responsible for the emergency alert system as the province’s solicitor general, said in a statement that the alert was unintentionally released to the public during “a routine training exercise being conducted by the Provincial Emergency Operations Center.”  She added that the government would investigate and introduce steps to ensure no repeat false alarms occur.  Isabelle Roy, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, confirmed that there was no safety risk at the power station, which is owned by a provincial government agency. The alert appeared to have been sent throughout the sprawling province, which spans parts of two time zones. But exactly how many people were startled out of bed or over breakfast is unclear.  While the alarm overrides any silencing of phones, it cannot switch on handsets that have been shut off. Nor does it work with phones that are connected to older cellular networks that are often the only service in remote areas. Most messages sent by the system are “Amber Alerts,” usually involving children who have been taken by one of their parents in contravention of a court order. But it can be used to issue alerts about dangerous weather, particularly tornadoes, or other potential emergencies. The federally mandated alert system has struggled with technical issues that resulted in early test messages failing to reach large numbers of phones.  It is also been criticized for distributing messages too broadly in the middle of the night even though the system can localize warnings. One early Amber Alert went provincewide even though it involved an incident in Thunder Bay, about 1,000 miles northwest of the southern portion of the province that contains most of its population. But the system’s potentially wide reach apparently played a role in the safe recovery of a boy about 250 miles from where he had been abducted in Toronto. There has been little apparent sympathy for people who don’t want to be startled by any alerts, particularly at night.  In October, a man in Hamilton, Ontario, was charged with mischief after calling an emergency line to complain about being woken up at 5:04 a.m. by a regional Amber Alert involving five children.  “He was angry about receiving the Amber Alert on his phone because he was trying to rest,” Acting Detective Sgt. Lisa Chambers of the Hamilton Police told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “And then he further told us he would continue to call in response to the ongoing alerts.”']","Millions were greeted with a screeching alert on their phones. An hour and a half later, another message followed: The alarm “was issued in error.”"
Australia’s Leader Calls for Inquiry Into Government Response to Fires,2020-01-12,By Jamie Tarabay,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said on Sunday that he would call for a high-level government inquiry into the response to the country’s devastating bushfires. But he did not signal a significant shift in policies to curb carbon emissions, as many had hoped. The suggested inquiry, which Mr. Morrison proposed during a televised interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, came on the heels of news that a firefighter had died overnight in the state of Victoria, the site of some of the worst of the fires that have swept parts of Australia since October. At least 28 people have been killed in the fires. Mr. Morrison and his government have been harshly criticized over their response to the monthslong crisis. The proposed inquiry, known as a royal commission, would look at that response, including the deployment of emergency services to deal with blazes that crossed state borders, streaked across mountain ranges and forced the evacuations of thousands of people along the country’s eastern and southeastern shorelines.  The journalist who interviewed Mr. Morrison on Sunday, David Speers, said afterward that the prime minister’s call for a “historic change,” mostly involving how resources are used to combat disasters, fell short of what many Australians were hoping to hear: a plan for a significant shift in his government’s policies to curb emissions and invest more in renewable energy.  This fire season has been the worst in Australia’s recorded history, burning millions of acres of land and at least 3,000 homes. The number of wild animals killed because of the fires has been estimated at over half a billion and rising. At one point, Royal Australian Navy ships were dispatched to rescue people stranded on beaches after flames and deadly smoke blocked escape routes.  Mr. Morrison has declined to consider major changes to policies on renewable energy, fossil fuels and coal. The mining and export of coal are key industries in Australia’s economy, and in his interview on Sunday, he reiterated that he would not put jobs at risk or raise taxes in the pursuit of lower carbon emissions. Mr. Morrison has repeatedly said that enough was being done to curb emissions, particularly for a nation with Australia’s relatively small population. But climate scientists say that the government’s targets are low to begin with and that emissions have been rising under Mr. Morrison’s government. On Sunday, Mr. Morrison said Australia’s “new normal” was a changing climate that would require the country to adopt better policies for disaster management and relief. “These are the areas of climate change action that I think need greater attention, because they’re the things that are practically affecting people’s daily lives here in Australia, where we can do practical things that will make us more resilient and ensure that we’re safer,” he said. “It isn’t just restricted to bush fires,” he said. “It deals with floods. It deals with cyclones. It deals with the drought, which is affected by these broader issues. Adaptation and resilience is key to that. Building dams is key to that. Native vegetation management is key to that. Land clearing is key to that. Where you can build homes is key to that.”  “And that is as much a climate change response as emissions reduction,” he said. Some critics said that royal commissions, which can take a year or more to conclude, are often interpreted as a way for the government to delay meaningful action on a divisive subject. “It’s a fob-off — they always are,” said John Blaxland, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra, the capital. “They give you a good 18 months of political grace for the issue to die down politically and then shelve it when it comes out.” Mr. Blaxland said such inquiries could also be cathartic, giving the government a way to demonstrate action and leadership, a quality that Mr. Morrison has been widely criticized as lacking in recent weeks. In December, as firefighters battled worsening blazes, Mr. Morrison left for a vacation in Hawaii, returning only after nationwide outrage over his absence. On Sunday, he said that would not happen again. “In hindsight, I would not have taken that trip knowing what I know now,” he said. “I’d made a promise to my kids and we’d taken forward that break, as I explained when I came back, and I thought I was very upfront about my contrition on that.” During visits to some fire-ravaged areas shortly after his return from Hawaii, Mr. Morrison was harangued by residents of one town in a video that spread across the internet and social media. Regardless of people’s views of Mr. Morrison, a recent rule change within his conservative Liberal Party means that he will almost certainly remain prime minister for the next two and a half years, Professor Blaxland said. Given the present crisis, Professor Blaxland said that Australians needed to rise above politics. “Our circumstances are so dire, we can’t afford to just continue to bicker,” he said. “We have this cavalier approach to our security that’s fostered and bred a political narcissism that we can no longer afford. We’ve got to rise above our petty differences and come up with solutions, not just for the next election but for our grandkids.”']","In an interview with the local media, Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed regret but reiterated that economic concerns would still play a key role in climate policies.

"Migrant Boat Sinks Near Greek Island, Killing at Least 12",2020-01-11,By Niki Kitsantonis,"['ATHENS — The bodies of 12 people were recovered from the Ionian Sea on Saturday after a migrant smuggling boat sank near the island of Paxos in western Greece, the Greek Coast Guard said. The authorities were alerted that the vessel was in trouble shortly after 9 a.m., when one of the migrants on board phoned the emergency services. No details were immediately available about the identities of the victims. The cause of the sinking was also unclear, according to the Coast Guard spokesman, Nikolaos Lagadianos. Weather conditions had been good, he said. But the boat may have been overloaded, he added, noting that about 50 people may have been on board. A large search-and-rescue operation was underway, the Coast Guard said, with six Coast Guard vessels scouring the area alongside two Air Force helicopters, a Navy helicopter and four fishing boats. The Coast Guard said that 21 people had so far been rescued. The migrants were the first to drown in Greek waters this year. Their deaths follow scores more in recent years, although the rate of drownings here has fallen sharply since Turkey and the European Union signed a deal in 2016 to reduce migration. Saturday’s sinking was unusual because it took place in the Ionian rather than the Aegean Sea, suggesting that the vessel was likely headed to Italy.']","The vessel may have had around 50 people aboard, the Greek Coast Guard said, and a major search-and-rescue mission was underway."

Warnings of ‘Volcanic Tsunami’ After Eruption in Philippines,2020-01-12,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — A dramatic explosion of the Philippines’ second-most-active volcano on Sunday prompted warnings of a possible “volcanic tsunami” as villagers were evacuated and nearby communities were advised to take precautions against any lake water surges. The explosion, which sent a plume of ash half a mile into the air, came months after the volcano —\xa0Taal, about 40 miles south of Manila — began exhibiting a state of unrest. Tremors were felt on the volcano’s island and in villages around the nearby town of Agoncillo in Batangas Province, and booming noises from the volcano raised fears among residents. “The earthquakes were strong, and it felt like there was a monster coming out” as in the movies, said Cookie Siscar, who had left the area and was relaying a report from her husband, Emer, a poultry farmer, who was in their home in Batangas, which overlooks the volcano island. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised its alert level for Taal Volcano to four out of five, indicating that a “hazardous eruption” was imminent.  The institute warned that the eruption could cause a “volcanic tsunami” and advised nearby communities to take precautions against possible surges from the lake that surrounds the volcano. About 6,000 people live on the island, and boats took residents to safety in Batangas early on Sunday. Tens of thousands of people were ordered evacuated from the surrounding area, The Associated Press reported, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Manila’s international airport also said on Twitter that flights to and from it were suspended because of the eruption. Volcanic ash was seen “in the vicinity of the airport” and nearby air routes, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said. The volcano island has been showing signs of activity since last March, and about three dozen eruptions have been recorded in recent history. Sitting on a lake that partly fills a caldera formed thousands of years ago, it is a popular attraction for tourists, who view it from a ridge in Cavite Province to the north. Salvador Panelo, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said the government was “closely monitoring the situation of Taal Volcano.”  “Concerned agencies of the national government are now working closely with the provincial government of Batangas to ensure the safety of the residents, including their evacuation,” Mr. Panelo said. “We advise the public to continue to remain vigilant.” Rea Torres, who is from the town of Dita in Batangas, said that when she went to check on the family residence, she felt tremors twice: “I felt as if the whole floor moved.” “It is very scary,” she said, describing “ominous clouds above us” and thunder and lightning.  Last January, an eruption at the most active volcano in the island nation —\xa0the Mayon, in Albay Province, about 200 miles east of the Taal — prompted an alert level of four as it generated up to 1,600 feet of lava fountains and ash fell on two nearby villages.']","Tens of thousands were evacuated and tremors were felt in nearby villages amid an eruption of the country’s second-most-active volcano, the Taal, near Manila."
"Plane Shot Down Because of Human Error, Iran Says",2020-01-11,,"['After maintaining for days that there was no evidence that one of its missiles had struck a Boeing 737-800 minutes after it took off from Tehran on Wednesday with 176 people on board, Iran admitted early on Saturday that its military had shot down the passenger jet by mistake. The military blamed human error. In a statement, it said Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had taken a sharp, unexpected turn that brought it near a sensitive military base. Hours later, though, an Iranian official walked back that claim. “The plane was flying in its normal direction without any error and everybody was doing their job correctly,” Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ airspace unit, said during a televised news conference later Saturday. “If there was a mistake, it was made by one of our members.” In a post on Twitter, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohamad Javad Zarif, apologized but appeared to also blame American “adventurism” for the tragedy, writing: “Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster.” President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter that Iran “deeply regrets this disastrous mistake.”  In a statement cited by the semiofficial Fars News Agency, the president offered condolences to the victims’ families and said that “the terrible catastrophe should be thoroughly investigated” and those responsible would be prosecuted.  But facing the possibility of American military strikes on Iran on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani added, the armed forces made a “human mistake.” “This painful incident is not something we can easily overcome,” he added, saying that was imperative to correct shortcomings in the country’s defense mechanisms. Iranians vented fury toward their government after Tehran’s admission, with thousands pouring into main squares around the city Saturday afternoon. Gatherings organized on social media to mourn the victims of the crash swiftly turned into angry protests against the government’s actions.  “Death to liars!” and “Death to the dictator!” people chanted, according to videos posted on social media. “You have no shame,” shouted several young men, as the crowd joined in a chorus, another video showed. The country’s elite security force was not spared. At universities, crowds called the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps “incompetent” and “the people’s shame.”  But as protests spread throughout the capital and to other cities, the public’s anger seemed to find a one clear target: Ayatollah Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader and its commander in chief. In Tehran, video posted to social media showed, protesters demanded that Mr. Khamenei resign, thrusting their fists in the air and screaming: “Khamenei is a murderer! His regime is obsolete!”  The protests turned violent in Tehran with anti-riot police using tear gas and opening water cannons at the crowd, videos showed. Even conservatives and supporters of the government accused the authorities on social media of initially misleading the public about what had brought down the plane, whose passengers included many young Iranians on their way to Canada for graduate study. The semiofficial Fars News Agency, which is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, posted a harsh commentary condemning Iran’s leaders, saying “their shortcomings have made this tragedy twice as bitter.” “It is pivotal that those who were hiding the truth from the public for the past 72 hours be held accountable, we cannot let this go,” it read.  “Individuals, media, political and military officials who commented in the past 72 hours must be investigated. If they knew of the truth and were deliberately speaking falsehood or for any reason were trying to hide it, they must be prosecuted, no matter what post they hold.” Siamak Ghaesmi, a Tehran-based economist, addressed the country’s leaders in an Instagram post: “I don’t know what to do with my rage and grief. I’m thinking of all the ‘human errors’ in these years that were never revealed because there was no international pressure. I’m thinking of the little trust left that was shattered. I’m thinking of the innocent lives lost because of confronting and being stubborn with the world. What have you done with us?” Mohamad Saeed Ahadian, a conservative analyst in Iran, said on Twitter, “There are two major problems with the Ukrainian Airlines issue. One is firing at an airplane and two is firing at the public’s trust. The first can be justified, but the latter is a mistake with absolutely no justification.” Some social media posts made use of the term “harsh revenge,” which Iran’s leaders had promised to inflict on the United States for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Revolutionary Guards commander; an Iraqi militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis; and others as they left the airport in Baghdad. The general’s killing sent shock waves through the Middle East and led to calls for revenge in Iran, as well as a vote by Iraq’s Parliament to oust American troops from that country.  Mojtaba Fathi, an Iranian journalist, wrote on Twitter, “They were supposed to take their harsh revenge against America, not the people.” The British ambassador to Iran was briefly detained by the authorities in Tehran as protests exploded across the country, a move denounced by Britain as a “flagrant violation of international law.” The ambassador, Rob Macaire, was held for a few hours after being picked up during a demonstration at Amir Kabir University, one of the large protests sites in Tehran, according to Tasnim, an official Iranian news agency.  Tasnim said Mr. Macaire was detained for “involvement in provoking suspicious acts,” a claim that was immediately disputed by British officials.  “The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. The Iranian government, he added, was at a crossroads.  “It can continue its march toward pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards,” Mr. Raab said. The Iranian authorities plan to summon Mr. Macaire for questioning on Sunday, Tasnim reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine praised the 45-member Ukrainian investigative team that arrived in Iran this week for helping bring the circumstances of the disaster to light. “Their high professionalism and promptness and the preliminary evidence they found in Tehran have not allowed the truth to be hidden,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address on Saturday.  In the address, Mr. Zelensky said Ukraine had received important intelligence from the United States and Britain, but he called on the international community to be “persistent until all the circumstances of the crash are identified.”  He pledged that “the guilty will be punished” and that the bodies of Ukrainians killed in the crash would be returned promptly. Earlier, in a Facebook posting, Mr. Zelensky said Kyiv would “insist on a full admission of guilt” from Iran. Mr. Zelensky had come under some domestic criticism this week for refusing to publicly blame Iran for the disaster even as the United States, Canada and Britain did.  The Ukrainian investigators landed in Iran on Thursday. Among the evidence examined, the president’s office said on Facebook, was shrapnel damage and a Canadian man’s passport showing piercings about half an inch in diameter. The lead Ukrainian investigator said Iran had little choice but to allow his team access to the site because the International Civil Aviation Organization would have closed Iranian airspace if it had not.  “As we saw it, Iran had to face the reality that there’s no way they’ll get out of this,” he said. But Mr. Danilov said Iranian authorities had complicated the investigation by scraping the wreckage into piles rather than photographing and mapping the coordinates. Over all, he said, they had acted “inappropriately.” “When a catastrophe happens, everything is supposed to stay in its place.” Mr. Danilov said. “Every element is described, every element is photographed, every element is fixed in terms of its location and coordinates. To our great regret, this was not done.”    The Trump administration had for hours stayed relatively quiet about Iran’s admission and the tumultuous aftermath. But by Saturday afternoon, both President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had weighed in on Twitter. “There cannot be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown,” Mr. Trump wrote, apparently referring to the deadly repression of protests in November. Though human rights issues have not typically been at the top of the administration’s agenda, Mr. Trump called on the Iranian authorities to allow rights groups to monitor the protests and report abuses.  For his part, Mr. Pompeo said that Iranians “are fed up with the regime’s lies, corruption, ineptitude and brutality.” He described the government led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “kleptocracy.” “The voice of the Iranian people is clear,” Mr. Pompeo said.  Flight 752 followed the same departure route as other planes leaving on Wednesday, Igor Sosnovsky, the airline’s vice president for flight operations, told reporters on Saturday. “There was no deviation from any routes that some are hinting at,” he said. Iranian officials initially said that the plane had taken an unexpected turn that brought it near a sensitive military base, but hours later a top official walked back that claim and said the plane was flying in a “normal” direction. The airline presented maps showing the jet took a similar path out of the airport as other departures Wednesday morning — and the same path that Flight 752 had taken on dozens of previous departures from November to January.  Iran’s decision not to shut down its airspace on Wednesday morning, shortly after it struck American positions in Iraq, was “absolutely irresponsible,” Mr. Sosnovskiy said.  “When you act in war, then you act however you wish,” he said at a news conference. “But there must be protection around ordinary people. If they are shooting somewhere from somewhere, they are obliged to close the airport.” Yevhen Dykhne, the airline’s president, said the Iranians had provided no information about possible risks before the plane’s takeoff. A commander of the aerospace division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran, Amirali Hajizadeh, said on Saturday that he accepted responsibility for the plane’s downing minutes after takeoff in Tehran, according to Iranian state TV. In a televised address, he gave more details about the sequence of events that he said had led to the disaster. He said it had been misidentified as a cruise missile, and was shot down with a short-range missile. He also said that the Iranian missile operator had acted independently because of “jamming.”  “I wish I was dead,” Mr. Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by local news outlets. “I accept all responsibility for this incident.” He said that whatever decision the Iranian authorities made, “I will accept with the arms open.” The downing came hours after Iran had fired a barrage of missiles at two American air bases in neighboring Iraq, in retaliation for an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, an Iraqi militia leader and others in Baghdad. Asked during his address why Iranian airspace was not shut to commercial air traffic amid the attacks, Mr. Hajizadeh had no clear answer. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Saturday that he was “furious” and “outraged” at the Iranian government. “Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice and closure that the families deserve,” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference. “Canada and the world still have many questions — questions that must be answered.” He repeated his demand that Canada participate in the crash investigation with the “full cooperation of Iranian authorities.” Providing compensation to the families, Mr. Trudeau added, should be “part of the mix.” Mr. Trudeau told President Hassan Rouhani of Iran in a phone call earlier in the day that the admission of responsibility was “an important step” but that much more needed to be done. The crash killed 57 Canadians, including a number of students and faculty at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. More than 25 residents of Edmonton were on the plane. In Canada, Iranians are comparative newcomers: Most arrived after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Today, by some counts, Canada has the third-largest number of expatriate Iranians in the world and its universities are a top destination for Iranian graduate students. Though Canada has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 2012, Mr. Trudeau spoke to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Saturday and said the Iranian leader promised to cooperate with Canadian investigators. International pressure had been building on Iran to take responsibility. American and allied officials had said that all intelligence assessments indicated that surface-to-air missiles fired by Iranian military forces had shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. Hours after the crash, Ukraine International Airlines officials had consistently ruled out pilot error or mechanical problems as the cause of the crash. They had said the Boeing 737-800, which was less than four years old, was helmed by some of the airline’s most experienced crew. “We never thought for a second that our crew and our plane could have been the reason for this terrible, horrific aviation catastrophe,” the airline’s president, Yevhenii Dykhne, said in a Facebook post on Saturday after Iran’s admission. “These were our best young men and women. The best.” The crew maintained normal radio contact with the tower in Tehran, airline officials said, and followed a standard departure procedure for the airport. After reaching an elevation of 6,000 feet, the pilots were instructed to make a slight northerly turn. In the last communication, he said, one pilot simply read back this instruction from the tower, saying, “Turn and climb.” Addressing criticism that the airline should not have sent a plane to Iran at all, in light of tensions in the region, the officials said it was Iran’s responsibility to close airspace if it intended to fire missiles. There was no immediate reaction from the United States to Iran’s admission, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been the first American official to publicly confirm the intelligence assessments. “We do believe that it’s likely that the plane was shot down by an Iranian missile,” Mr. Pompeo said at a briefing at the White House announcing new sanctions against Iran on Friday.  President Hassan Rouhani of Iran called his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, on Saturday to apologize for the downing of Flight 752. Mr. Rouhani told Mr. Zelensky that errors made by the Iranian military led to the plane being shot down and that those responsible would be punished, according to Ukraine’s summary of the call.  Mr. Rouhani’s statement appeared to be the latest effort at damage control by Iran, whose military first claimed that the Ukrainian flight crew had made a sharp, unexpected turn toward a military base, only to retract that accusation a few hours later. Mr. Zelensky, in a tweet after the phone call, described Iran’s acknowledgment of the missile strike as “a step in the right direction.” He told Mr. Rouhani that the bodies of the 11 Ukrainian victims needed to be identified and repatriated by Jan. 19. “The acknowledgment of the ‘missile version’ of events as the cause of the catastrophe has opened the door to continuing the investigation without any delays or obstacles,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement. “I expect further constructive cooperation with Iran in accordance with the norms of international law.” Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign relations committee in the Russian Senate, said Iran’s admission showed the downing of the plane had been a “tragic incident” and should not lead to further escalation between Iran and the West. “It was a tragic incident; people cannot be returned,” Mr. Kosachev told the Interfax news agency. “The admission of error, although not immediate, and expression of condolences is sufficient to be accepted. With this, the incident should be closed.” All sides should “learn lessons” from what happened, he said.  Mr. Kosachev also pushed back on reports that the missile used to strike the plane had been Russian-made. He did not deny the missile’s origin, but rejected any Russian responsibility for what had happened. “At the height of this tragedy,” he said, “it is absolutely immoral.” American intelligence officials have said that a Russian-made missile system designated SA-15 by NATO and known in Russia as the Tor struck the civilian airliner shortly after takeoff. The Tor system is a mobile missile launch system, with eight missiles carried on either a tracked vehicle or a truck. The vehicles can operate without relying on other air defense infrastructure. They carry both a radar to detect targets and a launch system. The low- to medium-altitude missiles were developed by Soviet engineers in the 1970s as a so-called lower-tier air defense weapon.   Russia sold the Tor systems to Iran in 2005 as part of a $1 billion arms deal and over the objection of American diplomats. It has also sold the system to more than a dozen other countries.   A New York Times analysis of flight path information and video of the missile strike determined that the plane stopped transmitting its signal for between 20 seconds and 30 seconds before it was hit.  Civilian airplanes identify themselves with radio signals constantly streaming from a system known as a transponder on the planes, said Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for Flightradar 24, which tracks the signals for flights around the world.  The Tor software relied on radar and visual identification of a plane as well as the identification signals from the transponder, John Cox, an accident investigator and former pilot who is the chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, said. If the identification is incorrect or absent from the plane, Mr. Cox said, the system “will declare it a threat.”  From there, he said, the missile navigates via radar, “and when it gets in proximity to target it explodes,” releasing deadly fragments. A second missile is usually fired immediately after the first. At that point, the plane, in flames, glided down to its demise.

"Iran Protests Rage Over Downed Jet, as Lawmakers Demand Accountability",2020-01-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and Ben Hubbard,"['Widespread anger at the Iranian government for shooting down a passenger plane and then misleading the public about it simmered for a third day on Monday, with the police and protesters facing off in at least two cities and increasing demands from lawmakers for accountability. After days of denials, Iran acknowledged Saturday that it had mistakenly shot down the Ukrainian airliner, killing 176 people. A government spokesman, Ali Rabeei, said Monday that Iranian officials had not lied to the public when they insisted the plane crashed because of mechanical problems, but were providing the limited information they had. He said that President Hassan Rouhani had learned that missiles were fired at the plane only on Friday, two days after it crashed near the Tehran airport. Demands for government resignations spread Monday from hard-liners, who support Iran’s clerical government and called for officials to step down over the weekend, to members of the more moderate reformist parties, Mr. Rouhani’s base. Bahram Parsaie, a prominent lawmaker from Shiraz, said that it was not enough for Mr. Rouhani and his government to issue statements and that they needed to resign. He warned that if the president and his cabinet were not transparent with the public, Parliament would take legal action against them. Ali Shakouri Rad, the head of a reformist political party, said the growing rift between the public and the clerical government had become insurmountable. “Covering up the mistake of downing the passenger jet with missiles was throwing acid at the image of the Islamic Republic,” he said on Twitter. In a sign of the tensions between Iran’s clerical rulers and the elected officials, the government said Monday that it had disqualified 90 current lawmakers from running for re-election, Iranian official news media reported. The lawmakers, mostly members of reformist and centrist factions, account for roughly a third of the 290-member Parliament. Several leading reformist politicians responded by calling for a boycott of the parliamentary election next month. The rift over how the plane crash was handled also spread to the official news media on Monday, with several prominent state television and radio hosts quitting their jobs, saying they could no longer lie for the government. Gelare Jabbari, the popular host of state TV’s Channel Two programs, changed her profile picture on Instagram to black and posted a public apology. “It was very hard for me to believe the murdering of my countrymen,” she wrote. “Forgive me for believing it too late. I apologize for lying to you on TV for 13 years.” The journalists’ union for the province of Tehran also issued a public apology for helping spread the government’s misinformation about the cause of the crash. “We are currently holding a funeral service for public trust,” the statement said. “The first coffins are for state broadcast company and all media and websites.” The union called on all Iranian journalists to no longer “amplify the cover-ups of officials” and to conduct their reporting with skepticism and independent investigations. State television, however, continued to play down the mistaken downing of the plane, with one anchor saying “it was nothing compared to the main event” — the Iranian missile attack on American forces in Iraq hours earlier. The Iranian attack, which caused moderate damage but killed no one, was conducted in retaliation for the American killing of Iran’s terror mastermind in a drone attack on Jan. 3. Just hours later, a Ukraine International Airlines flight was taking off from Tehran before dawn on Wednesday, and Iranian forces were on high alert for an American counterattack. An Iranian crew, confusing the jet for an attacking craft, fired an antiaircraft missile at it about three minutes after it took off. On Monday, the government closed the popular reformist news website Entekhab for publishing false rumors over the weekend that Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of National Security Council, had resigned. Videos from inside Iran shared on social media on Monday showed university students in Isfahan and the capital, Tehran, chanting against the country’s clerical rulers while riot police officers were deployed nearby. Thousands of students gathered at Iran’s elite technical university, Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, 14 of whose recent graduates died when the plane was shot down. Some lashed out our Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We want transparency,” said one student, addressing the crowd. “This country has not had transparency for years. You have lied to us. the state broadcast company has lied to us. You think we are all stupid. The supreme leader must answer to us about the country’s problems. Mr. Khamenei, why are you lying?” The crowd cheered. [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] A group of more than 30 artists, filmmakers and actors issued a joint statement on Monday saying they would not participate in the government-sponsored Fajr competition, Iran’s equivalent of the Oscars. One of the signatories, the well-known filmmaker Rakhshan Bani Etemad, was briefly detained and interrogated for several hours after she called for a nationwide vigil for the victims of the crash. There were no reports of violence in the protests on Monday, as there had been over the weekend, when there were videos of protesters carrying off bleeding comrades as gunshots echoed in the background. The authorities in Iran denied that security forces had opened fire. Late Sunday, President Trump warned Iran not to target the demonstrators. Framing himself as a supporter of the media, which in other circumstances he has frequently disparaged, Mr. Trump exhorted Iran’s leaders to allow unfettered reporting. “To the leaders of Iran — DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!” In addition to the domestic outrage, Iran may also face demands for compensation from nations whose citizens were killed on the plane, Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko of Ukraine told Reuters on Monday in an interview in Singapore. Foreign ministers from five nations will meet in London on Thursday to discuss legal action, he said. The participants will include Canada, which lost 57 citizens, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and another country he did not identify. Mr. Prystaiko said Tehran had agreed to hand over the jet’s black boxes for analysis, but had yet to set a date to do so. Tensions between the United States and Iran have soared since 2018, when Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of an international agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program and imposed the first in a series of sanctions on Iran to punish it for what his administration sees as its destabilizing activities across the Middle East. After a number of attacks on United States assets and allies in the Middle East in recent months, Mr. Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds force. He headed Iran’s efforts to direct allied militias in the region. Those militias include an Iraqi group that the United States accused of firing rockets at a military base in Iraq late last month, killing one American contractor. United States forces retaliated against militia bases, killing more than two dozen fighters, and militias responded by surrounding the American Embassy compound in Baghdad, breaching its perimeter wall, setting fires and throwing rocks. The killing of General Suleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport raised fears that Iran or its network of allies across the Middle East would respond against the United States and its allies, possibly igniting a regional war.

"Ontario Alert Warned of a Nuclear ‘Emergency,’ Then Backed Down",2020-01-12,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — Millions of people in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, were greeted by a screeching alarm on their cellphones on Sunday morning and an ambiguous “emergency alert” about an “incident” at one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants. But after about 90 minutes of puzzling and fretting by Canadians over a possible nuclear Armageddon, the warbling siren sounded out again from phones across Ontario with another alert taking it all back.  “The previous alert was issued in error,” the second message read. “There is no danger to the public or environment.” The false alarm over a possible emergency at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, which sits on the shore of Lake Ontario to the east of Toronto, is the latest embarrassment for Canada’s national emergency alert system, which was expanded to phone from broadcast warnings just over a year and a half ago. The warning in Ontario didn’t set off a panic, unlike an erroneous message about a ballistic missile threat in Hawaii in January 2018. But it did appear to add to public frustration about a system that some people have criticized for crying wolf or for creating needless disturbances. On social media, a number of people reacted with good humor. “This is embarrassing because I had JUST finished organizing my neighborhood into a band of foraging mutants,” Jonathan Kay, a journalist in Toronto, wrote on Twitter with the first warning attached.  Sylvia Jones, who is responsible for the emergency alert system as the province’s solicitor general, said in a statement that the alert was unintentionally released to the public during “a routine training exercise being conducted by the Provincial Emergency Operations Center.”  She added that the government would investigate and introduce steps to ensure no repeat false alarms occur.  Isabelle Roy, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, confirmed that there was no safety risk at the power station, which is owned by a provincial government agency. The alert appeared to have been sent throughout the sprawling province, which spans parts of two time zones. But exactly how many people were startled out of bed or over breakfast is unclear.  While the alarm overrides any silencing of phones, it cannot switch on handsets that have been shut off. Nor does it work with phones that are connected to older cellular networks that are often the only service in remote areas. Most messages sent by the system are “Amber Alerts,” usually involving children who have been taken by one of their parents in contravention of a court order. But it can be used to issue alerts about dangerous weather, particularly tornadoes, or other potential emergencies. The federally mandated alert system has struggled with technical issues that resulted in early test messages failing to reach large numbers of phones.  It is also been criticized for distributing messages too broadly in the middle of the night even though the system can localize warnings. One early Amber Alert went provincewide even though it involved an incident in Thunder Bay, about 1,000 miles northwest of the southern portion of the province that contains most of its population. But the system’s potentially wide reach apparently played a role in the safe recovery of a boy about 250 miles from where he had been abducted in Toronto. There has been little apparent sympathy for people who don’t want to be startled by any alerts, particularly at night.  In October, a man in Hamilton, Ontario, was charged with mischief after calling an emergency line to complain about being woken up at 5:04 a.m. by a regional Amber Alert involving five children.  “He was angry about receiving the Amber Alert on his phone because he was trying to rest,” Acting Detective Sgt. Lisa Chambers of the Hamilton Police told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “And then he further told us he would continue to call in response to the ongoing alerts.”']","Millions were greeted with a screeching alert on their phones. An hour and a half later, another message followed: The alarm “was issued in error.”"
Macron Scraps Proposal to Raise Retirement Age in France,2020-01-11,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — With tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators once again coursing through the streets of Paris and other cities and clouds of tear gas and smashed store windows punctuating the urban landscape, the French government made a major concession on Saturday to unions protesting its pension reform plan. It agreed to scrap, for now at least, a proposal to raise the full-benefits retirement age from 62 to 64. Unlike in the United States, the French government plays a huge role in the retirement plans of individuals in France, both as a source of funds and as overseer and guarantor of the pension system. The raised age had infuriated moderate unions that the government of President Emmanuel Macron badly needs on its side. Mr. Macron has insisted the French need to work longer to strengthen a generous retirement system that is one of the world’s most generous but may be heading toward a $19 billion deficit.  On Saturday, with a crippling transport strike already in its sixth week, Mr. Macron’s government backed down, announcing that it would “withdraw” the new age limit, and put off decisions on financing the system until it gets a report on the money problem “between now and the end of April.” But the government did not entirely rule out the idea of reintroducing a new retirement age if funding solutions to the pensions deficit are not reached. And the government’s concession is unlikely to end either the strike or the demonstrations. The more militant unions — and the ones most heavily represented in the railways and the Paris subway — are demanding that Mr. Macron abandon his entire reform plan. The demand in the streets Saturday was for precisely that. The mood was militant, and the more violent demonstrators once again clashed with the police, even as they sowed a trail of damage through eastern Paris. A bank branch was sacked, and bus shelters smashed and fires set. Unions said 150,000 protesters were in the streets of Paris on Saturday. “We’ve got to continue to mobilize, until they pull the whole plan, pure and simple,” Eric Coquerel, a representative in Parliament and a leading voice in the far-left France Unbowed party, told French television Saturday afternoon, as police sirens blared in the background. Mr. Macron’s prime minister, Edouard Philippe, announced the concession. The moderate French Democratic Confederation of Labor, or CFDT, which has long been calling for the withdrawal of the new retirement age, welcomed the government’s move on Saturday, which it said had shown “the government’s willingness to compromise.” The far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, called the government’s move a “dishonest” negotiating tactic. “You introduce something that’s unacceptable, and then you withdraw it,” she told French media. Like other opposition figures, Ms. Le Pen has been demanding the government withdraw its whole plan. “Nothing justifies this reform,” she said. Mr. Macron has insisted that his retirement plan represents a fair, rational response to the new world of work, where careers are interrupted and French citizens no longer stay in the same job for life. The plan would replace the current system of 42 different pension regimes, most tailored to match individual professions, with a single, points-based system that will be the same for everybody. Workers would accumulate points, then cash them in at the end. Bus drivers in Toulouse would get the same retirement benefits as those in Paris — not now the case, as the Paris system has some of the country’s most generous benefits. Now, workers in the private and public sector get pension benefits based on the salaries of their best working years. That system would end. The French, though, are uneasy with Mr. Macron’s proposals. Although polls show they support some form of universal pension plan, they are also deeply attached to a system which has achieved among the lowest old-age poverty rates in the world. Faced with weeks of strikes and mass demonstrations that have ripped into the economy, Mr. Macron’s government has been forced to carve out a series of concessions to individual professions in recent days — the police, dancers at the Paris Opera, nurses, airline flight attendants, pilots — moving back toward precisely the same type of tailored retirement structure his reform sought to end. On Saturday crowds of strikers, unionists and hard-core demonstrators began gathering early, with the sprawling Place de la Nation in eastern Paris packed by early afternoon. Revolutionary hymns from Latin America blared over the loudspeakers, as did rap mocking Mr. Macron. Philippe Martinez, leader of the hard-line General Confederation of Workers, or CGT, which is calling for scrapping the whole reform, said in a brief interview before the start of the march that the “government has had its back up against the wall for some time. But it is obstinately refusing to listen to the opinions of the majority of French.” Later, Mr. Martinez, at the head of the march, told reporters the issue of the new age limit “is a red herring.” The solution to the pensions-funding problem was simple, he insisted: raise salaries. ']","Faced with an unrelenting protest over proposed changes in France’s generous pension system, officials withdraw a move to raise the full-benefit retirement age to 64 from the present 62. "
"In Blow to Beijing, Taiwan Re-elects Tsai Ing-wen as President",2020-01-11,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Horton,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s voters delivered a stinging rebuke of China’s rising authoritarianism on Saturday by re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen, who vowed to preserve the island’s sovereignty in the face of Beijing’s intensifying efforts to bring it under its control.  Ms. Tsai’s victory highlighted how successfully her campaign had tapped into an electorate that is increasingly wary of China’s intentions. It also found momentum from months of protests in Hong Kong against Beijing’s encroachment on the semiautonomous Chinese territory’s freedoms.  For China’s ruling Communist Party, the outcome is a dramatic display of the power of Hong Kong’s antigovernment protest movement to influence attitudes toward the mainland in other regions the party deems critical to its interests.  China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, has warned Taiwan that unification between the sides was inevitable. His party has sought to court Taiwanese with opportunities to work in the mainland while isolating Ms. Tsai’s administration and said that China would use force, if necessary, to prevent the island from taking steps toward formal independence. The vote, which was a reversal of Ms. Tsai’s political fortunes, suggested that Beijing’s pressure campaign had backfired. It could widen the political and cultural gulf across the Taiwan Strait and might raise the specter of armed conflict, which could have implications for the United States.  In her victory speech, Ms. Tsai called for unity as she pledged to work to defend the island’s sovereignty and improve the economy. “With each presidential election, Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our democratic way of life,” she said at a news conference in Taipei. “We must work to keep our country safe and defend our sovereignty.” The vote drew a large turnout including thousands who flew home from abroad. Lines of voters snaked through schools and other public spaces. Willie Yu, 23, who cast his ballot at the Taipei Municipal Jinhua Junior High School, said he had come out to vote because “I hope Taiwan can preserve its democracy and freedom.” Ms. Tsai’s main opponent, Han Kuo-yu, a populist mayor, conceded defeat on Saturday evening, saying he had called Ms. Tsai to congratulate her on her re-election.  “I can only say that I didn’t work hard enough to live up to everyone’s expectations,” he told his supporters. During his campaign, Mr. Han had pledged to restore closer relations with the mainland but then found himself on the defensive because of China’s increasingly authoritarian actions. Ms. Tsai and her supporters had cited the Hong Kong protests as an ominous example of what unification on the Communist Party’s terms would portend for Taiwan’s young and vibrant, if messy at times, democratic society. “Taiwan must be Taiwan,” Hiro Huang, a 30-year-old filmmaker, said this past week at a rally for Ms. Tsai and her party, the Democratic Progress Party. He cited national security and the protection of Taiwan’s sovereignty as the principal reasons for his vote for Ms. Tsai.  “After all, we are completely different from the system on the other side,” he added. That much was clear in the campaign, in which the candidates offered divergent visions of Taiwan’s economic and political path and contested them openly in ways that would be unthinkable in today’s China, where the party cracks down on dissent. In China, a spokesman for the department overseeing Taiwan affairs, Ma Xiaoguang, issued a statement that avoided even mentioning Ms. Tsai’s name but warned that Beijing resolutely opposed any form of “separatist conspiracy” in Taiwan, the Xinhua news agency reported late Saturday. Ms. Tsai defeated Mr. Han and a third candidate, James Soong. She exceeded her vote total from four years ago, surpassing eight million votes, the most garnered by any candidate since direct presidential elections began in 1996, according to unofficial results.  The victory completed a remarkable comeback for Ms. Tsai, who only a year ago appeared to have little chance of winning. The election underscored support for a distinct Taiwanese identity and the extent to which public sentiment had drifted further from the idea of a single, unified China.  China’s efforts to intimidate Taiwan allowed her to portray herself as a defender of the island’s democracy and sovereignty. In the months leading up to the vote, officials warned that China was trying to sway the outcome with online disinformation campaigns. A would-be defector detailed what he claimed were covert efforts by Chinese military intelligence to manipulate the outcome of elections in Taiwan. Taiwan became the Republic of China after the national Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the island following the Communist revolution in 1949. It has never been part of the People’s Republic of China, and since its transition to democracy following decades of martial law, it has developed a distinct identity that makes unification with China seem more unlikely than ever — despite Mr. Xi’s efforts to encourage it. Mr. Xi has said that Taiwan could join the People’s Republic and still preserve its political and social freedoms under the “one country, two systems” political formula that governs Hong Kong and Macau, former colonies that returned to Chinese rule in the 1990s. Ms. Tsai has rejected the proposal. “Young people in Hong Kong have used their lives and blood and tears to show us that ‘one country, two systems’ is not possible,” Ms. Tsai said at a large rally in Taipei on Friday night. “Tomorrow it’s the turn of our young people in Taiwan to show them that the values of democracy and freedom will overcome all difficulties.” China’s efforts to isolate Ms. Tsai’s administration and to punish the island economically — by, forbidding tourist travel by Chinese citizens this year, for example — failed to deliver the desired outcome. Ms. Tsai’s government has presided over an improving economy, with the lowest unemployment rate in two decades (3.8 percent on average) and rising wages. She also lured manufacturers back from overseas, which might be a benefit of the trade war between the United States and China.  The question now is whether China will change its tactics, reaching out at last to Ms. Tsai’s administration or, as some hawkish voices in Beijing have suggested, turning to more forceful actions.  “Xi Jinping will be under enormous pressure at home for failing the ‘one country, two system’ model,” said Su Chi, a former legislator and government minister for the Kuomintang who served as an adviser to Mr. Han’s campaign. He warned that Mr. Xi’s government could very likely take steps to halt what officials there view as Taiwan’s further drift away from the possibility of unification. “Short of military conflict, short of an invasion,” he said, “it will take punitive actions to teach Taiwan a lesson.” The potential for military conflict has always hovered over the relationship. At a conference in Beijing last month, hawkish officials openly called for China to take more aggressive measures. Wang Hongguang, a retired lieutenant general in the People’s Liberation Army, declared that “the window for peaceful reunification has already closed in Taiwan.” In her first term, Ms. Tsai sought to revive the island’s military in the face of a much larger, more ambitious project by Mr. Xi to modernize the People’s Liberation Army, particularly its ability to project naval power beyond its coastal waters. China’s newest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, has twice sailed through the Taiwan Strait during the presidential campaign. Only days before the vote, Taiwan’s top uniformed officer, Gen. Shen Yi-ming, died when the American Black Hawk helicopter he was flying in crashed near the capital. Ms. Tsai’s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, sought to forge closer economic and political ties with the mainland, and even met with Mr. Xi in 2015. Without a drastic shift in tactics by Beijing, the prospect of warming relations during a second Tsai term appears slim. “This cold confrontation between the two sides of the strait will continue,” Zhu Songling, a professor at Beijing Union University, said. Beijing has insisted that Ms. Tsai disavow the provision of her party’s charter recognizing Taiwan as an independent country as a condition for any improvement in relations. Ms. Tsai has refused, carefully maintaining a balance among her own supporters between a declaration of independence and de facto steps to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties with other nations, especially the United States and Japan. Mr. Han, who in 2018 was elected mayor of the southern city Kaohsiung, said that Ms. Tsai and her party had harmed Taiwan’s economy by pivoting away from reliance on China. At a Thursday-night rally attended by tens of thousands, he led supporters in a call and response. “Dear friends, are you satisfied with the current situation?” he asked the crowd, which responded in unison: “We’re dissatisfied!” At the Kuomintang’s office in Kaohsiung on Saturday, Tsai Jie-wen, a 60-year-old retired soldier, blamed the president for the chill in relations with Beijing.  “There is no diplomatic contact with the mainland China at all,” he said. “This is a very, very big loss for Taiwanese people.” In the end, however, people seemed more worried about the fate of Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. “Having seen what’s happening in Hong Kong, I get it: the so-called one country, two systems is a Communist lie,” said Allen Hsu, a student in Hong Kong who returned home to vote. “I hope Taiwan doesn’t end up sharing the same fate, with my children having to take to the streets 20 years from now to oppose the Communist Party.” Amy Chang Chien in Taiwan contributed reporting. Claire Fu and Amber Wang contributed research from Beijing. ']",The victory was a remarkable comeback for Ms. Tsai and suggested that Beijing’s pressure campaign had backfired. 
"Harry, Meghan and Britain: When Did the Fairy Tale Go Sour?",2020-01-11,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Once upon a short time ago, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were lauded as the breath of fresh air that the British monarchy needed to become more inclusive and modern.  Then the couple shocked the nation and rattled the royals by announcing on Instagram that they were all but divorcing “The Firm” — a term for the royal family — and planning to split their time between Britain and North America. By Friday, Meghan had already decamped to Canada — where in another life she had filmed the TV show “Suits” — to be with their son, her spokeswoman told reporters.  A lot has been written about the shocking move. But here’s a reminder of how we got to this point. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met on a blind date and started dating in July 2016. The British tabloids instantly churned out sensationalized coverage of Ms. Markle, the once-married actress-daughter of a white father and black mother.  They described her as Prince Harry’s “saucy divorcee,” said she had engaged in “raunchy snaps” and suggested she might have still been dating an ex-boyfriend when she met Harry.  The prince soon released a statement on Nov. 8, 2016, that served a dual purpose: It acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Markle and berated the British news media for their treatment of her.  That set the tone for the relationship between the couple and the tabloids: Harry, who had long blamed the paparazzi for the car crash in 1997 in Paris that killed his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, had drawn a royal line. “It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm,” the statement read. “This is not a game — it is her life and his.” [Analysis: ‘Megxit’ is the new Brexit in a Britain split by age and politics.] More evidence of their relationship emerged: They’re buying a Christmas tree in London! Going to see the Northern Lights in Norway! Holding hands at a friend’s wedding in Jamaica! After Ms. Markle gave a revelatory interview to Vanity Fair in Sept. 2017, it became clear the two were in it for the long haul.  “We’re two people who are really happy and in love,” she said. Two months later, they announced their engagement. “I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction, after the five to six months we had to ourselves, of what actually happened from then,” Prince Harry said in their interview with the BBC.  A week later, The Daily Mail published a story about Ms. Markle’s supposed ambitions that included racist tropes. “Now that’s upwardly mobile! How in 150 years, Meghan Markle’s family went from cotton slaves to royalty via freedom in the U.S. Civil War … while her dad’s ancestors included a maid at Windsor Castle,” the headline read.  But the world watched as the couple celebrated their lavish union at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their wedding, of a kind the royals had never experienced before — the chapel of the thousand-year-old castle echoed with the sermon of an African-American bishop and a gospel choir — was viewed by nearly two billion people around the globe, according to the BBC.  It was heralded as the dawn of a new era for the British royal family.  Ahead of the wedding, the tabloids turned a relentlessly unflattering lens on Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas, a 73-year-old former Hollywood lighting director who lived in Mexico. The theme: Would he or wouldn’t he attend the wedding?  One tabloid got him to cooperate with staged photos. Then, The Daily Mail reported, accurately, that Ms. Markle’s father had decided to skip the ceremony and would not walk her down the aisle.  Prince Charles ended up doing the honors. But a steady stream of unsavory stories quoting Meghan’s half siblings — especially an estranged half sister — continued to appear. Last February, The Mail on Sunday published heartfelt excerpts from what it said was a handwritten letter that Meghan had sent to her estranged father, in which she said he had “broken her heart into a million pieces.” In October, it was revealed that the Duchess of Sussex — Meghan’s title since her wedding — had filed a lawsuit against the tabloid and its parent company over the publication of the letter.  Prince Harry — who had started legal proceedings against the owners of two British tabloids over accusations that they had hacked his phone — said in a statement that Meghan had become a victim of “a ruthless campaign” by British tabloids, and that he had been “a silent witness to her private suffering for too long.” There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious,” Prince Harry said, “and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been. The Mail on Sunday said that it “stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.” Amid tabloid rumblings, the royal couple announced they were expecting their first child, but the harsh coverage continued apace. Meghan was criticized for showing off her baby bump, and for flying to New York for her baby shower in February. But Prince Harry could barely contain his glee when he faced a news camera to announce their son’s birth on May 6, 2019. It would be two days before they presented Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor to the world.  The couple unfurled Archie piece by piece: parts of his face, fingers and feet on Instagram, often in sepia-toned or black-and-white images. As the media fretted that it was not allowed to photograph the newborn in the traditional way, other royal watchers had one question: Is he ginger?  Yes, it appears so. In November 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would move out of Nottingham Cottage, on the grounds of Kensington Palace, where Prince Harry’s brother, William, and William’s wife and children live, and take up residence in Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.  The tabloids reveled in what they saw as a royal rift, branding Meghan as “demanding” and a “diva.”  In April, the tabloids seized on the cost of the refurbishment of Frogmore: 2.4 million pounds of taxpayers’ money, or more than $3 million, according to the BBC. Rumors of a rift between the brothers grew stronger, fueled by images of their public appearances. For example, the brothers arrived separately for the service at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor on Easter Sunday; a video taken on the day showed them appearing to avoid addressing each other despite standing close.  On June 20, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would split from the Royal Foundation, established by Princes William and Harry in 2009, and create their own.  In September, during an official tour of Africa, Prince Harry addressed his relationship with his brother in an ITV documentary. “Inevitably stuff happens, but we’re brothers, we will always be brothers,” he said. “We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him and I know he will always be there for me.” But the interview that made Britain spill its collective tea came from Meghan. “Not many people have asked if I’m O.K.,” the Duchess of Sussex said poignantly of adjusting to the pressures of her royal role, the harsh media coverage and her struggles as a new mother. In November, it was announced that the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex, and their son, Archie, would not be spending Christmas with the rest of the royal family at Sandringham, the queen’s country retreat in eastern England. They instead took a holiday break in Canada with the duchess’s mother, Doria Ragland. In the queen’s annual Christmas message, the faces of Prince Harry, Meghan and Archie were nowhere to be seen amid the other photos on the desk where she sat. On Jan. 8, the couple announced their semi-resignation. The news spread like wildfire just as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Harry’s brother, celebrated her 38th birthday, on Jan. 9. A divided nation digested the news that the couple were stepping back as senior members of the royal family and striving to become financially independent. The tabloids erupted with indignant headlines — “They Didn’t Even Tell the Queen.” The general sense was that the couple had unleashed a potentially existential crisis for the royal family, quickly nicknamed “Megxit,” for which the 93-year-old queen and Harry’s father, Prince Charles, were trying to find a “workable solution” in an emergency meeting.']","Not that long ago, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were golden in the eyes of the news media and public.

A Growing U.S. Base Made This Afghan Town. Now It’s Dying.,2020-01-12,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fahim Abed,"['BAGRAM, Afghanistan — Nine years ago, Faiqullah Tajik helped sort laundry at Bagram Air Base, the largest American military outpost in Afghanistan. Mr. Tajik made $600 a month. He liked his job. Mr. Tajik, 25, was laid off in 2011, along with thousands of other local residents of the nearby town of Bagram, as American forces started to withdraw from the country. Now he runs a shop adjacent to the main gate, selling American refuse from the sprawling facility: a discarded treadmill, used jugs, broken printers and computer fans. He makes $60 a month now, at least sometimes, he said. “If the Americans leave, I will close my shop,” Mr. Tajik said. “And I will leave.” Since Mr. Tajik relies on the six-square-mile base for his livelihood, the Taliban will kill him if they return, he said. The town’s location — straddling an important airfield that over the past 40 years has been occupied by two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States — has long kept Bagram in a sort of purgatory. The town depends on the base for its economy and also supplies it with a local work force, making it a prime target for the Taliban. With the Trump administration again engaged in peace talks with the Taliban that are likely to lead to a troop withdrawal, Mr. Tajik and the 80,000 residents of Bagram feel especially vulnerable  to the geopolitical maneuverings of the United States and the fate of a war in its 19th year. “The harm of the base now is not worth it being there,” said Abdul Shokoor, the district governor of Bagram, pointing at the continuously deteriorating security in the district. “And people are not happy with the economic consequences.” With a line of snow-capped mountains as its backdrop, Bagram airfield was built in the 1950s. It became a vital military hub during the Soviet Union’s 10-year occupation of Afghanistan. After the Soviets finished withdrawing in 1989, the Taliban and Northern Alliance fighters fought for the base, sometimes with their trenches at either end.  After the American invasion in 2001, the base ballooned into a small suburb. Engineers added another runway, permanent barracks and a Pizza Hut; at one point, tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers lived within the base’s growing sprawl. The base’s size at the height of the war, when more than 100,000 American troops were in Afghanistan, meant that 80 percent of the town of Bagram’s economy relied on it, Mr. Shokoor said. Bagram is the seat of Bagram District, one of 10 districts in surrounding Parwan Province. The modest town is just west of the base in a network of tan-walled compounds surrounded by green grape vineyards.  More than 3,000 Afghan workers like Mr. Tajik once lived in the town, commuting each day to within the barbed-wire confines of the base. The line at the gate, Mr. Tajik said, held more than 1,000 people some mornings. Now, when he arrives at his shop at sunrise, treading across steel pallets left over from the Soviet occupation, just six or seven employees wait to enter. Bagram started becoming an island unto itself in 2014, when American forces euphemistically ended combat operations and reduced the number of troops in Afghanistan. Because of security concerns on the base, and the town’s shrinking population, many of the local workers have been replaced by foreign contractors.  A “wall” went up between the base and its surrounding community, Mr. Shokoor said. Before, American soldiers would often leave the gates and visit local leaders, listening to residents’ complaints and requests, Mr. Shokoor said. Now, it is just miles of cement walls and guard towers, accompanied by the constant whine of aircraft, occasional rocket attack and roadside bombs. Attacks have become more frequent. In one of the worst, in November 2016, a suicide bomber sneaked onto Bagram Air Base hidden among a group of workers reporting for duty. The blast killed four Americans and wounded more than a dozen others.  The latest was a Taliban bombing that led to a 12-hour firefight at the base on Dec. 11, in which at least two civilians were killed and dozens were wounded. Without the well-paying and steady jobs from the base, people started spending less in the bakeries and surrounding shops in Bagram. Those, too, slowly closed or moved. The economic downturn, also acutely felt in nearby Kabul, the country’s capital, has forced residents to relocate elsewhere in Afghanistan, return to farming, turn to the Taliban or, in increasing numbers, try to leave the country altogether. Nowhere has the base’s declining stature in the community been more acute than in the dozens of scrapyards that ring its borders. The mile-long stretch of vendors who buy wood and refuse from base contractors has been an ever-changing ecosystem.  Sayeed Jamal Nasari started his scrapyard with his father 17 years ago, back when the air base was a cluster of makeshift tents and a small number of American soldiers hunting Al Qaeda in the Hindu Kush. His family employed 100 workers, he said, while the base grew. On some days they would offload 15 trucks’ worth of damaged equipment, piping and wood from used pallets and ammunition crates. Detritus from the American war effort was then growing so fast there was not enough space to burn, bury or destroy all of it at once. His scrapyard proudly displays relics of the American military industrial complex. Humvee lights built in Aurora, Ill., a damaged running machine made in Plymouth, Mich., and the hull of a decrepit front-end loader from West Fargo, N.D., all lay among piles of debris that have leaked off the base over the last 18 years. In the past, hundreds of shops, much like Mr. Tajik’s, would buy from his yard, Mr. Nasari said. Customers would drive the 25 miles from Kabul, often looking for home improvement items. Now there are only dozens of shops left, he said, with one truck a day supplying all of them with trash from the base. At the height of the war, Mr. Nasari made $3,000 to $4,000 a month, he said. In 2014, when the number of American troops in Afghanistan shrank to roughly 10,000 from 26,000, he made more than $100,000 as excess equipment and trash was jettisoned from their headquarters, he said. But with fewer American and Western troops in the country, and more advanced trash facilities on the air base, Mr. Nasari’s business has slumped. He has one employee and two dogs that limp among the rubbish and scrap, often resting in the shade of a torn, bleached green military cot. “If the Americans leave, I will just sit and try and sell everything here,” Mr. Nasari said. “What else do I have to do?”']","Bagram’s economy is tightly bound to the American military, but what once made it a boom town today leaves it more a target."
Iran Says It Unintentionally Shot Down Ukrainian Airliner,2020-01-11,By Farnaz Fassihi,"[""Iran’s military announced early Saturday that it had accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, blaming human error because of what it called the plane’s sharp, unexpected turn toward a sensitive military base. After days of tension since the jet crashed near Tehran on Wednesday, the same day that Iranian missiles struck American bases in Iraq, the admission was a stunning reversal. Iran initially maintained that mechanical issues had brought the Boeing airliner down, killing all 176 people aboard.  “The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,” President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter soon after the military released its statement. He offered condolences to the victims’ families and said investigations were underway. The military said the person responsible would face legal consequences.  International pressure had been building on Iran to take responsibility. American and allied intelligence assessments had already concluded that Iranian missiles brought down the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, most likely by accident, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. “The little credibility that the Islamic Republic had among its supporters suffered a major blow tonight,” said Rouzbeh MirEmbrahim, an independent Iran analyst in New York and a consultant with the United Nations. “This tragedy undermines the image Iran has cultivated as a military power and weakened it significantly both regionally and internationally.” On social media, Iranians began expressing anger toward the military soon after the announcement, many of them using the term “harshest revenge,” which officials had repeatedly promised in the wake of the American drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a powerful Revolutionary Guards commander, last week. “They were supposed to take their harsh revenge against America, not the people,” wrote Mojtaba Fathi, a journalist. [Read: Iran’s only female Olympic medalist has defected from the country over “lies” and “injustice.”] The Iranian military's statement said the plane “took the flying posture and altitude of an enemy target” as it came close to an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base. It said that “under these circumstances, because of human error,” the plane “came under fire.” The military said it would undertake “major reform in operations of all armed forces” to make sure that such an error never happened again. It said Revolutionary Guards officials had been ordered to appear on state media and give the public a full explanation. In a statement of his own, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tried to place some of the blame on the United States, saying on Twitter that the disaster was “caused by U.S. adventurism.” The military’s statement said there had been information suggesting the United States was “preparing to aerially target sensitive defense and key sites and multiple targets in our country, and this led to even more sensitive defense posture by our antiaircraft units.” The State Department had no immediate comment late Friday about Iran’s admission of responsibility.  Suspicions that an Iranian missile had brought down the plane were raised immediately after the crash Wednesday morning — just hours after Iran fired missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American forces. The Iranians asked the National Transportation Safety Board to help with the investigation, and the State Department granted waivers to allow the American agency to help. A senior administration official said Friday that he thought the Iranians wanted American investigators there to keep up the appearance that they did not know what had caused the crash. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss these matters publicly, said the Iranian military had poor command and control, and that this was reflected in what had happened with the airplane. Communications among officials and between units are often lacking, he said, and confusion can be the norm. Western analysts often overestimate the capability of parts of the Iranian military, he said. State television in Iran aired footage that it said showed two flight recorder units recovered from the crash site. Processing their data could take more than a month, and the investigation could take up to two years, Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigation team, said Friday.  The military announcement came as something of a surprise. As late as Friday night, officials were weighing whether to blame faulty jet equipment in acknowledging that Iranian missiles brought down the jet, according to four Iranians familiar with the deliberations. Until Saturday, Ukraine’s main intelligence agency, known as the S.B.U., said only that it had narrowed the cause of the crash to a missile strike or a terrorist act and that it could not confirm Western intelligence that an Iranian missile system was likely to blame.  An Iranian report released on Thursday said that the plane, bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was in flames before it hit the ground but sent no distress signal.  Video verified by The New York Times and published on Thursday appeared to show a missile fired from Iranian territory hitting the plane. The video showed a small explosion as the plane flew above Parand, a city near the airport — where it stopped transmitting its signal before it crashed. The plane turned back toward the airport before it exploded and crashed, other videos verified by The Times showed. When Iran began firing missiles early on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani by the United States in Baghdad, international airlines rerouted flights away from Iran, and the Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the airspace in the region.  After the crash, experts raised questions about why the Iranian authorities had not stopped flights in and out of Tehran.  In Iran, a debate over how much blame the government bears threatened to destroy the national solidarity that followed the country’s conflict with the United States. Many Iranians said that their anger over the lack of accountability at the highest levels of government had quickly returned. On Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States and its allies had intelligence showing that the passenger jet had been shot down. He was the first American official to publicly confirm the intelligence assessments. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, citing a preliminary review of the evidence, called for a full investigation “to be convinced beyond all doubt.” The jetliner was carrying 57 Canadians among its 176 passengers and crew. “We recognize that this may have been done accidentally,” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. “The evidence suggests very clearly a possible and probable cause for the crash.” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made clear on Friday that Western governments had not initially shared the evidence underpinning their assessments that Iran had brought down the Ukrainian jet, though later a spokeswoman said that American officials had handed over more information. Ukrainian officials also analyzed the plane’s flight pattern on Friday and determined it had stayed within the normal corridor for flights out of Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said at a news conference. “Our goal is to ascertain the undeniable truth,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement on Friday. “We believe this is the responsibility of the whole international community before the families of the dead and the memory of the victims of the catastrophe.” Reporting was contributed by Niraj Chokshi, Anton Troianovski, Julian E. Barnes, Karen Zraick, Edward Wong and Michael Levenson.""]","“The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,” President Hassan Rouhani said, as Iran reversed its claims that mechanical failure was to blame."
Rural Venezuela Crumbles as President Shores Up the Capital and His Power,2020-01-13,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['PARMANA, Venezuela — From his palace in Caracas, President Nicolás Maduro projects an image of strength and his grip on power appears secure. Residents have a regular supply of electricity and gasoline. Shops are bursting with imported goods. But beyond the city, this facade of order quickly melts away. In order to preserve the quality of life of his most important backers, the country’s political and military elites, his administration has poured the country’s dwindling resources into Caracas and forsaken large swaths of Venezuela. “Venezuela is broken as a state, as a country,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst in Caracas. “The few available resources are invested in the capital to protect the seat of power, creating a ministate amid the collapse.” Across much of the country, basic government functions like policing, road maintenance, health care and public utilities have been abandoned. The only remaining evidence of the state in Parmana, a fishing village on the banks of the Orinoco River, is the three teachers who remain at the school, which lacks food, books, and even a marker for the board. The priest was the first to leave Parmana. As the economic crisis deepened, the social workers, the police, the community doctor and several of the schoolteachers deserted. Overwhelmed by crime, the village’s residents say, they turned to Colombian guerrillas for protection. “We are forgotten,” said Herminia Martínez, 83, as she stooped with a machete in the tropical heat to tend an overgrown bean field. “There’s no government here.” A year ago, it seemed, for a moment, that Mr. Maduro’s critics might have a chance to oust him. An opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, had staged the biggest challenge to Mr. Maduro’s rule to date by claiming the presidency and quickly winning support from the United States and almost 60 other countries.  Now Mr. Maduro’s adversaries have lost momentum. The Trump administration remains supportive of Mr. Guaidó: On Monday, the United States issued new sanctions against government allies who tried to block him from assuming the leadership of the country’s National Assembly. Despite this pressure, Mr. Maduro’s tenure seems secure, in part because of how well Mr. Maduro’s policies have bolstered Caracas. [Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.] But the economy, suffering from poor management, diminished oil and gold exports and crippling sanctions by the United States, is now entering its seventh year of a devastating contraction. This lasting depression, along with the retrenchment of the state, has allowed much of the nation’s infrastructure to fall into neglect.  It has also led to Venezuela’s breakup into localized economies with only nominal links to Caracas. As runaway inflation rendered the country’s currency, the bolívar, practically worthless, dollars, euros, gold and the currencies of three neighboring countries began to circulate in different parts of Venezuela. Barter is rampant. “Each place survives in its own way, as best it can,” said Armando Chacín, head of Venezuela’s ranchers’ federation. “They are completely different economies.” Outside Caracas, citizens of what was once Latin America’s wealthiest nation can be relegated to surviving in what are nearly preindustrial conditions.  About half the residents of Venezuela’s seven major cities are exposed to daily blackouts and three-quarters get by without a reliable water supply, according to a September survey by the Venezuelan Public Services Observatory, a nonprofit. In Parmana, flooding last year washed away the only road out of town, leaving the village without regular deliveries of food, fuel for the power plant and gasoline. To get by, its 450 remaining residents have resorted to clearing fields with machetes, rowing their fishing boats and using the beans they grow themselves as currency. After decades of lavish oil spending, Venezuela’s government is running out of money. The country’s gross domestic product has shrunk 73 percent since Mr. Maduro took office in 2013 — one of the biggest declines in modern global history, according to estimates by the opposition-controlled congress, based on official statistics and data from the International Monetary Fund. Unable to pay meaningful salaries to millions of state employees, the government has looked the other way as they resorted to graft, influence peddling and side businesses to make ends meet. The official salary of Venezuela’s top military general is $13 a month, according to Citizens’s Control, a Venezuelan research group. In Caracas, the private sector — maligned for years under the Socialist government of Mr. Maduro and his popular predecessor, Hugo Chávez — has been allowed to fill some of the gaps in consumer products left by declining state imports.  As once sacrosanct economic controls disappeared overnight, the capital filled up with hundreds of new shops and showrooms, offering everything from imported sports cars to American-made seaweed chips. And the burden of the country’s collapse has fallen largely on Venezuela’s provinces, where many residents have been effectively cut off from the central government. Regions close to Venezuela’s borders have resorted to smuggling and cross-border trade for survival. Agricultural towns in Venezuela’s interior have sunk into subsistence, as the collapse of the road system and gasoline shortages decimated domestic trade. Tourism hot spots have survived on private investment and by catering to the elites.  Local military commanders and a few ruling party strongmen with limited ties to Mr. Maduro have taken political control of far-flung regions. As national law enforcement shrank, irregular armed groups took their place, including Colombian Marxist guerrillas, former right-wing paramilitaries, criminal gangs, pro-Maduro militias and indigenous self-defense groups. Across the Venezuelan interior, these groups have often taken charge of enforcing business contracts, punishing common crimes and even settling divorces, according to dozens of testimonies of residents collected over months of reporting in three regions. The collapse of the Venezuelan state has run its course in Parmana, a large and once prosperous village of fishermen and farmers in Venezuela’s central plains. For lack of pay, the local police unit packed up and left one day in 2018, followed by the public workers who ran social programs. Shortly after, locals chased away the village’s detachment of National Guards for drunkenness and extortion. To replace the guards, the village leaders decided to travel to the closest gold mine controlled by Colombian guerrillas to ask them to set up a post in Parmana. Over the past four years, to protect their supply lines, the guerrillas had wiped out the river pirates who had terrorized Parmana’s fishermen, robbing their boats of motors and killing several people. “We need authority here,” said Gustavo Ledezma, a shop owner and community sheriff.  The guerrillas “bring order,” he said. “They don’t mess around.” Parmana’s descent into lawless subsistence is a steep downfall from its glory days of exporting rice, beans and cotton. The village’s wetlands and pristine springs drew throngs of holidaymakers every year. “Parmana, Parmana, how beautiful it is to wake up with you,” went a song by Venezuela’s legendary country bard, Simon Díaz. Mr. Chávez, the former president, had seen in the region’s agricultural potential the future of the Venezuelan economy. A decade ago, he spent at least a billion dollars building a bridge over the Orinoco to connect the region to Brazilian markets.  The bridge, unfinished, is now abandoned. Parmana’s springs dried up after a politically-connected landowner diverted the water to his cotton fields in 2013, destroying the tourism industry. Now, on the village’s dusty streets, desperate fishermen stop the occasional visiting drivers in search of gasoline for their boat motors.  A farming family sat by a pile of watermelons. They had tried sending a phone message to a wholesaler to pick up their harvest, but the cellular tower had been down for two weeks, and they were unsure if he would come, or when.  “We have to depend on each other now, not on the state,” said Ana Rengifo, the community council leader. In October, the village doctor went to the closest town to find medications for his empty shelves. He never came back. The abandoned Catholic church is filled with bats, its pews chopped up for firewood. The pastor of the local evangelical group still comes once a week. The group meets daily to sing for salvation, but breaks up at sunset for lack of electricity. The village ambulance rusts in a shed without tires, its driver having left that job three years ago to plant beans to survive.  At the school, after singing the national anthem and doing calisthenics, the students study basic reading and math, but go home after an hour or two. Teachers say many of them get too hungry to focus. Despite the town’s collapse, most here prefer to remain on their land, where they can grow some food, to risking hunger elsewhere. “You go outside and the hunger kills you,” said Inselina Coro, a 29-year-old mother of four. “At least here you go to the river and get a fish.” Ms. Coro lives with her children and her boyfriend, a fisherman, in a one-room shack of corrugated iron and dirt floors. The six of them share two hammocks. Her oldest daughter, Ana Herrera, 14, is pregnant, but the family has no means to take her to a doctor. Ms. Coro’s dreams for her family are confined to moving to Caicara, a dilapidated town about three hours upstream. The reason? “There is electricity,” she said.']",
A Growing U.S. Base Made This Afghan Town. Now It’s Dying.,2020-01-12,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fahim Abed,"['BAGRAM, Afghanistan — Nine years ago, Faiqullah Tajik helped sort laundry at Bagram Air Base, the largest American military outpost in Afghanistan. Mr. Tajik made $600 a month. He liked his job. Mr. Tajik, 25, was laid off in 2011, along with thousands of other local residents of the nearby town of Bagram, as American forces started to withdraw from the country. Now he runs a shop adjacent to the main gate, selling American refuse from the sprawling facility: a discarded treadmill, used jugs, broken printers and computer fans. He makes $60 a month now, at least sometimes, he said. “If the Americans leave, I will close my shop,” Mr. Tajik said. “And I will leave.” Since Mr. Tajik relies on the six-square-mile base for his livelihood, the Taliban will kill him if they return, he said. The town’s location — straddling an important airfield that over the past 40 years has been occupied by two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States — has long kept Bagram in a sort of purgatory. The town depends on the base for its economy and also supplies it with a local work force, making it a prime target for the Taliban. With the Trump administration again engaged in peace talks with the Taliban that are likely to lead to a troop withdrawal, Mr. Tajik and the 80,000 residents of Bagram feel especially vulnerable  to the geopolitical maneuverings of the United States and the fate of a war in its 19th year. “The harm of the base now is not worth it being there,” said Abdul Shokoor, the district governor of Bagram, pointing at the continuously deteriorating security in the district. “And people are not happy with the economic consequences.” With a line of snow-capped mountains as its backdrop, Bagram airfield was built in the 1950s. It became a vital military hub during the Soviet Union’s 10-year occupation of Afghanistan. After the Soviets finished withdrawing in 1989, the Taliban and Northern Alliance fighters fought for the base, sometimes with their trenches at either end.  After the American invasion in 2001, the base ballooned into a small suburb. Engineers added another runway, permanent barracks and a Pizza Hut; at one point, tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers lived within the base’s growing sprawl. The base’s size at the height of the war, when more than 100,000 American troops were in Afghanistan, meant that 80 percent of the town of Bagram’s economy relied on it, Mr. Shokoor said. Bagram is the seat of Bagram District, one of 10 districts in surrounding Parwan Province. The modest town is just west of the base in a network of tan-walled compounds surrounded by green grape vineyards.  More than 3,000 Afghan workers like Mr. Tajik once lived in the town, commuting each day to within the barbed-wire confines of the base. The line at the gate, Mr. Tajik said, held more than 1,000 people some mornings. Now, when he arrives at his shop at sunrise, treading across steel pallets left over from the Soviet occupation, just six or seven employees wait to enter. Bagram started becoming an island unto itself in 2014, when American forces euphemistically ended combat operations and reduced the number of troops in Afghanistan. Because of security concerns on the base, and the town’s shrinking population, many of the local workers have been replaced by foreign contractors.  A “wall” went up between the base and its surrounding community, Mr. Shokoor said. Before, American soldiers would often leave the gates and visit local leaders, listening to residents’ complaints and requests, Mr. Shokoor said. Now, it is just miles of cement walls and guard towers, accompanied by the constant whine of aircraft, occasional rocket attack and roadside bombs. Attacks have become more frequent. In one of the worst, in November 2016, a suicide bomber sneaked onto Bagram Air Base hidden among a group of workers reporting for duty. The blast killed four Americans and wounded more than a dozen others.  The latest was a Taliban bombing that led to a 12-hour firefight at the base on Dec. 11, in which at least two civilians were killed and dozens were wounded. Without the well-paying and steady jobs from the base, people started spending less in the bakeries and surrounding shops in Bagram. Those, too, slowly closed or moved. The economic downturn, also acutely felt in nearby Kabul, the country’s capital, has forced residents to relocate elsewhere in Afghanistan, return to farming, turn to the Taliban or, in increasing numbers, try to leave the country altogether. Nowhere has the base’s declining stature in the community been more acute than in the dozens of scrapyards that ring its borders. The mile-long stretch of vendors who buy wood and refuse from base contractors has been an ever-changing ecosystem.  Sayeed Jamal Nasari started his scrapyard with his father 17 years ago, back when the air base was a cluster of makeshift tents and a small number of American soldiers hunting Al Qaeda in the Hindu Kush. His family employed 100 workers, he said, while the base grew. On some days they would offload 15 trucks’ worth of damaged equipment, piping and wood from used pallets and ammunition crates. Detritus from the American war effort was then growing so fast there was not enough space to burn, bury or destroy all of it at once. His scrapyard proudly displays relics of the American military industrial complex. Humvee lights built in Aurora, Ill., a damaged running machine made in Plymouth, Mich., and the hull of a decrepit front-end loader from West Fargo, N.D., all lay among piles of debris that have leaked off the base over the last 18 years. In the past, hundreds of shops, much like Mr. Tajik’s, would buy from his yard, Mr. Nasari said. Customers would drive the 25 miles from Kabul, often looking for home improvement items. Now there are only dozens of shops left, he said, with one truck a day supplying all of them with trash from the base. At the height of the war, Mr. Nasari made $3,000 to $4,000 a month, he said. In 2014, when the number of American troops in Afghanistan shrank to roughly 10,000 from 26,000, he made more than $100,000 as excess equipment and trash was jettisoned from their headquarters, he said. But with fewer American and Western troops in the country, and more advanced trash facilities on the air base, Mr. Nasari’s business has slumped. He has one employee and two dogs that limp among the rubbish and scrap, often resting in the shade of a torn, bleached green military cot. “If the Americans leave, I will just sit and try and sell everything here,” Mr. Nasari said. “What else do I have to do?”']","Bagram’s economy is tightly bound to the American military, but what once made it a boom town today leaves it more a target."
Will Canadians Have to Pay the Security Costs for Harry and Meghan?,2020-01-13,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — News from Queen Elizabeth II on Monday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will be living part-time in Canada was greeted with a mix of enthusiasm and concern that Canada could end up faced with a hefty bill for hosting them. Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the monarchy at Carleton University, said that although monarchists and celebrity watchers will be happy, others could be annoyed if Canada ended up having to foot the cost for their security. There was also a camp of people consumed by “indifference,” he added. “People who care about the monarchy and celebrity will view this in a good light,” he said. “Now the question will be who is going to pay the tab for the security bill.” [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] One reader commented on the website of The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper: “Welcome to Canada but I trust you will be paying for any security or other costs. You cannot benefit from your royal station.” The sentiment was echoed by other readers. Bill Morneau, Canada’s finance minister, told reporters on Monday that the government had not yet decided if it would cover some of the security costs related to the royal move. “No, we haven’t spent any time thinking about this issue,” he was quoted as saying by the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster. “We obviously are always looking to make sure, as a member of the Commonwealth, we play a role. We have not had any discussions on that subject at this time.” While the royal couple have professed to wanting to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada. Speaking before Monday’s announcement, Professor Lagassé noted that,  although the queen is Prince Harry’s grandmother and is an enduring presence on the Canadian 20-dollar bill, she was not a Canadian citizen and that her status as Canada’s head of state did not automatically confer legal rights to her grandson. He added that while Canada is a constitutional monarchy and there was little enthusiasm for upending its constitutional structure, the setup was nevertheless viewed by many as a vestige of the past. “If you were to remake Canada now it wouldn’t be a monarchy,” he said. “At the moment, the royal family don’t live here or cost us anything. But if they did, then attitudes toward them could change.” The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment. In December, around the time of the couple’s Canadian vacation, he had extended them a warm welcome on Twitter. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here,” he wrote.']",Some in Canada worry that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be expensive to protect.
"In Statement, Queen ‘Supportive’ of Prince Harry and Meghan’s ‘New Life’",2020-01-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II, seeking to defuse a spiraling crisis in the British royal family, said on Monday that she would allow Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, to make a transition to being part-time royals, splitting their time between Britain and Canada and supporting themselves. “My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life as a young family,” the queen said in a statement after an extraordinary family meeting at her country home, Sandringham.  “Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family,” the queen said, “we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.” The strikingly personal statement did not answer a host of thorny questions, including who would pay for the couple’s upkeep, whether they could achieve financial independence without unacceptably commercializing the monarchy or even whether they will keep their royal titles, given the queen’s pointed use of their first names. But it was clearly calculated as a show of support and an exercise in damage control after the couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, abruptly announced a self-imposed exile from royal life. While the queen acknowledged the complexity of the issues involved, she made clear she wanted the crisis settled soon, saying she had asked for “final decisions to be reached in the coming days.” The statement came after one of the most-anticipated royal meetings in recent memory. The queen gathered her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, to hash out the arrangement, which could set a precedent for future generations of royals in a more streamlined royal family.  The British news media lost no time in breathlessly labeling the session the “Sandringham showdown” or “Sandringham summit,” depending on which tabloid one picked up — and dispatching TV crews to camp outside the gates of the 20,000-acre estate in Norfolk, where the queen spends the Christmas holidays. By whatever label, the queen’s gathering was a watershed moment in the life of the royal family, the capstone to a turbulent week in which, at times, the family appeared to be coming apart at the seams. “It’s as good an outcome as we could have hoped for,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “It’s the right decision under the circumstances.” By putting in place a transitional period, during which the duke and duchess can spend time in Britain and Canada, Ms. Junor said, Buckingham Palace may have wanted to give the couple space to make reasoned decisions — even, perhaps, to reconsider what officials at the palace viewed as a precipitous and ill-considered announcement.  “I suspect there is a hope that with the pressure released from them, they may change their minds and come back into the fold,” she said. Royal watchers said Buckingham Palace was also scrambling to regain control of the narrative, after days in which the palace seemed to be reacting to events and the news coverage grew ever more toxic, particularly about tensions between Harry and William. On Monday, representatives of both princes issued a statement denying a report in The Times of London that William’s “bullying” of Harry and Meghan had triggered their decision to step away from the royal family. The report cited “a source that knows the couple well.”  “Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a U.K. newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge,” the statement said, using the formal titles for the princes. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health,” the statement continued, “the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.” The report came hours after another anonymously sourced story, in The Times’s sister newspaper, The Sunday Times, portrayed William as frustrated but regretful about his brother’s tribulations. “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore; we’re separate entities,” William is said to have told a friend, according to The Sunday Times. “I’m sad about that,” he continued. “All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we’re all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the team.” The choice of Sandringham for the family meeting was freighted with history and symbolism. Unlike Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, which are owned by the state, Sandringham is owned personally by the queen, having been purchased in 1862 as a country house for the Prince of Wales. The estate, with its Jacobean-style gabled roofs, sprawling gardens, and tidal mud flats, has long been a favorite refuge for English monarchs. The queen’s grandfather, George V, described it as “dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world.” He died there in 1936. George VI, the queen’s father, died there in February 1952, while his daughter was away on a royal tour in Kenya. The queen now stays at Sandringham from before Christmas until February to mark the anniversary of his death and her accession to the throne. She plays host at a Christmas lunch at the house, which is one of a handful of times the entire royal family is together. Prince Harry and Meghan missed that gathering this year, having decided to spend the holiday in Canada with their eight-month-old son, Archie. After returning briefly with her husband to make their announcement, the duchess flew back to Canada last week to be with Archie, whom they had left with a friend. She had been expected to take part in the family meeting via conference call from Canada, people with ties to the palace said, but the palace did not confirm on Monday whether she did.  The British press has been scathing in its coverage of the couple, particularly the duchess, an American actress who was once celebrated here as a breath of fresh air for the stodgy House of Windsor. The tabloids took offense on behalf of the queen, saying she had been blindsided by the duke and duchess.    Critics traced the over-the-top tone of the coverage back to a decision the queen made in 1969 to allow a documentary crew backstage access in Buckingham Palace and elsewhere to film a movie of the daily lives of the royal family. The decision to turn the family members into public figures, these critics said, planted the seeds of celebrity coverage, which has grown over the decades into the breathless headlines about Princess Diana and, now, Prince Harry and Meghan. “The Queen went for the celebrity royal family because she thought it would make the family more relevant,” said Simon Jenkins, a columnist and former editor of The Times and the Evening Standard. “Now she’s paying the price for it.” The struggles of Prince Harry and his wife, Mr. Jenkins said, were ultimately not very important, particularly in a country that will exit from the European Union in less than three weeks. But he acknowledged it was a “terrific story.” “The rebellious younger son tears loose from the family and throws out the playbook,” Mr. Jenkins said. “The whole concept of the ‘Firm’ depends on the family sticking together. It’s like something out of the ‘Godfather.’”  ']","While long-term arrangements will take time to settle, the queen wants final decisions to be reached “in the coming days.” "
A Homecoming at Taal Volcano: ‘Everything’s Gone in the Blink of an Eye.’,2020-01-14,By Jason Gutierrez and Jes Aznar,"['TAAL VOLCANO, Philippines — The gray ash is knee-deep. It covers homes, trees and the bloated cadavers of cows and horses, their limbs protruding at unnatural angles in the shadow of a brooding volcano that could re-explode at any moment. “My home is now gone,” said Melvin Mendoza, 39, a boatman who returned on Tuesday to Taal, the volcanic island in the middle of a freshwater lake just 40 miles south of Manila, which erupted on Sunday like an atomic bomb mushroom cloud. The toxic ash and smoke, reeking of sulfur and other noxious gases, have transformed the verdant island, a popular tourist spot, into a vast carpet of lifeless gray. At least 30,000 people in a nine-mile radius of surrounding towns have fled, and the United Nations says as many as a half-million residents remain at risk. For now, Taal is not habitable, and volcanologists say a new and perhaps more powerful eruption is possible.  Despite government warnings, Mr. Mendoza and a few other residents of the island ventured back from emergency shelters on Tuesday to see firsthand what remained of their homes, and perhaps salvage a few belongings. A reporter and photographer from The New York Times accompanied them. Among the first challenges they faced as they sloshed ashore from a motorized canoe was the two feet of ash. It was difficult to see precisely where the water ended and the land began. Hundreds of dead, ash-coated tilapia bobbed in the gentle current, injecting the smell of rotting fish into the sulfur-scented air. In some places, rain had already hardened the ash, like crusty snow, making it relatively easy to walk over. Elsewhere, the ash was still soft and treacherous. Mr. Mendoza choked back tears as he salvaged a plank of wood from what had been his house. “We had happy memories here,” he said. “The island sustained our livelihoods, but also took everything back. Everything’s gone in the blink of an eye.” Coconut trees are now blackened stumps, and the menacing mountain was still belching plumes of smoke and ash with ultrafine particles that are dangerous to breathe. Just steps away from a horse’s cadaver stood the remains of Taal’s tourist office, a two-story cement building that was once the busiest on the island, hosting more than 2,000 volcano visitors a year. All the other buildings nearby have collapsed. One of the Philippines’ most active volcanoes, Taal roared to life with a jolt on Sunday, catapulting ash a mile high and triggering dozens of earthquakes that panicked residents as far away as the Manila metropolitan area, home to nearly 13 million people. The government’s Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said Tuesday that Taal was at the fourth of a five-step alert level, meaning that another hazardous eruption was possible within hours to days. Warning of a heavy and prolonged ash fall, it said all residents should stay away. A thick column of ash was rising from the Taal crater, visible for miles around and posing a threat to aircraft. The danger is not limited to ash, smoke and lava flows. The volcano institute also warned of a possible tsunami from the earthquakes that might accompany another eruption. They could send walls of suddenly displaced lake water surging toward the shore, crushing and inundating everything in the way. The Taal volcano has erupted about 35 times in the last few hundred years, volcanologists say. The last time was in 1977. There was little warning before Taal erupted again on Sunday, and residents of the island and nearby towns in Batangas Province scrambled for safety, forced to leave everything behind.  Mr. Mendoza said he felt lucky. His wife, Jasmine, 34, and two young children, ages 14 and 10, escaped unscathed. “As long as we’re alive, there’s hope,” he said. Others who returned in small canoes on Tuesday found that some of their livestock had survived. One farmer was miraculously able to load a water buffalo aboard a canoe. Another rummaged through a crack in the ash-covered earth and emerged with a plastic bag of stuffed toys. “These are owned by my nieces,” he said as he pointed to a mound. “Our house is under that.” Amid reports that the government may permanently bar residents from going back to the island, the men risked arrest by the Coast Guard, which has deployed officers in towns surrounding the volcano to ensure a complete evacuation. For Roger Holgado, a 56-year-old resident of the island, not going home was not an option. He was born on the island and has spent his whole life there, he said. Mr. Holgado witnessed the last eruption four decades ago, when he was just a teenager.  “I have seen the island being restless before, but it has always calmed down,” he said. “I’m sure it will again this time. Because I don’t know what we will do.” Mr. Holgado said his family had operated a small lottery business on the island, and it provided for him, his wife and nine children. Volcanic eruptions are not an anomaly in the Philippines. Last January, an eruption at the most active volcano in the island nation — the Mayon, in Albay Province, about 200 miles east of the Taal — prompted a Level 4 alert as it generated up to 1,600 feet of lava fountains and ash fell on two nearby villages. Renato Solidum, the government’s chief volcanologist, said Tuesday that Taal had been emitting lava ever since its eruption, accompanied by significant earthquakes — all pointing to more trouble.  “The condition of Taal Volcano is dangerous, and an explosive eruption is possible within hours,” he said.']",
Saudi Society Is Changing. Just Take a Look at These Coffeehouses.,2020-01-15,By Vivian Yee,"['RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — For insight into these head-spinning times in Saudi Arabia, where the ultraconservative social and religious codes that micromanage daily life seem to spring a new leak every month — women driving! movie theaters! Usher and Akon rapping to sold-out crowds! — it sometimes pays to read the Google Maps reviews of specialty coffee shops. “I visited this place and was in a total shock!” Tarak Alhamood, a customer at Nabt Fenjan, a Riyadh coffee shop, raged online recently. “YOU r VIOLATING the rules of this country. I hope this place get closed permanently.” The blame lay not with the matcha iced tea and flat whites (good, other reviewers opined), the nondairy milk options (appreciated), the chocolate cake (don’t miss) or the prices (less popular). The issue was the decision that made Nabt Fenjan a daring outpost of the new Riyadh: Originally opened only for women, the coffee shop began allowing male and female customers to mix in late 2018. The move propelled the cafe ahead of the law in the kingdom, where most restaurants and coffee shops are divided, by law and custom, into all-male “singles” sections and “family” sections for women and mixed family groups. Men enter through separate doors and pay in separate lines; women sometimes eat behind partitions to ensure privacy from male strangers. In early December, however, the government announced that businesses would no longer be required to segregate customers — the latest expansion of the social reforms initiated by the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Yet Nabt Fenjan was far from the only Saudi establishment to discreetly drop separate sections over the last few years, after the crown prince defanged the religious police, which once enforced conservative social norms. Nor was it the only place to thrive partly as a result. “I think the reason coffee shops became a trend is because people are more open to change,” said Shaden Alkhalifah, 30, who was studying at Draft Café in Riyadh on a recent evening. “It has something to do with the current political dialogue,” she added. (And, perhaps, with the many Saudis who have studied abroad in cities with single-origin coffee bean fetishes.) Notwithstanding Mr. Alhamood’s Google pan of Nabt Fenjan, even traditionalists have begun to unbend amid the general loosening-up, in larger cities if not yet in smaller ones or rural areas. Some women whose families might previously have allowed them to work only in the privacy of offices, if at all, now hold barista jobs. Saudis can now mingle with the opposite sex not only at home but also at movie theaters, concerts and even wrestling matches. Young entrepreneurs are opening places where Saudis can meet like-minded people of both sexes, whether they are artists, filmmakers or entrepreneurs. The clientele in such coffee shops skews young, reflecting a country where more than two-thirds of the population is under 30 and an unknown proportion is chronically bored. Bars are barred, concerts and movies just starting to become widely available. Evenings out, therefore, still tend to revolve around food and (nonalcoholic) drink, the more Instagrammable, the better. For a while, fancy burger joints were everywhere. Food trucks had a long moment. Social media whetted one frenzy after another. “It’s because we have nothing to do,” said Abdulrahman, an Uber driver in Riyadh, who gave only his first name. “Just these coffee shops.” What is becoming acceptable in Riyadh is still dicey in smaller Saudi cities. But the changes are en route. After befriending a woman through social media, Ziyad Abdulrahman, 26, a teaching assistant at an Islamic university in the holy city of Medina, met her in person not long ago at a Riyadh restaurant. It was his first time being alone with a woman in public. “It was totally fine,” he said. “Actually, I was a little late to this. People have changed.” Most coffee shops are still gender-segregated. But many have other draws: imported Japanese brewing equipment, Instagrammable tarts and — more intangible, but mandatory nevertheless — good vibes. Virtually none offer the golden, cardamom-infused Arabic coffee, poured from a curvaceous pot into dainty cups and served to guests with a hillock of dates, that traditionally defined Saudi coffee culture. Instead, at Draft, which still separates single men and “families,” there are quinoa salads and blond-wood tables illuminated by industrial-style bulbs. And at Medd Café in Jeddah, the Red Sea city where social codes have long been more relaxed than elsewhere, the organic, fair-trade beans are roasted in-house. On a recent Friday night at Medd Café, the outdoor patio was crowded with young men and women. Many of the women wore their hair uncovered and their abayas open over jeans and sneakers, styling them more like long, fluid jackets than the traditional all-covering gowns. Still, Riyadh is starchier than Jeddah. It was only after much internal debate that Kanakah, a Riyadh coffee shop that spent three years proudly all-female, reopened last year as a mixed space. Patrons entered through the same door, stood in the same line and ordered from baristas of both sexes. Khawater Alismaeel, Kanakah’s owner, had noticed that men and women were publicly working together at a few other businesses. If it was not explicitly forbidden, she figured, she might as well try it. “I wanted to prove that I could do everything on my own with an all-female staff,” said Ms. Alismaeel, 23, who opened Kanakah at 19, with help from her family. “Now we’re proving that it’s possible for men and women to work together.” The change put off some female customers who preferred the old way. Others were scandalized, convinced the cafe had become what one reviewer slammed as a “boys and girls dating spot.” The reaction hurt, Ms. Alismaeel said. But she was after a larger, more inclusive vision — not only women working alongside men, but also women who wear the niqab, the veil that exposes only the eyes, working alongside women with bare heads. The changes have unfurled so swiftly that, four months in, she was still not sure whether regulations forbade her from employing female baristas alongside male ones. A municipal health inspector had visited the cafe after a customer complained about the situation, but left them alone. “I feel lucky to be part of this generation,” she said. “Even five years ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.” It can still go the other way. Tala Alzaid, 19, a Kanakah barista, used to work with an all-female crew at another coffee shop (“the whole woman-stays-at-home thing is so last year,” she said), but the women were summarily fired in August after a customer complained to the government. “I mean, equal rights! Why am I being fired when I did nothing wrong?” she said. “When it comes to the government, there’s equality, but in the minds of citizens, maybe it’s not equal.” With her family’s support, Ms. Alzaid had embraced working with men, because “it’s boring otherwise,” she said. “The younger generation accepts change. It’s the older people.” The young, too, have their demands. Ms. Alismaeel plans to introduce more sustainable and vegan-friendly offerings, addressing another complaint from her online reviews. “They used to have plant milk and vegan” desserts, “but now they don’t!” Shatha Zayd wrote in December. “GET UPGRADED! THE WORLD IS CHANGING.” Abdu Mansour contributed reporting.']","As the government relaxes restrictions on men and women working and socializing together, coffeehouses are on the front lines of change."
Ex-Judge Reveals Secrets of How Cuba Suppresses Dissent,2020-01-13,By Frances Robles,"['A former high-ranking judge in Cuba has joined an antigovernment activist in revealing information from secret government documents that show the government is holding thousands of inmates on dubious charges and has the highest incarceration rate in the world. The revelations by Edel González Jiménez, who spent more than 15 years on the bench and once supervised 65 other judges, are believed to be the first public challenge to the Cuban government by a top member of the judiciary. “The repression that I am seeing against part of my people is not what I want for my people,” he said during a news conference on Monday in Madrid, where he was joined by members of an organization that works on behalf of political prisoners in Cuba and by members of the European Parliament. “I have a lot of fear about the future. Every day Cubans face more fear. I don’t want blood on the streets of Cuba, I don’t want these imprisonments.”  Choking back tears, Mr. González told the audience that his wife had advised him not to speak out, but that he had gone against her wishes because he felt it was his duty to challenge the government. Mr. González said that Cuba’s judiciary was often controlled by state security forces that can manufacture cases against political opponents — a statement that critics will readily agree with, but that is surprising coming from a man who insisted that he remains a faithful member of the Communist Party of Cuba and a believer in Fidel Castro’s project. His avowed support of the government makes his words significantly troubling for a country that frequently paints dissidents as mercenaries on Washington’s payroll. “I am not looking for problems,” Mr. González, who left Cuba in 2018 and now lives in Peru, said in an earlier interview. “But I decided: Enough with cowardice.”  Mr. González was joined at the news conference by Javier Larrondo, a longtime anti-Castro activist who runs an organization called Prisoners Defenders in Madrid, in publicly announcing his call for the Cuban government to respect civil rights.  “This is an important blow to the regime,” Mr. Larrondo said. Documents reviewed by The New York Times showed that approximately 92 percent of those accused in the more than 32,000 cases that go to trial in Cuba every year are found guilty.  Nearly 4,000 people every year are accused of being “antisocial” or “dangerous,” terms the Cuban government uses to jail people who pose a risk to the status quo, without having a committed a crime. Such measures are often used against young black men to stifle potential social uprisings, said Orlando Gutiérrez, an activist in Miami. Those accused of being a threat are subjected to summary trials and have no right to a defense or to present evidence, Mr. González said. The records show that 99.5 percent of the people accused of this are found guilty. Mr. Larrondo released Cuban court documents showing that dozens of men received sentences between two and four years in prison for offenses falling broadly under the category of “antisocial” — a phrase that can be applied to people who are unemployed, do not belonging to civic organizations associated with the state, behave disorderly and harass tourists, and associate with similarly “antisocial” people. In case after case, the description of the crime is identical, suggesting that the police cut and pasted the language in the investigative report. Arianna López Roque, 29, said that when her husband, Mitzael Díaz Paseiro, was sentenced to three and a half years for being “dangerous” in Mr. González’s judicial district, the court was “completely militarized.” He was not permitted to have a defense lawyer and only members of his immediate family were allowed to attend. “The court in Cuba is manipulated by the dictatorship,” she said. “You don’t have the opportunity to defend yourself in any manner against what they say.” Mr. González said that in ordinary criminal cases, judges are independent and free of government influence. But he said that cases against dissidents like Mr. Díaz are orchestrated by the state security apparatus, because judges, fearful of losing their jobs, go along with evidence that is often flagrantly concocted, he said. The records show that Cuba’s prison system holds more than 90,000 prisoners. The Cuban government has only publicly released the figure once, in 2012, when it claimed that 57,000 people were jailed.  “What is important is what is behind those numbers,” Mr. González said. “People are in prison for stealing flour, because they are pizza makers and the government has set up a system where the only way to get flour is by buying in the black market from someone who stole it from the state.” Still, Mr. González insisted on Monday that there was time for Cuba to resolve its problems internally, and he warned against any outside interference. “We will not allow anybody to impose anything, that should be clear to all countries. Cubans can manage this alone without any kind of interference,” he said. Mr. González also cautioned against coming to the conclusion that the high number of prisoners in Cuba was proof of a failed society and judiciary. Other countries, he said, had fewer prisoners, but that reflected a high level of “impunity” and failure to prosecute common and violent crime, while Cuba instead “maintains social order.” Officials at the Cuban Embassy in Washington and the Cuban judiciary did not respond to requests for comment, as is customary. Eloy Viera Cañive, an independent legal analyst in Cuba, said the Communist Party and Ministry of Interior always have the last word in Cuba’s judiciary. “This is a police state, and the Ministry of Interior has a lot of influence, even on judges,” Mr. Viera said. “True independence is impossible.” Mr. González had a humble upbringing in Caibarién, a coastal town in central Cuba, where his mother was a restaurant cook and his father managed a government transportation warehouse. In 1973, his uncles were among 11 fishermen on state-owned vessels attacked at sea by anti-Castro fighters from abroad, who were trying to force the men to defect. The attackers set fire to the boats, killed one man, and cut the throat of one of his uncles, who survived, even after being left adrift to die. The episode marked the family, turning them against those who tried to topple the Cuban government. “We have always had a vocation of supporting the system,” he said.  After Fidel Castro fell ill in 2006, his brother Raúl Castro assumed the presidency. In a seismic shift for a country where hundreds of people have served long prison sentences for speaking out against the Communist Party, he organized community town halls and let it be known that Cubans were welcome to voice their opinions about vexing food shortages and other disappointments.  Although Raúl Castro stepped down from the presidency in 2018, he retained a great measure of control by remaining the head of Cuba’s Communist Party. That is, in part, why Mr. González is convinced that his announcement might actually be perceived as the kind of constructive criticism Raúl Castro encouraged.  Mario Félix Lleonart, a Baptist minister from the central province of Villa Clara who left Cuba as a political refugee in 2016, laughed out loud at the thought that Mr. González could return to his old job. The two met 20 years ago when the minister’s wife was a secretary at the civil courthouse, and Mr. González was assigned to find out more about her political activities. Mr. González was surprisingly respectful and professional, the minister recalled.  “Edel was a brilliant student of law and the government kept promoting him,” he said. “But as he continued rising, his curiosity rose too. He realized his country was not in order.” Last year, Mr. González’s former boss, Rubén Remigio Ferro, president of the Cuban Supreme Court, told the state newspaper, Granma that although the administration of justice on the island is improving, “deficiencies” still exist, such as trial delays, misguided decisions and a lack of professionalism. President Miguel Díaz-Canel told judges while inaugurating the new judicial calendar last week that the courts must “remain a system that is distinguished first and foremost by its ethics, its transparency and the honest behavior of its members.” Mr. González is betting that public criticism from someone who believes in the system the Castros built will trigger dialogue between longtime enemies of the Cuban government and loyal insiders who wish to see improvements in areas such as human rights. He also hopes, eventually, to return to the island, where his 14-year-old daughter lives, to reclaim his job in Villa Clara. “My wife says I’m too much of a dreamer,” Mr. González said.

"Sinkhole in China Swallows a Bus, Killing at Least 6",2020-01-14,By Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — At least six people have been killed and more are missing after a bus plunged into a sinkhole in the city of Xining, in northwestern China.  Video footage circulating on Chinese social media on Monday shows several people waiting to board the bus in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, when a traffic sign wobbles and the vehicle begins to sink into the road.  Bystanders rushed to help passengers escape from the sinkhole, which was at least 32 feet in diameter, according to Chinese state media, but they backed away as the bus slipped further into the widening hole.  Rescue crews worked overnight to free trapped passengers. Local business owners said they tried to help by breaking the bus windows to reach passengers.  Officials in Xining said Tuesday morning that 10 people were missing and 15 more injured.  Sinkholes can be caused by natural erosion or acidic rainwater that weakens sedimentary rock. Similar accidents in China in recent years were thought to stem from construction projects.   A sinkhole in the southeastern city of Xiamen in December swallowed three cars. That same month, three people fell into a sinkhole near a subway line under construction in Guangzhou, in southern China. In 2013, a sinkhole engulfed an entire building complex in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the border with Hong Kong.

Iran’s President Calls for Special Court on Downed Plane,2020-01-14,By Mujib Mashal,"['President Hassan Rouhani of Iran called on Tuesday for a special court to examine the recent downing of a passenger plane that killed 176 people,  as protests flared for the fourth day in several cities over the disaster and officials’ shifting explanations for it. But even as the president made the announcement, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful arm of Iran’s military, said it had arrested a person it identified as having recorded a video of a missile attacking the plane, which undercut the military’s initial denials that Iran was responsible. The arrest was announced by Iranian media outlets affiliated with the Guards.  The contradictory messages from the president, who is elected, and the Guards, who answer to Iran’s clerical leaders, reflect the competing power centers in the Iranian government. For three days after the crash of a Ukraine International Airlines jetliner, the military blamed mechanical failure. It eventually acknowledged that it had mistakenly shot the jet down with a missile, but insisted that “human error” was to blame, not any systemic problem. In an apparent criticism of the military, Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, urged that an official inquiry be candid about its findings. But some hard-line lawmakers have lashed out at his administration, demanding resignations. Iran’s chief prosecutor also demanded the expulsion of the British ambassador on Tuesday, accusing him of having broken the law by participating in an unauthorized protest. The ambassador, Rob Macaire, was briefly detained on Saturday after being picked up at an antigovernment demonstration at a Tehran university. Britain denounced the arrest as “a flagrant violation of international law” and summoned the Iranian ambassador to London on Monday to convey its objections. The Iranian prosecutor, Muhammad Jaffar Montazeri, said Tuesday that Mr. Macaire should be expelled as soon as possible, and Gholam Hossein Ismaili, a spokesman for the judiciary, called the ambassador a “problematic mole.” In the government’s investigation of the shooting down of the Ukrainian jet, Mr. Ismaili said Tuesday that “arrests have been” made but he did not provide any details, leaving it unclear how many people had been detained or how senior they were. “It would have been better if they had announced from the beginning that commissions are investigating,” he said, in an apparent criticism of the military and the government for the initial misleading statements. He said the flight data recorders recovered from the Ukrainian plane would be sent to France for analysis.  Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to deliver a Friday Prayer sermon this week, a role he plays only at times of major crisis; the last was eight years ago. The Ukrainian plane was shot down on Jan. 8, shortly after takeoff from Tehran, as hostilities between Iran and the United States had escalated after an American airstrike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Hours before the airliner crashed, Iran had fired missiles at United States forces in Iraq in response to the general’s killing, and Iranian forces were on guard for American retaliation. After three days of denying any role in the crash, Iran’s military admitted that the plane had been hit by at least one of its missiles.  Mr. Rouhani, himself a former commander of Iran’s air defense forces, said on Tuesday that he wanted the issue “to be addressed to the people with honesty.” “The familiarity I have with air defense issue, I say that it can’t be one person who is responsible for this,” he said, according to the state news agency. “Not just the person who pressed the button — there are others too.”  Ali Rabeei, a spokesman for Mr. Rouhani, has said that the government did not lie, but initially made incorrect statements because it did not have all the relevant information in a tense, fast-changing situation.  “Perhaps, I can even say, it was due to being kept uninformed,” Mr. Rabeei said.  President Rouhani asked the judiciary on Tuesday to create a “special court, with a high-ranking judge and tens of experts,” to look into the downing of the airliner. “This is not a regular case,” Mr. Rouhani said. “The whole world will watch this trial.” Amid a heavy security presence in Tehran, protests broke out on several university campuses on Tuesday, as they have daily since the government admitted that the plane had been shot down. At Tehran University, where Ayatollah Khamenei had prayed over the coffin of General Suleimani just days earlier, students chanted about the ayatollah, “our shame, our shame is our supreme leader.” At Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, students castigated officials who had misled the public about the crash while saying they were mourning the victims. “If you are mourning why did you cover it up for three days?” they chanted. Mr. Ismaili, the judiciary spokesman, said about 30 people have been arrested over the recent days of protests.  Officials in Tehran said on Tuesday that 61 of the 176 victims had been identified through DNA testing, and that their remains could be handed over to their families.

Plan to Cut U.S. Troops in West Africa Draws Criticism From Europe,2020-01-14,By Helene Cooper,"['BRUSSELS — A Pentagon proposal to greatly reduce American forces in West Africa faced criticism from allies on Tuesday, with French officials arguing that removing United States intelligence assets in the region could stymie the fight against extremist groups. American officials said they were proceeding nonetheless.  While no final decision has been made on how many troops will be transferred from Africa and the Middle East as the Pentagon refocuses its priorities to confront “great powers” like Russia and China, America’s top military officer said the United States needed to shift its forces to better counter China in particular. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged that the proposal was “causing some anxiety.” But he said that the United States needed to seriously re-examine its military footprint in Africa, and the Middle East and Latin America after that, given the heightened focus on China. General Milley’s comments came ahead of a NATO military chiefs’ meeting in Brussels, where he also sought to lay out the United States’ rationale for killing Iran’s top military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani this month. The killing of General Suleimani, who was the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force, has raised questions from America’s military allies about whether commanders of sovereign countries are now fair game for drone strikes. The Pentagon is also asking Europe to do more in the Middle East. After the killing of General Suleimani, Mr. Trump called for NATO to step up efforts to train Iraqi forces to fight the Islamic State in their country —\xa0a point that General Milley elaborated on at the NATO meeting on Tuesday.  One way European allies could help in Iraq, he said, was to provide ballistic missile defense systems at bases that house troops from the American-led coalition that has been fighting the Islamic State. Iran fired several ballistic missiles at two such bases in Iraq last week, though no one was killed. In Africa, the Trump administration wants European allies, particularly the French, to pick up a bigger share of the battle against extremist Islamist organizations like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and Boko Haram. The Pentagon’s discussions of a large-scale pullback from West Africa include abandoning a recently built $110 million drone base in Niger and ending assistance to French forces battling militants in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. President Emmanuel Macron of France, in his own meeting with leaders of five West and Central African nations on Monday, pledged to send a further 220 French troops to the region, supplementing the 4,500 who are already there. Mr. Macron had called the meeting in an effort to persuade the African leaders to make clear publicly that they wanted the French forces to remain. With the Pentagon expected to make its initial decision about Africa this month, the United States’ plans have already drawn criticism from lawmakers, allies and military officials, and could eventually affect most global missions. About 200,000 United States forces are stationed abroad, a similar number to when President Trump took office with a promise to conclude the nation’s “endless wars.” Responding to General Milley’s comments on Monday, an aide to Mr. Macron told the news agency Agence France-Presse that American contributions to the fight against Islamic extremist groups in West Africa were “irreplaceable.” General Milley said that no final decision had been made, and that the Pentagon was reviewing American force posture all over the world. (United States military officials said that Africa was first because it begins with “A.”)  The Pentagon says that the overhaul of African deployments will be followed by one in Latin America and that drawdowns will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan, as it has outlined in recent months. But the killing of General Suleimani, which has sharply exacerbated tensions between Washington and Tehran, could undermine the Pentagon’s plans. Since that killing, it has sent thousands of additional troops to the region to protect against possible strikes from Iran.']",French officials said that a Pentagon proposal to relocate troops as it focuses on China and Russia could hinder the fight against extremists.
"U.K. Failed to Alert E.U. on 75,000 Criminal Convictions",2020-01-14,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Britain failed to notify other European countries about tens of thousands of foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, and then covered up the error to avoid embarrassment, according to a report on Tuesday in The Guardian. With Britain on the precipice of significant negotiations with the European Union over its post-Brexit security relationship with the bloc, the mistake threatened to weaken Europe’s trust in British law enforcement agencies heading into those talks. Under Britain’s arrangements with the European Union, it is supposed to send other member states an alert when citizens of another European country are convicted of crimes in a British court. But for five years, the Guardian reported, a British computer system failed to send the details of 75,000 such convictions to the offenders’ home countries, amounting to one in three of the required alerts. The notification system is supposed to allow local European police agencies to monitor people convicted of serious crimes abroad and to prevent offenders from escaping their convictions by moving to another European Union country. The Guardian quoted from the minutes of a meeting in May of the ACRO Criminal Records Office, a British police unit, indicating officials knew about the problem but did not want to send out alerts belatedly. “There is a nervousness from Home Office around sending the historical notifications out dating back to 2012 due to the reputational impact this could have,” the minutes say, according to The Guardian, which  published its article on Tuesday. Opposition Labour lawmakers and European lawmakers called for an urgent investigation. A Home Office spokeswoman said on Tuesday night that “work is already underway with the police to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.” The Home Office said it sent more than 30,000 notifications about convictions to European Union member states last year, and received more than 16,000 from other member states.  The ACRO Criminal Records Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The criminal records office told The Guardian that the problem was a technical one that stemmed in part from cases in which an offender had dual nationality. It said a software fix had been developed that would be released in the next update, though it said it did not know when that would be. As part of negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government will have to work out whether and how British and European law enforcement agencies will continue to share information. Britain is scheduled to formally leave the bloc on Jan. 31, but its current trading and security arrangements with Brussels will not expire until the end of a transition period in December.']",Britain was supposed to notify other member states of foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain.

Iran’s President Lashes Out at Europeans Over Crumbling Nuclear Deal,2020-01-15,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Under growing pressure at home and abroad, Iranian leaders attempted on Wednesday to calm domestic anger over the downing of a passenger jet last week, while lashing out at European nations that have formally accused Iran of breaking the 2015 agreement to curb its nuclear program. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani criticized — and appeared to threaten — Britain, France and Germany for officially accusing Iran on Tuesday of reneging on its commitments under the nuclear deal, a step that further isolates Iran internationally and that could lead to renewed United Nations sanctions. The European countries, signatories to the deal, have tried to salvage the agreement since President Trump pulled out in 2018 and imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran, kick-starting the current high tensions. They said on Tuesday that they still hoped to preserve the deal, but Mr. Rouhani, at a government meeting, accused the Europeans of siding with the United States and urged them to uphold the deal. “Today, the American soldier is in danger, tomorrow the European soldier could be in danger,” Mr. Rouhani said in a speech, Agence France-Presse reported. The Europeans and the United States would only aggravate tensions in the region if they continued pulling back from the deal, he warned. “You will suffer if you take a wrong move,” he said, according to Press TV, a state-run news agency.  The nuclear deal, which was intended to keep Iran from building an atomic bomb, imposed limits on its ability to enrich uranium — the process of transforming the element into fuel for nuclear reactors or weapons. In response to American sanctions, Iran has repeatedly breached those restrictions, despite European pleas to return to compliance. But Mr. Rouhani seemed to leave a sliver of room open for further negotiation on Wednesday, noting in his speech that Iran’s recent steps to increase its nuclear activities were reversible. If the United States softened its punishing stance toward Iran, “we are prepared” to reciprocate, he said, according to Press TV. Comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday morning suggested that the United States was looking in the opposite direction, citing what he called “very direct discussions” with the European signatories to the nuclear deal.  “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place,” he said on CNBC. The Europeans’ decision to invoke the deal’s formal dispute resolution process arrived at a flammable moment for Iran, after weeks of domestic and international tumult. Antigovernment protests broke out in several cities last month, but the targeted killing by the United States of a top Iranian general this month temporarily united the country behind its leadership, and Iran fired missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq in retaliation. On Jan. 8, a Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kyiv crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard. After claiming for three days that the disaster had resulted from mechanical failure, Iran acknowledged that its own antiaircraft missiles had shot the plane down, as Western governments and news organizations had reported. The crowds of mourners that packed Iranian cities for the slain Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, last week gave way to widespread, though smaller, protests against the government’s handling of the airliner accident.  The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, acknowledged the protesters’ anger and seemed to validate it in remarks on Wednesday at a diplomatic conference in New Delhi. “In the last few nights, we’ve had people in the streets of Tehran demonstrating against the fact that they were lied to for a couple of days,” news organizations reported him as saying. After admitting to shooting down the plane, the Iranian military said that “human error” had been at fault, not any system problem. On Tuesday, the military’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had arrested a person who had recorded a video of a missile striking the plane — images that undermined Iran’s initial denials.  Mr. Rouhani said on Wednesday that the military should apologize to the Iranian people for its three-day wait in admitting the mistake, according to Press TV. He said the military had taken a “good step” in acknowledging what had happened, but that it had to follow up with reforms to prevent future mistakes. But he also seemed to attribute the delay in conceding that the plane had been shot down to the sheer shock of what had happened.  “No one could believe that an aircraft has taken off from an international airport in the capital, begun flying on its route, and is then targeted,” said Mr. Rouhani, a former commander of Iran’s air defense forces. It was the second day in a row that the president, a relative moderate on Iran’s political spectrum, had criticized the military, which is closely tied to the country’s hard-line leaders. On Tuesday, he called for a special court to investigate the disaster and the authorities’ response to it, saying that greater openness was needed.  On Wednesday, Mr. Zarif, an ally of the president, appeared to be trying to balance the two power centers, praising the military in his remarks for being “brave enough to claim responsibility early on.” Mr. Rouhani also criticized the clerical establishment, which wields ultimate power in Iran, for disqualifying candidates in parliamentary elections next month, including some sitting lawmakers. Religious leaders often bar candidates seen as liberals or critics of the system, leaving voters to choose among conservatives whom the establishment considers acceptable.  Where there is no clear reason for disqualification, “don’t disappoint the people,” the president said. A contest for a single office might have the appearance of choice, with 17 candidates, but “17 people from how many sides, one side?” Mr. Rouhani asked. “This is not elections. It’s like having 2,000 of the same item in a shop.” The protests since the plane crash resulted on Wednesday in the departure of the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran had sought to expel him after he was detained briefly on Saturday, accused of attending an illegal antigovernment demonstration at a university in Tehran. Mr. Macaire said on Twitter this week that he had not been taking part in the protest but had gone to attend a planned vigil for victims of the plane crash. “Normal to want to pay respects,” he wrote, noting that some of the victims were British. “I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.” Britain had strongly objected to his detention in Iran, but in the end, Mr. Macaire left the country “with prior notice and according to the protocols,” IRNA reported on Wednesday, without offering further details. It remained to be seen whether protests in Iran over the airplane’s downing would continue much longer, but the economic distress that spurred Iranians into the streets late last year seems almost certain to continue. The economy is already choking under American sanctions, and Iran’s fading hopes for a badly needed economic lifeline from Europe received another blow with the invoking of the resolution mechanism on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, warned on Tuesday that Iran would respond “firmly, decisively and aptly” if the three European nations moved toward reimposing sanctions. “They should prepare themselves for potential consequences, of which they have been notified,” Mr. Mousavi said, according to the state-run outlet Press TV. Mujib Mashal and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.']","With the government in Tehran under pressure, President Hassan Rouhani warned that European troops could be in “danger.” "
Europe’s Gamble: Can It Save Iran Deal by Threatening to Kill It?,2020-01-15,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Europe is gambling on keeping the 2015 Iran nuclear deal alive by threatening to destroy it — a risky, oddly timed strategy that could backfire badly, European officials and analysts say. The decision by France, Germany and Britain on Tuesday to challenge Iran’s breaches of the nuclear agreement and trigger what is known as the dispute resolution mechanism starts a clock that the Europeans may not be able to control, subject to unpredictable actions by the leaders of both Iran and the United States. Already the move has angered Iran, which contends its breaches of the accord are justified and that the Europeans are bending toward President Trump and his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Tehran. The Europeans insist otherwise. But watching Iran and the United States head for a possible military escalation, they are trying at least to avoid an outcome in which Iran moves down the North Korean road toward a nuclear bomb. “If there is a European strategy here, it’s essentially to try to buy time,’’ said Nathalie Tocci, a former adviser to the European Union’s former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the 2015 deal with Iran.  “The optimistic scenario is that they’ve done this to keep Trump happy and hope to stretch out the dispute process until the November U.S. elections,” Ms. Tocci said. The Europeans, she said, are wagering that “despite all the pressure on Iran, it won’t use the freedom it’s granted itself’’ to enrich uranium to bomb-ready levels. The Europeans also are hoping to induce the United States and Iran to somehow engage in negotiations on an enhanced deal that Mr. Trump can call his own, even if it differs little from the current one, negotiated by President Barack Obama, that limited Iran’s nuclear activities — a deal Mr. Trump has called the worst in history. “But it’s a very high-risk strategy,” Ms. Tocci said. “It’s hard to see Tehran playing ball all the way until November.’’ Wendy R. Sherman, a key American negotiator of the 2015 accord, also described the use of the dispute mechanism as “incredibly risky” and said “it will increase the likelihood of the demise” of the deal. It is hard to see those around Mr. Trump, who have opposed the nuclear deal and supported his maximum pressure campaign, granting Iran any concession to get talks started, said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform.  Mr. Trump’s subordinates appear to believe their strategy is working. Iran’s government and economy are weakened, they note. And they say the United States killing of a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad nearly two weeks ago has deterred Iran in the region, rather than prompting further attempts to expel the Americans from Iraq and Syria. But others, like Robert Malley, an American who helped negotiate the nuclear deal and now runs the International Crisis Group, say they are not so sure. They expect further retaliation from Iran and from the Iraqi militias it supports, including one led by a commander killed alongside General Suleimani. In its zeal to pressure the Europeans, a Trump administration official even threatened them with 25 percent tariffs on automobile exports if they did not invoke the dispute provision with Iran, according to a European official — which would be an extraordinary use of economic leverage for a foreign policy goal. The warning, first reported by The Washington Post, was conveyed in a single phone call and was regarded by the Europeans as counterproductive, the European official said.  An indication of the American administration’s mood came on Wednesday from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed United Nations sanctions on Iran would be swiftly reimposed now that France, Britain and Germany had triggered the dispute-resolution mechanism. The Europeans made that move in response to Iran’s declarations that it would no longer honor the nuclear accord’s limits on Iranian enrichment of uranium — potential fuel for a bomb. “I’ve had very direct discussions — as well as Secretary Pompeo has — with our counterparts,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC. “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place.’’ But that outcome, which would likely terminate the agreement, is precisely what the Europeans say they are trying to avoid. There is nervousness that Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, with his eye on a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, might crack, but European officials consider that possibility unlikely.  Mr. Johnson and his government support the nuclear deal and collaborated on a statement with France and Germany on Tuesday that said “we are not joining a campaign to implement maximum pressure on Iran.” On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson urged new talks with Washington and Tehran to try to negotiate a “Trump deal” to supplant the current one. Under the dispute mechanism, explained Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, time limits on discussions can be extended by consent. Any party to the deal can go directly to the United Nations Security Council to request the re-imposition of United Nations sanctions, but no one is expected to do that, unless Mr. Johnson unexpectedly capitulates to Washington.  John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, has argued that the Americans can make this request themselves. The Europeans disagree, saying Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the nuclear accord last year means the United States is no longer a party to it. Still, Ms. Geranmayeh said, both Iran and the United States are unpredictable. “If there is no diplomacy or something else poisons it militarily, the Europeans have triggered a clock that could end up more quickly at the Security Council,’’ she said. The political unrest in Iran, following the killing of General Suleimani and Iran’s accidental shooting down of a civilian airliner, creates enormous uncertainty. The government in Iran is cracking down on protests, and with parliamentary elections next month, hard-line rhetoric is bound to increase. While Iran insists its nuclear work will remain peaceful, its decisions to disregard the nuclear deal’s limits on both the volume and purity of Iranian nuclear fuel have raised worries that the country could amass enough enriched uranium to create a bomb in a matter of months. “I think the attack on Suleimani will make the Iranians want to accelerate their nuclear program,’’ Mr. Bond said. “They’ve seen Kim Jong-un and the lesson from Trump, which is if you have nuclear weapons you can get love letters from the president, and if you don’t, your generals can get killed.’’ Iran’s first reaction has been relative calm, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “But given the stalemate and the European inability to deliver the economic benefits it promised, Iran could end up by lashing out, and could do so on the nuclear side,’’ she said.  For example, Iran could restrict access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency or even expel them. “So it could all be worse, and you can’t separate that from the U.S.-Iran confrontation,’’ she said. Which is why the three European countries are expected to continue to focus on finding an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has been trying to do with Washington and Iran since the late summer.  Any new talks would face extraordinary obstacles. Iran says they would require sanctions relief as a precondition, and the Trump administration is instead increasing sanctions on Iran.  Some European officials have speculated that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has enjoyed some diplomatic successes where Washington has created vacuums, might try to mediate himself. Mr. Bond said Russia was happy to be aligned with the Europeans on at least this issue, and has benefited from Europe’s split on Iran with the United States. And Moscow, which is a party to the nuclear deal, has made clear it does not want a nuclear-armed Iran. François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, said that he could imagine a phased negotiation — first to determine what sanctions Washington could lift as a sign of good faith, then some high-level meeting, much like Mr. Trump had with Mr. Kim. While Mr. Heisbourg expressed skepticism, he praised the European countries for at least trying to de-escalate the tension while attempting to keep Iran from going down the North Korean path, risking a real war with the United States or Israel. “This is an unholy mess,’’ he said. “The chance of the Europeans succeeding in a meaningful way to improve matters is very low. But we are in a position to try this. And no one else is even trying.’’ Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Washington.']","A risky strategy to keep the nuclear agreement alive could backfire. Badly. But no one else is even trying, Europeans argue."
Putin’s Power Shake-up: Here Are Six Takeaways,2020-01-15,By Anton Troianovski,"['In his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shook up the country and its political class by calling for constitutional changes that would give him a new path to holding onto power after his current — and, in theory, last — term ends in 2024.  With that, the entire cabinet, led by a long-serving Putin ally, Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, abruptly resigned. The head of the Federal Tax Service, Mikhail V. Mishustin — a little-known but skilled technocrat — will become the next prime minister. The spate of moves offers some clues about Mr. Putin’s plans and priorities, but also raises questions about what may lie ahead for the Russian president. Here are answers to some of them.  Mr. Putin’s hold on power in Russia is unrivaled, built up over the last 20 years in his posts as president and prime minister. But Russia’s Constitution bars a president from serving more than two consecutive terms. To maintain his grip on power, as he has hinted he intends to do, Mr. Putin needs to find a way to engineer a leadership transition that will allow that to happen.  [Update: Putin endorses legislation enabling him to run for president again.] To that end, it appears, he has proposed changes to the Constitution that would weaken the presidency while increasing the sway of the Parliament and the prime minister. He said, for example, that the president should in the future be required to accept the prime minister’s cabinet appointments. This and other changes could give Mr. Putin more leeway to find a position in which he can maintain power without violating the Constitution.  That’s not entirely clear. Mr. Putin could become prime minister again, taking advantage of the position’s expanded influence. Alternatively, some analysts have pointed to a leadership maneuver engineered by Nursultan Nazarbayev, the longtime president of Kazakhstan, another former Soviet republic. In 2018, Mr. Nazarbayev increased the power of Kazakhstan’s Security Council and made himself its chairman for life. When he resigned from the presidency last year in favor of a handpicked successor, his position at the helm of the Security Council allowed him to hold on to key levers of power.  On Wednesday, offering few details, Mr. Putin dangled the possibility of a similar move in Russia. The State Council — currently an advisory body made up of the governors of Russia’s regions — should have its “status and role” fixed in the Constitution, he said. That quickly raised speculation among Russian political analysts that a revamped State Council could become a vehicle for Mr. Putin to maintain power if he relinquishes the presidency, particularly over the military and foreign policy.  Despite Mr. Putin’s immense sway, he’d be taking a risk if he simply declared himself president for life. Mr. Putin served two consecutive presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, and then became prime minister. His announcement in 2011 that he would seek the presidency again, followed by parliamentary elections widely seen as rigged, helped trigger Russia’s biggest street protests since the 1990s.  This time around, Mr. Putin looks determined to orchestrate his next move in a slow-motion fashion that’s less likely to produce a backlash. The changes to the Constitution he called for give him several options to hold on to power — while affording him as much as four years’ time to set his course.   “Our society is clearly calling for change,” Mr. Putin said at the beginning of his speech on Wednesday.  Indeed, over the last year, Russia has seen its most vigorous street protests since the anti-Putin rallies of 2011 and 2012. Polls show that Russians increasingly distrust pro-Kremlin TV channels and are getting their news on the internet, which remains largely uncensored. And the Kremlin’s appeal to patriotism — so effective after Mr. Putin’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 — has lost its visceral power, overshadowed by Russia’s economic problems.  All of this means that the Kremlin is likely to portray the resignation on Wednesday of Mr. Medvedev and every cabinet minister as a sign that Mr. Putin has heard Russians’ demand for change. While Russians do increasingly blame Mr. Putin for their ills, many more blame the bureaucrats below him. Mr. Putin’s approval rating has fallen to 68 percent from 82 percent in April 2018, an independent pollster, Levada, says. But Mr. Medvedev is in far worse shape, with an approval rating of 38 percent.  Mr. Putin’s choice of Mr. Mishustin seems to reflect his concerns about Russia’s declining standard of living, which has contributed to spasms of unrest over the last year.  Mr. Mishustin is widely seen as one of Russia’s most effective technocrats. He has headed Russia’s Federal Tax Service since 2010, modernizing a notoriously ineffective and corrupt tax-collecting system. The Financial Times dubbed the computerized, real-time approach to taxation he developed as “the taxman of the future.” In his early years as president, Mr. Putin built his popularity on soaring living standards, which coincided with a period of rising oil prices. But with lower oil prices and Western sanctions, those steady improvements are now a thing of the past. Disposable incomes are still effectively below what they were in 2013.  Mr. Putin also used his state-of-the-nation speech to make a raft of pledges to improve Russians’ daily lives. For example: free hot meals for all elementary school students from grades one through four.  Unlike Russia’s more prominent economic reformers, the 53-year-old Mr. Mishustin has no political base of his own, reducing the likelihood that he might use the powers of his new office to chip away at Mr. Putin’s authority.  Not at all. In theory, at least, Russia’s system of governance echoes that of France — a powerful presidency checked by an independent judiciary, by parliament and by a cabinet of ministers headed by a prime minister with his own locus of authority. But Mr. Putin has steadily subsumed the authority of all those institutions, often justifying crackdowns on political pluralism as necessary in the face of external threats. He reprised that language in his speech on Wednesday, signaling that no political thaw is in the offing. “Russia can be and can remain Russia only as a sovereign state,” he said. That was an allusion to Mr. Putin’s frequent charge the West is fomenting political opposition to undermine Russian sovereignty. To drive home the point, Mr. Putin proposed a constitutional amendment that offered the day’s clearest statement of how he views his successor: Russia’s future president, Mr. Putin said, may not ever have had citizenship or permanent residency in another country.']",Is Vladimir Putin Russia’s president for life? Maybe. But he’s still observing the niceties.
"Two Popes, and One Big Furor After Benedict Weighs in on Priestly Celibacy",2020-01-14,By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The theologically fraught relationship between two living popes — fictionalized in a current movie — is beginning to have very real consequences for the obligation of celibacy for priests in the Roman Catholic Church. It wasn’t supposed to be that way. Pope Benedict XVI, the first pope in the modern era to retire, promised when he stepped down in 2013 and took the title “Pope Emeritus” that he would remain “hidden to the world.”  But in a new book written in part by Benedict, to be published on Wednesday in France, the former pope makes a firm defense of priestly celibacy at the same time that his successor, Pope Francis, faces a critical decision on whether to lift the restriction on married priests in remote areas. It is a move that Francis seems open to, but his critics consider a first step on a slippery slope toward the end of the centuries-old tradition.  To be certain, Francis is the pope and is the one with the power to promulgate dogma. Benedict retired in 2013 and lost all such powers. But he has maintained, among a small but powerful coterie of conservatives, the power not just to influence, but to validate their views with an ex-papal seal.  The question now is whether he is a player or a pawn in the ideological battles.  Benedict “is being taken advantage of,” said Roberto Rusconi, a church historian, who considered the book an open and direct attack on Francis by “reactionaries” inside the church.  He said that Benedict had put himself in this awkward position by failing to renounce his title upon retirement and embracing the neologism of Pope emeritus.  “There’s only one pope,” Mr. Rusconi said.  An extraordinary Vatican conference in October had recommended that the pope lift the restriction on married priests in remote areas of the Amazon region, where a severe shortage of clerics means that the faithful often go months or longer without seeing a priest who can administer the sacraments. Some bishops around the world have expressed interest in having married men of good standing be ordained as priests in their regions as well. Francis is currently working on a document with the potential of turning the recommendations from the Amazon bishops’ conference into church law. It was in that context that, on Sunday, the French newspaper Le Figaro published an excerpt from a book, “From the Depths of our Hearts,” by Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea, a top conservative prelate and Vatican official, and Benedict.  In the book, the retired pope makes an impassioned case for priestly celibacy, writing about the “impossibility of a marital bond” for priests and that in the church’s tradition, renouncing marriage “became a criterion for priestly ministry.” The excerpt became an opening salvo. Whisper campaigns conducted by pro-pope and pro-pope-emeritus partisans are nourishing a dueling-popes story line, with anonymous allegations from team Benedict in the Italian press suggesting that Cardinal Sarah had inappropriately put Benedict’s name and face on the book cover. Talk grew over whether the time had come to enshrine restrictions on the conduct of papal retirees into canon law, and the Vatican scrambled to insist that there was nothing to see here. But with each passing hour, there was more to see. Archbishop Georg Gänswein, Benedict’s closest collaborator, who happens also to be the prefect of Pope Francis’ household, found himself again caught in the middle of a different popes for different folks comedy of errors.  A conservative, Archbishop Gänswein found himself publicly disagreeing with Cardinal Sarah, who spent the early part of the week rejecting allegations that he had tricked the aging Benedict into joining his opposition to Pope Francis’ agenda. Benedict, at age 92, is now restricted to a wheelchair and has seemed frail in public appearances, appearing slumped and struggling to speak. When Benedict became the first pontiff to resign since Gregory XII in 1415, his vow to remain hidden seemed a guarantee that he would keep to his refurbished Vatican convent and stay out of Francis’ way. But Benedict turns out to be bad at hiding. He has repeatedly chimed in throughout Francis’ pontificate.  Their relationship — often depicted as a rivalry — has become an object of widespread fascination, most recently in the movie “The Two Popes,” where the two men are shown watching the 2014 World Cup final, rooting for competing teams. But the truth, as often is the case in the small Vatican city-state consumed with power politics and ideological rifts, shadowy maneuvering and gossip, is much stranger.   In April, only months after a groundbreaking Vatican conference called by Francis to address the Roman Catholic Church’s clerical sex abuse crisis, he released a 6,000-word letter holding forth on his views on the scandal’s origins. He put the blame on the swinging ’60s and sexual liberty, effectively undercutting Francis’ view that clericalism, or the abuse of power by priests, had allowed the scandal to fester. That letter marked, for many critics, an egregious example of why having two popes — whose addresses are close but whose visions of the church are vastly apart — can be so confusing to the faithful. But the book project appeared to mark an escalation. “I believe that celibacy has great significance as an abandonment of an earthly realm,” Benedict wrote in the book, according to the excerpt in the French newspaper Le Figaro, adding that for priests staying on the path to God, “celibacy becomes really essential.” On Tuesday, Archbishop Gänswein told the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress that at the request of the pope emeritus, Cardinal Sarah had called his publisher to ask that Benedict’s name and photograph be removed from the book’s cover, introduction and conclusion. Benedict had not co-authored the book, Archbishop Gänswein explained, but had merely contributed “a short text of his on the priesthood.” He added that the pope emeritus had not signed a contract with the French publisher, Fayard. “It was a misunderstanding, without questioning Cardinal Sarah’s good intentions,” Archbishop Gänswein said. Both Cardinal Sarah and Archbishop Gänswein declined to comment.  (The website of the French publisher, Fayard, proclaimed that Benedict had “exceptionally, with his great friend Cardinal Sarah” emerged from his silence “to write on one of the most difficult subjects for the church: the future of priests.”) Earlier Tuesday, Cardinal Sarah rejected allegations that he had duped the fragile pope emeritus. To clear his name, Cardinal Sarah produced receipts, publishing on Twitter Benedict’s personally signed correspondence. “Finally I can send my thoughts on the priesthood,” read a letter dated Oct. 12 and apparently signed by Benedict, posted by Cardinal Sarah.  Pointing to the letters, Cardinal Sarah added, “I solemnly affirm that Benedict XVI knew that our project would take the form of a book.” He also published on Tuesday a statement that called the allegations against him “deeply despicable,” and cuttingly added, “I sincerely forgive all those who have slandered me or who wish to set me against Pope Francis.”  He detailed his cooperation with Benedict on the book as dating back to Sept. 5, when he solicited Benedict’s reflection on priestly celibacy. “I can imagine that you are going to think that your thoughts on this could be inappropriate because of the debates that they would provoke,” Cardinal Sarah said he wrote to Benedict, but he said that he told the former pope that “the whole church needs this gift.” Benedict, he said, delivered a lengthy text to him in October, during the meeting of bishops from the Amazon region. Cardinal Sarah said in his statement that he was bowled over by the “magnitude” of the work and asked the pope if he would be willing to combine it into a book with his own meditations on the issue. On Nov. 19, he said he sent the book’s manuscript to Benedict, who later that month signed off, writing, “I agree to publish the text.” But letters or no letters, Benedict’s involvement in the book created the impression that the former pope was taking a stand against Francis’ openness to dialogue on the issue of priestly celibacy. As a result, a campaign to distance Benedict from the book he apparently co-authored pressured Cardinal Sarah to take a step back.  Not long after issuing his statement on Tuesday, Cardinal Sarah announced on Twitter that he had spoken this morning with Archbishop Gänswein and that, as per his demands, future editions of the book would present the cardinal as the sole author, “with contributions from Benedict XVI.”  He added that the content, however, “would remain absolutely unchanged” and that he stood by his previous statement. The book’s American publisher, Mark Brumley, the president of Ignatius Press, said he had no intention of stripping Benedict’s name from the book’s cover. “The text we received indicates the two authors are Benedict XVI and Cardinal Sarah,” he said.  Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Rome.

Iran’s President Lashes Out at Europeans Over Crumbling Nuclear Deal,2020-01-15,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Under growing pressure at home and abroad, Iranian leaders attempted on Wednesday to calm domestic anger over the downing of a passenger jet last week, while lashing out at European nations that have formally accused Iran of breaking the 2015 agreement to curb its nuclear program. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani criticized — and appeared to threaten — Britain, France and Germany for officially accusing Iran on Tuesday of reneging on its commitments under the nuclear deal, a step that further isolates Iran internationally and that could lead to renewed United Nations sanctions. The European countries, signatories to the deal, have tried to salvage the agreement since President Trump pulled out in 2018 and imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran, kick-starting the current high tensions. They said on Tuesday that they still hoped to preserve the deal, but Mr. Rouhani, at a government meeting, accused the Europeans of siding with the United States and urged them to uphold the deal. “Today, the American soldier is in danger, tomorrow the European soldier could be in danger,” Mr. Rouhani said in a speech, Agence France-Presse reported. The Europeans and the United States would only aggravate tensions in the region if they continued pulling back from the deal, he warned. “You will suffer if you take a wrong move,” he said, according to Press TV, a state-run news agency.  The nuclear deal, which was intended to keep Iran from building an atomic bomb, imposed limits on its ability to enrich uranium — the process of transforming the element into fuel for nuclear reactors or weapons. In response to American sanctions, Iran has repeatedly breached those restrictions, despite European pleas to return to compliance. But Mr. Rouhani seemed to leave a sliver of room open for further negotiation on Wednesday, noting in his speech that Iran’s recent steps to increase its nuclear activities were reversible. If the United States softened its punishing stance toward Iran, “we are prepared” to reciprocate, he said, according to Press TV. Comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday morning suggested that the United States was looking in the opposite direction, citing what he called “very direct discussions” with the European signatories to the nuclear deal.  “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place,” he said on CNBC. The Europeans’ decision to invoke the deal’s formal dispute resolution process arrived at a flammable moment for Iran, after weeks of domestic and international tumult. Antigovernment protests broke out in several cities last month, but the targeted killing by the United States of a top Iranian general this month temporarily united the country behind its leadership, and Iran fired missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq in retaliation. On Jan. 8, a Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kyiv crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard.

He said the military had taken a “good step” in acknowledging what had happened, but that it had to follow up with reforms to prevent future mistakes. But he also seemed to attribute the delay in conceding that the plane had been shot down to the sheer shock of what had happened.  “No one could believe that an aircraft has taken off from an international airport in the capital, begun flying on its route, and is then targeted,” said Mr. Rouhani, a former commander of Iran’s air defense forces. It was the second day in a row that the president, a relative moderate on Iran’s political spectrum, had criticized the military, which is closely tied to the country’s hard-line leaders. On Tuesday, he called for a special court to investigate the disaster and the authorities’ response to it, saying that greater openness was needed.  On Wednesday, Mr. Zarif, an ally of the president, appeared to be trying to balance the two power centers, praising the military in his remarks for being “brave enough to claim responsibility early on.” Mr. Rouhani also criticized the clerical establishment, which wields ultimate power in Iran, for disqualifying candidates in parliamentary elections next month, including some sitting lawmakers. Religious leaders often bar candidates seen as liberals or critics of the system, leaving voters to choose among conservatives whom the establishment considers acceptable.  Where there is no clear reason for disqualification, “don’t disappoint the people,” the president said. A contest for a single office might have the appearance of choice, with 17 candidates, but “17 people from how many sides, one side?” Mr. Rouhani asked. “This is not elections. It’s like having 2,000 of the same item in a shop.” The protests since the plane crash resulted on Wednesday in the departure of the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran had sought to expel him after he was detained briefly on Saturday, accused of attending an illegal antigovernment demonstration at a university in Tehran. Mr. Macaire said on Twitter this week that he had not been taking part in the protest but had gone to attend a planned vigil for victims of the plane crash. “Normal to want to pay respects,” he wrote, noting that some of the victims were British. “I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.” Britain had strongly objected to his detention in Iran, but in the end, Mr. Macaire left the country “with prior notice and according to the protocols,” IRNA reported on Wednesday, without offering further details. It remained to be seen whether protests in Iran over the airplane’s downing would continue much longer, but the economic distress that spurred Iranians into the streets late last year seems almost certain to continue. The economy is already choking under American sanctions, and Iran’s fading hopes for a badly needed economic lifeline from Europe received another blow with the invoking of the resolution mechanism on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, warned on Tuesday that Iran would respond “firmly, decisively and aptly” if the three European nations moved toward reimposing sanctions. “They should prepare themselves for potential consequences, of which they have been notified,” Mr. Mousavi said, according to the state-run outlet Press TV.

Europe’s Gamble: Can It Save Iran Deal by Threatening to Kill It?,2020-01-15,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Europe is gambling on keeping the 2015 Iran nuclear deal alive by threatening to destroy it — a risky, oddly timed strategy that could backfire badly, European officials and analysts say. The decision by France, Germany and Britain on Tuesday to challenge Iran’s breaches of the nuclear agreement and trigger what is known as the dispute resolution mechanism starts a clock that the Europeans may not be able to control, subject to unpredictable actions by the leaders of both Iran and the United States. Already the move has angered Iran, which contends its breaches of the accord are justified and that the Europeans are bending toward President Trump and his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Tehran. The Europeans insist otherwise. But watching Iran and the United States head for a possible military escalation, they are trying at least to avoid an outcome in which Iran moves down the North Korean road toward a nuclear bomb. “If there is a European strategy here, it’s essentially to try to buy time,’’ said Nathalie Tocci, a former adviser to the European Union’s former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the 2015 deal with Iran.  “The optimistic scenario is that they’ve done this to keep Trump happy and hope to stretch out the dispute process until the November U.S. elections,” Ms. Tocci said. The Europeans, she said, are wagering that “despite all the pressure on Iran, it won’t use the freedom it’s granted itself’’ to enrich uranium to bomb-ready levels. The Europeans also are hoping to induce the United States and Iran to somehow engage in negotiations on an enhanced deal that Mr. Trump can call his own, even if it differs little from the current one, negotiated by President Barack Obama, that limited Iran’s nuclear activities — a deal Mr. Trump has called the worst in history. “But it’s a very high-risk strategy,” Ms. Tocci said. “It’s hard to see Tehran playing ball all the way until November.’’ Wendy R. Sherman, a key American negotiator of the 2015 accord, also described the use of the dispute mechanism as “incredibly risky” and said “it will increase the likelihood of the demise” of the deal. It is hard to see those around Mr. Trump, who have opposed the nuclear deal and supported his maximum pressure campaign, granting Iran any concession to get talks started, said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform.  Mr. Trump’s subordinates appear to believe their strategy is working. Iran’s government and economy are weakened, they note. And they say the United States killing of a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad nearly two weeks ago has deterred Iran in the region, rather than prompting further attempts to expel the Americans from Iraq and Syria. But others, like Robert Malley, an American who helped negotiate the nuclear deal and now runs the International Crisis Group, say they are not so sure. They expect further retaliation from Iran and from the Iraqi militias it supports, including one led by a commander killed alongside General Suleimani. In its zeal to pressure the Europeans, a Trump administration official even threatened them with 25 percent tariffs on automobile exports if they did not invoke the dispute provision with Iran, according to a European official — which would be an extraordinary use of economic leverage for a foreign policy goal. The warning, first reported by The Washington Post, was conveyed in a single phone call and was regarded by the Europeans as counterproductive, the European official said.  An indication of the American administration’s mood came on Wednesday from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed United Nations sanctions on Iran would be swiftly reimposed now that France, Britain and Germany had triggered the dispute-resolution mechanism. The Europeans made that move in response to Iran’s declarations that it would no longer honor the nuclear accord’s limits on Iranian enrichment of uranium — potential fuel for a bomb. “I’ve had very direct discussions — as well as Secretary Pompeo has — with our counterparts,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC. “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place.’’ But that outcome, which would likely terminate the agreement, is precisely what the Europeans say they are trying to avoid. There is nervousness that Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, with his eye on a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, might crack, but European officials consider that possibility unlikely.  Mr. Johnson and his government support the nuclear deal and collaborated on a statement with France and Germany on Tuesday that said “we are not joining a campaign to implement maximum pressure on Iran.” On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson urged new talks with Washington and Tehran to try to negotiate a “Trump deal” to supplant the current one. Under the dispute mechanism, explained Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, time limits on discussions can be extended by consent. Any party to the deal can go directly to the United Nations Security Council to request the re-imposition of United Nations sanctions, but no one is expected to do that, unless Mr. Johnson unexpectedly capitulates to Washington.  John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, has argued that the Americans can make this request themselves. The Europeans disagree, saying Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the nuclear accord last year means the United States is no longer a party to it. Still, Ms. Geranmayeh said, both Iran and the United States are unpredictable. “If there is no diplomacy or something else poisons it militarily, the Europeans have triggered a clock that could end up more quickly at the Security Council,’’ she said. The political unrest in Iran, following the killing of General Suleimani and Iran’s accidental shooting down of a civilian airliner, creates enormous uncertainty. The government in Iran is cracking down on protests, and with parliamentary elections next month, hard-line rhetoric is bound to increase. While Iran insists its nuclear work will remain peaceful, its decisions to disregard the nuclear deal’s limits on both the volume and purity of Iranian nuclear fuel have raised worries that the country could amass enough enriched uranium to create a bomb in a matter of months. “I think the attack on Suleimani will make the Iranians want to accelerate their nuclear program,’’ Mr. Bond said. “They’ve seen Kim Jong-un and the lesson from Trump, which is if you have nuclear weapons you can get love letters from the president, and if you don’t, your generals can get killed.’’ Iran’s first reaction has been relative calm, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “But given the stalemate and the European inability to deliver the economic benefits it promised, Iran could end up by lashing out, and could do so on the nuclear side,’’ she said.  For example, Iran could restrict access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency or even expel them. “So it could all be worse, and you can’t separate that from the U.S.-Iran confrontation,’’ she said. Which is why the three European countries are expected to continue to focus on finding an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has been trying to do with Washington and Iran since the late summer.  Any new talks would face extraordinary obstacles. Iran says they would require sanctions relief as a precondition, and the Trump administration is instead increasing sanctions on Iran.  Some European officials have speculated that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has enjoyed some diplomatic successes where Washington has created vacuums, might try to mediate himself. Mr. Bond said Russia was happy to be aligned with the Europeans on at least this issue, and has benefited from Europe’s split on Iran with the United States. And Moscow, which is a party to the nuclear deal, has made clear it does not want a nuclear-armed Iran. François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, said that he could imagine a phased negotiation — first to determine what sanctions Washington could lift as a sign of good faith, then some high-level meeting, much like Mr. Trump had with Mr. Kim. While Mr. Heisbourg expressed skepticism, he praised the European countries for at least trying to de-escalate the tension while attempting to keep Iran from going down the North Korean path, risking a real war with the United States or Israel. “This is an unholy mess,’’ he said. “The chance of the Europeans succeeding in a meaningful way to improve matters is very low. But we are in a position to try this. And no one else is even trying.’’ Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Washington.']","A risky strategy to keep the nuclear agreement alive could backfire.

"Sinkhole in China Swallows a Bus, Killing at Least 6",2020-01-14,By Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — At least six people have been killed and more are missing after a bus plunged into a sinkhole in the city of Xining, in northwestern China.  Video footage circulating on Chinese social media on Monday shows several people waiting to board the bus in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, when a traffic sign wobbles and the vehicle begins to sink into the road.  Bystanders rushed to help passengers escape from the sinkhole, which was at least 32 feet in diameter, according to Chinese state media, but they backed away as the bus slipped further into the widening hole.  Rescue crews worked overnight to free trapped passengers. Local business owners said they tried to help by breaking the bus windows to reach passengers.  Officials in Xining said Tuesday morning that 10 people were missing and 15 more injured.  Sinkholes can be caused by natural erosion or acidic rainwater that weakens sedimentary rock. Similar accidents in China in recent years were thought to stem from construction projects.   A sinkhole in the southeastern city of Xiamen in December swallowed three cars. That same month, three people fell into a sinkhole near a subway line under construction in Guangzhou, in southern China. In 2013, a sinkhole engulfed an entire building complex in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the border with Hong Kong.

South Korean Leader Considers Letting Its Tourists Visit North Korea,2020-01-14,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on Tuesday called for economic exchanges with North Korea, including allowing visits there by South Korean tourists, to help ease tensions and encourage the North to resume talks with the United States. North Korea has already said that it would welcome tourists from the South as the heavily sanctioned country seeks new ways to earn hard currency. Tourism is one of the few North Korean industries not covered by sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council and Washington to squeeze the North’s ability to earn foreign currency. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently declared that his country no longer expected\u200b a breakthrough in deadlocked negotiations \u200bwith Washington \u200bover how to denuclearize \u200bthe \u200bNorth \u200bnor the lifting of American-led United Nations sanctions\u200b. He said his country would\u200b instead\u200b rebuild its economy without the help of relief from the sanctions that were imposed over the North’s weapons programs. To increase tourism, North Korea has recently opened seafront resorts or ski and spa complexes, all built in part to attract tourist cash from abroad, mainly China. Speaking during a nationally televised news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Moon, a tireless advocate for dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, said it was too early to give up hopes on North Korean-United States negotiations. One way to help revive diplomacy is to increase South-North Korean economic cooperation and exchanges\u200b as an incentive for the North to return to the negotiating table, Mr. Moon said. “The South and the North should not just look to North Korean-United States dialogue and should instead increase South-North Korean cooperation a bit as a way to expedite North Korea-United States dialogue,” Mr. Moon said. “There are things the South and the North can easily do. For instance, tour programs, especially individual tourists, are something we can probe because they are not banned \u200bunder international sanctions.” \u200bUnder United Nations sanctions, countries cannot buy coal, iron ore, textiles, fish and other key export items from the North. But foreign tourists can visit North Korea. The last South Korean tourists visited the North in 2008, when Seoul withdrew from a jointly run inter-Korean resort town at Diamond Mountain, or Kumgang, just north of the inter-Korean border. The resort was opened in 1998 and, until it was closed in a dispute over the shooting death of a South Korean tourist, served as a major source of foreign currency for the cash-starved North, frequently hosting South Korean tour groups. In October, North Korea said it would rebuild the long-abandoned town on its own after demolishing “shabby” hotels and other \u200bSouth Korean-built facilities there. But Mr. Kim said the North would “always welcome our compatriots from the South if they want to come to Mount Kumgang, after it is wonderfully built as the world-level tourist destination.” Mr. Moon has long argued that the United States should offer incentives, including easing sanctions, in return for concrete steps North Korea would take toward denuclearization. When he met Mr. Kim in April and September 2018, Mr. Moon presented bold \u200bplans for inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the reopening of the Diamond Mountain tour resort\u200b and the rebuilding of the North’s decrepit railways\u200b. But such visions remain in blueprint form \u200bwhile the country faces sanctions that ban all major international investments in the North.  Mr. Kim and President Trump met in Vietnam in February 2019 for a second summit meeting, but they parted ways without an agreement on how fast North Korea should dismantle its nuclear programs and how soon Washington should lift sanctions. North Korea’s attitude has since turned cold toward Washington. It has also begun heaping scorn on Seoul’s efforts to facilitate dialogue between the North and the United States, calling them “presumptuous.” Despite such ridicule, Mr. Moon said on Tuesday that his government would not abandon its efforts. He said South Korea would seek cooperation from the United States to get inter-Korean exchanges exempted from sanctions.\u200b Washington remains wary of giving such exemptions, fearing that they could weaken an international resolve to enforce sanctions on the North\u200b. In their latest messages, North Korea and Mr. Kim did not completely abandon dialogue \u200b with Washington, although they made vague threats about showing off “new strategic weapons” and to abandon a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, Mr. Moon said.  But Mr. Moon warned that the time for diplomacy was running out fast as Mr. Trump was expected to focus more on his re-election campaign in the coming months. “I think neither North Korea nor the United States has a lot of time on its hands,” he said.']",Kim Jong-un has been trying to attract more foreign tourists to ease the pain of sanctions; South Korea says it may allow visits to the North.
Plan to Cut U.S. Troops in West Africa Draws Criticism From Europe,2020-01-14,By Helene Cooper,"['BRUSSELS — A Pentagon proposal to greatly reduce American forces in West Africa faced criticism from allies on Tuesday, with French officials arguing that removing United States intelligence assets in the region could stymie the fight against extremist groups. American officials said they were proceeding nonetheless.  While no final decision has been made on how many troops will be transferred from Africa and the Middle East as the Pentagon refocuses its priorities to confront “great powers” like Russia and China, America’s top military officer said the United States needed to shift its forces to better counter China in particular. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged that the proposal was “causing some anxiety.” But he said that the United States needed to seriously re-examine its military footprint in Africa, and the Middle East and Latin America after that, given the heightened focus on China. General Milley’s comments came ahead of a NATO military chiefs’ meeting in Brussels, where he also sought to lay out the United States’ rationale for killing Iran’s top military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani this month. The killing of General Suleimani, who was the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force, has raised questions from America’s military allies about whether commanders of sovereign countries are now fair game for drone strikes. The Pentagon is also asking Europe to do more in the Middle East. After the killing of General Suleimani, Mr. Trump called for NATO to step up efforts to train Iraqi forces to fight the Islamic State in their country —\xa0a point that General Milley elaborated on at the NATO meeting on Tuesday.  One way European allies could help in Iraq, he said, was to provide ballistic missile defense systems at bases that house troops from the American-led coalition that has been fighting the Islamic State. Iran fired several ballistic missiles at two such bases in Iraq last week, though no one was killed. In Africa, the Trump administration wants European allies, particularly the French, to pick up a bigger share of the battle against extremist Islamist organizations like the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and Boko Haram. The Pentagon’s discussions of a large-scale pullback from West Africa include abandoning a recently built $110 million drone base in Niger and ending assistance to French forces battling militants in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. President Emmanuel Macron of France, in his own meeting with leaders of five West and Central African nations on Monday, pledged to send a further 220 French troops to the region, supplementing the 4,500 who are already there. Mr. Macron had called the meeting in an effort to persuade the African leaders to make clear publicly that they wanted the French forces to remain. With the Pentagon expected to make its initial decision about Africa this month, the United States’ plans have already drawn criticism from lawmakers, allies and military officials, and could eventually affect most global missions. About 200,000 United States forces are stationed abroad, a similar number to when President Trump took office with a promise to conclude the nation’s “endless wars.” Responding to General Milley’s comments on Monday, an aide to Mr. Macron told the news agency Agence France-Presse that American contributions to the fight against Islamic extremist groups in West Africa were “irreplaceable.” General Milley said that no final decision had been made, and that the Pentagon was reviewing American force posture all over the world. (United States military officials said that Africa was first because it begins with “A.”)  The Pentagon says that the overhaul of African deployments will be followed by one in Latin America and that drawdowns will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan, as it has outlined in recent months. But the killing of General Suleimani, which has sharply exacerbated tensions between Washington and Tehran, could undermine the Pentagon’s plans. Since that killing, it has sent thousands of additional troops to the region to protect against possible strikes from Iran.']",French officials said that a Pentagon proposal to relocate troops as it focuses on China and Russia could hinder the fight against extremists.
"U.K. Failed to Alert E.U. on 75,000 Criminal Convictions",2020-01-14,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Britain failed to notify other European countries about tens of thousands of foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, and then covered up the error to avoid embarrassment, according to a report on Tuesday in The Guardian. With Britain on the precipice of significant negotiations with the European Union over its post-Brexit security relationship with the bloc, the mistake threatened to weaken Europe’s trust in British law enforcement agencies heading into those talks. Under Britain’s arrangements with the European Union, it is supposed to send other member states an alert when citizens of another European country are convicted of crimes in a British court. But for five years, the Guardian reported, a British computer system failed to send the details of 75,000 such convictions to the offenders’ home countries, amounting to one in three of the required alerts. The notification system is supposed to allow local European police agencies to monitor people convicted of serious crimes abroad and to prevent offenders from escaping their convictions by moving to another European Union country. The Guardian quoted from the minutes of a meeting in May of the ACRO Criminal Records Office, a British police unit, indicating officials knew about the problem but did not want to send out alerts belatedly. “There is a nervousness from Home Office around sending the historical notifications out dating back to 2012 due to the reputational impact this could have,” the minutes say, according to The Guardian, which  published its article on Tuesday. Opposition Labour lawmakers and European lawmakers called for an urgent investigation. A Home Office spokeswoman said on Tuesday night that “work is already underway with the police to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.” The Home Office said it sent more than 30,000 notifications about convictions to European Union member states last year, and received more than 16,000 from other member states.  The ACRO Criminal Records Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The criminal records office told The Guardian that the problem was a technical one that stemmed in part from cases in which an offender had dual nationality. It said a software fix had been developed that would be released in the next update, though it said it did not know when that would be. As part of negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government will have to work out whether and how British and European law enforcement agencies will continue to share information. Britain is scheduled to formally leave the bloc on Jan. 31, but its current trading and security arrangements with Brussels will not expire until the end of a transition period in December.']",Britain was supposed to notify other member states of foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain.

Iran’s President Calls for Special Court on Downed Plane,2020-01-14,By Mujib Mashal,"['President Hassan Rouhani of Iran called on Tuesday for a special court to examine the recent downing of a passenger plane that killed 176 people,  as protests flared for the fourth day in several cities over the disaster and officials’ shifting explanations for it. But even as the president made the announcement, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful arm of Iran’s military, said it had arrested a person it identified as having recorded a video of a missile attacking the plane, which undercut the military’s initial denials that Iran was responsible. The arrest was announced by Iranian media outlets affiliated with the Guards.  The contradictory messages from the president, who is elected, and the Guards, who answer to Iran’s clerical leaders, reflect the competing power centers in the Iranian government. For three days after the crash of a Ukraine International Airlines jetliner, the military blamed mechanical failure. It eventually acknowledged that it had mistakenly shot the jet down with a missile, but insisted that “human error” was to blame, not any systemic problem. In an apparent criticism of the military, Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, urged that an official inquiry be candid about its findings. But some hard-line lawmakers have lashed out at his administration, demanding resignations. Iran’s chief prosecutor also demanded the expulsion of the British ambassador on Tuesday, accusing him of having broken the law by participating in an unauthorized protest. The ambassador, Rob Macaire, was briefly detained on Saturday after being picked up at an antigovernment demonstration at a Tehran university. Britain denounced the arrest as “a flagrant violation of international law” and summoned the Iranian ambassador to London on Monday to convey its objections. The Iranian prosecutor, Muhammad Jaffar Montazeri, said Tuesday that Mr. Macaire should be expelled as soon as possible, and Gholam Hossein Ismaili, a spokesman for the judiciary, called the ambassador a “problematic mole.” In the government’s investigation of the shooting down of the Ukrainian jet, Mr. Ismaili said Tuesday that “arrests have been” made but he did not provide any details, leaving it unclear how many people had been detained or how senior they were. “It would have been better if they had announced from the beginning that commissions are investigating,” he said, in an apparent criticism of the military and the government for the initial misleading statements. He said the flight data recorders recovered from the Ukrainian plane would be sent to France for analysis.  Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to deliver a Friday Prayer sermon this week, a role he plays only at times of major crisis; the last was eight years ago. The Ukrainian plane was shot down on Jan. 8, shortly after takeoff from Tehran, as hostilities between Iran and the United States had escalated after an American airstrike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Hours before the airliner crashed, Iran had fired missiles at United States forces in Iraq in response to the general’s killing, and Iranian forces were on guard for American retaliation. After three days of denying any role in the crash, Iran’s military admitted that the plane had been hit by at least one of its missiles.  Mr. Rouhani, himself a former commander of Iran’s air defense forces, said on Tuesday that he wanted the issue “to be addressed to the people with honesty.” “The familiarity I have with air defense issue, I say that it can’t be one person who is responsible for this,” he said, according to the state news agency. “Not just the person who pressed the button — there are others too.”  Ali Rabeei, a spokesman for Mr. Rouhani, has said that the government did not lie, but initially made incorrect statements because it did not have all the relevant information in a tense, fast-changing situation.  “Perhaps, I can even say, it was due to being kept uninformed,” Mr. Rabeei said.  President Rouhani asked the judiciary on Tuesday to create a “special court, with a high-ranking judge and tens of experts,” to look into the downing of the airliner. “This is not a regular case,” Mr. Rouhani said. “The whole world will watch this trial.” Amid a heavy security presence in Tehran, protests broke out on several university campuses on Tuesday, as they have daily since the government admitted that the plane had been shot down. At Tehran University, where Ayatollah Khamenei had prayed over the coffin of General Suleimani just days earlier, students chanted about the ayatollah, “our shame, our shame is our supreme leader.” At Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, students castigated officials who had misled the public about the crash while saying they were mourning the victims. “If you are mourning why did you cover it up for three days?” they chanted. Mr. Ismaili, the judiciary spokesman, said about 30 people have been arrested over the recent days of protests.  Officials in Tehran said on Tuesday that 61 of the 176 victims had been identified through DNA testing, and that their remains could be handed over to their families.

"Fire in Bound Brook, N.J., Destroys New Luxury Complex",2020-01-13,By Tiffany May,"['An enormous fire on Sunday engulfed several buildings in Bound Brook, N.J., sowing panic as tall plumes of smoke shot into the air. No injuries were reported, but the fierce blaze set off multiple alarms, and Doppler radars detected a shift in weather patterns as a result of the smoke. Residents were also able to see the flames from a distance. Bound Brook, a borough in Somerset County with a population of about 10,000 people, has been experiencing a building boom, with new downtown developments going up in the wake of the completion of a flood-control project. The low-lying area had been hit by heavy flooding in recent decades, including in 1999, when Hurricane Floyd left Main Street under 12 feet of water and sent about a third of the city’s residents to emergency shelters. One building struck by the overnight fire was part of Meridia, a new luxury complex with residential units and retail space. The fire then spread to another residential complex under construction, as well as at least two houses and a store. The Bound Brook police warned on Facebook that the fire might spread farther because it was so difficult to contain.  The blaze caused NJ Transit to suspend service on the Raritan Valley Line in both directions, and the agency  said on Twitter that train service could remain suspended during the morning commute. Bus service was being provided to the affected communities. Another apartment fire in the community last summer injured a building superintendent and displaced more than a dozen tenants.

U.S. Military Resumes Joint Operations With Iraq,2020-01-15,By Alissa J. Rubin and Eric Schmitt,"['BAGHDAD — The United States military resumed joint operations with Iraq on Wednesday, military officials said, ending a 10-day pause that began after an American airstrike killed a top Iranian military commander in Baghdad. The decision to restart military operations came less than two weeks after Iraq’s Parliament voted to expel all American forces from the country. The government accused the United States of violating Iraqi sovereignty by carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, including one on Jan. 3 that killed the Iranian commander, a leader of Iraqi militia forces and eight other people. Two American military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the missions to reporters, confirmed that the joint operations had restarted.  They said the military wanted to resume operations against the Islamic State as soon as possible to blunt any momentum the group might have and to stifle any propaganda victory it might claim because the United States had suspended the operation. It was unclear on Wednesday whether anyone in the Iraqi government approved the resumption of joint missions — it was the Americans who stopped them, not the Iraqis — and Iraqi officials could not be reached for comment. Iraq’s acting prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, who has said that his government would comply with Parliament’s order to expel American forces, seemed to soften his position on Wednesday. In a speech to his cabinet, he suggested that Parliament’s decision might not be the final word, saying “If we reach the decision to get the forces out of Iraq, then this would be the decision of the Iraqi government.” He also noted that if the government expelled the Americans, it would follow “an appropriate time line,” suggesting that any departure might not be immediate. He also reminded the ministers that “ISIS has begun to reorganize and plan invasions and attacks.” Mr. Abdul Mahdi had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over the weekend to send delegates to Iraq to work out the details of a troop withdrawal, according to a statement released by his office.  Mr. Pompeo refused, saying the American mission in Iraq was to train Iraqi forces to fight the Islamic State, and “we’re going to continue that mission.”  The State Department said that the United States would only be willing to discuss “appropriate force posture in the Middle East.” Despite the Iraqi government’s moves toward expelling the Americans, some Iraqi security officials have opposed the idea, saying they were needed to help fight the remnants of the Islamic State and prevent its resurgence, as well as to support coalition troops from other countries. If the Americans and most other coalition militaries left, the Iraqis could continue to fight the extremists on their own, but would likely be hampered by a lack of drone-based intelligence and air cover, according to senior coalition military officials. The Islamic State, which a few years ago controlled a large part of Iraq, no longer controls territory there but remains active in some pockets and claims a few Iraqi lives almost every week.  Removing the United States military from Iraq would take more than a vote in Parliament. According to American officials, it would require the Iraqi government to annul the agreements it has made allowing the American and coalition forces to train, advise and assist in the fight against the Islamic State. The American-led military coalition in Iraq suspended its counterterrorism mission on Jan. 5, two days after an American MQ-9 Reaper drone fired missiles into a convoy at the Baghdad airport, killing the Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani; Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy chief of a coalition of Iraqi militias; and eight other people. The Americans were concerned that the outrage over the drone attack could lead to attacks on the American military by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq or a retaliatory attack by Iran itself.

"Fire in Bound Brook, N.J., Destroys New Luxury Complex",2020-01-13,By Tiffany May,"['An enormous fire on Sunday engulfed several buildings in Bound Brook, N.J., sowing panic as tall plumes of smoke shot into the air. No injuries were reported, but the fierce blaze set off multiple alarms, and Doppler radars detected a shift in weather patterns as a result of the smoke. Residents were also able to see the flames from a distance. Bound Brook, a borough in Somerset County with a population of about 10,000 people, has been experiencing a building boom, with new downtown developments going up in the wake of the completion of a flood-control project. The low-lying area had been hit by heavy flooding in recent decades, including in 1999, when Hurricane Floyd left Main Street under 12 feet of water and sent about a third of the city’s residents to emergency shelters. One building struck by the overnight fire was part of Meridia, a new luxury complex with residential units and retail space. The fire then spread to another residential complex under construction, as well as at least two houses and a store. The Bound Brook police warned on Facebook that the fire might spread farther because it was so difficult to contain.  The blaze caused NJ Transit to suspend service on the Raritan Valley Line in both directions, and the agency  said on Twitter that train service could remain suspended during the morning commute. Bus service was being provided to the affected communities. Another apartment fire in the community last summer injured a building superintendent and displaced more than a dozen tenants.

"Death Sentence Overturned for Pervez Musharraf, Ex-Leader of Pakistan",2020-01-13,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani high court on Monday overturned a death sentence that was handed down to Pervez Musharraf in a treason trial last month, most likely putting an end to the legal case against the country’s former military dictator. Monday’s ruling, by a three-member bench of the High Court, found that the special court that issued the sentence was unconstitutional. Several lawyers and analysts said that the current government, which includes many Musharraf loyalists, was unlikely to reconstitute the special court for a new trial. The three judges, in the eastern city of Lahore, said that the case against Mr. Musharraf was politically motivated and that the crimes he was accused of committing —\xa0high treason and subverting the Constitution — were “a joint offense” that “cannot be undertaken by a single person.” Mr. Musharraf, 76, was accused of subverting the country’s Constitution in 2007 when he fired much of the judiciary and imposed a state of emergency in an attempt to block a political opposition movement. The movement had greatly weakened him, and he resigned the following year under a threat of impeachment. Even when originally announced in December, the death sentence was largely seen as symbolic —\xa0the first time in the country’s history that a former military ruler had been held accountable for actions taken while in office. It was not expected to be carried out in a country where the military, which still wields immense power, was expected to protect its former chief. Soon after the death sentence was announced, the Pakistani Army criticized the verdict and called for a legal review. Mr. Musharraf’s legal team challenged the sentence in the Lahore High Court this month. The treason trial was initiated in 2013 by the prime minister at the time, Nawaz Sharif, whose earlier government Mr. Musharraf had toppled in a bloodless coup. Mr. Musharraf —\xa0who is now in Dubai in a self-imposed exile —\xa0claimed that the charges against him were politically motivated.  Mr. Musharraf also maintained that he was not alone in the imposition of the state of emergency in 2007 and had been aided by senior government and military officials.  He did not appear in the initial proceedings of the treason case, and his security convoy was mysteriously directed to a military hospital before one 2014 hearing. Despite his complaints of chest pains, many believed that the military was protecting him from prosecution. He was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment in 2016, and although he vowed to return and face the legal cases, he did not do so. The death sentence announced in December was handed down in absentia.']",A panel of judges ruled that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and that the crime he was accused of could not be “undertaken by a single person.”
"Cash Appeared on Their Streets for Years. Now, Villagers Know Why.",2020-01-14,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — For nearly six years, money seemed to be falling from the sky onto the streets of a village in northeastern England.  Residents of the village, Blackhall Colliery, regularly found neat bundles of 20-pound notes, then promptly handed the money to the police. The bundles often amounted to 2,000 pounds, or about $2,600. But the question of where the cash had come from left the authorities baffled. The police revealed this week that two people who wished to be known only as good Samaritans had been dotting the money around town in an effort to “give something back” to the community. At least £26,000 in cash had been found since 2014 near the main street of Blackhall Colliery, a former mining village of less than 5,000 residents on the North Sea coast.  The Durham Constabulary, the police force responsible for the surrounding county, first went public with the mystery in November in a last-ditch effort to find the source of the money. Inquiries to residents, village organizations, the post office and local bank had yielded nothing, nor had tests for fingerprints.  “These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in,” John Forster, detective constable of the Durham Constabulary said in a statement released in November, after the fourth bundle that year was handed to the police. He appealed to the public to come forward with any relevant information. The news of the cash drops spread quickly, drawing international attention and heated speculation about who, or what, might be behind them. The village residents were also praised for their honesty, as they consistently turned the cash over to the police. When no one came to claim it, the finders received the money themselves.  At least one element of the mystery came to an end on Monday, when the Durham Constabulary said that two people had come forward as the village’s philanthropists.  They both asked to remain anonymous, and the police referred to them as only “the good Samaritans.” Mr. Forster said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the pair — who, he said, knew each other but appear to be unrelated — did not choose Blackhall Colliery “at random.” “It’s something personal for them,” he said. The police said in a statement released this week that “both generous individuals had recently received unexpected windfalls and told police they wanted to give something back.”  “One of the Good Samaritans told detectives that they felt an ‘emotional connection’ to the village after being helped by one of the residents, so she wanted to repay the kindness she received,” the police said.  The police said that the pair left the bundles of £20 notes in places where people in need, including the elderly or vulnerable, would be likely to find them. But the police said they didn’t leave everything to chance, and often waited until they saw someone pick up the money.  Mr. Forster said on Tuesday that the only detail he had withheld from the public was the exact way the bundles were wrapped.

‘It Was Like a Scene From an Action Movie’,2020-01-13,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['AYN AL ASAD AIR BASE, Iraq — The first of several Iranian missiles to hit the American military base rammed into the airstrip, nearly destroying a guard tower where two young army specialists were on watch duty. Another crashed next to a dining hall and destroyed part of a building where some drone operators were still working. The base, Ayn Al Asad, in western Iraq, was one of two hit last week in an Iranian attack in retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force. As flames, dust and debris filled the air and the building shook, the drone operators dived under their desks. The lights swung madly, and then went out. They had remained in the building despite warnings of an imminent assault because they wanted to get their drones into the air so they would not  be destroyed by the missiles, and because “we didn’t know if there was going to be any ground attack,” said First Sgt. Wesley Kilpatrick.  For the most part, they succeeded in preserving the drones.   Moments after the attack ended, one of the drone operators, Staff Sgt. Costin Herwig, 26, stumbled outside to look for his colleagues. “It was like a scene from an action movie,” he said. “I tried to get to a desk so I could bring down my drone, but my electrical wires were fried and I couldn’t get it back.” On Monday, though, despite simmering tensions between Iran and the United States, and looming questions about whether the American military would be ordered to leave Iraq, as the Iraqi Parliament demanded last week, the base seemed mostly normal.  It was still forbidden to eat in the dining hall because it was not bombproof. So everybody grabbed their food — a reduced menu — and left. Some housing units were destroyed as well as work places — all empty when the missiles hit — but the rebuilding had already begun. The drone lost by Sergeant Herwig was one of the few casualties of the missile attack on the base, which was opened by Saddam Hussein in 1987. No one was killed or wounded in the five barrages of multiple missiles that night, although several military personnel who were working were checked for concussions. The absence of casualties seemed to be the result of luck and warnings. The first came early in the day, when all the bases in the region went on high alert. Another warning was issued around 11 p.m., putting the bases into lockdown. Finally, the American military detected the missile launches in Iran and determined their likely targets, giving the military personnel at Asad Air Base 15 minutes to take cover.  Most retreated to concrete bunkers where the greatest danger anyone faced was the collapse of one of the concrete walls. But they were able to jump out of the way in time. The base has about 1,500 American servicemen and women and 500 others from coalition countries, principally Danes, Norwegians and Polish.']",United States military personnel recount what it was like when Iranian missiles hit their base last week.
She Was Known in China by Her Weight: 47 Pounds. Her Death Set Off Outrage.,2020-01-15,By Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — To save money for her brother’s medical bills, the woman in a Chinese village often ate only rice and chili peppers or plain steamed buns. Years later, malnutrition wasted her body and worsened a heart problem — and she turned to the internet for help. The woman, Wu Huayan, was a 24-year-old college student, but she weighed less than 50 pounds and stood at a mere 4 feet and 5 inches, according to state news reports. She became an instant symbol of the harsh effects of poverty and hunger, and set off an outpouring of $140,000 in donations — a significant amount in rural China. Then, on Monday, Ms. Wu died in a hospital — and public sympathy quickly turned to grief and outrage.  The images of her frail, stunted body touched off a torrent of criticism that officials had failed to help the disadvantaged at a time when China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has vowed to eliminate extreme poverty. For many Chinese, Ms. Wu’s plight was a stark reminder that despite the party’s pledges and the leaps the country has made economically, poverty was still a harsh reality in parts of rural China. Some also drew a link between the tragedy and the country’s problem with official graft that eats up public resources.  “How much money do corrupt officials have to embezzle before they get caught? Hasn’t this already damaged our country and our people?” Yu Fannuo, a tech commentator, wrote on a blog. “Why is it that Wu Huayan, the girl in Guizhou, was only discovered and helped when she was on the brink of death?” Ms. Wu’s death also cast a spotlight on the widespread public skepticism and distrust of philanthropy, which is a nascent concept in China. Questions arose over how several charities handled the money that had flooded in to pay for the woman’s hospital treatment, and why only a tenth of the funds was used. In a commentary, People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, asked if the charities had exploited a tragedy for commercial gain. “At what scale is phony fund-raising and tragedy consumption happening?” the paper said.  Ms. Wu grew up in a village in the poor, heavily rural province of Guizhou, state media reported. She subsisted for several years on a meager diet to help care for her younger brother. The malnutrition caused her to lose her eyebrows and some of her hair, and made her untreated illnesses worse. She began to have trouble breathing in 2018, and was admitted to a hospital in October for heart and kidney problems.  That month, she started an appeal on Shuidichou, an online crowdfunding site, saying that medical costs that would add up to nearly $30,000 were far beyond her means. Family and friends had already made loans and she was desperate, she said. “I’m only asking for help because I have no other way out,” she wrote. “I still want to live a proper life. I still want to contribute to society and will use all my strength to fight my illness.” Her story was reported by national news outlets in October  and then widely circulated on social media. Ms. Wu said after that in a video interview  that she had received 100 calls and messages.  Speaking in a soft voice from a hospital bed and wearing fuzzy blue pajamas, she thanked her donors, saying that the support made her feel less alone.  “I feel as though I can suddenly see the sun again after being abandoned in the dark night,” she said. “I don’t know your name, where you are and what lives you are living, and I haven’t appeared in your lives before — but I want to thank you for your sacrifices for an ordinary stranger like me.”  A few charities also helped to raise money, including the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children, a private organization that is overseen by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.  The charity started a crowdfunding campaign that raised nearly $30,000 for Ms. Wu. It said it wired about $3,000 of that amount to her hospital in November. Under pressure to account for the rest of the money, the foundation said in statements that swelling in her organs had prevented Ms. Wu from undergoing surgery, and that Ms. Wu’s family had requested that the money be used for the operation and her recovery.  The foundation acknowledged the public criticism of how it handled the donations and said it was investigating the matter. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.  Ms. Wu died of heart and kidney diseases on Monday, according to an announcement posted by the school she attended, Guizhou Forerunner College. That was three months after she started her crowdfunding appeal. Philanthropy is in the early stages of development in China, and the sector has been roiled in recent years by scandals. The Red Cross Society of China, a state-run organization that is one of the country’s largest charities, was badly hit by a 2011 scandal that hurt public trust, especially in efforts that are led by the government. Concerns about transparency and accountability in philanthropy have surged alongside the popularity of crowdfunding for charitable causes.  Internet platforms created by Chinese technology giants have enabled charities and nonprofits to finance their projects, and those efforts have been met with increasing scrutiny, said Shawn Shieh, an independent expert on Chinese philanthropy and civil society. “China’s social media culture demands immediate responses to questions on funding quite often without understanding the whole story,” Mr. Shieh said. “We’re seeing the charity sector go through growing pains on how to deal with public criticism about these public cases.” Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing.']",The woman’s struggle made her a symbol of the effects of poverty and hunger and raised questions about philanthropy and government aid.
Iran Cracks Down as Protests Over Downing of Airliner Grow,2020-01-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and David D. Kirkpatrick,"['A top Iranian military commander made a rare public appeal for forgiveness on Sunday as security forces fired on protesters and outrage over the mistaken downing of a jetliner reignited opposition on the streets and stirred dissent within the government’s conservative base.  It was the second day of protests after the military acknowledged early Saturday that it had launched the missiles that brought down a Ukraine International Airlines jet near the Iranian capital on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. The disaster unfolded amid escalating tensions with the United States over the killing of a revered Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. For the first three days after the crash, Iran denied growing international accusations that it had shot the plane down, and looked as if it was engaged in a cover-up. The Iranian authorities insisted that the jetliner had gone down for mechanical reasons, and refused to cooperate with investigators. They also began to remove some evidence from the scene. But then, as the uproar mounted, Iranian leaders admitted that they had shot the aircraft down, citing human error.  That admission limited the blowback from abroad — but threw a match on the volatile situation at home. Anti-government protests that had quieted when General Suleimani was killed in a drone strike in Iraq rekindled across the country. Still, analysts argued that this latest wave of internal unrest could ultimately strengthen those in Iran who are pressing to confront the United States. Already, they were seeking to blame Washington for the protests.  [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] On Sunday, the unrest spread outside Tehran, the capital, to at least a dozen cities. Security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets and eventually live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in Tehran. By late Sunday night, several people had been wounded, witnesses said. Unlike previous waves of opposition, some of the outrage this time has come from conservatives who ordinarily support the government, as well as from the usual critics. Headlines in hard-line newspapers demanded resignations, and the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Hossein Salami, issued a very rare public apology. In a televised address, he all but begged Iranians to return to the nationalist zeal that only days earlier had seemed to fill the country, after General Suleimani’s killing. Iran responded to his death by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where American forces were stationed. “We achieved a great victory,” General Salami said, though the missile barrage injured no one and did little serious damage. “But the crash of the airplane has tarnished it.” He said he wished he, too, had “crashed and burned” on the jet. The editor in chief of the Revolutionary Guard’s Tasnim news agency, Kian Abdollahi, said that attempts by government officials to lie about what had happened were as great a “catastrophe” as the crash itself. “Officials who misled the media are guilty too,” he said on Twitter. “We are all ashamed before the people.” Analysts say the uproar, however, is unlikely to dampen the Iranian appetite for confrontation with the West. Iranian hard-liners habitually suspect that American covert operations are behind domestic protests, and the unvarnished pleasure the White House seemed to take in the events unfolding in Iran over the weekend may only harden that view, analysts said. “We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage,” President Trump tweeted on Sunday.  Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said that even as they took tough measures to suppress protests at home, Iranian leaders might lash out against Washington, covertly or otherwise.  “They believe that the U.S. and its allies in the region are fueling and exploiting internal discontent in Iran,” he said. “The game will return to Iran’s comfort zone: indirect attacks against the United States and its allies in ways that would allow plausible deniability and minimal risks of reprisal.” Over the last year, the Trump administration has hit Iran with a so-called “maximum pressure campaign” of painful economic sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran to submit to new restrictions on its military activities and nuclear program. Iranian officials  describe it as economic warfare.  If hawks in Washington view the protests as evidence of success, that could work against Iranians who favor compromise with the United States — and strengthen hard-liners who favor confrontation, said Sanam Vakil, a scholar at Chatham House.  “Security-focused conservatives are thinking they can’t come to the table now because it would be weak,” she said. General Salami of the Revolutionary Guards, in his apology and plea for unity on Sunday, appeared eager to rally Iranians once again against their perennial rival since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “We are at war with the United States,” he said. “We do not consider the conflict with the United States over. We are the soldiers of the people, and we will sacrifice ourselves for you.” “Iran has risen,” he said, noting that its military had dared fire missiles toward American forces on bases in Iraq — even if it did so without much chance of damage or casualties. “Iran is proud and the whole world has seen our power.” By acknowledging belatedly that Iran’s own military had brought down the jet, Iranian leaders avoided the prospect of greater international isolation. European and other governments that had sought to trade with Iran or mediate its dispute with Washington had all begun to cite evidence that Iranian forces shot down the plane.  Canada, the final destination of most passengers on the downed jet, lost 57 citizens. At a memorial event on Sunday at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the crash “truly a Canadian tragedy.” “I want to assure all families and all Canadians: We will not rest until there are answers,” he said. “We will not rest until there is justice and accountability.” The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said Sunday that two of its air accident investigators had obtained visas from Iran and would arrive in Tehran on Monday. It said  two experts in downloading and analyzing flight data and voice recorder information would follow. In Tehran, the scale of the domestic backlash may have caught the government by surprise. Uniformed members of the security forces and pro-government militia men were deployed in large numbers in cities around the country, apparently in an unsuccessful effort to discourage a second day of protests. By the end of the night, at least several people had been shot in the back by security forces, according to witnesses and videos. Several protesters in Tehran said in interviews that a circle of militiamen had closed in and beaten them. “The city is a security zone and special forces units are at every square,” Siamak Ghasemi, an economist living in Tehran, wrote on his Instagram page. The wrong group, he said, was being punished: “It’s as if civilians had brought down a military plane.” Despite the heavy security presence, large crowds turned out. In many places, they chanted caustic slogans. Some denounced the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is a capital offense in Iran.  “The supreme leader is a murderer; his regime is obsolete,” demonstrators chanted in Azadi Square in Tehran. “Our enemy is right here,” others chanted in a video circulating on social media. “They lie to us that it’s America.”  The protests in several cities were centered at universities and dominated by students, perhaps because many of those killed in the plane crash were recent graduates heading for further study in Canada. “They killed our geniuses and replaced them with clerics,” young men and women chanted in the city of Shiraz. Dozens of prominent film directors, artists and performers issued statements condemning the government’s handling of the crash and pulling their work from a prestigious competition. “We are not citizens,” Iran’s best-known actress, Taraneh Alidoosti, wrote on her Instagram page; she has six million followers. “We are hostages, millions of hostages.”  A member of the Tehran city council issued a stinging statement of resignation: “Today we are faced with systematic lies, cover-ups and lack of accountability. In the current environment I have no hope for reform.” And the only female Iranian athlete to win an Olympic medal also chose Sunday to announce that she had defected. “I am one of the millions of oppressed women in Iran who they have been playing with for years,” the athlete, Kimia Alizadeh, wrote on Instagram. She won a bronze medal in taekwondo in 2016. Officials appeared to be scrambling to get behind the outpouring of public grief for those killed on the plane. A billboard in downtown Tehran that had displayed a photo of General Suleimani was taken down. In its place was a black banner with the names of the victims and a verse about grief. In Tabriz and Tehran, some protesters could be seen tearing up photos of General Suleimani that had been hanging from poles. Iranian media reported that local officials, prayer leaders and Revolutionary Guard commanders were visiting the families of victims to offer apologies and condolences. Like the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Guards, though, Ayatollah Khamenei did his best to shift public attention back to the conflict with the Washington.  In a meeting with the visiting emir of Qatar, according to his website, he argued that the problems of the region were created by “the United States and its friends.” Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.']","Remarkably, some criticism is coming from some within the government’s hard-line power base."
Turkey Restores Wikipedia After More Than 2-Year Ban,2020-01-15,By The New York Times,"['The Turkish government lifted a two-and-a-half-year ban on Wikipedia on Wednesday, restoring access to the online encyclopedia a month after the country’s top court ruled that blocking it was unconstitutional. Access to Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey in 2017, after the site refused to remove unflattering references to Turkey’s relationship with Syrian militants and state-sponsored terrorists.  Turkey began allowing access to the site again on Wednesday, hours after its Official Gazette published the Constitutional Court’s ruling in favor of Wikipedia. In December, the court had found that the ban violated the right to free expression protected in Turkey’s Constitution.  By late Wednesday, access had been restored to most of the country, according to NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet usage and cybersecurity. But for those advocating freedom of expression, the restoration was too little, too late. “It shouldn’t have gone either to the Constitutional Court or to the European Court of Human Rights for such a matter,’’ tweeted Gonenc Gurkaynak, a lawyer representing the Wikimedia Foundation, the site’s parent organization, referring to a second complaint filed against the ban in Europe. The case is still pending at the European court, and Can Yeginsu, a London-based lawyer representing Wikipedia said it would address both the Turkish law that allowed the ban and the lengthy judicial process to remove it. ‘’Any judicial process that takes so long puts into question its own effectiveness,’’ Mr. Yeginsu said. Turkey had also blocked YouTube and Twitter in 2014, but the country’s constitutional court took immediate action at the time to declare those bans unconstitutional.  The right of free speech in Turkey has been under increasing pressure in recent years, especially after a failed coup in 2016. Dozens of media outlets were shuttered after the coup attempt, and at least 47 journalists remain jailed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Tens of thousands of websites are still blocked, said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor who has helped lead legal challenges against the Wikipedia ban and other web restrictions. “Restoring Wikipedia is just a start,’’ he said. “We should not forget the dimensions of Turkey’s freedom of expression problems.’’']",The country’s top court had ruled that the move was unconstitutional. 
Chemical Plant Explosion in Spain Kills One and Prompts Order to Stay Inside,2020-01-14,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — An explosion and fire at a petrochemical factory in Catalonia on Tuesday killed at least one person and injured several more, prompting officials to block roads, suspend rail service and order nearby residents to stay inside. The shock waves from the initial blast were felt several miles from the factory, the authorities said, and the one fatality was reported in a building damaged by tremors.  The blast occurred at about 7 p.m. at a factory housing the Iqoxe company on the outskirts of Tarragona, a city whose metropolitan area includes several hundred thousand people.  The factory is Spain’s only producer of ethylene oxide, which can be transformed into ethylene glycol, a chemical that is used to help manufacture a wide range of products, including antifreeze, packaging film, plastic bottles and polyester fibers for clothing. The explosion was reported in a part of the plant that opened last year, after an investment of about 10 million euros, according to local news reports.  The authorities offered no immediate explanation for the explosion. Firefighters struggled throughout the night to battle the blaze, declaring it under control at about midnight. The order to stay inside was lifted about three hours after the explosion. Quim Torra, the regional president of Catalonia, Spain’s northeastern region, told local reporters that “no toxic agent” had been detected in the air and that people should not fear for their health.  Two of the injured were being treated Tuesday night for burn injuries, and their condition was described as critical.

Under the agreement, if they cannot resolve their dispute, that could revive United Nations sanctions on Iran that had been suspended under the deal, including an arms embargo. The move, which had been expected for more than a week, was delayed when the United States killed a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, with repercussions that are still playing out in Iran and across the region. President Trump withdrew in 2018 from the deal, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama, and he has imposed several rounds of American sanctions on Iran. In response, Tehran has repeatedly moved beyond the limits that the agreement had placed on its uranium enrichment, raising fears that it could be close to building an atomic bomb. Still, Iran has allowed international inspectors to stay in the country, making it unlikely that it could go forward with a bomb in secret. The Europeans want to save the deal and persuade both Washington and Tehran to begin a new set of negotiations about missile development and Iran’s regional activities, a senior European official said. But the three European countries, all signatories to the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, clearly felt that they had to respond to Iran’s movement away from compliance. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said that they had warned Iran on Dec. 6 that “unless it reversed course, we would have no choice but to take action,” but Iran “has chosen to further reduce compliance.” On Tuesday, they set in motion the nuclear deal’s dispute resolution process, they said, “in good faith, with the overarching objective of preserving the JCPOA and in the sincere hope of finding a way forward through constructive diplomatic dialogue.” The Europeans reiterated that they opposed Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the deal and were not joining his campaign of “maximum pressure” to cripple Iran economically. “Our hope is to bring Iran back into full compliance,” they said. The three nations “took the right step,” the State Department said in a statement, adding that “nations must unite behind this effort to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its continued destabilizing actions.” There was no immediate reaction from Tehran. The 2015 agreement restricted how many centrifuges Iran could use to enrich uranium — increasing the percentage of U-235, the rare isotope crucial to its use in nuclear fission — how highly it could enrich the metal, and how much uranium it could stockpile.  It has taken a series of steps beyond those limits, trying in vain to pressure the Europeans to make good on a commitment to ease the economic pain of American sanctions. Earlier this month, in response to the Suleimani killing, Iran said it would no longer abide by any restrictions in its uranium enrichment, but without specifying what it would actually do, which was taken by the Europeans as a useful ambiguity. Mr. Trump’s harsh sanctions include a prohibition on banking transactions with Iran — a very difficult prohibition to work around, given the global reach of American banks. The Europeans have struggled to get a barter system working to circumvent the use of the dollar and American banking systems, adding to Iranian frustration as the United States sanctions take a toll on the country. The Europeans, especially Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, want to give a nod toward Mr. Trump while also trying to bring urgency to diplomatic efforts to get new talks underway. In a BBC interview Tuesday morning, Mr. Johnson spoke flatteringly of Mr. Trump and said he wanted to avert further military confrontation between Iran and the United States. “Let’s dial this thing down,” he said. “President Trump is a great deal-maker, by his own account,” Mr. Johnson said. “Let’s work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead,” he added, though it was not clear what such a deal would look like.  In a separate statement, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany said, “We could no longer leave unanswered the increasing Iranian violations of the nuclear agreement unanswered.” “Our objective is clear: We want to preserve the agreement and reach a diplomatic solution within the agreement,” he said. “We will tackle this together with all partners in the agreement. We call on Iran to participate constructively in the negotiation process that is now beginning.” But there was some skepticism that the time was right for talks. Robert Malley, who heads the International Crisis Group and helped negotiate the nuclear deal, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump and his aides would feel now that Iran was weakened by the sanctions and the protests in the streets after the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner. The Americans would be unlikely to want to give Iran any concessions to start the talks, he said, let alone the lifting of American sanctions that Iran insists must be a precondition. At the same time, Mr. Malley said, senior Iranian officials would not want to be seen talking with Trump administration officials responsible for the killing of General Suleimani, a very popular figure in Iran who was considered its second most important leader. “The Europeans are trying not to offend Trump too much but also trying to keep the JCPOA alive,” he said. “But the U.S. now thinks it’s winning,” he said, “so the Europeans are trying now to avoid it all going off the rails.” Mr. Malley said he did not agree with triggering the dispute mechanism now, given the newly complicated setting, but said that doing so was “is not fatal” to the deal. “The only way forward now is to use the time to try to get the U.S. and Iran to talk,” he added. Iran had been put under a series of United Nations Security Council sanctions, mostly dating from 2006 and later, after it refused to comply with a Security Council resolution to stop uranium enrichment. Nearly all those sanctions were lifted after the 2015 nuclear deal.  Even if they were reinstated — something the Europeans do not want to do — they would not make a significant economic difference to Iran, given the power of the separate American sanctions reimposed by Mr. Trump.  One measure that could matter to Tehran if reimposed would restore an essentially blanket arms embargo on Iran. Iran in the past has threatened to quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if United Nations sanctions were to be restored.  Last week Mr. Trump urged the European signatories to abandon the nuclear deal; as late as Sunday, the three European leaders pledged to salvage the deal and again urged Iran to return to full compliance. Russia and China, also signatories to the nuclear deal, have supported the efforts to preserve it, including the purchasing of some Iranian oil. In their joint statement, the three European foreign ministers urged all sides to negotiate and said: “Given recent events, it is all the more important that we do not add a nuclear proliferation crisis to the current escalation threatening the whole region.” On Tuesday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry warned of a “serious and strong response” to the European decision. At the same time, its spokesman Abbas Mousavi said that Iran was “fully ready to answer any good-will and constructive effort” that would preserve the nuclear deal, according to the official IRNA news agency.

"Iran Protests Rage Over Downed Jet, as Lawmakers Demand Accountability",2020-01-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and Ben Hubbard,"['Widespread anger at the Iranian government for shooting down a passenger plane and then misleading the public about it simmered for a third day on Monday, with the police and protesters facing off in at least two cities and increasing demands from lawmakers for accountability. After days of denials, Iran acknowledged Saturday that it had mistakenly shot down the Ukrainian airliner, killing 176 people. A government spokesman, Ali Rabeei, said Monday that Iranian officials had not lied to the public when they insisted the plane crashed because of mechanical problems, but were providing the limited information they had. He said that President Hassan Rouhani had learned that missiles were fired at the plane only on Friday, two days after it crashed near the Tehran airport. Demands for government resignations spread Monday from hard-liners, who support Iran’s clerical government and called for officials to step down over the weekend, to members of the more moderate reformist parties, Mr. Rouhani’s base. Bahram Parsaie, a prominent lawmaker from Shiraz, said that it was not enough for Mr. Rouhani and his government to issue statements and that they needed to resign. He warned that if the president and his cabinet were not transparent with the public, Parliament would take legal action against them. Ali Shakouri Rad, the head of a reformist political party, said the growing rift between the public and the clerical government had become insurmountable. “Covering up the mistake of downing the passenger jet with missiles was throwing acid at the image of the Islamic Republic,” he said on Twitter. In a sign of the tensions between Iran’s clerical rulers and the elected officials, the government said Monday that it had disqualified 90 current lawmakers from running for re-election, Iranian official news media reported. The lawmakers, mostly members of reformist and centrist factions, account for roughly a third of the 290-member Parliament. Several leading reformist politicians responded by calling for a boycott of the parliamentary election next month. The rift over how the plane crash was handled also spread to the official news media on Monday, with several prominent state television and radio hosts quitting their jobs, saying they could no longer lie for the government. Gelare Jabbari, the popular host of state TV’s Channel Two programs, changed her profile picture on Instagram to black and posted a public apology. “It was very hard for me to believe the murdering of my countrymen,” she wrote. “Forgive me for believing it too late. I apologize for lying to you on TV for 13 years.” The journalists’ union for the province of Tehran also issued a public apology for helping spread the government’s misinformation about the cause of the crash. “We are currently holding a funeral service for public trust,” the statement said. “The first coffins are for state broadcast company and all media and websites.” The union called on all Iranian journalists to no longer “amplify the cover-ups of officials” and to conduct their reporting with skepticism and independent investigations. State television, however, continued to play down the mistaken downing of the plane, with one anchor saying “it was nothing compared to the main event” — the Iranian missile attack on American forces in Iraq hours earlier. The Iranian attack, which caused moderate damage but killed no one, was conducted in retaliation for the American killing of Iran’s terror mastermind in a drone attack on Jan. 3. Just hours later, a Ukraine International Airlines flight was taking off from Tehran before dawn on Wednesday, and Iranian forces were on high alert for an American counterattack. An Iranian crew, confusing the jet for an attacking craft, fired an antiaircraft missile at it about three minutes after it took off. On Monday, the government closed the popular reformist news website Entekhab for publishing false rumors over the weekend that Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of National Security Council, had resigned. Videos from inside Iran shared on social media on Monday showed university students in Isfahan and the capital, Tehran, chanting against the country’s clerical rulers while riot police officers were deployed nearby. Thousands of students gathered at Iran’s elite technical university, Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, 14 of whose recent graduates died when the plane was shot down. Some lashed out our Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We want transparency,” said one student, addressing the crowd. “This country has not had transparency for years. You have lied to us. the state broadcast company has lied to us. You think we are all stupid. The supreme leader must answer to us about the country’s problems. Mr. Khamenei, why are you lying?” The crowd cheered. [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] A group of more than 30 artists, filmmakers and actors issued a joint statement on Monday saying they would not participate in the government-sponsored Fajr competition, Iran’s equivalent of the Oscars. One of the signatories, the well-known filmmaker Rakhshan Bani Etemad, was briefly detained and interrogated for several hours after she called for a nationwide vigil for the victims of the crash. There were no reports of violence in the protests on Monday, as there had been over the weekend, when there were videos of protesters carrying off bleeding comrades as gunshots echoed in the background. The authorities in Iran denied that security forces had opened fire. Late Sunday, President Trump warned Iran not to target the demonstrators. Framing himself as a supporter of the media, which in other circumstances he has frequently disparaged, Mr. Trump exhorted Iran’s leaders to allow unfettered reporting. “To the leaders of Iran — DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,” he wrote on Twitter. “Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!” In addition to the domestic outrage, Iran may also face demands for compensation from nations whose citizens were killed on the plane, Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko of Ukraine told Reuters on Monday in an interview in Singapore. Foreign ministers from five nations will meet in London on Thursday to discuss legal action, he said. The participants will include Canada, which lost 57 citizens, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and another country he did not identify. Mr. Prystaiko said Tehran had agreed to hand over the jet’s black boxes for analysis, but had yet to set a date to do so. Tensions between the United States and Iran have soared since 2018, when Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of an international agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program and imposed the first in a series of sanctions on Iran to punish it for what his administration sees as its destabilizing activities across the Middle East. After a number of attacks on United States assets and allies in the Middle East in recent months, Mr. Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds force. He headed Iran’s efforts to direct allied militias in the region. Those militias include an Iraqi group that the United States accused of firing rockets at a military base in Iraq late last month, killing one American contractor. United States forces retaliated against militia bases, killing more than two dozen fighters, and militias responded by surrounding the American Embassy compound in Baghdad, breaching its perimeter wall, setting fires and throwing rocks. The killing of General Suleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport raised fears that Iran or its network of allies across the Middle East would respond against the United States and its allies, possibly igniting a regional war.

Iran’s Only Female Olympic Medalist Defects Over ‘Lies’ and ‘Injustice’,2020-01-13,By Megan Specia,"['The only female athlete to win an Olympic medal for Iran announced this weekend that she had defected from the nation because of “hypocrisy, lies, injustice and flattery” and said she had been used as a “tool.”  The Olympian, Kimia Alizadeh, 21, announced her decision in an Instagram post accompanied by a photo from the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she won a bronze medal in taekwondo. “They took me wherever they wanted,” she wrote. “Whatever they said, I wore. Every sentence they ordered, I repeated.” Her comments came during a time of especially heightened tensions in the country after the Iranian authorities announced this weekend that the country’s forces had unintentionally downed a passenger plane last week near Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. The admission prompted outrage in the country and set off a series of protests over the weekend. Iran has also been embroiled in a simmering conflict with the United States after an American drone strike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a powerful Iranian commander, and Tehran retaliated with missile strikes on bases in Iraq that house American troops. While Ms. Alizadeh’s statement did not refer to her country’s geopolitical troubles, she did address the “oppressed people of Iran” and pointed to restrictive policies on women’s public conduct and appearance, including the “obligatory veil.” “My troubled spirit does not fit into your dirty economic channels and tight political lobbies,” she wrote. “I have no other wish except for taekwondo, security and a happy and healthy life.” Ms. Alizadeh did not say where she was seeking asylum. But Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency reported that Ms. Alizadeh had moved to the Netherlands and noted that she had been absent from training for several days before releasing her statement.  The Iranian news outlet also reported that Ms. Alizadeh planned to compete in this summer’s Olympics in Tokyo, but noted that she would not represent Iran. Photos shared on social media by Jaleh Yekta, an Iranian photographer based in Eindhoven, a city in the southern Netherlands, appear to show Ms. Alizadeh and her fiancé, Hamed Madanchi, taking part in a memorial service for victims of the Tehran plane crash. In the photo, Ms. Alizadeh stands alongside candles, flowers and pictures of those killed in the crash. Mimoun El Boujjoufi, a taekwondo trainer in Eindhoven, told the Dutch broadcaster NOS that he had received a request about a month ago for Ms. Alizadeh to come train with him.  “She was on holiday in Europe but decided not to return to Iran with her partner,” Mr. El Boujjoufi told the broadcaster. “Of course she is welcome with us. We know her qualities. She is an asset to taekwondo in the Netherlands.” A spokesman for the Netherlands’ migration minister said that the office would not comment on individual asylum applications.  Ms. Alizadeh was praised as a national hero after her Olympic victory at age 18, and many in Iran saw her as a symbol for emboldening girls to take part in sports despite the country’s oppressive policies for women and girls.  The president of Iran’s Taekwondo Federation, Seyed Mohammad Puladgar, said in a statement that his organization and the Olympic Committee had “made every effort to support” Ms. Alizadeh, and said the foreign media’s depiction of the situation was “simply false, unfair and untrue.” Ms. Alizadeh’s announcement came four months after Saeid Mollaei, one of Iran’s biggest judo stars, defected to Germany. During last year’s judo World Championships, Iranian officials pressured Mr. Mollaei to either withdraw or intentionally lose his semifinal bout, to avoid being matched in the final against an Israeli rival. Iranian athletes are forbidden to compete against Israelis. [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] “A lot of our athletes are forced to deal with these matters — and their suffering is growing by the day,” Mr. Mollaei told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle in September. “Many athletes have left their country and left their personal lives there behind to pursue their dreams.” Ms. Alizadeh said that she had embarked on a “difficult path,” but that she “didn’t want to sit at the table of hypocrisy, lies, injustice and flattery.” “This decision is even harder than winning the Olympic gold,” Ms. Alizadeh wrote, “but I remain the daughter of Iran wherever I am.” ']","Kimia Alizadeh, 21, announced her decision in an Instagram post featuring a photo from the 2016 Summer Games, where she won a bronze medal in taekwondo."
Will Canadians Have to Pay the Security Costs for Harry and Meghan?,2020-01-13,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — News from Queen Elizabeth II on Monday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will be living part-time in Canada was greeted with a mix of enthusiasm and concern that Canada could end up faced with a hefty bill for hosting them. Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the monarchy at Carleton University, said that although monarchists and celebrity watchers will be happy, others could be annoyed if Canada ended up having to foot the cost for their security. There was also a camp of people consumed by “indifference,” he added. “People who care about the monarchy and celebrity will view this in a good light,” he said. “Now the question will be who is going to pay the tab for the security bill.” [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] One reader commented on the website of The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper: “Welcome to Canada but I trust you will be paying for any security or other costs. You cannot benefit from your royal station.” The sentiment was echoed by other readers. Bill Morneau, Canada’s finance minister, told reporters on Monday that the government had not yet decided if it would cover some of the security costs related to the royal move. “No, we haven’t spent any time thinking about this issue,” he was quoted as saying by the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster. “We obviously are always looking to make sure, as a member of the Commonwealth, we play a role. We have not had any discussions on that subject at this time.” While the royal couple have professed to wanting to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada. Speaking before Monday’s announcement, Professor Lagassé noted that,  although the queen is Prince Harry’s grandmother and is an enduring presence on the Canadian 20-dollar bill, she was not a Canadian citizen and that her status as Canada’s head of state did not automatically confer legal rights to her grandson. He added that while Canada is a constitutional monarchy and there was little enthusiasm for upending its constitutional structure, the setup was nevertheless viewed by many as a vestige of the past. “If you were to remake Canada now it wouldn’t be a monarchy,” he said. “At the moment, the royal family don’t live here or cost us anything. But if they did, then attitudes toward them could change.” The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment. In December, around the time of the couple’s Canadian vacation, he had extended them a warm welcome on Twitter. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here,” he wrote.']",Some in Canada worry that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be expensive to protect.
"France Agrees to Small Troop Increase, but Little Else, at Sahel Summit",2020-01-13,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — France’s partnership with West African armies to combat Islamist terrorism is flailing, but little new to reinforce it emerged from a quick summit meeting on Monday called by President Emmanuel Macron of France. Flanked by the leaders of five West and Central African countries, Mr. Macron pledged to send an additional 220 French troops to the region, adding to the force of 4,500 already there. That force is under increasing criticism in some of the countries for failing to halt recurring massacres of local armies’ troops, and there have been calls for it to leave. The leaders agreed Monday that France should not go anywhere. Still, the small boost to the French force was the only concrete result of the meeting, called by a French president increasingly frustrated over calls from protesters in Mali and elsewhere for France to get out of the countries it once ruled as colonies. “I know who is dying for the citizens of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso,” Mr. Macron said angrily at a news conference Monday night after the summit meeting. “It’s French soldiers.” Mr. Macron, who had warned that France might withdraw its troops, wanted the leaders of the Sahel — the semiarid strip stretching more than 2,000 miles across West and Central Africa where violent groups loosely affiliated with the Islamic State and Al Qaeda operate — to make clear, in public, that they wanted French forces to stay.  And if nothing else, the summit accomplished that goal. The leaders of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad “have expressed their wish for the pursuit of France’s military engagement in the Sahel,” they said in a joint statement after meeting in the southwestern town of Pau. They then pleaded with other European countries to join France’s mostly lonely fight in the region, and, protectively, expressed “gratitude” for the tactical support of the United States, which has also been threatening to pull out forces from the region. France’s neighbors have shown little appetite for joining a fight that even some French officers say is unwinnable, and that appears to be gaining France few friends, especially in the territories where it is deployed. The West African countries did pledge Monday to work more closely together, and with the French, to concentrate forces on the dangerous tri-border region shared by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and to focus on the regional affiliate of the Islamic State. But whether this will improve the military situation is unclear. The poorly trained, unmotivated and badly led armies of these countries are subjected to repeated massacres by the jihadists who roam the desert. Last week, 89 soldiers from Niger were killed in an attack by militants at the camp of Chinegodar, near the Mali border. And there have been numerous similar attacks in recent years. Thousands of citizens in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have been displaced, hundreds of schools have been closed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region. Protesters, many inspired by Islamist preachers, have taken to the streets of the region’s cities to demand an end to the French military presence. Asked at the Monday news conference by a Malian journalist why the French couldn’t stop the massacres, Mr. Macron bristled. “The army is there at the demand of the Malian state,” he said. “When you consider the space that must be covered — it’s impossible to put troops everywhere.” The presidents Monday pledged to work to “speed up the return of government and public service throughout the region in question.” Numerous such pledges have been made in the past, with little to show for them. Commentators were quick to point out the paucity of results from Monday’s summit, and the political difficulty for the French government in undertaking the task of shoring up West African governments that are widely rejected on their home turf. “To restore a state when there’s a rejection of the state, that’s a contradiction,” Jean-Hervé Jezequel, an expert on the region with the International Crisis Group, told France 24 television. “There’s a military strategy, but there’s no political strategy. If you want to restore a state, you’ve got to ask what state you’re restoring,” he said.']",President Emmanuel Macron and five African leaders agreed that French troops would remain in the fight against Islamist militants.
The World Saw This Australian Beach Town Burn. It’s Still Cut Off.,2020-01-14,By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Asanka Brendon Ratnayake,"['MALLACOOTA, Australia — Flying with gut-churning force over miles of charred bush land, the military plane had a vital load to deliver: 500 gallons of fuel, to help power a town cut off from the world. On the ground below, residents had become desperate for the suddenly scarce resource, and some were taking their frustration out on gas station attendants forced to ration it. With the only road in or out blocked for two weeks by fallen and smoldering trees, the usually laid-back beach town, Mallacoota, had grown tense with the hardships that come with isolation. “People are starting to get angry and frustrated with the lack of supplies, being stuck here and the power is still off,” said Tracey Hargreaves, the owner of a cafe on the main street. To keep business going, she has had to serve long-life milk and carefully preserve her pastries. “It’s surreal,” she said. Since wildfires began ravaging huge expanses of Australia late last year, about a dozen communities have become isolated to some degree, the authorities say. Some are completely cut off, accessible only by planes or helicopters, which have been dropping water, food and satellite phones, and even carrots for wildlife. Along the roads to others, arborists and engineers are working shifts of up to 14 hours to remove “killer trees” that are at risk of falling. The crisis, which has stranded thousands of Australians, exemplifies the growing danger of inhabiting the world’s forests as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense. “More people are living in high-risk bushfire areas, emergency services are stretched and the climate is rapidly changing,” said Andrew Gissing, an emergency management expert with the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center, a nonprofit supported by the Australian government.  “Future crises are inevitable,” he added. “We must consider the prospect of a monstrous bushfire season, the likes of which we’ve never seen.” A sense of that dystopian future has already come to Mallacoota, where images of thousands of people evacuating to a beach and a child leading his family to safety under amber skies focused worldwide attention on Australia’s calamitous bushfires months after they began.  In normal times, the town, surrounded by lush eucalyptus trees, is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos and koalas. It has a magical quality: Many people return year after year for their summer vacations, and on New Year’s Eve people often take a dip in the lake, which lights up with bioluminescent microorganisms. But this year, as one decade gave way to another, a fierce inferno swept through the community, destroying homes and severing power lines. Four days later, more than 1,000 people and their pets boarded naval ships that took them down the coast to safety. Many others, residents and vacationers alike, decided to remain.  Help has come slowly by air and sea, in the forms of water, fresh fruit and vegetables and, perhaps most critically, fuel.  Last weekend, after the C-27J Spartan military plane touched down at a small airport, air force personnel gathered their weight behind a giant bladder full of diesel fuel to roll it down the tarmac. This is the first time in Australia’s history that military reservists have been called up to respond to fires. For now, supplies in Mallacoota remain limited. On Sunday, the gas station was still restricting sales to about 1.5 gallons per person — and only for generators, not cars. Neighbors have suspected others of siphoning fuel, or wasting it on their boats. It was rumored that a truck had tried to break through the hazardous highway to deliver some, only to be forced back by the authorities.  In recent days, parts of the community have been hooked up to large generators. But many people are still rationing power. They say they haven’t been watching much television; they are catching up with the news only occasionally, when they read or watch it on their phones.  Most cannot believe their small town has made global headlines, and become a symbol of many Australians’ hopes for a new government policy toward climate change. “After all this happened, we heard we were on the news,” said Amy Preston, 23, whose family runs Beachcomber Caravan Park, which they protected during the blazes. Now, Ms. Preston said, “Mallacoota’s on the map.” Others do not want to relive the trauma by watching repeated footage of their town in flames, said Michelle Gamble, who works at the gas station, which is also a tackle shop. On Sunday, customers offered the store’s workers hugs and empathy — rationing the town’s fuel had been an emotional roller coaster.  One woman came in asking for prawn bait, declaring that since it was the weekend, she was going fishing. Ms. Gamble encouraged her. “Good idea,” she said. “Go do something normal!” Neighbors share food and power, opening up their homes to people who have lost theirs. The local pub, which is powered by generator to keep the beer cold and the jukebox rolling, has become one of the few places of reprieve. There’s “nothing else to do,” Mia Kroger, 25, said as she sat with her friends on Saturday night, drinking beer in an eerie halo of normalcy.  “I’ve got nowhere to go, but the feeling of being stuck here is kind of intimidating,” she added. “It feels weird not to be able to leave town.” Ms. Kroger’s friend Hannah Searl, 20, disagreed. “I know we’re stuck here, but I don’t feel stuck,” she said.  During the fires, Ms. Searl helped defend her family’s property by filling buckets from the swimming pool and leaping over her fence to douse the flames. “You couldn’t have gotten me out of here,” she said, “even if you tried.” Around midnight, Ms. Searl climbed onto one of the bar tables and whistled: Her eldest sister had just had a baby in Arizona, and their mother, after being evacuated and taking flights through multiple cities, had made it to the birth. Soon after, the room was encircling Ms. Searl, dancing. Even as progress has been made toward reconnecting cut-off communities, many challenges remain. The greatest is clearing a 90-mile stretch of highway from Mallacoota to the town of Orbost in southeastern Australia. Darren McQuaid, an official in Orbost, said that among the thousands of miles of roads in the area, his team had managed to make only a fraction of them safe. In recent weeks, the authorities have warned residents of the dangers of trying to cut their own way out of their communities. Others who evacuated before the fires have been unable to return, some to assess the devastation of their burned-down homes. By Sunday, the military had cleared roads north of Mallacoota just enough for some vacationers and residents to leave in a convoy of more than 60 cars, escorted by fire trucks and police vehicles.  Those leaving, and those staying behind, said they felt confident that new life would eventually sprout from the scorched landscape. But they acknowledged that fires could one day tear through the community again. Yolande Oakley, an artist who moved to Mallacoota with her husband nearly two decades ago, said that on New Year’s Eve, she took her grandchildren to safety on the jetty, where she bundled them in wet towels. She gave them iPads and earplugs to block out the wail of exploding gas bottles and the roar of the approaching inferno.  “I didn’t want them to see what was to come,” she said. Now, the Oakleys eat dinner by flashlight. They keep food cold in a gas fridge usually used for camping, and charge their phones with a battery connected to their car.  They don’t mind; they live in paradise, after all. But Ms. Oakley worries that climate change will bring more horrific scenes like the ones she and her family are still grappling with. “If we don’t address that,” she said, “that’s the future for us.”']","Mallacoota, where people huddled on the shore for safety on New Year’s Eve, is rationing fuel and relying on the military for help."

Still, the small boost to the French force was the only concrete result of the meeting, called by a French president increasingly frustrated over calls from protesters in Mali and elsewhere for France to get out of the countries it once ruled as colonies. “I know who is dying for the citizens of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso,” Mr. Macron said angrily at a news conference Monday night after the summit meeting. “It’s French soldiers.” Mr. Macron, who had warned that France might withdraw its troops, wanted the leaders of the Sahel — the semiarid strip stretching more than 2,000 miles across West and Central Africa where violent groups loosely affiliated with the Islamic State and Al Qaeda operate — to make clear, in public, that they wanted French forces to stay.  And if nothing else, the summit accomplished that goal. The leaders of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad “have expressed their wish for the pursuit of France’s military engagement in the Sahel,” they said in a joint statement after meeting in the southwestern town of Pau. They then pleaded with other European countries to join France’s mostly lonely fight in the region, and, protectively, expressed “gratitude” for the tactical support of the United States, which has also been threatening to pull out forces from the region. France’s neighbors have shown little appetite for joining a fight that even some French officers say is unwinnable, and that appears to be gaining France few friends, especially in the territories where it is deployed. The West African countries did pledge Monday to work more closely together, and with the French, to concentrate forces on the dangerous tri-border region shared by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and to focus on the regional affiliate of the Islamic State. But whether this will improve the military situation is unclear. The poorly trained, unmotivated and badly led armies of these countries are subjected to repeated massacres by the jihadists who roam the desert. Last week, 89 soldiers from Niger were killed in an attack by militants at the camp of Chinegodar, near the Mali border. And there have been numerous similar attacks in recent years. Thousands of citizens in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have been displaced, hundreds of schools have been closed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region. Protesters, many inspired by Islamist preachers, have taken to the streets of the region’s cities to demand an end to the French military presence. Asked at the Monday news conference by a Malian journalist why the French couldn’t stop the massacres, Mr. Macron bristled. “The army is there at the demand of the Malian state,” he said. “When you consider the space that must be covered — it’s impossible to put troops everywhere.” The presidents Monday pledged to work to “speed up the return of government and public service throughout the region in question.” Numerous such pledges have been made in the past, with little to show for them. Commentators were quick to point out the paucity of results from Monday’s summit, and the political difficulty for the French government in undertaking the task of shoring up West African governments that are widely rejected on their home turf. “To restore a state when there’s a rejection of the state, that’s a contradiction,” Jean-Hervé Jezequel, an expert on the region with the International Crisis Group, told France 24 television. “There’s a military strategy, but there’s no political strategy. If you want to restore a state, you’ve got to ask what state you’re restoring,” he said.']",President Emmanuel Macron and five African leaders agreed that French troops would remain in the fight against Islamist militants.
Iran’s Only Female Olympic Medalist Defects Over ‘Lies’ and ‘Injustice’,2020-01-13,By Megan Specia,"['The only female athlete to win an Olympic medal for Iran announced this weekend that she had defected from the nation because of “hypocrisy, lies, injustice and flattery” and said she had been used as a “tool.”  The Olympian, Kimia Alizadeh, 21, announced her decision in an Instagram post accompanied by a photo from the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she won a bronze medal in taekwondo. “They took me wherever they wanted,” she wrote. “Whatever they said, I wore. Every sentence they ordered, I repeated.” Her comments came during a time of especially heightened tensions in the country after the Iranian authorities announced this weekend that the country’s forces had unintentionally downed a passenger plane last week near Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. The admission prompted outrage in the country and set off a series of protests over the weekend. Iran has also been embroiled in a simmering conflict with the United States after an American drone strike killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a powerful Iranian commander, and Tehran retaliated with missile strikes on bases in Iraq that house American troops. While Ms. Alizadeh’s statement did not refer to her country’s geopolitical troubles, she did address the “oppressed people of Iran” and pointed to restrictive policies on women’s public conduct and appearance, including the “obligatory veil.” “My troubled spirit does not fit into your dirty economic channels and tight political lobbies,” she wrote. “I have no other wish except for taekwondo, security and a happy and healthy life.” Ms. Alizadeh did not say where she was seeking asylum. But Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency reported that Ms. Alizadeh had moved to the Netherlands and noted that she had been absent from training for several days before releasing her statement.  The Iranian news outlet also reported that Ms. Alizadeh planned to compete in this summer’s Olympics in Tokyo, but noted that she would not represent Iran. Photos shared on social media by Jaleh Yekta, an Iranian photographer based in Eindhoven, a city in the southern Netherlands, appear to show Ms. Alizadeh and her fiancé, Hamed Madanchi, taking part in a memorial service for victims of the Tehran plane crash. In the photo, Ms. Alizadeh stands alongside candles, flowers and pictures of those killed in the crash. Mimoun El Boujjoufi, a taekwondo trainer in Eindhoven, told the Dutch broadcaster NOS that he had received a request about a month ago for Ms. Alizadeh to come train with him.  “She was on holiday in Europe but decided not to return to Iran with her partner,” Mr. El Boujjoufi told the broadcaster. “Of course she is welcome with us. We know her qualities. She is an asset to taekwondo in the Netherlands.” A spokesman for the Netherlands’ migration minister said that the office would not comment on individual asylum applications.  Ms. Alizadeh was praised as a national hero after her Olympic victory at age 18, and many in Iran saw her as a symbol for emboldening girls to take part in sports despite the country’s oppressive policies for women and girls.  The president of Iran’s Taekwondo Federation, Seyed Mohammad Puladgar, said in a statement that his organization and the Olympic Committee had “made every effort to support” Ms. Alizadeh, and said the foreign media’s depiction of the situation was “simply false, unfair and untrue.” Ms. Alizadeh’s announcement came four months after Saeid Mollaei, one of Iran’s biggest judo stars, defected to Germany. During last year’s judo World Championships, Iranian officials pressured Mr. Mollaei to either withdraw or intentionally lose his semifinal bout, to avoid being matched in the final against an Israeli rival. Iranian athletes are forbidden to compete against Israelis. [Read: France, Germany and the U.K. have taken the first step to reimposing sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.] “A lot of our athletes are forced to deal with these matters — and their suffering is growing by the day,” Mr. Mollaei told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle in September. “Many athletes have left their country and left their personal lives there behind to pursue their dreams.” Ms. Alizadeh said that she had embarked on a “difficult path,” but that she “didn’t want to sit at the table of hypocrisy, lies, injustice and flattery.” “This decision is even harder than winning the Olympic gold,” Ms. Alizadeh wrote, “but I remain the daughter of Iran wherever I am.” ']","Kimia Alizadeh, 21, announced her decision in an Instagram post featuring a photo from the 2016 Summer Games, where she won a bronze medal in taekwondo."
‘Megxit’ Is the New Brexit in a Britain Split by Age and Politics,2020-01-15,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — It started with the catchword “Megxit,” a tabloid editor’s clever play on Brexit, published in The Sun soon after Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, announced their plans to leave Britain and live in North America part of the year. It continued with corny jokes that Buckingham Palace is seeking a “Super Canada-plus” agreement for the Canada-bound couple, an allusion to the sweetheart trade deal Britain would like to strike with the European Union when it leaves the bloc. And now, as the royal family races to hammer out an agreement with the couple to put the unpleasant affair behind it, commentators are comparing the royal couple’s impending breakup with Britain to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election-year promise to “Get Brexit done.” Stoked by a zealous news media and consumed by a divided, enthralled public, the Harry-and-Meghan saga is playing out uncannily like the long-running debate over Brexit — only a whole lot juicier. With the storms over Brexit temporarily calmed by Mr. Johnson’s victory, but the underlying economic and social issues far from resolved, the royals have become a convenient proxy, allowing people to argue about race, class, gender and British identity, through the travails of a single star-crossed couple. “With Brexit, Britain is choosing to leave the European Union,” said Meera Selva, director of the Reuters Journalism Fellowship Program at Oxford University, “and yet with Megxit, there is this outrage that someone is choosing to leave Britain.” “He’s leaving because he doesn’t like what he sees in Britain,” she added, referring to Harry. “That’s a message the British don’t want to hear right now.” As the Harry-and-Meghan drama unfolds in breathless headlines and acres of news commentary, it is resurfacing the same questions that animated the Brexit debate. What kind of society do the British want: open or closed, cosmopolitan or nationalist, progressive or traditional? The debate, as with Brexit, breaks along political and generational fault lines. Young people and liberals, many of whom voted to stay in the European Union, tend to be more sympathetic to the prince and his American wife. Older, more conservative people, a majority of whom voted to leave, tend to be more critical of the couple and defensive of Queen Elizabeth II. Where Prince Harry and Meghan’s defenders see a multiracial, trans-Atlantic family seeking refuge from a vindictive press and the hidebound traditions of royal life, critics see a self-indulgent pair who want the perks of royalty without its responsibilities, forsaking queen and country for the stardust of Hollywood. The critics are particularly hard on the Duchess of Sussex, as Meghan is formally known. A divorced former TV actress from a mixed-race background, Meghan Markle met Prince Harry through mutual friends in London in July 2016, a month after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Their romance unfolded against the backdrop of a charged debate over immigration and the country’s national identity. “Meghan Markle represented change because of her racial heritage but also because of her feminism, her activism, and the fact that she is self-made, with strong ideas about her autonomy and identity,” said Afua Hirsch, who teaches journalism at the University of Southern California and is the author of “Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging.” “She happened to arrive at a moment when Brexit emboldened people who advocated for a nationalist identity and a return to Britain’s imperial past,” Ms. Hirsch continued. “It’s no surprise that this triggered a really hostile reaction.” For many Britons, however, the couple’s wedding — with its gospel choir singing “Stand by Me” and Bishop Michael Curry of Chicago quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his freewheeling sermon — sent an electrifying message about the potential of an outsider to shake up a centuries-old institution. But then came the reports that the duchess was miserable in her new life and barely speaking to her in-laws. The couple’s relations with the press, which had started out well, quickly turned sour. The papers criticized them for flying on private jets and restricting access to their newborn, Archie. BuzzFeed News, in a startling exercise, collected 20 examples of how the tabloids covered the duchess more negatively than his brother Prince William’s wife, the former Kate Middleton. The duchess took legal action against one of the papers, The Mail on Sunday, for publishing a letter she sent her father, Thomas Markle. She now faces the prospect of a trial in which the paper’s publisher has threatened to call her father to testify.  Prince Harry and Meghan spoke hopefully of carving out a “progressive new role within this institution.” But in the end, the duchess, who had returned to Canada after their announcement, did not even take part by phone in the family conclave at Sandringham, the queen’s country home, to discuss the couple’s future. People with ties to the palace said the queen hoped to come to an agreement within days about how the couple’s part-time status will work and how they will be allowed to finance themselves. The goal is for the royals to get back to business as usual.  Critics noted that the palace, like the Johnson government with Brexit, hopes to make a complicated problem go away with a simple piece of paper. Still, at a time when Britain is casting off from the European Union, the monarchy and other symbols of national identity may exert greater pull than ever. Britons, for example, are busy debating whether the government should pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to ring the bell in Big Ben, which is undergoing renovation, to mark the formal moment that Britain leaves on Jan. 31. “Once we’ve left the E.U., Britons will hold even tighter to those things that are uniquely or peculiarly British,” said Jonathan Freedland, a columnist, writing in The Guardian. “Some on the left might wish that would mean no more than the N.H.S.,” he said, referring to Britain’s National Health Service. “But as this week has shown yet again, for many millions it also means the royal family.” Among the casualties of this post-Brexit conservatism, Mr. Freedland said, would be the movement to abolish the monarchy. Republicanism never got much traction in Britain, even before Brexit. But it seems even more far-fetched now, after three years of anguished national debate over Britain’s future. Critics noted that the same Conservative Party that engineered Brexit has fanned the yearning for an imperial Britain. Prince Harry and Meghan, however, are speeding the move toward a more streamlined royal family — the kind one finds in more compact European countries like the Netherlands or Belgium. “We have a royal family that befits the idea of an empire bestriding half the globe,” said Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of The Guardian. “The inability to face up to a more modest royal family gels with our inability to come to terms with Britain’s diminished role in the world.”']","The debate over Harry and Meghan’s push for greater independence from royal life is uncannily like the Brexit debate, with young liberals favoring the couple and older conservatives backing the queen."
Rural Venezuela Crumbles as President Shores Up the Capital and His Power,2020-01-13,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['PARMANA, Venezuela — From his palace in Caracas, President Nicolás Maduro projects an image of strength and his grip on power appears secure. Residents have a regular supply of electricity and gasoline. Shops are bursting with imported goods. But beyond the city, this facade of order quickly melts away. In order to preserve the quality of life of his most important backers, the country’s political and military elites, his administration has poured the country’s dwindling resources into Caracas and forsaken large swaths of Venezuela. “Venezuela is broken as a state, as a country,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst in Caracas. “The few available resources are invested in the capital to protect the seat of power, creating a ministate amid the collapse.” Across much of the country, basic government functions like policing, road maintenance, health care and public utilities have been abandoned. The only remaining evidence of the state in Parmana, a fishing village on the banks of the Orinoco River, is the three teachers who remain at the school, which lacks food, books, and even a marker for the board. The priest was the first to leave Parmana. As the economic crisis deepened, the social workers, the police, the community doctor and several of the schoolteachers deserted. Overwhelmed by crime, the village’s residents say, they turned to Colombian guerrillas for protection. “We are forgotten,” said Herminia Martínez, 83, as she stooped with a machete in the tropical heat to tend an overgrown bean field. “There’s no government here.” A year ago, it seemed, for a moment, that Mr. Maduro’s critics might have a chance to oust him. An opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, had staged the biggest challenge to Mr. Maduro’s rule to date by claiming the presidency and quickly winning support from the United States and almost 60 other countries.  Now Mr. Maduro’s adversaries have lost momentum. The Trump administration remains supportive of Mr. Guaidó: On Monday, the United States issued new sanctions against government allies who tried to block him from assuming the leadership of the country’s National Assembly. Despite this pressure, Mr. Maduro’s tenure seems secure, in part because of how well Mr. Maduro’s policies have bolstered Caracas. [Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.] But the economy, suffering from poor management, diminished oil and gold exports and crippling sanctions by the United States, is now entering its seventh year of a devastating contraction. This lasting depression, along with the retrenchment of the state, has allowed much of the nation’s infrastructure to fall into neglect.  It has also led to Venezuela’s breakup into localized economies with only nominal links to Caracas. As runaway inflation rendered the country’s currency, the bolívar, practically worthless, dollars, euros, gold and the currencies of three neighboring countries began to circulate in different parts of Venezuela. Barter is rampant. “Each place survives in its own way, as best it can,” said Armando Chacín, head of Venezuela’s ranchers’ federation. “They are completely different economies.” Outside Caracas, citizens of what was once Latin America’s wealthiest nation can be relegated to surviving in what are nearly preindustrial conditions.  About half the residents of Venezuela’s seven major cities are exposed to daily blackouts and three-quarters get by without a reliable water supply, according to a September survey by the Venezuelan Public Services Observatory, a nonprofit. In Parmana, flooding last year washed away the only road out of town, leaving the village without regular deliveries of food, fuel for the power plant and gasoline. To get by, its 450 remaining residents have resorted to clearing fields with machetes, rowing their fishing boats and using the beans they grow themselves as currency. After decades of lavish oil spending, Venezuela’s government is running out of money. The country’s gross domestic product has shrunk 73 percent since Mr. Maduro took office in 2013 — one of the biggest declines in modern global history, according to estimates by the opposition-controlled congress, based on official statistics and data from the International Monetary Fund. Unable to pay meaningful salaries to millions of state employees, the government has looked the other way as they resorted to graft, influence peddling and side businesses to make ends meet. The official salary of Venezuela’s top military general is $13 a month, according to Citizens’s Control, a Venezuelan research group. In Caracas, the private sector — maligned for years under the Socialist government of Mr. Maduro and his popular predecessor, Hugo Chávez — has been allowed to fill some of the gaps in consumer products left by declining state imports.  As once sacrosanct economic controls disappeared overnight, the capital filled up with hundreds of new shops and showrooms, offering everything from imported sports cars to American-made seaweed chips. And the burden of the country’s collapse has fallen largely on Venezuela’s provinces, where many residents have been effectively cut off from the central government. Regions close to Venezuela’s borders have resorted to smuggling and cross-border trade for survival. Agricultural towns in Venezuela’s interior have sunk into subsistence, as the collapse of the road system and gasoline shortages decimated domestic trade. Tourism hot spots have survived on private investment and by catering to the elites.  Local military commanders and a few ruling party strongmen with limited ties to Mr. Maduro have taken political control of far-flung regions. As national law enforcement shrank, irregular armed groups took their place, including Colombian Marxist guerrillas, former right-wing paramilitaries, criminal gangs, pro-Maduro militias and indigenous self-defense groups. Across the Venezuelan interior, these groups have often taken charge of enforcing business contracts, punishing common crimes and even settling divorces, according to dozens of testimonies of residents collected over months of reporting in three regions. The collapse of the Venezuelan state has run its course in Parmana, a large and once prosperous village of fishermen and farmers in Venezuela’s central plains. For lack of pay, the local police unit packed up and left one day in 2018, followed by the public workers who ran social programs. Shortly after, locals chased away the village’s detachment of National Guards for drunkenness and extortion. To replace the guards, the village leaders decided to travel to the closest gold mine controlled by Colombian guerrillas to ask them to set up a post in Parmana. Over the past four years, to protect their supply lines, the guerrillas had wiped out the river pirates who had terrorized Parmana’s fishermen, robbing their boats of motors and killing several people. “We need authority here,” said Gustavo Ledezma, a shop owner and community sheriff.  The guerrillas “bring order,” he said. “They don’t mess around.” Parmana’s descent into lawless subsistence is a steep downfall from its glory days of exporting rice, beans and cotton. The village’s wetlands and pristine springs drew throngs of holidaymakers every year. “Parmana, Parmana, how beautiful it is to wake up with you,” went a song by Venezuela’s legendary country bard, Simon Díaz. Mr. Chávez, the former president, had seen in the region’s agricultural potential the future of the Venezuelan economy. A decade ago, he spent at least a billion dollars building a bridge over the Orinoco to connect the region to Brazilian markets.  The bridge, unfinished, is now abandoned. Parmana’s springs dried up after a politically-connected landowner diverted the water to his cotton fields in 2013, destroying the tourism industry. Now, on the village’s dusty streets, desperate fishermen stop the occasional visiting drivers in search of gasoline for their boat motors.  A farming family sat by a pile of watermelons. They had tried sending a phone message to a wholesaler to pick up their harvest, but the cellular tower had been down for two weeks, and they were unsure if he would come, or when.  “We have to depend on each other now, not on the state,” said Ana Rengifo, the community council leader. In October, the village doctor went to the closest town to find medications for his empty shelves. He never came back. The abandoned Catholic church is filled with bats, its pews chopped up for firewood. The pastor of the local evangelical group still comes once a week. The group meets daily to sing for salvation, but breaks up at sunset for lack of electricity. The village ambulance rusts in a shed without tires, its driver having left that job three years ago to plant beans to survive.  At the school, after singing the national anthem and doing calisthenics, the students study basic reading and math, but go home after an hour or two. Teachers say many of them get too hungry to focus. Despite the town’s collapse, most here prefer to remain on their land, where they can grow some food, to risking hunger elsewhere. “You go outside and the hunger kills you,” said Inselina Coro, a 29-year-old mother of four. “At least here you go to the river and get a fish.” Ms. Coro lives with her children and her boyfriend, a fisherman, in a one-room shack of corrugated iron and dirt floors. The six of them share two hammocks. Her oldest daughter, Ana Herrera, 14, is pregnant, but the family has no means to take her to a doctor. Ms. Coro’s dreams for her family are confined to moving to Caicara, a dilapidated town about three hours upstream. The reason? “There is electricity,” she said.']",
The World Saw This Australian Beach Town Burn. It’s Still Cut Off.,2020-01-14,By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Asanka Brendon Ratnayake,"['MALLACOOTA, Australia — Flying with gut-churning force over miles of charred bush land, the military plane had a vital load to deliver: 500 gallons of fuel, to help power a town cut off from the world. On the ground below, residents had become desperate for the suddenly scarce resource, and some were taking their frustration out on gas station attendants forced to ration it. With the only road in or out blocked for two weeks by fallen and smoldering trees, the usually laid-back beach town, Mallacoota, had grown tense with the hardships that come with isolation. “People are starting to get angry and frustrated with the lack of supplies, being stuck here and the power is still off,” said Tracey Hargreaves, the owner of a cafe on the main street. To keep business going, she has had to serve long-life milk and carefully preserve her pastries. “It’s surreal,” she said. Since wildfires began ravaging huge expanses of Australia late last year, about a dozen communities have become isolated to some degree, the authorities say. Some are completely cut off, accessible only by planes or helicopters, which have been dropping water, food and satellite phones, and even carrots for wildlife. Along the roads to others, arborists and engineers are working shifts of up to 14 hours to remove “killer trees” that are at risk of falling. The crisis, which has stranded thousands of Australians, exemplifies the growing danger of inhabiting the world’s forests as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and intense. “More people are living in high-risk bushfire areas, emergency services are stretched and the climate is rapidly changing,” said Andrew Gissing, an emergency management expert with the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Center, a nonprofit supported by the Australian government.  “Future crises are inevitable,” he added. “We must consider the prospect of a monstrous bushfire season, the likes of which we’ve never seen.” A sense of that dystopian future has already come to Mallacoota, where images of thousands of people evacuating to a beach and a child leading his family to safety under amber skies focused worldwide attention on Australia’s calamitous bushfires months after they began.  In normal times, the town, surrounded by lush eucalyptus trees, is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos and koalas. It has a magical quality: Many people return year after year for their summer vacations, and on New Year’s Eve people often take a dip in the lake, which lights up with bioluminescent microorganisms. But this year, as one decade gave way to another, a fierce inferno swept through the community, destroying homes and severing power lines. Four days later, more than 1,000 people and their pets boarded naval ships that took them down the coast to safety. Many others, residents and vacationers alike, decided to remain.  Help has come slowly by air and sea, in the forms of water, fresh fruit and vegetables and, perhaps most critically, fuel.  Last weekend, after the C-27J Spartan military plane touched down at a small airport, air force personnel gathered their weight behind a giant bladder full of diesel fuel to roll it down the tarmac. This is the first time in Australia’s history that military reservists have been called up to respond to fires. For now, supplies in Mallacoota remain limited. On Sunday, the gas station was still restricting sales to about 1.5 gallons per person — and only for generators, not cars. Neighbors have suspected others of siphoning fuel, or wasting it on their boats. It was rumored that a truck had tried to break through the hazardous highway to deliver some, only to be forced back by the authorities.  In recent days, parts of the community have been hooked up to large generators. But many people are still rationing power. They say they haven’t been watching much television; they are catching up with the news only occasionally, when they read or watch it on their phones.  Most cannot believe their small town has made global headlines, and become a symbol of many Australians’ hopes for a new government policy toward climate change. “After all this happened, we heard we were on the news,” said Amy Preston, 23, whose family runs Beachcomber Caravan Park, which they protected during the blazes. Now, Ms. Preston said, “Mallacoota’s on the map.” Others do not want to relive the trauma by watching repeated footage of their town in flames, said Michelle Gamble, who works at the gas station, which is also a tackle shop. On Sunday, customers offered the store’s workers hugs and empathy — rationing the town’s fuel had been an emotional roller coaster.  One woman came in asking for prawn bait, declaring that since it was the weekend, she was going fishing. Ms. Gamble encouraged her. “Good idea,” she said. “Go do something normal!” Neighbors share food and power, opening up their homes to people who have lost theirs. The local pub, which is powered by generator to keep the beer cold and the jukebox rolling, has become one of the few places of reprieve. There’s “nothing else to do,” Mia Kroger, 25, said as she sat with her friends on Saturday night, drinking beer in an eerie halo of normalcy.  “I’ve got nowhere to go, but the feeling of being stuck here is kind of intimidating,” she added. “It feels weird not to be able to leave town.” Ms. Kroger’s friend Hannah Searl, 20, disagreed. “I know we’re stuck here, but I don’t feel stuck,” she said.  During the fires, Ms. Searl helped defend her family’s property by filling buckets from the swimming pool and leaping over her fence to douse the flames. “You couldn’t have gotten me out of here,” she said, “even if you tried.” Around midnight, Ms. Searl climbed onto one of the bar tables and whistled: Her eldest sister had just had a baby in Arizona, and their mother, after being evacuated and taking flights through multiple cities, had made it to the birth. Soon after, the room was encircling Ms. Searl, dancing. Even as progress has been made toward reconnecting cut-off communities, many challenges remain. The greatest is clearing a 90-mile stretch of highway from Mallacoota to the town of Orbost in southeastern Australia. Darren McQuaid, an official in Orbost, said that among the thousands of miles of roads in the area, his team had managed to make only a fraction of them safe. In recent weeks, the authorities have warned residents of the dangers of trying to cut their own way out of their communities. Others who evacuated before the fires have been unable to return, some to assess the devastation of their burned-down homes. By Sunday, the military had cleared roads north of Mallacoota just enough for some vacationers and residents to leave in a convoy of more than 60 cars, escorted by fire trucks and police vehicles.  Those leaving, and those staying behind, said they felt confident that new life would eventually sprout from the scorched landscape. But they acknowledged that fires could one day tear through the community again. Yolande Oakley, an artist who moved to Mallacoota with her husband nearly two decades ago, said that on New Year’s Eve, she took her grandchildren to safety on the jetty, where she bundled them in wet towels. She gave them iPads and earplugs to block out the wail of exploding gas bottles and the roar of the approaching inferno.  “I didn’t want them to see what was to come,” she said. Now, the Oakleys eat dinner by flashlight. They keep food cold in a gas fridge usually used for camping, and charge their phones with a battery connected to their car.  They don’t mind; they live in paradise, after all. But Ms. Oakley worries that climate change will bring more horrific scenes like the ones she and her family are still grappling with. “If we don’t address that,” she said, “that’s the future for us.”']","Mallacoota, where people huddled on the shore for safety on New Year’s Eve, is rationing fuel and relying on the military for help."
Will Canadians Have to Pay the Security Costs for Harry and Meghan?,2020-01-13,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — News from Queen Elizabeth II on Monday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will be living part-time in Canada was greeted with a mix of enthusiasm and concern that Canada could end up faced with a hefty bill for hosting them. Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the monarchy at Carleton University, said that although monarchists and celebrity watchers will be happy, others could be annoyed if Canada ended up having to foot the cost for their security. There was also a camp of people consumed by “indifference,” he added. “People who care about the monarchy and celebrity will view this in a good light,” he said. “Now the question will be who is going to pay the tab for the security bill.” [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] One reader commented on the website of The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper: “Welcome to Canada but I trust you will be paying for any security or other costs. You cannot benefit from your royal station.” The sentiment was echoed by other readers. Bill Morneau, Canada’s finance minister, told reporters on Monday that the government had not yet decided if it would cover some of the security costs related to the royal move. “No, we haven’t spent any time thinking about this issue,” he was quoted as saying by the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster. “We obviously are always looking to make sure, as a member of the Commonwealth, we play a role. We have not had any discussions on that subject at this time.” While the royal couple have professed to wanting to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada. Speaking before Monday’s announcement, Professor Lagassé noted that,  although the queen is Prince Harry’s grandmother and is an enduring presence on the Canadian 20-dollar bill, she was not a Canadian citizen and that her status as Canada’s head of state did not automatically confer legal rights to her grandson. He added that while Canada is a constitutional monarchy and there was little enthusiasm for upending its constitutional structure, the setup was nevertheless viewed by many as a vestige of the past. “If you were to remake Canada now it wouldn’t be a monarchy,” he said. “At the moment, the royal family don’t live here or cost us anything. But if they did, then attitudes toward them could change.” The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment. In December, around the time of the couple’s Canadian vacation, he had extended them a warm welcome on Twitter. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here,” he wrote.']",Some in Canada worry that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be expensive to protect.
"Will Big Ben Chime for Brexit? It’s a $650,000 Question",2020-01-15,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — When Britain leaves the European Union at the end of the month, it must secure trade ties to the Continent, revamp its migration rules and reset relations with global partners like the United States, to name just a few looming challenges. But the question gripping Brexit supporters is whether the moment of departure will be marked by the familiar chimes of Big Ben. Inconveniently, the country’s most famous clock tower is under repair, like much of the crumbling parliamentary estate, yet that has not stopped a vigorous campaign to bring it back to life for a brief moment of history. “Big Ben Must Bong For Brexit,” screamed a front-page headline in the British tabloid The Daily Express, which was superimposed on a picture of the clock minus the scaffolding and cladding that conceal it.  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that the 500,000-pound cost (about $650,000) of restoring the chimes for the night could be raised by crowd funding. But his office later conceded that there was no official way for the public to contribute. “Boris’ bonkers ‘bung a bob for Big Ben Brexit bongs’ bid bombs,” was the verdict of another tabloid, The Daily Mirror, as frustrated Brexit enthusiasts hinted of a plot against them and suggested that church bells ring out instead. (The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers has responded with skepticism.) The debate has exposed the government’s surprising awkwardness over how to commemorate the end of 47 years of European integration, an ambition that helped bring Mr. Johnson to power but has also divided the nation. Although he won a convincing parliamentary majority in last month’s election, he achieved this largely by uniting the pro-Brexit vote in a way that guaranteed victory under the British system. In fact, a majority of voters supported parties that wanted either a second referendum on Brexit or to scrap it altogether. For days Downing Street has stalled when asked what will happen when Britain officially leaves the bloc, not at midnight on Jan. 31, but at 11 p.m. (The timing is dictated, like much else in the Brexit negotiations so far, by Brussels, which is in a different time zone.) Mr. Johnson seems queasy about the moment being hijacked by Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, who plans a celebration outside Parliament. But the prime minister also appears to be unsure what note to strike over an issue that has split the nation for three years. Brexit was originally scheduled to happen last March, and previous preparations have had to be scrapped, with commemorative coins being melted down when Britain was forced to make a second request for more time. [Read: Battered at the polls, pro-Europe Britons gird for the next fight.] To critics of the Big Ben idea, it illustrates their fear that Brexit is motivated by nostalgia and a wish to bask in the afterglow of a long-lost British Empire. Some Brexit supporters yearn for a restoration of the blue passports they carried in the 1970s (Britain, like other European Union nations, adopted a maroon passport), and some have campaigned for a new royal yacht. “The obsession with Big Ben chiming really highlights the shallowness of the Vote Leave campaign,” Neil Gray, a lawmaker with the Scottish National Party, wrote on Twitter. Most analysts say they believe that the 2016 vote for Brexit was more about identity and a sense of sovereignty than economics, and according to research by Bloomberg Economics, the cost of Brexit has already hit £130 billion, with a further £70 billion set to be added by the end of this year. So national symbols are important to many Brexit supporters, and those who want Big Ben to chime argue that despite the renovation work, the bell has been struck on specific occasions — including on New Year’s Eve. Dozens of lawmakers, including perhaps the most outspoken Brexit supporter, Mark Francois, signed a letter to The Sunday Telegraph, urging that Big Ben not stay silent on Jan. 31. “We believe this would be much to the consternation of many people around the U.K. who wish to celebrate this momentous event,” they wrote. Mr. Farage has weighed in, too, saying that at his planned celebration outside Parliament, he might be forced to play a recording of the chimes. “I frankly think that, around the world, at that moment at 11 p.m., if Big Ben doesn’t strike, our country looks like a joke,” he told LBC Radio. The House of Commons says that the clock mechanism that usually powers the hammer that strikes the Great Bell, as Big Ben is formally known, has been dismantled and removed for refurbishment. (While Big Ben is a nickname for the clock, which is called the Great Clock and sits atop the tower, it is strictly speaking the name of the main bell in the clock. The name is also often used to refer to the Elizabeth Tower, the structure that contains the clock.) For the bell to ring, a temporary striking mechanism used for New Year’s Eve would have to be reattached and tested to ensure the timing was correct. Alongside this work, a temporary floor would have to be installed in the belfry where Big Ben is housed, and the cost for the temporary floor and installing, testing and striking Big Ben would be approximately £120,000. What is more, the delay to other planned work in the belfry would push back the tower’s overall restoration schedule by two to four weeks — with the cost of each week’s delay being approximately £100,000. Even though for Brexit supporters some sort of celebration is important, for most Britons, nothing will actually change after Jan. 31. Under the exit deal, Britain will remain under European Union rules until the end of 2020 while the two sides try to negotiate what the future looks like. So now, although Britain faces tough trade negotiations with the European Union, Mr. Johnson’s public position is that it is time for the country to move on and change the subject. A triumphalist celebration of a moment that millions of Britons will regret hardly fits with a notion of healing and catharsis. The Big Ben for Brexit campaign is not giving up, however. On Wednesday, there were some high-profile pledges of donations, but one online funding page had recorded just £425. If necessary, Mr. Francois told ITV, he and another pro-Brexit lawmaker would “go up there, whack it and save some money.”']",A campaign is underway to get the British Parliament’s great bell to ring when the country leaves the E.U. on Jan. 31. But there are hurdles: the cost and repairs. 
TV Cameras Coming to English Criminal Courts,2020-01-16,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — High-profile criminal cases in English and Welsh courts will be partially televised for the first time, the British Ministry of Justice said on Thursday, in a move that was welcomed by broadcasters but that drew caution from lawyers’ organizations. The change is a limited one. Cameras will be present to record only judges’ sentencing remarks in crown courts, which handle more serious criminal offenses, including the Old Bailey, the main criminal court in London. Defendants, jurors, lawyers, victims and witnesses will remain strictly out of shot. But it still represents a drastic cultural shift for English and Welsh criminal courts, which for decades have banned not only filming and still photography but even the making of sketches — leading British news outlets to rely on artists working from memory.  Sentences in murder, terrorism and sexual offenses, among other serious crimes, would be available to broadcasters and to the public on a dedicated website, the ministry said in a statement. It added that it would begin the legislative process for the change on Thursday, but that the exact schedule would depend on Parliament.  Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said he hoped the filming would make justice more accessible, and “a better understood thing.” “Very often, we hear a story about a case, we think, ‘Why did the judge pass that sort of sentence?’” Mr. Buckland told British radio on Thursday. “Now in a direct way, in a modern way, we’ll be able to see in those high-profile cases exactly why a judge made a decision.” Allowing cameras in courtrooms has long been debated among lawmakers, journalists and lawyers. Those who favor televising court cases consider it vital to open and transparent justice. Opponents argue that it distorts proceedings, and invades the privacy of victims, suspects, judges and prosecutors. Many state trial and appeals courts in the United States permit cameras, and some federal courts have run pilot programs, though the Supreme Court has rejected the idea. The justice systems in most European nations, including Germany and France, ban filming by the media in courtrooms. It can be authorized by a judge in Italian courtrooms and in some cases in Spain, where the trial of the Catalan independence leaders at the Supreme Court in 2019 was broadcast live. In France, some trials are filmed, but the recordings are not available to the media.  In Britain, filming has been authorized in the Supreme Court since it was created in 2009, and in some English and Welsh Court of Appeal cases since 2013. Some courts in Scotland, which has a separate legal system, have invited applications to televise some proceedings since 1992, though filming has been rare in practice. Copies of sentences in English and Welsh criminal cases are available online, but they are often dozens of pages long and not easily accessible to the wider public. Under the new legislation, television and social media producers would most likely edit the soon-to-be-filmed remarks, which can last dozens of minutes, to fit shorter formats on various platforms. Britain’s top broadcasters have lobbied for the introduction of cameras in courtrooms for years, calling the ban shameful and the reliance on court sketches ludicrous. They welcomed the proposed legislation on Thursday, with BBC’s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, calling it “a momentous day for transparency in our justice system.” Yet law experts have warned that context could be missed if the remarks were too heavily edited, and that judges could face threats if they became more public figures. “If the public see judges’ faces in the living room on television and are able to identify them more readily, then unfortunately they are more likely to be personally attacked,” Amanda Pinto, the chairman of the Bar Council, which represents British lawyers, told the BBC. British commentators also wondered on Thursday if the introduction of cameras would turn trials into sensational drama, citing the 1995 trial of O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, which attracted live television audiences in the millions. Mr. Buckland, the justice secretary, said in an interview with the British broadcaster TalkRadio that the filmed remarks would not amount to entertainment, but to information. He added that they would be available with a 10-second delay. “The mission is to explain,” Mr. Buckland said.']","Judges’ sentencing remarks in some serious criminal cases in England and Wales will be televised, a rarity in much of Europe."
Russian Parliament Approves Putin’s Pick for Prime Minister,2020-01-16,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers on Thursday overwhelmingly approved Mikhail V. Mishustin as the new Prime Minister, elevating a little-known technocrat picked by President Vladimir V. Putin as part of an unexpected Kremlin shake-up. Mr. Putin on Wednesday proposed major changes to the Russian Constitution that would spread political power more evenly, away from the president to the Parliament, the State Council and other government institutions. Many analysts saw the potential reordering of Russia’s political system, which surprised the country’s political elite, as an effort by Mr. Putin to ensure that he remains in power past 2024, when his term ends — though how exactly that would work remained unclear. Shortly after Mr. Putin put forward the overhaul in his annual state of the nation address, his ally Dmitri A. Medvedev resigned as prime minister, saying that it would clear the way for the proposed constitutional changes. On Thursday, Mr. Putin appointed Mr. Medvedev deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, which advises the president. Mr. Mishustin, former head of the Federal Tax Service, received 383 votes of 424 cast on Thursday in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, with 41 abstentions coming from the Communist Party. The chamber, dominated by the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, is seen as having only a rubber-stamp role. After the vote, Mr. Putin signed a decree formalizing Mr. Mishustin’s new role. The proposed constitutional changes, Mr. Medvedev’s resignation and the selection of Mr. Mishustin were made swiftly in what resembled a carefully planned operation — one that left many analysts guessing about Mr. Putin’s intentions and his next moves. Many speculated that Mr. Putin — who, under the Constitution, cannot run for president again in 2024 — was planning to take another position that would allow him to retain his grip on power. Others noted that the sequence of moves would keep his opponents off balance and short-circuit any talk of succession, ensuring that the president was not considered a lame duck.

Germany Investigates 3 Suspected of Spying for China,2020-01-16,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — German authorities raided the homes and offices of three people suspected of spying for the Chinese government,  officials said on Thursday, giving no details about their identities or the nature of the alleged espionage.  “This is a preliminary investigation against three known persons,” said Markus Schmitt, a spokesman for the German federal prosecutor, Peter Frank. None of the three have been arrested, he said. The raid comes amid an intensifying debate in Berlin over the country’s relationship with Huawei, the Chinese technology giant that Washington says is being used for espionage by Beijing.

"In Huawei Battle, China Threatens Germany ‘Where It Hurts’: Automakers",2020-01-16,By Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewing,"['BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Premier Li Keqiang of China settled into the back seat of a driverless Volkswagen van, fastened their seatbelts and went for a spin around a disused airport landing strip in central Berlin. “There is nothing like seeing in practice what’s possible,” Ms. Merkel beamed when they returned. That was July 2018, when economic cooperation between the two countries looked limitless — combining Germany’s powerful auto industry and China’s technology giant, Huawei.  Eighteen months later, Germany is embroiled in a tortured debate over whether to allow Huawei to help build its 5G next generation mobile network. But with German automakers, including Audi and Daimler, already working closely with Huawei, it may be China who sits in the driver’s seat.  Whatever Germany decides will shape its relations with China for years and reverberate across the Continent. It will send a powerful political signal on how united, or fractured, Europe will be in the digital age of rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Germany, like all of Europe, is under tremendous pressure to ostracize Huawei by the American government, which fears that the Chinese company is a Trojan horse that would allow China’s government to spy on or control European and American communication networks. The pressure remains even after President Trump signed an initial trade deal with China on Wednesday.  “The West should have a joint solution to 5G because we view the world the same way,” Richard Grenell, the United States ambassador to Germany, said on Thursday in an email. But for Germany that decision is especially fraught. Relations with the Trump administration are infused with threats of tariffs against German automakers and mounting distrust that Europeans have come to believe may permanently reshape, if not rupture, a once ironclad trans-Atlantic alliance.  China, on the other hand, is elbowing its way onto the European stage as a new strategic player and an increasingly indispensable economic partner. By far the largest market in the world, it has become the biggest source of growth for Germany’s main carmakers and the key to their dominance of the luxury car market.  It is a position that China has not been shy to weaponize.  “If Germany were to make a decision that led to Huawei’s exclusion from the German market, there will be consequences,” Wu Ken, China’s ambassador to Germany warned last month. “The Chinese government will not stand idly by.” Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker and member of the digital affairs committee in the German Parliament, put it this way: “The Chinese have made clear that they will retaliate where it hurts: The car industry.” For months, German lawmakers have danced around the issue of whether to effectively exclude Huawei from the bidding process. The issue is expected to be debated in Parliament again in the coming weeks. As a decision approaches, Ms. Merkel has found herself caught between worried German automakers, who accompanied her on a dozen junkets to Beijing, and her own wary intelligence community. Ms. Merkel, steward of the pro-business Christian Democratic Party, met on Thursday with lawmakers from her party and urged them to find a solution that would settle the dispute.  Ms. Merkel is opposed to banning the Chinese company. “It is not about individual companies, but rather security standards,” the chancellor said in November. “It is about the certification we will carry out. That should be our guiding benchmark.” But a rebellion is brewing in Germany’s foreign policy and intelligence community — scared of American threats to limit intelligence sharing — and even among some of the chancellor’s own lawmakers, who want to submit a proposal to Parliament with tougher security criteria that would, in effect, keep Huawei out. Ms. Merkel’s critics say the current certification process, which merely demands that companies sign a pledge not to spy, is inherently flawed because it relies on trust.  At her party’s annual conference in November, the chancellor’s Christian Democrats disinvited Huawei as a corporate sponsor and passed a motion demanding that only companies “which demonstrably fulfill a clearly defined catalog of safety requirements” should be allowed to bid. One key requirement would be to rule out state interference. The motion did not name Huawei or China but the implication was clear.  “Under Chinese law companies are obliged to cooperate with the Chinese Secret Service,” said Norbert Röttgen, a conservative lawmaker who co-wrote the motion against Ms. Merkel’s Huawei policy. “When you deal with Huawei you also have to accept that you might be dealing with the Chinese Communist Party.”  Cars that can steer themselves may make driving safer but they also open up opportunities for government surveillance and control. “Car companies gather loads of personal data from the drivers of their cars, and they face an enormous risk of an angry public outraged to find their data used by the Chinese Communist Party,” said Mr. Grenell, the United States ambassador. Beyond fears of spying and sabotage, lawmakers warned that if Germany allowed Huawei to bid it would not just alienate Washington but risk undermining a badly needed united European front.  “Our only hope is to stick together as Europeans,” Mr. Röttgen said. That, he said, was also an argument for giving the 5G contract to European companies like Nokia or Ericsson.  Analysts say Nokia and Ericsson, which have won 5G contracts in Denmark and elsewhere, have the competence to build the 5G network, but it would take longer and cost more — not least because Huawei is already a huge part of the existing networks in Germany. Switching will be messy and costly.  Still, Mr. Röttgen said, given the scale of the new bid, if it went to Huawei, Europe risked permanently falling behind.  “If you let Huawei build a big chunk of the 5G network after a while you won’t understand your own system,” he said. “It would be a maximal loss of control and sovereignty.” “Strategically it is a crystal clear case,” Mr. Röttgen said.  Others, however, say that giving the bid to Huawei may not be such a bad idea.  “If we ban Huawei, the German car industry will be pushed out of the Chinese market — and this in a situation where the American president is also threatening to punish German carmakers,” said Sigmar Gabriel, a former German foreign minister and vice chancellor. “Just because we have an American president who doesn’t like alliances, we give all that up?"" he said. “Why would we? Especially since he does exactly what the Chinese do and threatens the German car industry.” German automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW have continued to record sales gains in China and to take share from rivals like Ford, even as the overall market has slumped.  “See, last year, 28 million cars were sold in China, 7 million of those were German,” Mr. Wu, China’s ambassador to Germany, added in his remarks in December, making what many in Germany interpreted as a veiled threat.   As Germany’s automakers have become more deeply dependent on China, they also have become more beholden to the Chinese government.  Chinese consumer preferences, and Chinese government policies, increasingly determine what models the carmakers build and what kind of technology they develop. China also has become the stage where German carmakers develop and test new technology, often with Huawei.  Audi, the luxury car unit of Volkswagen, announced a “strategic cooperation” with Huawei on developing autonomous driving technology during Mr. Li’s visit to Berlin last year. Daimler, 9.9 percent owned by Chinese investor Li Shufu, uses Huawei high-performance computing. BMW and others partner with Huawei on research and development.  No car company is more closely entwined with China than Volkswagen. The company has been operating in China since the early 1980s, when the Communist government began opening to the West. Today Volkswagen earns almost half its sales revenue in China and has 14 percent of the Chinese car market.  “If we were to pull out” of China, Herbert Diess, the chief executive of Volkswagen, told the Wolfsburger Nachrichten newspaper in December, “a day later 10,000 of our 20,000 development engineers in Germany would be out of work.” German carmakers deny that their dependence on Chinese sales has turned them into advocates of Chinese interests. “We don’t want political developments to spill over into product development,” Bernhard Mattes, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview in Berlin.  But Mr. Mattes conceded, “We are not operating in a politics-free space, that is clear.” Huawei has understood as much. Its German headquarters are in Bavaria, alongside BMW and Audi and many other companies deeply embedded in China. The company has been a generous sponsor of all mainstream parties, including Bavaria’s governing conservatives. Markus Söder, Bavaria’s conservative leader, has publicly defended Huawei’s right to bid, while also lashing out at the United States. “To say up front that I rule it out because another partner in the world doesn’t like it,” he said, is “a bit of a problem.”    Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']","VW, Daimler and BMW sell more cars in China than anywhere else and many already cooperate with Huawei — a dependency Beijing is not shy to exploit."
Putin’s Power Shake-up: Here Are Six Takeaways,2020-01-15,By Anton Troianovski,"['In his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Wednesday, President Vladimir V.

The spate of moves offers some clues about Mr. Putin’s plans and priorities, but also raises questions about what may lie ahead for the Russian president. Here are answers to some of them.  Mr. Putin’s hold on power in Russia is unrivaled, built up over the last 20 years in his posts as president and prime minister. But Russia’s Constitution bars a president from serving more than two consecutive terms. To maintain his grip on power, as he has hinted he intends to do, Mr. Putin needs to find a way to engineer a leadership transition that will allow that to happen.  [Update: Putin endorses legislation enabling him to run for president again.] To that end, it appears, he has proposed changes to the Constitution that would weaken the presidency while increasing the sway of the Parliament and the prime minister. He said, for example, that the president should in the future be required to accept the prime minister’s cabinet appointments. This and other changes could give Mr. Putin more leeway to find a position in which he can maintain power without violating the Constitution.  That’s not entirely clear. Mr. Putin could become prime minister again, taking advantage of the position’s expanded influence. Alternatively, some analysts have pointed to a leadership maneuver engineered by Nursultan Nazarbayev, the longtime president of Kazakhstan, another former Soviet republic. In 2018, Mr. Nazarbayev increased the power of Kazakhstan’s Security Council and made himself its chairman for life. When he resigned from the presidency last year in favor of a handpicked successor, his position at the helm of the Security Council allowed him to hold on to key levers of power.  On Wednesday, offering few details, Mr. Putin dangled the possibility of a similar move in Russia. The State Council — currently an advisory body made up of the governors of Russia’s regions — should have its “status and role” fixed in the Constitution, he said. That quickly raised speculation among Russian political analysts that a revamped State Council could become a vehicle for Mr. Putin to maintain power if he relinquishes the presidency, particularly over the military and foreign policy.  Despite Mr. Putin’s immense sway, he’d be taking a risk if he simply declared himself president for life. Mr. Putin served two consecutive presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, and then became prime minister. His announcement in 2011 that he would seek the presidency again, followed by parliamentary elections widely seen as rigged, helped trigger Russia’s biggest street protests since the 1990s.  This time around, Mr. Putin looks determined to orchestrate his next move in a slow-motion fashion that’s less likely to produce a backlash. The changes to the Constitution he called for give him several options to hold on to power — while affording him as much as four years’ time to set his course.   “Our society is clearly calling for change,” Mr. Putin said at the beginning of his speech on Wednesday.  Indeed, over the last year, Russia has seen its most vigorous street protests since the anti-Putin rallies of 2011 and 2012. Polls show that Russians increasingly distrust pro-Kremlin TV channels and are getting their news on the internet, which remains largely uncensored. And the Kremlin’s appeal to patriotism — so effective after Mr. Putin’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 — has lost its visceral power, overshadowed by Russia’s economic problems.  All of this means that the Kremlin is likely to portray the resignation on Wednesday of Mr. Medvedev and every cabinet minister as a sign that Mr. Putin has heard Russians’ demand for change. While Russians do increasingly blame Mr. Putin for their ills, many more blame the bureaucrats below him. Mr. Putin’s approval rating has fallen to 68 percent from 82 percent in April 2018, an independent pollster, Levada, says. But Mr. Medvedev is in far worse shape, with an approval rating of 38 percent.  Mr. Putin’s choice of Mr. Mishustin seems to reflect his concerns about Russia’s declining standard of living, which has contributed to spasms of unrest over the last year.  Mr. Mishustin is widely seen as one of Russia’s most effective technocrats. He has headed Russia’s Federal Tax Service since 2010, modernizing a notoriously ineffective and corrupt tax-collecting system. The Financial Times dubbed the computerized, real-time approach to taxation he developed as “the taxman of the future.” In his early years as president, Mr. Putin built his popularity on soaring living standards, which coincided with a period of rising oil prices. But with lower oil prices and Western sanctions, those steady improvements are now a thing of the past. Disposable incomes are still effectively below what they were in 2013.  Mr. Putin also used his state-of-the-nation speech to make a raft of pledges to improve Russians’ daily lives. For example: free hot meals for all elementary school students from grades one through four.  Unlike Russia’s more prominent economic reformers, the 53-year-old Mr. Mishustin has no political base of his own, reducing the likelihood that he might use the powers of his new office to chip away at Mr. Putin’s authority.  Not at all. In theory, at least, Russia’s system of governance echoes that of France — a powerful presidency checked by an independent judiciary, by parliament and by a cabinet of ministers headed by a prime minister with his own locus of authority. But Mr. Putin has steadily subsumed the authority of all those institutions, often justifying crackdowns on political pluralism as necessary in the face of external threats. He reprised that language in his speech on Wednesday, signaling that no political thaw is in the offing. “Russia can be and can remain Russia only as a sovereign state,” he said. That was an allusion to Mr. Putin’s frequent charge the West is fomenting political opposition to undermine Russian sovereignty. To drive home the point, Mr. Putin proposed a constitutional amendment that offered the day’s clearest statement of how he views his successor: Russia’s future president, Mr. Putin said, may not ever have had citizenship or permanent residency in another country.']",Is Vladimir Putin Russia’s president for life?

"8 Americans Were Hurt in Iranian Strike, Military Says, Despite Trump Statements",2020-01-17,By Alissa J. Rubin and Russell Goldman,"[""Eight American troops were flown from their Iraqi bases after showing signs of concussions from Iranian missile strikes, the military said on Thursday,  despite earlier statements by President Trump that no Americans had been injured. Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a spokesman for the American-led coalition in Baghdad, added on Friday that the service members’ symptoms began to surface only after the president’s announcement. He said that there had been no other injuries. The Jan. 8 attack on bases in Iraq’s western desert and near Erbil, Iraq, were launched in retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a senior figure in Iran’s military, in a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump. The lack of American deaths in the strikes was a welcome relief to American officials, who had feared the killing of the general and its aftermath could set off a larger regional conflict.  During a briefing with reporters on Friday, Jonathan Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, attributed the delay in reporting the injuries to affected service members returning to duty immediately after the attack and displaying symptoms only days later. He denied that anyone had delayed the reporting of the injuries out of political considerations. “This idea that there was an effort to de-emphasize injuries for some sort of amorphous political agenda doesn’t hold water,” Hoffman said. Those who showed symptoms of concussions had been serving at Al Asad Air Base in the west. The base received warning that an attack was imminent, and many service members were in bunkers when the missiles hit. But some service member's assignments required them to be outside the bunkers during the attack, and the injured were among those people.  The trauma was caused by blast waves that resulted when the missiles exploded, Colonel Caggins said. Although an initial statement left unclear how many service members needed treatment, a military spokesman later said that only eight of 11 service members sent for evaluation showed signs of concussions.   In a speech the day of the attack, Mr. Trump had said that no Americans were hurt in the strike, in which at least a dozen missiles were fired. “I’m pleased to inform you the American people should be extremely grateful and happy,” the president said on Jan. 8. “No Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime.” Colonel Caggins said that, as is typical with concussions, symptoms manifest gradually in the days afterward. When President Trump tweeted “All is well” in the hours just after the attack, none of those affected by the blasts yet realized they potentially had concussions, Colonel Caggins said. “There’s no way the president would have known at the time he sent the tweet.”  Colonel Caggins said the first injured service member was not flown out for a medical evaluation until two days later, with the others leaving on Jan. 15. Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for United States Central Command, said the injured troops were taken to American military sites in Germany and Kuwait to undergo screening, and that “when deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq.” Alissa J. Rubin reported from Erbil, Iraq, and Russell Goldman from Hong Kong. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.

Saudi Society Is Changing. Just Take a Look at These Coffeehouses.,2020-01-15,By Vivian Yee,"['RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — For insight into these head-spinning times in Saudi Arabia, where the ultraconservative social and religious codes that micromanage daily life seem to spring a new leak every month — women driving! movie theaters! Usher and Akon rapping to sold-out crowds! — it sometimes pays to read the Google Maps reviews of specialty coffee shops. “I visited this place and was in a total shock!” Tarak Alhamood, a customer at Nabt Fenjan, a Riyadh coffee shop, raged online recently. “YOU r VIOLATING the rules of this country. I hope this place get closed permanently.” The blame lay not with the matcha iced tea and flat whites (good, other reviewers opined), the nondairy milk options (appreciated), the chocolate cake (don’t miss) or the prices (less popular). The issue was the decision that made Nabt Fenjan a daring outpost of the new Riyadh: Originally opened only for women, the coffee shop began allowing male and female customers to mix in late 2018. The move propelled the cafe ahead of the law in the kingdom, where most restaurants and coffee shops are divided, by law and custom, into all-male “singles” sections and “family” sections for women and mixed family groups. Men enter through separate doors and pay in separate lines; women sometimes eat behind partitions to ensure privacy from male strangers. In early December, however, the government announced that businesses would no longer be required to segregate customers — the latest expansion of the social reforms initiated by the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Yet Nabt Fenjan was far from the only Saudi establishment to discreetly drop separate sections over the last few years, after the crown prince defanged the religious police, which once enforced conservative social norms. Nor was it the only place to thrive partly as a result. “I think the reason coffee shops became a trend is because people are more open to change,” said Shaden Alkhalifah, 30, who was studying at Draft Café in Riyadh on a recent evening. “It has something to do with the current political dialogue,” she added. (And, perhaps, with the many Saudis who have studied abroad in cities with single-origin coffee bean fetishes.) Notwithstanding Mr. Alhamood’s Google pan of Nabt Fenjan, even traditionalists have begun to unbend amid the general loosening-up, in larger cities if not yet in smaller ones or rural areas. Some women whose families might previously have allowed them to work only in the privacy of offices, if at all, now hold barista jobs. Saudis can now mingle with the opposite sex not only at home but also at movie theaters, concerts and even wrestling matches. Young entrepreneurs are opening places where Saudis can meet like-minded people of both sexes, whether they are artists, filmmakers or entrepreneurs. The clientele in such coffee shops skews young, reflecting a country where more than two-thirds of the population is under 30 and an unknown proportion is chronically bored. Bars are barred, concerts and movies just starting to become widely available. Evenings out, therefore, still tend to revolve around food and (nonalcoholic) drink, the more Instagrammable, the better. For a while, fancy burger joints were everywhere. Food trucks had a long moment. Social media whetted one frenzy after another. “It’s because we have nothing to do,” said Abdulrahman, an Uber driver in Riyadh, who gave only his first name. “Just these coffee shops.” What is becoming acceptable in Riyadh is still dicey in smaller Saudi cities. But the changes are en route. After befriending a woman through social media, Ziyad Abdulrahman, 26, a teaching assistant at an Islamic university in the holy city of Medina, met her in person not long ago at a Riyadh restaurant. It was his first time being alone with a woman in public. “It was totally fine,” he said. “Actually, I was a little late to this. People have changed.” Most coffee shops are still gender-segregated. But many have other draws: imported Japanese brewing equipment, Instagrammable tarts and — more intangible, but mandatory nevertheless — good vibes. Virtually none offer the golden, cardamom-infused Arabic coffee, poured from a curvaceous pot into dainty cups and served to guests with a hillock of dates, that traditionally defined Saudi coffee culture. Instead, at Draft, which still separates single men and “families,” there are quinoa salads and blond-wood tables illuminated by industrial-style bulbs. And at Medd Café in Jeddah, the Red Sea city where social codes have long been more relaxed than elsewhere, the organic, fair-trade beans are roasted in-house. On a recent Friday night at Medd Café, the outdoor patio was crowded with young men and women. Many of the women wore their hair uncovered and their abayas open over jeans and sneakers, styling them more like long, fluid jackets than the traditional all-covering gowns. Still, Riyadh is starchier than Jeddah. It was only after much internal debate that Kanakah, a Riyadh coffee shop that spent three years proudly all-female, reopened last year as a mixed space. Patrons entered through the same door, stood in the same line and ordered from baristas of both sexes. Khawater Alismaeel, Kanakah’s owner, had noticed that men and women were publicly working together at a few other businesses. If it was not explicitly forbidden, she figured, she might as well try it. “I wanted to prove that I could do everything on my own with an all-female staff,” said Ms. Alismaeel, 23, who opened Kanakah at 19, with help from her family. “Now we’re proving that it’s possible for men and women to work together.” The change put off some female customers who preferred the old way. Others were scandalized, convinced the cafe had become what one reviewer slammed as a “boys and girls dating spot.” The reaction hurt, Ms. Alismaeel said. But she was after a larger, more inclusive vision — not only women working alongside men, but also women who wear the niqab, the veil that exposes only the eyes, working alongside women with bare heads. The changes have unfurled so swiftly that, four months in, she was still not sure whether regulations forbade her from employing female baristas alongside male ones. A municipal health inspector had visited the cafe after a customer complained about the situation, but left them alone. “I feel lucky to be part of this generation,” she said. “Even five years ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.” It can still go the other way. Tala Alzaid, 19, a Kanakah barista, used to work with an all-female crew at another coffee shop (“the whole woman-stays-at-home thing is so last year,” she said), but the women were summarily fired in August after a customer complained to the government. “I mean, equal rights! Why am I being fired when I did nothing wrong?” she said. “When it comes to the government, there’s equality, but in the minds of citizens, maybe it’s not equal.” With her family’s support, Ms. Alzaid had embraced working with men, because “it’s boring otherwise,” she said. “The younger generation accepts change. It’s the older people.” The young, too, have their demands. Ms. Alismaeel plans to introduce more sustainable and vegan-friendly offerings, addressing another complaint from her online reviews. “They used to have plant milk and vegan” desserts, “but now they don’t!” Shatha Zayd wrote in December. “GET UPGRADED! THE WORLD IS CHANGING.” Abdu Mansour contributed reporting.']","As the government relaxes restrictions on men and women working and socializing together, coffeehouses are on the front lines of change."
Putin’s Power Shake-up: Here Are Six Takeaways,2020-01-15,By Anton Troianovski,"['In his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shook up the country and its political class by calling for constitutional changes that would give him a new path to holding onto power after his current — and, in theory, last — term ends in 2024.

Iran’s President Lashes Out at Europeans Over Crumbling Nuclear Deal,2020-01-15,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Under growing pressure at home and abroad, Iranian leaders attempted on Wednesday to calm domestic anger over the downing of a passenger jet last week, while lashing out at European nations that have formally accused Iran of breaking the 2015 agreement to curb its nuclear program. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani criticized — and appeared to threaten — Britain, France and Germany for officially accusing Iran on Tuesday of reneging on its commitments under the nuclear deal, a step that further isolates Iran internationally and that could lead to renewed United Nations sanctions. The European countries, signatories to the deal, have tried to salvage the agreement since President Trump pulled out in 2018 and imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran, kick-starting the current high tensions. They said on Tuesday that they still hoped to preserve the deal, but Mr. Rouhani, at a government meeting, accused the Europeans of siding with the United States and urged them to uphold the deal. “Today, the American soldier is in danger, tomorrow the European soldier could be in danger,” Mr. Rouhani said in a speech, Agence France-Presse reported. The Europeans and the United States would only aggravate tensions in the region if they continued pulling back from the deal, he warned. “You will suffer if you take a wrong move,” he said, according to Press TV, a state-run news agency.  The nuclear deal, which was intended to keep Iran from building an atomic bomb, imposed limits on its ability to enrich uranium — the process of transforming the element into fuel for nuclear reactors or weapons. In response to American sanctions, Iran has repeatedly breached those restrictions, despite European pleas to return to compliance. But Mr. Rouhani seemed to leave a sliver of room open for further negotiation on Wednesday, noting in his speech that Iran’s recent steps to increase its nuclear activities were reversible. If the United States softened its punishing stance toward Iran, “we are prepared” to reciprocate, he said, according to Press TV. Comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday morning suggested that the United States was looking in the opposite direction, citing what he called “very direct discussions” with the European signatories to the nuclear deal.  “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place,” he said on CNBC. The Europeans’ decision to invoke the deal’s formal dispute resolution process arrived at a flammable moment for Iran, after weeks of domestic and international tumult. Antigovernment protests broke out in several cities last month, but the targeted killing by the United States of a top Iranian general this month temporarily united the country behind its leadership, and Iran fired missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq in retaliation. On Jan. 8, a Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kyiv crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard. After claiming for three days that the disaster had resulted from mechanical failure, Iran acknowledged that its own antiaircraft missiles had shot the plane down, as Western governments and news organizations had reported. The crowds of mourners that packed Iranian cities for the slain Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, last week gave way to widespread, though smaller, protests against the government’s handling of the airliner accident.  The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, acknowledged the protesters’ anger and seemed to validate it in remarks on Wednesday at a diplomatic conference in New Delhi. “In the last few nights, we’ve had people in the streets of Tehran demonstrating against the fact that they were lied to for a couple of days,” news organizations reported him as saying. After admitting to shooting down the plane, the Iranian military said that “human error” had been at fault, not any system problem. On Tuesday, the military’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had arrested a person who had recorded a video of a missile striking the plane — images that undermined Iran’s initial denials.  Mr. Rouhani said on Wednesday that the military should apologize to the Iranian people for its three-day wait in admitting the mistake, according to Press TV. He said the military had taken a “good step” in acknowledging what had happened, but that it had to follow up with reforms to prevent future mistakes. But he also seemed to attribute the delay in conceding that the plane had been shot down to the sheer shock of what had happened.  “No one could believe that an aircraft has taken off from an international airport in the capital, begun flying on its route, and is then targeted,” said Mr. Rouhani, a former commander of Iran’s air defense forces. It was the second day in a row that the president, a relative moderate on Iran’s political spectrum, had criticized the military, which is closely tied to the country’s hard-line leaders. On Tuesday, he called for a special court to investigate the disaster and the authorities’ response to it, saying that greater openness was needed.  On Wednesday, Mr. Zarif, an ally of the president, appeared to be trying to balance the two power centers, praising the military in his remarks for being “brave enough to claim responsibility early on.” Mr. Rouhani also criticized the clerical establishment, which wields ultimate power in Iran, for disqualifying candidates in parliamentary elections next month, including some sitting lawmakers. Religious leaders often bar candidates seen as liberals or critics of the system, leaving voters to choose among conservatives whom the establishment considers acceptable.  Where there is no clear reason for disqualification, “don’t disappoint the people,” the president said. A contest for a single office might have the appearance of choice, with 17 candidates, but “17 people from how many sides, one side?” Mr. Rouhani asked. “This is not elections. It’s like having 2,000 of the same item in a shop.” The protests since the plane crash resulted on Wednesday in the departure of the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran had sought to expel him after he was detained briefly on Saturday, accused of attending an illegal antigovernment demonstration at a university in Tehran. Mr. Macaire said on Twitter this week that he had not been taking part in the protest but had gone to attend a planned vigil for victims of the plane crash. “Normal to want to pay respects,” he wrote, noting that some of the victims were British. “I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.” Britain had strongly objected to his detention in Iran, but in the end, Mr. Macaire left the country “with prior notice and according to the protocols,” IRNA reported on Wednesday, without offering further details. It remained to be seen whether protests in Iran over the airplane’s downing would continue much longer, but the economic distress that spurred Iranians into the streets late last year seems almost certain to continue. The economy is already choking under American sanctions, and Iran’s fading hopes for a badly needed economic lifeline from Europe received another blow with the invoking of the resolution mechanism on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, warned on Tuesday that Iran would respond “firmly, decisively and aptly” if the three European nations moved toward reimposing sanctions. “They should prepare themselves for potential consequences, of which they have been notified,” Mr. Mousavi said, according to the state-run outlet Press TV. Mujib Mashal and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.']","With the government in Tehran under pressure, President Hassan Rouhani warned that European troops could be in “danger.” "
Europe’s Gamble: Can It Save Iran Deal by Threatening to Kill It?,2020-01-15,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Europe is gambling on keeping the 2015 Iran nuclear deal alive by threatening to destroy it — a risky, oddly timed strategy that could backfire badly, European officials and analysts say. The decision by France, Germany and Britain on Tuesday to challenge Iran’s breaches of the nuclear agreement and trigger what is known as the dispute resolution mechanism starts a clock that the Europeans may not be able to control, subject to unpredictable actions by the leaders of both Iran and the United States. Already the move has angered Iran, which contends its breaches of the accord are justified and that the Europeans are bending toward President Trump and his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Tehran. The Europeans insist otherwise. But watching Iran and the United States head for a possible military escalation, they are trying at least to avoid an outcome in which Iran moves down the North Korean road toward a nuclear bomb. “If there is a European strategy here, it’s essentially to try to buy time,’’ said Nathalie Tocci, a former adviser to the European Union’s former foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, who helped negotiate the 2015 deal with Iran.  “The optimistic scenario is that they’ve done this to keep Trump happy and hope to stretch out the dispute process until the November U.S. elections,” Ms. Tocci said. The Europeans, she said, are wagering that “despite all the pressure on Iran, it won’t use the freedom it’s granted itself’’ to enrich uranium to bomb-ready levels. The Europeans also are hoping to induce the United States and Iran to somehow engage in negotiations on an enhanced deal that Mr. Trump can call his own, even if it differs little from the current one, negotiated by President Barack Obama, that limited Iran’s nuclear activities — a deal Mr. Trump has called the worst in history. “But it’s a very high-risk strategy,” Ms. Tocci said. “It’s hard to see Tehran playing ball all the way until November.’’ Wendy R. Sherman, a key American negotiator of the 2015 accord, also described the use of the dispute mechanism as “incredibly risky” and said “it will increase the likelihood of the demise” of the deal. It is hard to see those around Mr. Trump, who have opposed the nuclear deal and supported his maximum pressure campaign, granting Iran any concession to get talks started, said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform.  Mr. Trump’s subordinates appear to believe their strategy is working. Iran’s government and economy are weakened, they note. And they say the United States killing of a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad nearly two weeks ago has deterred Iran in the region, rather than prompting further attempts to expel the Americans from Iraq and Syria. But others, like Robert Malley, an American who helped negotiate the nuclear deal and now runs the International Crisis Group, say they are not so sure. They expect further retaliation from Iran and from the Iraqi militias it supports, including one led by a commander killed alongside General Suleimani. In its zeal to pressure the Europeans, a Trump administration official even threatened them with 25 percent tariffs on automobile exports if they did not invoke the dispute provision with Iran, according to a European official — which would be an extraordinary use of economic leverage for a foreign policy goal. The warning, first reported by The Washington Post, was conveyed in a single phone call and was regarded by the Europeans as counterproductive, the European official said.  An indication of the American administration’s mood came on Wednesday from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believed United Nations sanctions on Iran would be swiftly reimposed now that France, Britain and Germany had triggered the dispute-resolution mechanism. The Europeans made that move in response to Iran’s declarations that it would no longer honor the nuclear accord’s limits on Iranian enrichment of uranium — potential fuel for a bomb. “I’ve had very direct discussions — as well as Secretary Pompeo has — with our counterparts,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC. “We look forward to working with them quickly and would expect that the U.N. sanctions will snap back into place.’’ But that outcome, which would likely terminate the agreement, is precisely what the Europeans say they are trying to avoid. There is nervousness that Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, with his eye on a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, might crack, but European officials consider that possibility unlikely.  Mr. Johnson and his government support the nuclear deal and collaborated on a statement with France and Germany on Tuesday that said “we are not joining a campaign to implement maximum pressure on Iran.” On Tuesday, Mr. Johnson urged new talks with Washington and Tehran to try to negotiate a “Trump deal” to supplant the current one. Under the dispute mechanism, explained Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, time limits on discussions can be extended by consent. Any party to the deal can go directly to the United Nations Security Council to request the re-imposition of United Nations sanctions, but no one is expected to do that, unless Mr. Johnson unexpectedly capitulates to Washington.  John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, has argued that the Americans can make this request themselves. The Europeans disagree, saying Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the nuclear accord last year means the United States is no longer a party to it. Still, Ms. Geranmayeh said, both Iran and the United States are unpredictable. “If there is no diplomacy or something else poisons it militarily, the Europeans have triggered a clock that could end up more quickly at the Security Council,’’ she said. The political unrest in Iran, following the killing of General Suleimani and Iran’s accidental shooting down of a civilian airliner, creates enormous uncertainty. The government in Iran is cracking down on protests, and with parliamentary elections next month, hard-line rhetoric is bound to increase. While Iran insists its nuclear work will remain peaceful, its decisions to disregard the nuclear deal’s limits on both the volume and purity of Iranian nuclear fuel have raised worries that the country could amass enough enriched uranium to create a bomb in a matter of months. “I think the attack on Suleimani will make the Iranians want to accelerate their nuclear program,’’ Mr. Bond said. “They’ve seen Kim Jong-un and the lesson from Trump, which is if you have nuclear weapons you can get love letters from the president, and if you don’t, your generals can get killed.’’ Iran’s first reaction has been relative calm, Ms. Geranmayeh said. “But given the stalemate and the European inability to deliver the economic benefits it promised, Iran could end up by lashing out, and could do so on the nuclear side,’’ she said.  For example, Iran could restrict access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency or even expel them. “So it could all be worse, and you can’t separate that from the U.S.-Iran confrontation,’’ she said. Which is why the three European countries are expected to continue to focus on finding an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough, as President Emmanuel Macron of France has been trying to do with Washington and Iran since the late summer.  Any new talks would face extraordinary obstacles. Iran says they would require sanctions relief as a precondition, and the Trump administration is instead increasing sanctions on Iran.  Some European officials have speculated that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has enjoyed some diplomatic successes where Washington has created vacuums, might try to mediate himself. Mr. Bond said Russia was happy to be aligned with the Europeans on at least this issue, and has benefited from Europe’s split on Iran with the United States. And Moscow, which is a party to the nuclear deal, has made clear it does not want a nuclear-armed Iran. François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, said that he could imagine a phased negotiation — first to determine what sanctions Washington could lift as a sign of good faith, then some high-level meeting, much like Mr. Trump had with Mr. Kim. While Mr. Heisbourg expressed skepticism, he praised the European countries for at least trying to de-escalate the tension while attempting to keep Iran from going down the North Korean path, risking a real war with the United States or Israel. “This is an unholy mess,’’ he said. “The chance of the Europeans succeeding in a meaningful way to improve matters is very low. But we are in a position to try this. And no one else is even trying.’’ Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Washington.']","A risky strategy to keep the nuclear agreement alive could backfire.

England’s Only County Without a McDonald’s Is About to Get One,2020-01-15,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The county of Rutland, England’s smallest by some measures, has for years had varied gastronomic options: pub food, Indian cuisine, tapas and even a restaurant with a Michelin star.  But it was the only English county not to have a McDonald’s — until now.  The local council on Tuesday approved an application by McDonald’s for a new restaurant in the county, a decision that many in the area viewed as a surrender of England’s last fortress to fast-food’s signature golden arches, despite a promise by the company that the outlet would provide at least 65 jobs. Among residents’ objections to the McDonald’s, which is planned near the town of Oakham, were worries over litter, noise, obesity and crime.  Rutland, a rural county with a population of about 37,000 according to the most recent census, has been noted for its serenity and beauty. Hailed as “Britain’s best rural area for quality of life” by Halifax bank in 2015, it includes the historic towns of Oakham and Uppingham. “There are numerous independent food retailers in and around Oakham that provide healthy, good priced food alternatives,” Claire Baines, a Rutland resident, told the council, in one of 80 written responses by members of the public before the meeting that approved the application.  “Why, in this day and age of spiraling obesity, diabetes and other health issues,” she asked, “would you encourage the introduction of a fast food restaurant serving nothing but junk food?” Graham Show, who lives in Oakham, also opposed the opening of a McDonald’s branch including a drive-through, writing that litter from such outlets was “disgraceful” because “people throw the leftover packaging out of their cars.”  Others said they hoped a McDonald’s might help modernize the county and reduce unemployment.  “Rutland is a stunning county but it could do with moving on with the times,” Victoria Wallace wrote to the council, and Nicola Tyers wrote that the fast-food outlet would provide “the younger generation in the area with jobs and a place to meet with friends in a safe and friendly environment.” Gordon Brown, the senior local council member responsible for planning, said on Tuesday that the planning officers and council members had to be impartial when deciding on any new development, despite any passionate opinions on the matter among members of the public. The new McDonald’s, he said in a statement, was “approved because it would not have an adverse impact on neighboring homes and businesses or the character of the surrounding area, and will create a significant number of new jobs on land that is set aside for employment rather than houses.” The council said that the public’s feedback had led to changes to the initial proposal, including more parking for disabled people and additional trash cans around the site.  McDonald’s also agreed to carry out “no fewer than three litter picks each day” and to pick up all litter found within 100 meters (about 110 yards) of the site, Mr. Brown said.

"French Strikers Shut Down the Louvre, Setting a New Target in a Pension Fight",2020-01-17,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — Visitors were turned away from the Louvre on Friday after strikers protesting the French government’s planned pension overhaul blocked entrances to the museum, leaving tourists from around the world befuddled and frustrated. The Louvre — the world’s most visited museum — was the latest target in the 44-day standoff between the government of President Emmanuel Macron and the labor unions opposed to him, with strikes that have caught commuters, business people and tourists in the middle. About 100 protesters prevented visitors from entering the museum, including through the famed glass pyramid that sits in the Louvre’s central courtyard, where they waved union placards and chanted slogans against President Emmanuel Macron as tourists looked on glumly. “Closing the Louvre to prevent tourists from visiting is very important because it’s the most visited museum in the world,” said Christophe Benoit, 52, a protesting employee of France’s Culture Ministry, although he acknowledged that some visitors were “very angry.” “We do understand that, but we feel like there is no other way to make our voices heard,” Mr. Benoit said. Not everyone was convinced. One crestfallen visitor, who gave only her first name, Chantal, said she had come from a Paris suburb to see the Leonardo da Vinci retrospective, the museum’s latest blockbuster show, which is fully booked far in advance. “I’d been planning this visit for three months,” she said, expressing irritation that her daily commute had already grown considerably longer because of the transportation strikes. “The tickets were already bought, and it took me an hour on public transit to get into Paris, so it’s a waste of time.” Others, especially foreign visitors who haven’t followed France’s strikes, were more puzzled than angered. “I don’t really understand why they are striking,” said Giuliana Maletese, a student visiting from Italy. “I just hope we’ll be refunded because we already bought our tickets online.” Labor unions, noting that Mr. Macron had given his victory speech in front of the glass pyramid after the 2017 presidential election, said in a statement that they now stood there “staunchly opposed” to his “disastrous” pension overhaul, which aims to unify 42 different public and private plans into one state-managed, point-based system. The unions also protested working conditions at the Louvre because of staff and funding cuts, the statement said. A Louvre spokeswoman said on Friday evening that tourists who had booked tickets in advance would be reimbursed. But she acknowledged it would be much harder to restore reservations for visitors who had missed their time slot for the da Vinci show. It was unclear how long the protesters, a mix of Louvre employees and strikers from other sectors, would continue to block entrances. Protesters have also staged smaller-scale actions, like closing some of the museum’s exhibition rooms, according to Christian Galani, 45, one of those demonstrating on Friday. “It’s the first time we’ve completely shut down the museum, which makes things much more visible,” said Mr. Galani, who works night shifts at the Louvre as a security guard. Train conductors, teachers, dock workers, energy workers, opera dancers and others have gone on strike and taken to the streets of Paris and other major cities over the past weeks to protest against Mr. Macron’s pension overhaul, which would abolish some special retirement plans and which protesters worry will lower their retirement payouts. About 187,000 protesters marched around France on Thursday, the latest day of demonstrations, down from 452,000 the previous week, according to the Interior Ministry. Union figures, while higher, have shown a similar dip. Public opinion is still mostly in favor of the protest movement, but support is waning. Transportation disruptions have also become less severe as railway workers, hardly mollified by government concessions but unable to forego pay any longer, are returning to work. Train traffic was almost normal around the country on Friday and some metro lines in Paris were back up and running, albeit slowly — a stark improvement from the first weeks of the strikes, which had ground transportation to a near complete halt.

China Releases #MeToo Activist Who Covered Hong Kong Protests,2020-01-17,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have released a prominent #MeToo activist and journalist whose detention nearly three months ago prompted an outcry from human rights groups, her friends said on Friday. The activist, Huang Xueqin, 32, was detained by the police in October in the southern city of Guangzhou on charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a vague accusation that the government often uses to silence activists. Ms. Huang gained prominence as a #MeToo activist who confronted China’s patriarchal culture, helping dozens of women report cases of sexual harassment. More recently, she had drawn attention for traveling to Hong Kong and writing essays about the antigovernment protests there. In a message to her friends on Friday, Ms. Huang said she was grateful for their support. “This is Xueqin, and I’m back,” she wrote, according to a friend who received the message and asked not to be identified. “One second of darkness doesn’t make people blind.” China’s #MeToo movement has taken on several prominent figures in media, academia and religion, despite government censorship and the male-dominated culture. “We’re not brave enough to stand out as one individual,” Ms. Huang said in a 2018 interview with The New York Times. “But together, we can be strong.” Human rights experts welcomed Ms. Huang’s release, though they cautioned that the governing Communist Party’s campaign to silence voices of dissent was still in full force. “That she was detained at all is an indictment of Beijing’s hostility toward independent activism and journalism,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group. Under President Xi Jinping, who rose to power in 2012, the authorities have detained and imprisoned dozens of lawyers, journalists and activists. It is unclear why the authorities detained Ms. Huang. The government has in recent months harassed and detained mainland citizens who have shown support for the protests in Hong Kong, which party leaders see as a separatist movement. In her essays about the demonstrations there, Ms. Huang wrote about attending a huge march in June. She also criticized the mainland’s restrictions on free speech. Calls to the Guangzhou police Friday evening were not immediately returned. Mr. Xi’s efforts to limit dissent have continued to send waves of anxiety through China’s community of activists. Last month, as part of a nationwide crackdown, the authorities detained several prominent rights lawyers who attended a planning meeting in the eastern city of Xiamen. One of the detained lawyers, Ding Jiaxi, had previously spent several years in prison for his role in the New Citizens Movement, a group of activists who called on officials to disclose financial assets. Xu Zhiyong, another prominent leader of that movement who also attended the meeting in Xiamen, is now in hiding, activists say. “Will this persecution ever end?” said Ms. Richardson, of Human Rights Watch. “And will the responsible Chinese officials ever be held accountable?”']","Huang Xueqin, who spoke critically of China’s restrictions on free speech, spent nearly three months in detention on charges of “provoking trouble.”"
Watching the Beach Town of My Childhood Burn,2020-01-17,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['   The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. This week’s issue is written by Livia Albeck-Ripka, a reporter with the Australia bureau. When I was about 15 months old and could only say a few words, one of them was “baitfish.” My family had just returned from our annual summer vacation in Mallacoota, a beach town of a few hundred on the southeast coast of Australia, where we would catch tiny, glimmering fish and use them to lure flathead out of the water. After we returned home, a patch of light shimmered on the wall, and according to my mother, I pointed to it and described what I saw: “baitfish.” It was the Australian summer of 1990-91, and on the other side of the world, the Israeli military was handing out gas masks to its citizens because of the threat of attacks from Iraq. But in a fishing village thousands of miles away, where giant goannas scuttled through gumtrees and kookaburras laughed, my siblings were hunting for wild animal scat and leaping into the ocean.  At the end of every day, we would collapse salty and exhausted into bed. My mother, riding in a dinghy across an expanse of glittering lake, felt grateful to be so far from the world’s calamities, she recently told me. This New Year’s Eve, when blazes near Mallacoota caused smoke so thick the sky turned pitch black, my family absorbed the news and the imagery in horror. We were in Inverloch, a different beach town some 280 miles away — which, this year, escaped the blazes. But our vacation was eclipsed by haze and news of the devastating fires, which so far have burned millions of acres, killed at least 25 people and likely wiped out around a billion animals. Across the country, hardware stores began selling out of masks used to protect people from smoke inhalation. A few days into the new year, in near 100 degree temperatures and choking smoke, I left my family and drove to Hastings, another coastal town, where hundreds of evacuees from Mallacoota — now ravaged by fires that cut off power and destroyed properties — were due to arrive.  Watching them disembark was surreal; I had only ever witnessed scenes like this in Italy, covering the country’s naval rescue mission for refugees. After 20 hours on the ocean, people were weary and some of them, having lost their properties, were likely now displaced. One woman getting off the boat, Corrin Mueller, 23, carried a sign that read “inaction costs more,” which she said referred to the Australian government’s failure to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to global warming. “We’re only here because nobody’s acted quick enough,” she said. “And there’s so much more we can still do to stop more people having to go through this.” One of the things I most wanted to understand, however, was what had driven those remaining in Mallacoota to stay there, and how it felt to watch their paradise turn to ash. So I headed east, toward the firegrounds, and eventually boarded a military flight to the fishing village so mythologized and revered in my family’s collective memory. In Mallacoota, I found miles of charred bush and flattened homes, but a resilient community, determined to rebuild as soon as possible. Our photographer, Asanka Brendon Ratnayake, and I stayed in one of a number of log cabins that had miraculously been spared by the fire — the “luckiest log cabins,” as one local described them. It was surrounded by scorched gumtrees. Despite the devastation, there was a kind of magic: Inside the local pub, which was running on a generator, people drank cold beer and sang along to Don McLean (“This will be the day that I die…”). The burden they were carrying was revealed only in snippets; people became teary describing the fear they’d felt on New Year’s Eve, as they fought with buckets of water and surgical masks to protect their properties, and the sounds of the gas bottles wailing as they exploded. At 8:30 a.m. on the morning of New Year’s Eve, Debbie Preston, who runs the local caravan park, said she “thought she was gone,” and texted a friend an expletive.  At 9:30 a.m., she texted again: “Goodbye.” It was surreal to hear these stories in a beach town like so many others along the coast, where summer after summer I have taken my own vacations. The scale of the calamity created a cognitive dissonance: In many moments during the two straight weeks I spent on the road reporting, I would forget that I was in Australia. I don’t believe I was alone in feeling this way.  Across the country, people who grew up here are grappling with seeing it transformed; with experiencing summer in an oppressive and polluting smog that seeps into everything; asking themselves if this is what this time of year is going to be like from now on, if we are experiencing the apocalypse. As a reporter, I ask myself and my sources the same questions, and the answers are complex. One of the most frightening things about climate change is that we cannot predict exactly what will happen, and that at some point, we may tip into a cascading series of devastating events that we cannot reverse.

Putin and the Art of Stepping Down Gracefully While Keeping a Grip on Power,2020-01-17,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Several years ago, for reasons that have never been explained, President Vladimir V. Putin vanished from the public eye for more than a week, sending the Russian capital into a tizzy over his fate. When he popped back up, Mr. Putin brushed off the episode, saying, “It would be boring without gossip.” But the brief absence did prove something about Russian politics: After 20 years leading Russia, Mr. Putin oversees a political class perhaps more fearful of his absence than his presence. That factor, more than anything else, helps explain why he used his state of the nation address on Wednesday to announce a surprise reorganization of the government four years before he is scheduled to step down. But it also raises a question that Mr. Putin himself seems to be wrestling with: Can he ever step away from power without sending the rigid Russian political system into convulsions and endangering his own legacy and, in extremis, even his own security? “For most autocratic leaders, it has been quite dangerous to leave power,” said Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Things have to be going extremely well, and the system has to be stable, to get out without any repercussions.” The usual autocrat retirement package is unappealing: death, jail or exile. That trend has played out in Russia, too, where Mr. Putin, at 67 and a grandfather, has ruled longer than any modern Russian leader other than Stalin. In the 100 years before Mr. Putin took power on New Year’s Eve, 1999, only three of nine leaders retired. The rest died in office or were executed. Mr. Putin’s constitutional overhaul suggests a plan to stay safe and avoid triggering infighting if, as now seems likely, he does not seek to remain as president when his current term expires in 2024. The key is to signify that he does not intend to cede power after he leaves the presidency. “He cannot just ask somebody else to keep his seat warm,” and step aside safely, said Sergey Belanovsky, a sociologist and close observer of Russian politics. In the Russian system, alliances of business oligarchs, generals, governors, intelligence officers and oil company chiefs compete for power and money. Mostly out of public view, they disseminate kompromat, or comprising information about each other, and arrange for rivals to be arrested or driven into exile. Mr. Putin, rather than the courts, arbitrates these disputes, preventing escalation. Were he actually to retire, abdicating this role, “there would be civil war,” said Konstantin Gaaze, a sociologist at the Moscow School for Social and Economic Sciences, who specializes in Russian patronage networks. Fights have already come to light. In 2017, for example, a former economy minister and member of a liberal wing of Russian politics, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, became embroiled in a feud with the powerful director of the state oil company, Igor I. Sechin. Ultimately, he was convicted of accepting a bribe of $2 million from the oil company that came in a holiday gift bag that also held homemade sausages. Mr. Ulyukayev, who is serving an eight-year sentence in a penal colony, says the charge was trumped up. The changes announced by Mr. Putin seem designed to maintain his perch as the arbiter of these disputes. They would drain power from the presidency and split it between the Parliament and a newly empowered body called the State Council, weakening the presidency before any potential successor occupies the post. Another change might safeguard Mr. Putin against foreign legal action, such as lawsuits related to the downing of a civilian airliner in Ukraine by a Russian missile in 2014, if he steps aside from the presidency. Mr. Putin suggested a measure to prohibit enforcement of treaty obligations if they violate Russia’s Constitution. Mr. Putin could take any of the proposed new positions — prime minister, head of the newly empowered State Council or leader of a majority party in Parliament — and still keep himself safe and the political system stable while ceding the presidency, said Mr. Gaaze, the sociology professor. Under a law adopted in 2001, Mr. Putin would be granted immunity from prosecution and would receive retirement pay of 580,035 rubles a month, or about $9,500, if he stepped down. On paper, he has only modest savings: an apartment, a garage, three Russian-made cars and a type of Russian camping trailer called the Scythian, according to his 2018 property declaration. Of course, his wealth has often been rumored to exceed that by tens of billions of dollars, and he is said to have built an immense villa for himself in Crimea. So rather than his material well-being, his greatest concern is likely the political overhaul. “One thing is clear: Putin has proposed a shift from the current system, which is too centered on the powers of the president, to a more complicated system of checks and balances,” Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy and opposition leader, wrote, allowing him in essence to control a successor president. On Thursday, Mr. Putin addressed a hastily convened committee drafting the constitutional amendments, shedding additional light on the plan. The changes, he said, were intended to transform Russia’s political system into one that is “more open.” Possibly hinting at his own future role, he stressed the expansion of the powers of the State Council. The committee should think carefully about its scope, he said. “This is delicate work,” he said. “We should pay careful attention to how we write into the basic law the State Council, its prerogatives and so forth. This is a very important element.” Signaling an intention to retain authority is important to dial down any succession scramble for the power Mr. Putin holds today, Mr. Belanovsky, the analyst, said of the strategy. He cited a Russian proverb: “You cannot sell the hide of a bear before it’s killed.”']","The Russian president may be leaving the presidency in 2024, but he is not about to retire. That could be dangerous for Russian stability — and himself."
"Hold the Phone, Sydney … It’s Raining.",2020-01-17,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Rural firefighters and farmers, as well as just about everyone in Australia’s largest city, rejoiced Friday at the arrival of something not seen for months: heavy downpours of that magnificent gift called rain. Thunderstorms hit Sydney and a wide swath of the surrounding area, including parts of the north coast of New South Wales that have been burning for months, with more rain expected through the weekend. “It’s a relief,” said Ray White, a group captain for volunteer fire brigades north of Sydney, where serious fires have been burning since July. “With the rain, we’ve pretty well got all the fires here contained at the moment, mate. Hopefully they’ll be looking to go out in the not too distant future.” The amount of rain varied wildly on Friday, from a few drops to more than four inches. It was not enough to end the country’s bush-fire crisis — dozens of fires farther south are still out of control. But for one gray and drenching moment, or a few hours in some places, strong rain doused the deadly flames. And the dried-out gardens. And the filthy streets. For many, the excitement could not be contained. Cows and humans jumped for joy in puddles, while others shared scenes of city life, like beads of rain on window screens, that only the fire-and-drought-tortured could see as beautiful. The soggy weather — “best day of the year,” said one sports commentator — delivered quite a jolt. Much of Sydney received more rain on Friday than it had over the past three months. A few smaller towns to the northwest welcomed more precipitation than they had seen in entire recent years. But while the downpours were greeted warmly, they also caused problems. Sydney suffered train cancellations and heavy traffic. The hardened, dry ground in more rural areas could not handle the largess, leading to flash floods in some places. In a battle of extremes, the historic wildfires made the storms more dangerous. Fire officials warned of “widow makers” — burned-out trees that collapse with precipitation. The rain also threatened the water supply in many areas as ash and debris washed off into reservoirs. At the Warragamba Dam, whose reservoir provides 80 percent of the water for Sydney, booms and filters have been set up to try to keep the contaminants from reaching treatment plants. “There are barriers floating on the water and beneath the water at significant inflow points,” said Tony Webber, a spokesman for WaterNSW. “It’s not a panacea, but it’s part of a broad response to maintain water quality.” Meteorologists and fire officials, like water officials, were quick to warn against viewing the storms as a cure for the country’s fire problem. Several large fires in Victoria “remain very active and unpredictable,” state fire officials said. In New South Wales, areas near the Snowy Mountains, where fires are still burning and smoldering, have received little if any rain. The same was true for some coastal towns. “Northern New South Wales fires have been impacted the most,” said Jonty Bruce, a spokesman for the Rural Firefighting Service. “Many of them have been put out. And as you move further down to the southern part of the state, it lessens.” “There continues to be a threat,” he added. “There’s plenty of fire on the ground.” Climate change deniers — including a federal lawmaker, Craig Kelly — still seized on the rain as evidence that people had been engaged in “climate alarmism.” On his Facebook page, Mr. Kelly noted that the government’s Bureau of Meteorology had predicted that heavy rain might not appear until March or April, after the end of summer. But scientists have long dismissed such claims, which confuse isolated weather patterns with long-term climate trends. Last year, Australia experienced its hottest and driest year on record. One day of rain does not erase decades of data predicting that Australia’s fire seasons would do exactly what they have done this year — become longer and more intense. “Weather is what we get, day to day, and this varies in the short term,” says an explanation from Australia’s Climate Council. “Climate is the long-term average of the weather patterns we experience, usually taken over 30 years or longer.” Some Australians, however, hoped that even the partisan climate debate might be dampened by the rain. Most of all, they hoped for more of the good stuff. “In the last few days, we have had very little,” said Brett Hosking, 46, a farmer in northern Victoria. “We are living on a Bureau of Meteorology promise that it will come in this Sunday.” Even in the places getting wet on Friday, the message to the heavens was clear: Keep going. “It’s not going to help the drought much, mate,” said Mr. White, the firefighter north of Sydney. “It’s just a start.

American Family Stuck in Saudi Arabia While Father Stands Trial,2020-01-16,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Five months after Saudi Arabia released a doctor with dual Saudi-American citizenship from jail, he and seven family members remain barred from leaving the kingdom while he stands trial on charges the United States contends are meritless, a son and a senior State Department official said. The Saudi authorities detained the doctor, Walid Fitaihi, during what they called an anti-corruption campaign in late 2017 and released him pending trial last summer. He has told confidantes that Saudi jailers tortured him. The authorities have confiscated his family’s passports, leaving eight dual Saudi-American citizens stuck in the kingdom, the son and the official said. “My family’s freedoms have been taken,” the son, Ahmad Fitaihi, 27, said by phone from California. While United States diplomats have worked to restore the rights of Dr. Fitaihi and his family, President Trump has never spoken publicly of his case, leaving his son wondering why he has not received the same attention from the White House as other Americans detained abroad. “President Trump has a great record in saving Americans, so why has he not saved my dad?” Ahmad Fitaihi said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has called securing the release of Americans detained abroad a “priority” and vowed on Twitter last year: “We will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home!” But not all cases appear to receive the same attention. Mr. Trump has taken pride in getting Americans released from countries such as Yemen, Turkey, Egypt and North Korea. Last month, he celebrated the release of Xiyue Wang, an American graduate student who had been imprisoned in Iran since 2016. But he has not spoken publicly about Moustafa Kassem, an American who died in Egypt this month after six years in detention and a hunger strike, nor criticized President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom he has jokingly called his “favorite dictator.” At least two dual Saudi-United States citizens are detained in Saudi Arabia in addition to Dr. Fitaihi: Salah al-Haidar, the son of a prominent women’s rights activist, and Bader al-Ibrahim, a writer and medical doctor, according to Human Rights Watch. Both were detained last April. Mr. Trump has not publicly spoken of them either, perhaps to avoid causing tension with Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Mr. Trump sees as a key partner in the Middle East. A spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on Dr. Fitaihi’s status. Saudi officials have said that the kingdom does not torture people. Dr. Fitaihi, a Harvard-trained physician, was born in Saudi Arabia but became a United States citizen while living and working in the Boston area. He returned to the kingdom around 2006, where he opened a private hospital and became a motivational speaker. He was arrested in November 2017 during a sweep of arrests that Saudi officials described as an anti-corruption campaign. But while most of the hundreds of princes, former officials and businessmen who were arrested then and locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton were released within a few months, Dr. Fitaihi was transferred to prison and held for 21 months before he was released pending trial last July. The senior State Department official said Dr. Fitaihi faces charges including obtaining United States citizenship without permission from the Saudi government and working with an organization affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamic organization that Saudi Arabia — but not the United States or other Western nations — considers a terrorist group. The senior official said that diplomats and other United States officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had raised Dr. Fitaihi’s case with a range of Saudis, so far to no avail. “We do not believe there is merit to the case,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under diplomatic protocols. He said the Saudis had presented no information that would justify Dr. Fitaihi’s incarceration or the travel ban facing him and other members of his family, which the official described as “sort-of collective punishment.” Dr. Fitaihi’s son, Ahmad, said that his mother, Lana Angawi, was born in Texas and has American citizenship, as do his six younger siblings. The family once traveled to the United States every year or so for vacation; Newport Beach was a favorite spot. Ahmad Fitaihi said a brother, Yusuf, 19, had planned to attend an American university after high school, and a sister, Mariam, 24, had planned to move to Britain, where she earned a master’s degree, to get engaged. But after their father’s arrest, security officers came to their home and seized their passports, barring them from leaving the kingdom and putting their lives on hold. Their father’s assets were also frozen, Ahmad Fitaihi said, further limiting their options. The family had initially been optimistic when their father was released, expecting that the charges against him would be dropped and that they would be able to travel. But five months later, their father has returned to work while his court case proceeds, and they all remain stuck in Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Fitaihi said. His sister opted for a smaller engagement party in the kingdom, and his brother has applied to several American universities, hoping the travel ban will be lifted by fall. “My whole family’s social and financial situation has been flipped upside down,” Mr. Fitaihi said. The next session in Dr. Fitaihi’s court case is scheduled for Feb. 2.']","The Saudi government has barred Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a dual Saudi-American citizen, and his wife and six children from leaving the kingdom while he faces charges the U.S. believes have no merit."
"Migrant Caravan Embarks From Honduras, Posing Challenge to Region",2020-01-16,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — Hundreds of Hondurans, many with hopes of reaching the United States, streamed toward the Guatemalan border on Wednesday in the kind of migrant caravan that, in 2018 and 2019, angered President Trump and posed a direct challenge to governments throughout the region. Traveling by foot and hitchhiking, the vanguard of the new caravan set off from the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula earlier in the week, with others following throughout the day on Wednesday, local media and migrants’ advocates reported. The migrants met some resistance at the Guatemalan border when Honduran police fired tear gas to repel a group seeking to cross. A spokesman for the Honduran security ministry said the group had tried to leave the country without clearing the proper migration controls, Reuters reported. President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala, who was sworn into office this week, said Wednesday that his government would honor Central American migration agreements that permitted Hondurans to enter Guatemala as long as they had proper identification. The caravan was reminiscent of the large-scale mobilizations of mostly Central American migrants that provoked the ire of Mr. Trump, who compelled his regional counterparts to step up their migration enforcement efforts by freezing American aid and threatening tariffs. Under pressure from the Trump administration, the Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — have all signed agreements with the Trump administration that require migrants who pass through one of those countries to first seek asylum there before applying in the United States.  The Guatemala deal is the only one of the three that has been put into effect, and in recent weeks, the American authorities have begun sending Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers back to Guatemala to apply for sanctuary there. Pressure from the Trump administration last year also forced Mexico to tighten its migration enforcement, leading to the deployment of thousands of Mexican security forces to help detain undocumented migrants as they traveled north. At the United States border, the Trump administration has imposed increasingly restrictive policies, including expanding a program that returns certain migrants to Mexico while their immigration cases play out in American courts. Administration officials hope the tactic further dissuades people from seeking refuge in the United States. As the latest caravan wends its way across Guatemala, Mexico will likely find itself under renewed pressure from the United States to strengthen its borders further and block the group’s passage across its territory. Mr. Giammattei, following a meeting on Wednesday with Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said Mexican officials had vowed to restrict the caravan’s movement. “The Mexican government told us that they won’t let it pass, that they will do everything in their powers to stop it from passing,” the Guatemalan president said, according to Reuters. A spokesman for Mexico’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

She Was Known in China by Her Weight: 47 Pounds. Her Death Set Off Outrage.,2020-01-15,By Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — To save money for her brother’s medical bills, the woman in a Chinese village often ate only rice and chili peppers or plain steamed buns. Years later, malnutrition wasted her body and worsened a heart problem — and she turned to the internet for help. The woman, Wu Huayan, was a 24-year-old college student, but she weighed less than 50 pounds and stood at a mere 4 feet and 5 inches, according to state news reports. She became an instant symbol of the harsh effects of poverty and hunger, and set off an outpouring of $140,000 in donations — a significant amount in rural China. Then, on Monday, Ms. Wu died in a hospital — and public sympathy quickly turned to grief and outrage.  The images of her frail, stunted body touched off a torrent of criticism that officials had failed to help the disadvantaged at a time when China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has vowed to eliminate extreme poverty. For many Chinese, Ms. Wu’s plight was a stark reminder that despite the party’s pledges and the leaps the country has made economically, poverty was still a harsh reality in parts of rural China. Some also drew a link between the tragedy and the country’s problem with official graft that eats up public resources.  “How much money do corrupt officials have to embezzle before they get caught? Hasn’t this already damaged our country and our people?” Yu Fannuo, a tech commentator, wrote on a blog. “Why is it that Wu Huayan, the girl in Guizhou, was only discovered and helped when she was on the brink of death?” Ms. Wu’s death also cast a spotlight on the widespread public skepticism and distrust of philanthropy, which is a nascent concept in China. Questions arose over how several charities handled the money that had flooded in to pay for the woman’s hospital treatment, and why only a tenth of the funds was used. In a commentary, People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, asked if the charities had exploited a tragedy for commercial gain. “At what scale is phony fund-raising and tragedy consumption happening?” the paper said.  Ms. Wu grew up in a village in the poor, heavily rural province of Guizhou, state media reported. She subsisted for several years on a meager diet to help care for her younger brother. The malnutrition caused her to lose her eyebrows and some of her hair, and made her untreated illnesses worse. She began to have trouble breathing in 2018, and was admitted to a hospital in October for heart and kidney problems.  That month, she started an appeal on Shuidichou, an online crowdfunding site, saying that medical costs that would add up to nearly $30,000 were far beyond her means. Family and friends had already made loans and she was desperate, she said. “I’m only asking for help because I have no other way out,” she wrote. “I still want to live a proper life. I still want to contribute to society and will use all my strength to fight my illness.” Her story was reported by national news outlets in October  and then widely circulated on social media. Ms. Wu said after that in a video interview  that she had received 100 calls and messages.  Speaking in a soft voice from a hospital bed and wearing fuzzy blue pajamas, she thanked her donors, saying that the support made her feel less alone.  “I feel as though I can suddenly see the sun again after being abandoned in the dark night,” she said. “I don’t know your name, where you are and what lives you are living, and I haven’t appeared in your lives before — but I want to thank you for your sacrifices for an ordinary stranger like me.”  A few charities also helped to raise money, including the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children, a private organization that is overseen by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.  The charity started a crowdfunding campaign that raised nearly $30,000 for Ms. Wu. It said it wired about $3,000 of that amount to her hospital in November. Under pressure to account for the rest of the money, the foundation said in statements that swelling in her organs had prevented Ms. Wu from undergoing surgery, and that Ms. Wu’s family had requested that the money be used for the operation and her recovery.  The foundation acknowledged the public criticism of how it handled the donations and said it was investigating the matter. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.  Ms. Wu died of heart and kidney diseases on Monday, according to an announcement posted by the school she attended, Guizhou Forerunner College. That was three months after she started her crowdfunding appeal. Philanthropy is in the early stages of development in China, and the sector has been roiled in recent years by scandals. The Red Cross Society of China, a state-run organization that is one of the country’s largest charities, was badly hit by a 2011 scandal that hurt public trust, especially in efforts that are led by the government. Concerns about transparency and accountability in philanthropy have surged alongside the popularity of crowdfunding for charitable causes.  Internet platforms created by Chinese technology giants have enabled charities and nonprofits to finance their projects, and those efforts have been met with increasing scrutiny, said Shawn Shieh, an independent expert on Chinese philanthropy and civil society. “China’s social media culture demands immediate responses to questions on funding quite often without understanding the whole story,” Mr. Shieh said. “We’re seeing the charity sector go through growing pains on how to deal with public criticism about these public cases.” Albee Zhang contributed research from Beijing.']",The woman’s struggle made her a symbol of the effects of poverty and hunger and raised questions about philanthropy and government aid.
A Japanese Politician Is Taking Paternity Leave. It’s a Big Deal.,2020-01-15,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — In a move heavy with symbolism for Japan’s workaholic fathers, Shinjiro Koizumi, a politician seen as a possible future prime minister, said on Wednesday that he would step back from his duties to care for his newborn child after the birth later this month. By the standards of other wealthy countries, Mr. Koizumi, Japan’s environment minister, will not be away from work for long. He will take a total of two weeks of paternity leave spread over three months, during which he will work flexibly from home or put in fewer hours. But in Japan, where fathers who take time off after a birth are rare, word of Mr. Koizumi’s intentions swept social media and drew praise from supporters as setting a powerful example. “I hope my taking paternity leave will lead the way of working styles to one where everyone can easily take child-care leave without hesitation in the environment ministry,” Mr. Koizumi, 38, said in a meeting with his staff on Wednesday. In Japan, men are generally expected to demonstrate total loyalty to their employers, often at their families’ expense. The announcement from Mr. Koizumi, whose father, Junichiro Koizumi, was one of Japan’s most popular modern prime ministers, raised hopes that those expectations could begin to change.  “It’s a good precedent, and it’s about time that this kind of thing becomes more normal,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. Mr. Nakano acknowledged that even with Mr. Koizumi’s leadership, other men might still face obstacles to taking time off for child care.  “Someone as privileged as Koizumi still struggled to get this paternity leave,” Mr. Nakano said, referring to a conservative backlash that arose as Mr. Koizumi publicly pondered the move. “So how hard must it be for other people in other lines of professions? But it has to start somewhere.” On paper, Japan has exceptionally generous paternity leave laws. According to a ranking by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan and South Korea grant fathers more time off for child care than any of the world’s other wealthy countries, including the Scandinavian nations. Japanese fathers are entitled to take up to a year off after the birth of a child — the same right granted to mothers. Yet very few men take advantage of these policies. According to government statistics, just over 6 percent of eligible men working for private companies took parental leave in 2018, compared with more than 82 percent of mothers. Men who work in the government are more likely to do so: Among public employees, about 21 percent of eligible men took parental leave last year, compared with nearly all mothers in government employment. The role of fathers in Japanese families has been the focus of growing attention as the number of babies born in the country has fallen to the lowest level since the 19th century, with some analysts attributing the low birthrate in part to the burdens on working mothers. Over all, women in Japan still take on the vast majority of the responsibility for child care. Yumiko Murakami, head of the Tokyo Center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, suggested that if more fathers followed Mr. Koizumi’s example, mothers might get some relief from the burdens of parenting and be willing to have more children. “If fathers take leave and help their wives with babies, maybe wives will have more support at home and they might decide to go for No. 2 or No. 3,” Ms. Murakami said. “So let’s hope this is a good sign that things are starting to change in Japan, slowly but surely.” In the private sector, those few fathers who do exercise their right to paternity leave take, on average, less than five days.  Mr. Koizumi’s leave, at two weeks, will not amount to much more.  Some fathers who tried to take paternity leave have accused their employers of discrimination. Last year, two men who took time off after the birth of their children sued their employers, saying the companies demoted them or cut their pay to punish them after they returned. One of them, Glen Wood, an American who sued his former employer, the investment bank Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, applauded Mr. Koizumi, particularly given his lineage as a fourth-generation conservative politician. Mr. Koizumi’s father did not take paternity leave when his children were born. “I think it really points in the right direction for the country and for corporations,” said Mr. Wood, who alleges that he was demoted and eventually fired because he took paternity leave. Mr. Wood cautioned that the country “loves window dressing and they love symbolism.” But, he added, “knowing Japan and knowing its very long history and knowing how slowly things change, I still think that the movement that we started here regarding the focus on paternity leave really has legs.” Mr. Koizumi set off a media frenzy last summer when he announced that he had wed his pregnant girlfriend, Christel Takigawa, 42, a celebrity television presenter, and said he was considering taking paternity leave. After criticism from some conservative lawmakers, Mr. Koizumi watered down his plans, saying that his work might prevent him from taking leave. And after his announcement on Wednesday, some critics questioned his commitment to his job. “Koizumi’s an environment minister, right? A novice taking paternity leave,” wrote a commenter on Twitter. “Well, whatever, but does he really love his work?” Female lawmakers, who make up less than 14 percent of Japan’s Parliament, have struggled to combine politics with child rearing. After Megumi Kaneko, a lawmaker in the lower house, gave birth to a son in 2016, she took a brief maternity leave, then was criticized for using a government car to drop her son off at day care. (Her husband, also a lawmaker, said he planned to take paternity leave, but he resigned days after their son was born, after news leaked that he had had an extramarital affair.) When Takako Suzuki, another member of the lower house, announced her pregnancy in 2017, critics said she was not acting like a responsible lawmaker. But the example of a male cabinet minister might carry more weight in patriarchal Japan, supporters said. “We need an achievement like this, ‘a male minister taking paternity leave,’” wrote one commenter on Twitter who described herself as the mother of three children. “It means a lot just to be able to destroy an excuse like ‘it’s not easy for men to take leave (because they tend to be in more important positions than women.)’” On his blog, Mr. Koizumi discussed his initial hesitation to take leave because of his duties as environment minister. And he acknowledged that it would take more than one celebrity politician to change an entrenched culture. “There are men who are going through similar difficulties. They want to take the leave, but it’s hard,” he wrote.  “Child-care leave will not be prevalent,” he added, “unless we change not only the system, but the atmosphere as well.” Eimi Yamamitsu, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a popular ex-prime minister, was praised for setting an example for Japan’s workaholic fathers."
Welcoming Winter’s Cold Embrace,2020-01-17,By Ian Austen,"['As I mentioned in last week’s Canada letter, the terrible aftermath of the missile strike on Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took me to Edmonton as it was reeling from the loss of 27 residents. Despite their shock and grief, those who knew the victims and the members of the city’s Iranian community received me with an exceptional graciousness and generosity. [Read: Plane Crash Leaves Iranian Diaspora in Canada Grief-Stricken] After I finished my article (for those of you reading it now: it was published before Iran admitted that its missiles brought down the airliner), I went for an evening run in the expansive river valley that is Edmonton’s defining geographic feature. It was the start of a cold spell that this week caused a rail to crack on Edmonton’s transit system, brought a general chill to the prairies and delivered significant, and unaccustomed, snowfall to southern British Columbia. There was already a fair amount of snow in Edmonton. So heading out of the hotel, I was a bit concerned about whether the trails down in the valley would be passable. But that worry lifted when I came to the dramatic stairway next to the relatively new funicular that runs down to the valley. All of its 156 steps had been thoroughly cleared of snow and ice. Ottawa, where I live, doesn’t even try to clear many outdoor stairways with as few as a half dozen steps and simply chains them off for the winter. Down in the river valley, every path — and there are many — had been plowed. Again, that’s novel to someone from Ottawa. None of what I found was random. For the past eight years or so, Edmonton has been rolling out an official strategy to encourage its residents to embrace winter rather than hibernate. This week, I spoke with Isla Tanaka who is Edmonton’s “winter city planner,” a post she believes no one else holds in the country. Like several other Canadian communities, she told me, Edmonton was part of a winter cities movement during the 1980s that fizzled out with few achievements. In 2012, Ben Henderson, a city councilor who came from Edmonton’s vibrant theater community, began pushing for a renewed effort and headed off on a winter tour of Scandinavian cities to see how they approach the season. A key takeaway, Ms. Tanaka said, was “that you have to remind people every year that winter can be fun.” A citizens’ group tasked with developing the city’s official winter strategy came up with 64 programs to roll out over a decade. They span a wide range. Some of them involve thinking about using color to make public spaces more appealing during the darkest period of winter. Ms. Tanaka and her colleagues work with restaurants on designing outdoor patios that can be open year-round (at least two were serving outside during this week’s deep freeze). New facilities with washrooms down in the river valley that don’t have to be shuttered in winter are opening. And the city now considers things like shelter from the winter winds when placing skating rinks and toboggan hills. “If we don’t design these spaces to be comfortable in the winter, people won’t go outside,” Ms. Tanaka said. That’s particularly an issue in the city’s downtown, where the outdoors competes with a heated, indoor “pedway” network linking most buildings. Ms. Tanaka said that Edmonton found that consistency was the key to encouraging winter cycling. If cycling routes and paths aren’t cleared promptly and regularly after every snowfall, she said, riders quickly put their bikes away for the winter. For Ms. Tanaka, the biggest surprise has been the public’s embrace of winter. She and others initially thought that winter would be a hard sell. “But that came really, really fast,” she said. “Maybe people were ready to be outside.” While other cities, of course, have many programs to encourage citizens to get outdoors in the winter, Ms. Tanaka said that she is not aware of any with as comprehensive a plan as Edmonton’s. And increasingly, she’s hearing from other cities looking for winter advice. Winnipeg, Ottawa and neighboring Gatineau, Saskatoon and, above all, Quebec City all hold winter carnivals with a variety of events. And they all have, as do other cities, season-long outdoor winter activities, even if they don’t follow Edmonton’s comprehensive approach. The Times’s Travel section this week features a tour of some of Quebec’s skating trails by Elaine Glusac. [Read: Where Trails Are for Skating, Not Hiking] Here in Ottawa, where plans often get fragmented between two municipalities in two provinces and the federal government’s National Capital Commission, volunteers have driven some of the recent efforts to get more people out in winter. In particular, Dave Adams, a cross country skier, began grooming a trail for his sport along the Ottawa River in a more or less solo effort. Now in its fourth year, the trail has become almost as much of an institution as skating on the Rideau Canal. Two more volunteer-based trails will appear elsewhere in the city this year. Looming over all of this, of course, is climate change and erratic weather. Last winter, it was often too cold for comfortable skating on the canal in Ottawa. This year, a series of thaws means that the ice still isn’t thick enough for its opening. But for now, at least, much of Canada is a wintry place. Edmonton’s recognition of that reality is one of its strengths. While it was somewhat overshadowed by the national grieving over the deaths in Iran, Canada was also in the news internationally for being the future part-time home of Prince Harry and Meghan, his wife. Dan Bilefsky took the national temperature on that news while I looked into the practical considerations facing the couple, who are formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Mark Landler, our London-based colleague, reports that “Megxit” is almost as divisive as Brexit in Britain. Michael McCain, the chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods, took to Twitter with his anger and frustration over what he saw as President Trump’s role in the airliner missile strike in Iran.

Down in the river valley, every path — and there are many — had been plowed. Again, that’s novel to someone from Ottawa. None of what I found was random. For the past eight years or so, Edmonton has been rolling out an official strategy to encourage its residents to embrace winter rather than hibernate. This week, I spoke with Isla Tanaka who is Edmonton’s “winter city planner,” a post she believes no one else holds in the country. Like several other Canadian communities, she told me, Edmonton was part of a winter cities movement during the 1980s that fizzled out with few achievements. In 2012, Ben Henderson, a city councilor who came from Edmonton’s vibrant theater community, began pushing for a renewed effort and headed off on a winter tour of Scandinavian cities to see how they approach the season. A key takeaway, Ms. Tanaka said, was “that you have to remind people every year that winter can be fun.” A citizens’ group tasked with developing the city’s official winter strategy came up with 64 programs to roll out over a decade. They span a wide range. Some of them involve thinking about using color to make public spaces more appealing during the darkest period of winter. Ms. Tanaka and her colleagues work with restaurants on designing outdoor patios that can be open year-round (at least two were serving outside during this week’s deep freeze). New facilities with washrooms down in the river valley that don’t have to be shuttered in winter are opening. And the city now considers things like shelter from the winter winds when placing skating rinks and toboggan hills. “If we don’t design these spaces to be comfortable in the winter, people won’t go outside,” Ms. Tanaka said. That’s particularly an issue in the city’s downtown, where the outdoors competes with a heated, indoor “pedway” network linking most buildings. Ms. Tanaka said that Edmonton found that consistency was the key to encouraging winter cycling. If cycling routes and paths aren’t cleared promptly and regularly after every snowfall, she said, riders quickly put their bikes away for the winter. For Ms. Tanaka, the biggest surprise has been the public’s embrace of winter. She and others initially thought that winter would be a hard sell. “But that came really, really fast,” she said. “Maybe people were ready to be outside.” While other cities, of course, have many programs to encourage citizens to get outdoors in the winter, Ms. Tanaka said that she is not aware of any with as comprehensive a plan as Edmonton’s. And increasingly, she’s hearing from other cities looking for winter advice. Winnipeg, Ottawa and neighboring Gatineau, Saskatoon and, above all, Quebec City all hold winter carnivals with a variety of events. And they all have, as do other cities, season-long outdoor winter activities, even if they don’t follow Edmonton’s comprehensive approach. The Times’s Travel section this week features a tour of some of Quebec’s skating trails by Elaine Glusac. [Read: Where Trails Are for Skating, Not Hiking] Here in Ottawa, where plans often get fragmented between two municipalities in two provinces and the federal government’s National Capital Commission, volunteers have driven some of the recent efforts to get more people out in winter. In particular, Dave Adams, a cross country skier, began grooming a trail for his sport along the Ottawa River in a more or less solo effort. Now in its fourth year, the trail has become almost as much of an institution as skating on the Rideau Canal. Two more volunteer-based trails will appear elsewhere in the city this year. Looming over all of this, of course, is climate change and erratic weather. Last winter, it was often too cold for comfortable skating on the canal in Ottawa. This year, a series of thaws means that the ice still isn’t thick enough for its opening. But for now, at least, much of Canada is a wintry place. Edmonton’s recognition of that reality is one of its strengths. While it was somewhat overshadowed by the national grieving over the deaths in Iran, Canada was also in the news internationally for being the future part-time home of Prince Harry and Meghan, his wife. Dan Bilefsky took the national temperature on that news while I looked into the practical considerations facing the couple, who are formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Mark Landler, our London-based colleague, reports that “Megxit” is almost as divisive as Brexit in Britain. Michael McCain, the chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods, took to Twitter with his anger and frustration over what he saw as President Trump’s role in the airliner missile strike in Iran.

Why Europe Is Finally Paying Attention to Libya,2020-01-17,By Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — For more than eight years, the Libyan conflict has festered and the European Union has mostly looked away. Libya mattered, if at all, as a playground for terrorism and a source of the migrants disrupting European politics. But with the recent involvement of Russia and Turkey on opposite sides of a nasty civil war, adding to the meddling of other neighbors, Europe has suddenly woken to the implications of a new Great Game, this time in North Africa, that is rapidly destabilizing its backyard. Belatedly, the Continent is paying attention. On Sunday, after months of effort, Germany and the United Nations will gather most of the main actors to try to at least bring a sustained halt to the fighting and get outside powers to give Libyans the space to attempt to find some kind of political reconciliation. It will not be easy, as potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying. Increasingly, the fate of Libya’s precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance. “There has been a major reawakening of geopolitical interest in Libya,” said Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund and an expert on Turkey and the Mediterranean. “That begins with issues of migration, energy, security and counterterrorism,” he added. “But it is just as much about the geopolitics of relations with Russia and Turkey. If they had not been so assertive, Libya would not have attracted such attention now.” The new European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel that the bloc could even send troops to safeguard a potential cease-fire, a move that Italy and Greece have already suggested they would be interested in committing troops to. “If there is a cease-fire in Libya, then the E.U. must be prepared to help implement and monitor this cease-fire — possibly also with soldiers, for example as part of an E.U. mission,” he said. But Europe looks weak and peripheral. Kristina Kausch, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said, “Now the Europeans are worried, but it’s too late and we’re out of the picture.” “Russia and regional powers are playing Europe in our own neighborhood,” she added. The Libyan mess began with the 2011 overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi after intervention by European forces, with American help. Justified on humanitarian grounds, the war produced chaos when those same Western forces largely abandoned energy-rich Libya to warring militias. Many weapons of the old regime spread all over the sub-Saharan region, feeding other militants and terrorist groups, and producing thousands of refugees and migrants seeking safety in Europe. Libya remains a major transit and jumping-off point for sub-Saharan Africans hoping to make the crossing to Europe. Since the migration crisis of 2015-16, “the E.U. viewed Libya mainly through the prism of the migration problem,” said Claudia Gazzini, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Individual European countries, at the same time, pursued their own, divergent interests in Libya, often at cross-purposes. But the entry of Russian proxies into the conflict last year and, more recently, Turkey’s pledge to send its own forces into the mix, meant Europe could no longer ignore the matter. It has also made the fissures in the Europeans’ approach to Libya more and more untenable as the civil war turns into a wider playground for outsiders. On one side, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France and now Russia support Khalifa Hifter, whose forces have laid siege to Tripoli, the capital, threatening the internationally backed government there. On the other, Qatar, Italy and now Turkey support the Government of National Accord. Created by a 2015 United Nations-sponsored political deal, the government is led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The divisions between France and Italy have already split the European Union and weakened its positioning on Libya. As the European Union’s top diplomat, Mr. Borrell has brought new thinking and “a renewed energy and willingness to look at Libya as a crisis and a war in and of itself,” said Ms. Gazzini of the International Crisis Group. In the last month, Mr. Borrell has repeatedly emphasized the dangers of Turkish military involvement in Libya and has criticized Europe’s preference for citing international law as a response to every conflict. “We Europeans, since we don’t want to participate in a military solution, we barricade ourselves in the belief there is no military solution,” he told the European Parliament this week. “Nobody will be very happy if, on the Libyan coast, there is a ring of military bases from the Russian and Turkish navies in front of the Italian coast.” He added in a Twitter message: “But this is something that could very much happen. We need to engage strongly, keep Libya united and find a peaceful solution to this conflict.” That will not be so easily done. Just last week, Russia and Turkey brought both Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj to Moscow to get them to sign a permanent cease-fire agreement, another sign of Russian diplomatic activity to fill vacuums created by Europe and the United States. But Mr. Hifter, who believes he can still take Tripoli, refused to obey his Russian backers and left Moscow without signing. Some believe that he will agree to do so on Sunday in Berlin, and that his signature, sincere or not, will be a kind of gesture from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The Trump administration, which had supported the Sarraj government and the United Nations process, reversed course last April, after a meeting with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to the International Crisis Group. But Washington is not very involved, and has just announced that it will sharply reduce the United States military presence in West Africa, intended to fight terrorism alongside the French, so the American influence will be further eroded. A senior State Department official said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who altered his schedule to attend the high-level meeting, would urge three things: the continuation of a cease-fire; the withdrawal of all external forces; and a return to a Libyan-led political process facilitated by the United Nations. But as with the European Union, there would appear to be little force behind those goals, and the messaging has stopped short of expressing support for the government of Mr. Sarraj. Historical alliances in Libya and interest in gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean are at the heart of the problem, and have raised the stakes for the outside parties. Migration aside, Italy, the former colonial power, and its energy giant, Eni, are key players in Libya. So stability matters for Rome, and the government has also tried to mediate between Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj. But with the trend of the fighting moving Mr. Hifter’s way, and Eni shifting to more commercial interests in the eastern Mediterranean, the Italian position has become more ambiguous. “Russian influence started first and foremost on gas and oil infrastructure,” said Tarek Megerisi of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If a situation unfolds whereby Russia and Turkey make peace, and Russia makes heavy investments in oil and gas infrastructure in Libya, that means that’s one more pipeline into Europe that’s in the hands of Russians,” he added. “That’s quite dangerous.” For other Mediterranean neighbors, Greece and Cyprus, who stand to gain if gas exploration yields commercially viable finds, Libya is crucial. Despite the cacophony, the meeting in Berlin, if modestly successful, could begin turning the tide for European involvement in Libya, and ultimately for Libya itself, Mr. Megerisi said. “It’s not that Europe is incapable, it seems that it’s unwilling,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be that way. They do have tools at their disposal. They do have some cards to play.” Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jason Horowitz and Emma Bubola from Rome.']","As potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying over Libya and the fate of its precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance, the Continent is suddenly getting involved."
American Family Stuck in Saudi Arabia While Father Stands Trial,2020-01-16,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Five months after Saudi Arabia released a doctor with dual Saudi-American citizenship from jail, he and seven family members remain barred from leaving the kingdom while he stands trial on charges the United States contends are meritless, a son and a senior State Department official said. The Saudi authorities detained the doctor, Walid Fitaihi, during what they called an anti-corruption campaign in late 2017 and released him pending trial last summer. He has told confidantes that Saudi jailers tortured him. The authorities have confiscated his family’s passports, leaving eight dual Saudi-American citizens stuck in the kingdom, the son and the official said. “My family’s freedoms have been taken,” the son, Ahmad Fitaihi, 27, said by phone from California. While United States diplomats have worked to restore the rights of Dr. Fitaihi and his family, President Trump has never spoken publicly of his case, leaving his son wondering why he has not received the same attention from the White House as other Americans detained abroad. “President Trump has a great record in saving Americans, so why has he not saved my dad?” Ahmad Fitaihi said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has called securing the release of Americans detained abroad a “priority” and vowed on Twitter last year: “We will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home!” But not all cases appear to receive the same attention. Mr. Trump has taken pride in getting Americans released from countries such as Yemen, Turkey, Egypt and North Korea. Last month, he celebrated the release of Xiyue Wang, an American graduate student who had been imprisoned in Iran since 2016. But he has not spoken publicly about Moustafa Kassem, an American who died in Egypt this month after six years in detention and a hunger strike, nor criticized President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom he has jokingly called his “favorite dictator.” At least two dual Saudi-United States citizens are detained in Saudi Arabia in addition to Dr. Fitaihi: Salah al-Haidar, the son of a prominent women’s rights activist, and Bader al-Ibrahim, a writer and medical doctor, according to Human Rights Watch. Both were detained last April. Mr. Trump has not publicly spoken of them either, perhaps to avoid causing tension with Saudi Arabia and its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Mr. Trump sees as a key partner in the Middle East. A spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on Dr. Fitaihi’s status. Saudi officials have said that the kingdom does not torture people. Dr. Fitaihi, a Harvard-trained physician, was born in Saudi Arabia but became a United States citizen while living and working in the Boston area. He returned to the kingdom around 2006, where he opened a private hospital and became a motivational speaker. He was arrested in November 2017 during a sweep of arrests that Saudi officials described as an anti-corruption campaign. But while most of the hundreds of princes, former officials and businessmen who were arrested then and locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton were released within a few months, Dr. Fitaihi was transferred to prison and held for 21 months before he was released pending trial last July. The senior State Department official said Dr. Fitaihi faces charges including obtaining United States citizenship without permission from the Saudi government and working with an organization affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamic organization that Saudi Arabia — but not the United States or other Western nations — considers a terrorist group. The senior official said that diplomats and other United States officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had raised Dr. Fitaihi’s case with a range of Saudis, so far to no avail. “We do not believe there is merit to the case,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under diplomatic protocols. He said the Saudis had presented no information that would justify Dr. Fitaihi’s incarceration or the travel ban facing him and other members of his family, which the official described as “sort-of collective punishment.” Dr. Fitaihi’s son, Ahmad, said that his mother, Lana Angawi, was born in Texas and has American citizenship, as do his six younger siblings. The family once traveled to the United States every year or so for vacation; Newport Beach was a favorite spot. Ahmad Fitaihi said a brother, Yusuf, 19, had planned to attend an American university after high school, and a sister, Mariam, 24, had planned to move to Britain, where she earned a master’s degree, to get engaged. But after their father’s arrest, security officers came to their home and seized their passports, barring them from leaving the kingdom and putting their lives on hold. Their father’s assets were also frozen, Ahmad Fitaihi said, further limiting their options. The family had initially been optimistic when their father was released, expecting that the charges against him would be dropped and that they would be able to travel. But five months later, their father has returned to work while his court case proceeds, and they all remain stuck in Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Fitaihi said. His sister opted for a smaller engagement party in the kingdom, and his brother has applied to several American universities, hoping the travel ban will be lifted by fall. “My whole family’s social and financial situation has been flipped upside down,” Mr. Fitaihi said. The next session in Dr. Fitaihi’s court case is scheduled for Feb. 2.']","The Saudi government has barred Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a dual Saudi-American citizen, and his wife and six children from leaving the kingdom while he faces charges the U.S. believes have no merit."
"Taal Volcano Eases, but Philippines Worries Worst Is to Come",2020-01-15,"By Jason Gutierrez, Hannah Beech and Jes Aznar","['BALETE, Philippines — Taal Volcano’s eruptions have eased in the past 24 hours, scientists said on Wednesday, but they warned that the picturesque mountain was still threatening hundreds of thousands of people just 40 miles south of Manila. Renato Solidum, Jr., who leads the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, said that Taal’s calm could be deceptive. “What we’re saying is that it was generally weaker compared with yesterday,” Mr. Solidum said, adding that it was “hard to tell” if the mountain was also easing its rumbling. Taal, the Philippines’ second-most-active volcano, surprised even volcanologists when it suddenly erupted on Sunday. Within hours, the volcano on an island in the middle of a lake shot a plume of ash a mile high and triggered multiple earthquakes. The new year dawned in the Philippines with one grim expectation: Somewhere at some point, the archipelago nation would be battered by a natural disaster, probably more than one. Whether it be typhoons, earthquakes, mudslides, tsunamis, volcanoes, droughts, or floods, the Philippines has been victimized by them all. Taal’s eruptions were a reminder that the country of 105 million is perched on the Pacific Ocean’s ring of fire, where seismic activity is at its most ferocious. Mr. Solidum said that Taal remained on the fourth of a five-step alert level, meaning that a hazardous explosive eruption was possible within hours or days. The earthquakes that followed the earlier eruption have caused large fissures in the ground, proving the volcano’s intense energy and hinting at an imminent explosion, Mr. Solidum said. Residents on the island, as well as those in provinces within a 14-kilometer (or 8.6-mile) danger zone, have been ordered to evacuate. Classes in some parts of Manila and in the surrounding provinces have been suspended since Monday. Emergency crews have managed to restore power and electricity to some areas, though a large part of the region still remained in the dark. But living with the continual threat of a natural calamity has inured some people to the danger, even as communities gathered together to tend to the 50,000 people from the provinces of Cavite and Batangas who have been sent to 200 evacuation camps.  Ignoring orders to stay away, some residents ventured back to their destroyed homes to salvage whatever they could — horses, electronics and photographs — from the thick mud before the Coast Guard began preventing people from returning.  On Tuesday night, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana warned against breaking the Coast Guard cordon and recommended that the island, with its sulfuric sludge, be declared a “no man’s land.” “Let’s not allow anyone to return there because if there will be another, more violent explosion, all the people there will perish,” he said. President Rodrigo Duterte visited affected areas on Tuesday but did not say whether he would declare the island a no-go zone. He ordered officials to speed up the delivery of basic services to displaced populations, even as he chose the occasion to criticize Batangas for supposedly having become a drug haven. Mr. Duterte has unleashed a so-called war on drugs that has resulted in the killing of thousands of people in what rights groups say is a campaign of extrajudicial slaughter.  Nature is also deadly. From 1997 to 2016, 23,000 people in the Philippines died from natural hazards, the Asian Development Bank estimated, with 6.8 million affected each year on average. Climate change, poverty and environmental degradation worsen their plight. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted north of Manila, the second-largest eruption of the century. A passing typhoon turned Pinatubo’s ash and lava flows into a deadly exodus of mud. At least 800 people were killed, even though tens of thousands of others had been evacuated earlier when the mountain began belching lava and ash. That same year, Tropical Storm Thelma left 6,000 people dead or missing. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan raged across the central Philippines, devastating the city of Tacloban and leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing. The characteristic resilience with which the Philippines faces natural disaster meant little to Jesus Habal, 67, who sat in a corner of an emergency shelter in Santo Domingo town, mourning his family’s ancestral home in Talisay town, in the shadow of Taal Volcano. Mr. Habal described the huge boom and torrent of ash as “one of the scariest episodes of my life.”  With a cane and the help of his granddaughter, Mr. Habal made it out. It’s unlikely he will be going back anytime soon. ']","The potential threat alarms a country that is no stranger to natural disasters like typhoons, earthquakes, mudslides, tsunamis and floods. "

"Reducing Fire, and Cutting Carbon Emissions, the Aboriginal Way",2020-01-16,By Thomas Fuller and Matthew Abbott,"['COOINDA, Australia — At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match. In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year — literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional Aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.  Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on Aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country’s cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40 percent. These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana. “Fire is our main tool,” Ms. Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. “It’s part of protecting the land.” The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe. “The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having Indigenous people look after their lands,” said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. “Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science.” In some ways, the Aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.  But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.  Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country’s thinly populated north, where Aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents’ concerns about the health effects of smoke.  The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces, and the distinctive seasons — a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains — make burning more predictable.  Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the Aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country. “We most certainly should learn to burn Aboriginal-style,” said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. “Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what Aboriginal people could do.” Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals. The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern Aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry. “We don’t have a fear of fire,” said Mr. Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. “We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have.” This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in Aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas. NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of Ping-Pong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.  Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is longstanding: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of Aboriginal methods. “I have many friends in other parts of Australia who can’t get their heads around that fire is a useful tool, that not all fire is the same and that you can manage it,” said Andrew Edwards, a fire expert at Charles Darwin University in northern Australia. “It’s hard to get across to people that fire is not a bad thing.” Nine years ago, Mr. Gammage published a book that changed the way many in Australia thought about the Australian countryside and how it has been managed since the arrival of Europeans in the late 18th century. The book, “The Biggest Estate on Earth,” uses documents from the earliest settlers and explorers to show how the landscape had been systematically shaped by Aboriginal fire techniques.  Many forests were thinner than those that exist now and were more resistant to hot-burning fires. Early explorers described the landscape as a series of gardens, and they reported seeing near constant trails of smoke from small fires across the landscape. As Europeans took control of the country, they banned burning. Jeremy Russell-Smith, a bushfire expert at Charles Darwin University, said this quashing of traditional fire techniques happened not only in Australia, but also in North and South America, Asia and Africa. “The European mind-set was to be totally scared of fire,” Mr. Russell-Smith said.  As the fires rage in the south, Aboriginal people in northern Australia say they are deeply saddened at the loss of life — about 25 people have been killed and more than 2,000 homes destroyed. But they also express bewilderment that forests were allowed to grow to become so combustible. Margaret Rawlinson, the daughter of Ms. Lawson, who does preventive burning on her property in the far north, remembers traveling a decade ago to the countryside south of Sydney and being alarmed at fields of long, desiccated grass.  “I was terrified,” Ms. Rawlinson said. “I couldn’t sleep. I said, ‘We need to go home. This place is going to go up, and it’s going to be a catastrophe.’” The area that she visited, around the town of Nowra, has been a focal point for fires over the past few weeks. The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and ’90s when Aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government. Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings. “The land was out of control,” said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose Indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions. The Aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and the Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions. According to calculations by Mr. Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57 percent fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started. Mr. Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 Aboriginal rangers, part time and full time. “We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices,” Mr. Yibarbuk said. “There’s a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference.”']","As blazes rage in southern Australia, Indigenous fire-prevention techniques that have sharply cut destructive bushfires in the north are drawing new attention."
The American Mustache Ruffling Feathers in South Korea,2020-01-16,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[""SEOUL, South Korea — At a time of growing unease in the alliance between the United States and South Korea, a hairy diplomatic issue has surfaced: the American ambassador’s mustache, which has become an object of ridicule and resentment among many South Koreans. On Thursday, the envoy, Harry B. Harris Jr. — a retired Navy admiral who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American Navy officer — defended his mustache in the face of some sentiment that it was a reminder of Japan’s brutal colonial rule over South Korea.  South Koreans hold a long-running animosity toward Japan\u200b because of that period, and many recall that Japanese governors-general \u200bwho ruled Korea\u200b from 1910 to 1945 wore mustaches\u200b. “My mustache, for some reason, has become a point of some fascination here,” Mr. Harris, 63, told foreign news reporters in Seoul on Thursday. “I have been criticized in the media here, especially in social media, because of my ethnic background, because I am a Japanese-American.” Mr. Harris, who became ambassador to Seoul in July 2018, said his decision to grow a mustache had nothing to do with his Japanese heritage. Clean-shaven for \u200b\u200bmost of \u200bthe time he served in the Navy, he said he had \u200bbegun growing a mustache \u200bto mark his retirement.  When his appointment was announced, many South Koreans considered it a slight to their national pride for President Trump to have chosen a Japanese-American as the top United States envoy to their country. And one of the first questions Mr. Harris was asked upon \u200blanding in South Korea was about his mustache\u200b, with some South Koreans apparently wondering whether it was a calculated insult\u200b to Koreans.  “Harris’s mother is Japanese. \u200bIt feels like that alone is enough for us to dislike him\u200b,” wrote one internet blogger last month\u200b. \u200b“Which side will he choose if he is asked to choose between South Korea and Japan?” Mr. Harris’s appointment to Seoul also came as South Korea’s relations with Japan were at a low point over disputes rooted in Japan’s colonial rule. It occurred at a time when Mr. Trump was demanding a fivefold increase in South Korea’s annual contribution to covering the cost of maintaining 28,500 American troops on the Korean Peninsula.  Since taking up his ambassador’s post, Mr. Harris has tirelessly pushed for the Trump administration’s demand over the American troops on Korean soil. He has also channeled Washington’s pressure on South Korea to\u200b retract its decision to abandon a military intelligence-sharing deal with Japan that American officials considered important in guarding against China and North Korea. On Thursday, Mr. Harris suggested that Washington be consulted when South Korea pursues new exchanges with North Korea — including the possibility of allowing its tourists to visit, which President Moon Jae-in raised this week — to ensure that no sanctions are violated in the process. Such comments have helped to give Mr. Harris the image of an overbearing American envoy \u200bamong many South Koreans.  Asked Friday about the ambassador's remarks on inter-Korean exchanges, a government spokesman, Lee Sang-min, said South Korea’s policy toward the North was “a matter of its sovereignty.” Senior members of the governing party accused Mr. Harris of “meddling in domestic affairs” and even “acting like a governor-general.” But behind \u200bmany South Koreans’ misgivings about the ambassador are issues with his ethnicity.  It didn’t take long for Mr. Harris to realize how \u200beven \u200ba little facial hair on an American diplomat with his ethnic background could \u200bstir Koreans’ deep-seated \u200bsentiments against Japan\u200b. South Koreans’ attack on Mr. Harris turned more personal. Local news outlets scrutinized every comment and Twitter post by Mr. Harris. “The mustache has become associated with the latest U.S. image of being disrespectful and even coercive toward Korea,” The Korea Times said. “Harris often has been ridiculed for not being an ambassador, but a governor general.” In a protest rally in downtown Seoul last month, young nationalist activists vented their anger by plucking mock mustache hair from a large photo of Mr. Harris. “To those people, I say that you are cherry-picking history,” Mr. Harris said\u200b on Thursday\u200b, noting that growing a mustache was popular not only in the West, but also in Asia in the early 20th century, even among Korean leaders who fought for liberation from Japan.  \u200bIn an interview with The Korea Times\u200b last month\u200b, Mr. Harris noted that throughout his career, his ethnic background had come into play \u200bonly \u200btwice — by the Chinese and now by South Koreans\u200b. When he was head of the United States Pacific Command, he was outspoken about China’s aggressive moves in the East and South China Seas, and China’s state-run news media \u200boften cited his ethnic background when attacking him. \u200b \u200bIn October, the South Korean police arrested more than a dozen student activists who broke into Mr. Harris’s residence to protest Washington’s demand for an increase in defense burden-sharing. The students held placards demanding that the ambassador leave South Korea. “I understand the historical animosity that exists between both of the nations,” Mr. Harris said on Thursday\u200b, referring to Japan and South Korea, the United States’ two most important — and often-squabbling — allies in northeast Asia\u200b.  “But I am not the Japanese-American ambassador to Korea — I am the American ambassador to Korea,” he said. “To take that history and put it on me simply because of accident of birth, I think, is a mistake.” He has also said he has no plans to remove the mustache. \u200b""]","The facial hair of Ambassador Harry B. Harris Jr., who is Japanese-American, reminds many South Koreans of Japan’s colonial rule. "
7 Found Dead and 15 in Captivity at Religious Sect in Panama,2020-01-16,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — The bodies of six children and a pregnant woman were found in a freshly dug grave in a remote, predominantly indigenous community on the Caribbean coast of Panama, possibly the sacrificial victims of a ritual performed by a religious sect, the Panamanian authorities said Thursday. The victims had been kidnapped from their homes by other members of the community, beaten and killed, said Rafael Baloyes, the chief prosecutor for the province of Bocas del Toro. The woman was the mother of five of the children; the sixth child was a neighbor, Mr. Baloyes said. The children ranged in age from 1 to 17. The authorities raided the community, Alto Terrón, on Wednesday after receiving a tip that people were being abused there, the prosecutor said, adding that officials saw a post on social media about someone being burned. On their arrival, the police interrupted a haunting religious ritual unfolding inside a makeshift church. “There were people held against their will, being mistreated,” Mr. Baloyes recalled. One of those detained was a nude woman. The captives, who had been tied up and beaten, were going to be killed “if they did not repent their sins,” he said. Fifteen people were rescued from captivity, officials said. Ten suspects — nine adults and one minor — were arrested and placed under investigation on charges of deprivation of liberty, homicide and sexual abuse, officials said. One of the suspects was the grandfather of the children whose bodies were found in the grave. The authorities also seized machetes “and other tools” that were presumably used against the victims, according to a statement from the Public Ministry of Panama. The suspects are members of an evangelical church called the New Light of God, officials said. Interviews with community members revealed that the sect began practicing rituals more than three months ago, Mr. Baloyes said, though the kidnapping and torture started only last Saturday, when a sect member claimed to have received a message from God. Investigators have found no evidence of other victims or secret graves, the prosecutor added. All the victims and suspects were residents of Alto Terrón, a community in Ngäbe Buglé, an indigenous administrative region with high rates of poverty. Officials said the community was located on a densely forested peninsula in western Panama, between the Caribbean Sea and the Chiriquí Lagoon.

Members of the sect, like those killed and kidnapped, are from a remote indigenous community on the Caribbean coast."
Ukraine Investigates Trump Allies Amid Reports of Surveillance of Marie Yovanovitch,2020-01-16,By Anton Troianovski and Richard Pérez-Peña,"['MOSCOW — Ukraine has opened a criminal investigation into allies of President Trump, following reports that they had the United States ambassador under surveillance while she was stationed in Kyiv, the Ukrainian government said on Thursday. The move was a remarkable departure from past practice for the new government of President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has tried hard to avoid any hint of partisanship in its dealings with Washington. The current situation has heightened those sensitivities, with Ukraine caught in the middle of the conflict between Democrats and Republicans over the impeachment of Mr. Trump for his pressure campaign on Ukraine. But the recent release of documents in Washington has prompted a change of course. On Tuesday, just before Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate was scheduled to begin, Democrats in the House of Representatives published text messages to and from Lev Parnas — an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer — pointing to surveillance of the ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch. The Internal Affairs Ministry of Ukraine said in a statement released on Thursday that “the published messages contain facts of possible violations of Ukrainian law and of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, which protect the rights of diplomats on the territory of another state.” Ukraine “cannot ignore such illegal activities” on its territory, the statement said, adding that the national police had started criminal proceedings after analyzing the new material. “Our goal is to investigate whether there were any violations of Ukrainian and international laws,” the ministry said in the statement. “Or maybe it was just bravado and fake conversation between two U.S. citizens.” Also on Thursday, Ukraine said it had asked the F.B.I. for help investigating the reported penetration of computer systems belonging to Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, by hackers working for Russian intelligence. Mr. Parnas was involved in a campaign, led by Mr. Giuliani, to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son, Hunter Biden, over the younger Mr. Biden’s lucrative time on the board of Burisma. As part of the pressure campaign against Ukraine, Mr. Trump’s allies were trying to remove Ms. Yovanovitch from her post, seeing her as an impediment to their business dealings as well as the campaign to force the government to investigate the Bidens. Last March, an exchange between Mr. Parnas and another man, Robert F. Hyde, indicated that Mr. Hyde was in contact with people watching Ms. Yovanovitch. “They are willing to help if we/you would like a price,” one message from Mr. Hyde read. Mr. Parnas said in a televised interview on Wednesday that he had not taken Mr. Hyde’s offer seriously. Mr. Hyde told the Sinclair Broadcasting host Eric Bolling in a television interview on Wednesday that he had been “absolutely not” monitoring Ms. Yovanovitch. He said he had been under the influence of alcohol when he sent his messages to Mr. Parnas. “It was just colorful, we were playing — I thought we were playing,” Mr. Hyde said. The State Department did not reply to a list of questions about the text messages, surveillance of Ms. Yovanovitch, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s knowledge of the matter and role in her ouster. Until now, Ukraine’s government has tried to stay out of the impeachment debate as much as possible. Washington is Kyiv’s most powerful ally in Ukraine’s conflict with Russia, and Ukrainian officials have sought to build a good relationship with Mr. Trump. At the same time, Ukrainians are aware that a Democrat could win the White House in November. They have refrained from making moves — such as publicly announcing an investigation related to Mr. Biden, as Mr. Trump’s emissaries sought — that could leave Ukraine open to accusations of interfering in domestic American politics. In a sign that Ukrainian officials remain concerned about such accusations, the statement on Thursday revealing the investigation said that Ukraine’s position was “not to interfere in the domestic affairs of the United States of America.” But Ukrainian law and international obligations to protect the rights of diplomats serving on its territory had forced the country to respond, the statement said. It called on the F.B.I. to provide all available “information and materials” related to people “who may be involved in a possible criminal offense.” Arsen Avakov, Ukraine’s interior minister, said the United States should take part in the investigation. “Ukraine expects the United States of America to respond promptly and looks forward to cooperation,” the Interior Ministry’s statement said. Anton Troianovski reported from Moscow, and Richard Pérez-Peña from London. Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington.']",Newly released documents suggest that Ms. Yovanovitch was being watched in Kyiv while she was the American ambassador there.
Taliban Offer to Reduce Violence in Afghanistan Ahead of Deal With U.S.,2020-01-16,By Mujib Mashal and Taimoor Shah,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with United States diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said on Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war. If the American side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed  after President Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September. Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway. Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways. Also unclear was the duration of any reduction — though one Taliban official suggested it was between seven and 10 days — and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday.  But the offer appears to have put the talks in Doha into a new phase. Soon after midnight, the Taliban negotiating team’s spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said the two negotiating teams had talked about details of “the signing of the agreement and the ceremony for it.” “The talks will continue for the coming days,” Mr. Shaheen said on Twitter. In another sign that a deal could be closer, the top commander of United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, joined the American negotiating team in Doha, officials said. The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 American forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington’s demand. Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, Qatar, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group’s leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire — in which no attacks are carried out — without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks. The Taliban’s willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies. The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks, and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing. In the past, the Taliban have refused to talk with the Afghan government, calling it an American puppet. But in September, before Mr. Trump scuttled a nearly signed peace deal, a round of negotiations that was to include some members of President Ashraf Ghani’s administration had been planned in Oslo for soon after the signing of a deal between the Taliban and the United States.The Afghan government still seemed to be pushing for an extensive cease-fire. Hamdullah Mohib, the national security adviser, said at a conference in New Delhi on Wednesday that Afghan leaders saw a cease-fire as a sign of the Taliban’s seriousness for genuine peace, and that the group — which the government has long seen as a proxy of the Pakistani military — can deliver on what they sign. “Peace for our people means the end of violence,” Mr. Mohib said. “This is why we insist that a cease-fire is necessary to create a conducive environment for talks.”A cease-fire, he added, “will prove to the Afghan people and government that our enemies are not only serious about peace, but that it is within their control to maintain their part of a future deal.” Mr. Trump’s scuttling of the talks threw into confusion American policy on Afghanistan, and raised fears that Mr. Trump, long public about his weariness with the war, might pull troops from the country even without a deal. But it also provided a window of reflection over a peace process that many saw as too rushed. Afghan leaders, which had worried that their American allies were selling them out, saw an opportunity for course correction and urged a complete reset that emphasized a cease-fire as a condition for any resumption of talks. The Taliban used the break to bridge divides in their own ranks, most notably the suspicions of many in the military over any deal. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban deputy leading the talks, traveled to Pakistan and held several large meetings, some with as many as 300 senior and midlevel commanders and officials, to bring them onboard with what he said was the best deal he could negotiate. About a month into the lull, American diplomats, led by the chief negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad, began quietly looking at trust-building measures that could put the negotiations back on track. That included releasing several senior Taliban leaders from prison, a move officials hope Taliban negotiators can use to prod their own military to agree to reduce violence. During his first visit to Afghanistan in November, Mr. Trump announced the resumption of negotiations. He said the Taliban were interested in a cease-fire. His remarks, which seemed to echo the Afghan government’s desire, appeared to catch both the militants and his own officials off guard. But both sides returned to the table in hope of finding ways to significantly reduce the bloodshed so the deal could move forward.

U.S. and Iran Are Trolling Each Other — in China,2020-01-16,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — They accuse each other of inciting violence. They denounce one another as corrupt. They call each other terrorists. As tensions between the United States and Iran persist after the American killing of a top Iranian general this month, the two countries are waging a heated battle in an unlikely forum: the Chinese internet. The embassies of the United States and Iran in Beijing have published a series of barbed posts in recent days on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site, attacking each other in Chinese and in plain view of the country’s hundreds of millions of internet users. The United States Embassy has accused Iran of “leaving bloodstains everywhere.” The Iranian Embassy has denounced the Jan. 3 killing of the general, Qassim Suleimani, and vowed to seek the end of “America’s evil forces in western Asia.” The battle has captivated people in China, where diplomatic rows rarely break into public view and the government often censors posts about politics.  The trolling comes at a time when the United States is pressuring American technology companies to censor content by groups the government has identified as terrorist organizations. Reports have emerged that Facebook, for example, is censoring some pro-Iran posts, including on Instagram. The company said in a statement that it was obliged to review some posts in order to comply with American sanctions.  Iran, for its part, has for years sought to hinder the flow of information from the West more broadly, blocking Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Chinese news outlets have covered the skirmish breathlessly, describing Weibo as the “new battlefield” between the two countries. A hashtag referring to the “Weibo fight” had been viewed more than 1.5 million times as of Thursday. The Chinese authorities operate one of the world’s most aggressive censorship systems, routinely scrubbing reports, comments and posts on the internet that are deemed politically sensitive or subversive. Posts by foreign diplomats are known to have been censored, especially on topics such as North Korea or human rights. But the government has so far allowed the war of words between the United States and Iran to continue, perhaps because it deflects attention away from issues in China, analysts said. “Any topic that provides a distraction from internal problems in China is beneficial to Beijing,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who has studied China’s censorship of posts by foreign embassies. “This just happens to be a case where Beijing sees little downside for itself as Iran and the U.S. squabble.” Many Chinese internet users have used the occasion to criticize the United States as an “imperialist” power, echoing a favorite propaganda theme of Beijing. Others have praised Weibo for allowing the discussion to be published, reacting to the news that Facebook had been censoring some posts.  The American Embassy, which has more than 2.6 million followers on Weibo, said it welcomed the debate. “We expect critical discussion and debate, which might include both support and criticism of U.S. policy,” the embassy said in a statement, describing its approach to social media in China. The Iranian Embassy, with more than 300,000 followers, did not respond to a request for comment. China and Iran have sought closer relations in recent years, especially as American sanctions have increased economic pressure on Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, visited Beijing in late December, just days before the killing of the general, to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. At the meeting, Mr. Wang criticized overseas “bullying practices,” a remark that was seen as aimed at the United States. In its Weibo posts, the Iranian Embassy made a point of appealing to Chinese internet users, thanking them for their support and even suggesting that they visit Iran for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday (“safety is not an issue,” the embassy wrote). Iran might be particularly eager to gain attention and validation from the Chinese public, experts said. “China has provided Iran with very important economic and political lifelines in recent years when U.S. sanctions have choked that country,” said Hongying Wang, an associate professor of political science at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Positive responses from Chinese commenters could help “boost the legitimacy of the Iranian government in the eyes of its own people,” she added.

"China’s Birthrate Hits Historic Low, in Looming Crisis for Beijing",2020-01-17,By Sui-Lee Wee and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world’s most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality. About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born. Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized. Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don’t see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted. “It’s a society where nobody wants to get married and people can’t afford to have children,” said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. “On a deeper level, you would have to think about what kind of society China will become, not just demographically, but socially.” Eno Zhang, a 37-year-old engineer in a tech company in Beijing, said he had argued with his parents for 10 years about his decision not to have children. They have since given up, he said. “I value my spiritual life and hobbies,” Mr. Zhang said. “Children will consume too much of my energy. This is something I cannot accept.” While many countries are struggling with low fertility rates and aging populations, these issues are even more pressing in China, because the country’s underdeveloped social safety net means that most older adults rely heavily on their families to pay for health care, retirement and other expenses. Many young married couples are expected to shoulder the burden of taking care of their parents, in-laws and grandparents, without the support of siblings. The birthrate in China fell to 10.48 per thousand last year, the lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, a decline that has important implications for the country’s economy and labor pool. If birthrates continue to fall while life expectancy increases, there will not be enough young people to support the economy and the elderly, the fastest-growing segment of the population. That will put pressure on the country’s underfunded pension systems, its overcrowded hospitals, and companies.  Making matters worse, the slowing birthrate has meant that China’s main state pension fund, which relies on tax revenues from its work force, risks running out of money by 2035 because of a decline in the number of workers, according to research commissioned by the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Despite the looming demographic crisis, the government still maintains tight control over reproduction.  The ruling Communist Party had sought for three decades to slow population growth by limiting most couples to one child and forcing many women to undergo abortions and sterilizations. In 2015, alarmed by the slump in births, it increased that limit to two children.  Even as the government is now trying to encourage people to have babies, it is sending mixed signals. It still punishes couples who exceed the birth restrictions. The authorities fine single women who bear children, and bar them from using reproductive technologies like freezing their eggs.  The government’s effort to raise the birthrate is also running into broader economic and social changes.  Education, housing and health care costs are rising. More women are getting university degrees and are reluctant to interrupt their careers. Some among the current generation of women of childbearing age, themselves the product of the “one child” policy, don’t see what the fuss about offspring is all about. Dong Chang, a 28-year-old administrative employee at a dentist’s clinic in Beijing, said millennials like her enjoyed spending on themselves without batting an eyelid and would find it hard to sacrifice their wants for a child. “We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish,” she said. “How can I raise a child when I’m still a child myself? And take care of him and feed him at midnight?” Ms. Dong said that she was living with her boyfriend but that they had decided to not get married for the time being because they didn’t want their parents to hound them about having children. Melody Lin, a 26-year-old worker at a nonprofit, said she couldn’t think of a reason to have a child. She said she had thought about conforming to societal norms and starting a family but decided against it after reading arguments that not all women need to have children. “My parents think that I’m still young and will change my mind when I get older, but I think it’s unlikely,” she said. China’s total fertility rate — an estimate of the number of babies a woman would have over her lifetime — has fallen to 1.6 children per woman, and for years has generally remained below the “replacement” level of 2.1. That means China could soon see a shrinking population and a work force too small to support its pensioners. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said last year that China’s population contraction would begin in 2027. Others believe it will come sooner or has already begun. The accuracy and completeness of China’s population figures, like other sensitive statistics, have been questioned for years, making exact projections and comparisons difficult. Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, said he expected the low fertility rate to continue for at least a decade. “There are a lot of parallels with this demographic crisis to global warming,” Dr. Cai said. “The waters are rising slowly, and we need a longer term strategy to deal with it.” Elsie Chen contributed research.']","In a country where most older adults rely heavily on their families, the continuing drop in births could have a seismic effect in the decades to come."
"Will Big Ben Chime for Brexit? It’s a $650,000 Question",2020-01-15,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — When Britain leaves the European Union at the end of the month, it must secure trade ties to the Continent, revamp its migration rules and reset relations with global partners like the United States, to name just a few looming challenges. But the question gripping Brexit supporters is whether the moment of departure will be marked by the familiar chimes of Big Ben. Inconveniently, the country’s most famous clock tower is under repair, like much of the crumbling parliamentary estate, yet that has not stopped a vigorous campaign to bring it back to life for a brief moment of history. “Big Ben Must Bong For Brexit,” screamed a front-page headline in the British tabloid The Daily Express, which was superimposed on a picture of the clock minus the scaffolding and cladding that conceal it.  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that the 500,000-pound cost (about $650,000) of restoring the chimes for the night could be raised by crowd funding. But his office later conceded that there was no official way for the public to contribute. “Boris’ bonkers ‘bung a bob for Big Ben Brexit bongs’ bid bombs,” was the verdict of another tabloid, The Daily Mirror, as frustrated Brexit enthusiasts hinted of a plot against them and suggested that church bells ring out instead. (The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers has responded with skepticism.) The debate has exposed the government’s surprising awkwardness over how to commemorate the end of 47 years of European integration, an ambition that helped bring Mr. Johnson to power but has also divided the nation. Although he won a convincing parliamentary majority in last month’s election, he achieved this largely by uniting the pro-Brexit vote in a way that guaranteed victory under the British system. In fact, a majority of voters supported parties that wanted either a second referendum on Brexit or to scrap it altogether. For days Downing Street has stalled when asked what will happen when Britain officially leaves the bloc, not at midnight on Jan. 31, but at 11 p.m. (The timing is dictated, like much else in the Brexit negotiations so far, by Brussels, which is in a different time zone.) Mr. Johnson seems queasy about the moment being hijacked by Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, who plans a celebration outside Parliament. But the prime minister also appears to be unsure what note to strike over an issue that has split the nation for three years. Brexit was originally scheduled to happen last March, and previous preparations have had to be scrapped, with commemorative coins being melted down when Britain was forced to make a second request for more time. [Read: Battered at the polls, pro-Europe Britons gird for the next fight.] To critics of the Big Ben idea, it illustrates their fear that Brexit is motivated by nostalgia and a wish to bask in the afterglow of a long-lost British Empire. Some Brexit supporters yearn for a restoration of the blue passports they carried in the 1970s (Britain, like other European Union nations, adopted a maroon passport), and some have campaigned for a new royal yacht. “The obsession with Big Ben chiming really highlights the shallowness of the Vote Leave campaign,” Neil Gray, a lawmaker with the Scottish National Party, wrote on Twitter. Most analysts say they believe that the 2016 vote for Brexit was more about identity and a sense of sovereignty than economics, and according to research by Bloomberg Economics, the cost of Brexit has already hit £130 billion, with a further £70 billion set to be added by the end of this year. So national symbols are important to many Brexit supporters, and those who want Big Ben to chime argue that despite the renovation work, the bell has been struck on specific occasions — including on New Year’s Eve. Dozens of lawmakers, including perhaps the most outspoken Brexit supporter, Mark Francois, signed a letter to The Sunday Telegraph, urging that Big Ben not stay silent on Jan. 31. “We believe this would be much to the consternation of many people around the U.K. who wish to celebrate this momentous event,” they wrote. Mr. Farage has weighed in, too, saying that at his planned celebration outside Parliament, he might be forced to play a recording of the chimes. “I frankly think that, around the world, at that moment at 11 p.m., if Big Ben doesn’t strike, our country looks like a joke,” he told LBC Radio. The House of Commons says that the clock mechanism that usually powers the hammer that strikes the Great Bell, as Big Ben is formally known, has been dismantled and removed for refurbishment. (While Big Ben is a nickname for the clock, which is called the Great Clock and sits atop the tower, it is strictly speaking the name of the main bell in the clock. The name is also often used to refer to the Elizabeth Tower, the structure that contains the clock.) For the bell to ring, a temporary striking mechanism used for New Year’s Eve would have to be reattached and tested to ensure the timing was correct. Alongside this work, a temporary floor would have to be installed in the belfry where Big Ben is housed, and the cost for the temporary floor and installing, testing and striking Big Ben would be approximately £120,000. What is more, the delay to other planned work in the belfry would push back the tower’s overall restoration schedule by two to four weeks — with the cost of each week’s delay being approximately £100,000. Even though for Brexit supporters some sort of celebration is important, for most Britons, nothing will actually change after Jan. 31. Under the exit deal, Britain will remain under European Union rules until the end of 2020 while the two sides try to negotiate what the future looks like. So now, although Britain faces tough trade negotiations with the European Union, Mr. Johnson’s public position is that it is time for the country to move on and change the subject. A triumphalist celebration of a moment that millions of Britons will regret hardly fits with a notion of healing and catharsis. The Big Ben for Brexit campaign is not giving up, however. On Wednesday, there were some high-profile pledges of donations, but one online funding page had recorded just £425. If necessary, Mr. Francois told ITV, he and another pro-Brexit lawmaker would “go up there, whack it and save some money.”']",A campaign is underway to get the British Parliament’s great bell to ring when the country leaves the E.U. on Jan. 31. But there are hurdles: the cost and repairs. 
"A Leak, a Resignation and Another Chance: Ukraine Infighting Grows",2020-01-17,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is already juggling multiple international crises: A war with Russia-backed separatists, an unwanted starring role in the impeachment drama gripping Washington, and tensions with Iran over the downing of Ukrainian jetliner. Now he is facing growing political turbulence at home. Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, an ally of Mr. Zelensky, tendered his resignation on Friday after clandestine audio recordings appeared to show Mr. Honcharuk criticizing the president’s knowledge of economics. Hours later, Mr. Zelensky rejected Mr. Honcharuk’s resignation in a videotaped meeting that the president’s office posted to Facebook.   The back-and-forth indicated that Mr. Zelensky, a 41-year-old former comedian, faces a power struggle within Ukraine’s elite, despite landslide victories in the presidential election last spring and parliamentary elections last summer. Mr. Honcharuk said the recordings of discussions with senior government officials had been doctored and leaked by people seeking to show that he and his team “don’t respect the president,” in hopes of impeding Mr. Zelensky’s efforts to fight systemic corruption. “Many influential groups that aim to get access to financial flows would benefit from things appearing that way,” Mr. Honcharuk said on Friday in a statement announcing that he had submitted his resignation. “But this is not true.” There was no clear indication as to who leaked the audio files, in which government officials discuss how to make a presentation about economic policy to Mr. Zelensky. A voice that sounds like Mr. Honcharuk’s can be heard describing Mr. Zelensky’s understanding of economics as “primitive.” The same voice also says, “I am a complete ignoramus in economics.” Mr. Honcharuk said he was submitting his letter of resignation to Mr. Zelensky in order to “remove any doubt as to our respect for and trust in the president.” About nine hours after Mr. Honcharuk announced the resignation offer, Mr. Zelensky’s office made public a video saying that the prime minister would remain.  “You know my personal attitude to you, you know it well,” Mr. Zelensky tells Mr. Honcharuk in the video, sitting across from him in a grand meeting room. “I’ve decided to give you a chance.”  Even with Mr. Honcharuk remaining in office, the leak of high-level government discussions hints at the intensity of political infighting in Ukraine, as Mr. Zelensky takes steps to follow through on a campaign pledge to take on corruption and the country’s entrenched interests. Mr. Zelensky has promised to rein in the business tycoons known as oligarchs, who have long held outsize sway in Ukraine with influential media holdings and deep political ties. Parliament has approved a raft of anticorruption laws in recent months, but analysts say it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the efforts. “Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to destroy criminal schemes that were built up over decades in the course of several months,” Mr. Honcharuk said. Mr. Zelensky’s office issued a statement saying the president had ordered law enforcement to find out within two weeks who was responsible for the recordings, which it described as stemming from a meeting between Mr. Honcharuk and other government ministers and central bank officials. “The unsanctioned surveillance and recording of conversations must not occur in the offices of the state authorities,” the president’s office said. “This is a question of national security.” The government has also announced a criminal investigation into different allegations of secret surveillance.

"As Five Star Party Risks Implosion, Italy Fears the Fallout",2020-01-18,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Its poll numbers are plummeting. Its members of Parliament are defecting. Its leaders complain about back-stabbing while supporters flee to the left and the right. And it runs the Italian government. Italy’s Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment party born on the internet that was supposed to revolutionize Italian politics, increasingly looks to be on the verge of cratering, only two years after winning the largest vote in national elections. With Italy’s economy essentially stuck and its power waning, there is rising clamor that the party’s dysfunction and identity crisis may not just bring down the government but drag Italy down with it. Five Star is not likely to collapse tomorrow. But its new governing coalition with the establishment, center-left Democratic Party, which was supposed to put Italy on track after Five Star’s rocky divorce from Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party this summer, is already clearly deeply troubled and has done little more than extend Italy’s malaise. Analysts foresee a slow, but potentially irreversible, burn for Five Star that will keep Italy distracted and unstable for some time to come. Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute of International Affairs, a Rome-based research institute, said the fragmentation of the party would ensure that its leaders focused on their own survival. “It does not put the government in the frame of mind for long-term strategic thinking,” she said. As Five Star limps along, Mr. Salvini, the anti-immigrant former interior minister who remains the dominant force in Italian politics, is circling his rivals, applying immense pressure on the campaign trail as he racks up victories in regional elections. In recent weeks, three members of Parliament fled Five Star to join Mr. Salvini’s League, which polls suggest has a brighter, and longer, future. Six other Five Star members quit and joined the “Mixed Group” — a catchall for electoral orphans in the Parliament. Italy’s education minister from Five Star quit the government and the party. Others have been expelled over internal divisions. More of the same is expected. “The cultural revolution Five Star had promised did not happen because of a lack of experience,” said Gianluca Rospi, one of the lawmakers who left the party. Many analysts agree that the party has failed to transition from an angry and vague protest movement into an effective governing party willing to alienate some voters by taking positions, assuming a clear identity and embracing core competencies. “The moment they entered the government, they entered an explosive contradiction,” said Piergiorgio Corbetta, a sociologist at the University of Bologna who has extensively studied Five Star. He called the party’s descent entirely predictable. “Protests can be of any color — making proposals is hard,” he said. “It requires you to make people unhappy.” The new Italian governing coalition was essentially fused together to prevent a government collapse and national elections that would result in Mr. Salvini taking what he has called “full powers.” For now, neither Five Star or the Democratic Party is in a rush to go to early elections, but the calculus could change if their polls keep falling or if other power brokers decide the time is ripe for elections.  The Democratic Party, which is going through its own existential crisis, is warning that it might not abide Five Star’s frustrating ambiguity and anti-politics politics much longer. “If they continue to have this anti-political flare they will destroy themselves,” Andrea Orlando, a top Democratic Party official, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper this week. He added that Five Star’s agita weakened the coalition’s ability to address the country’s problems. “It reflects negatively on the work of the government,” he said. Five Star was founded more than a decade ago as a protest movement by Beppe Grillo, a comedian, and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur and futurist. The movement soon disrupted the country’s traditionalleft-right spectrum by stoking broad anti-elite resentments. It steadily grew from blog posts to the most powerful party in the country. In March 2018 it took 33 percent of the vote and ultimately formed a nationalist and populist coalition with the League that struck fear into the European establishment. But governing has not come naturally to Five Star. In opposition, its leaders condemned major infrastructure, industrial and energy projects as disastrous for Italy. But once in power, they let those projects go forward, while simultaneously trying to appease their supporters by dragging their feet and complaining. The bold proposals they did follow through on, such as eliminating poverty, have fallen far short. Mr. Salvini made a meal of Five Star’s inexperience and incoherence and ultimately the marriage ended with his failed bid to take over. Five Star’s support has at best halved while the League’s has at least doubled.  Five Star’s polling is now so low in Emilia Romagna and Calabria, two regions set to vote at the end of the month, that it considered not running a candidate and taking “an electoral break.” “They betrayed their fundamental idea, which is that they were born against the system,” Mr. Salvini said in an interview after a day of campaigning in Emilia Romagna, where he is hoping to put a stake in the government’s heart. Mr. Salvini predicted his former ally would receive less than 5 percent of the vote in the region. His rivals had destroyed themselves, he said, by aligning with the very Democratic Party that had been the target of their invective for years. “It’s clear that their people and many of their electors don’t accept it,” Mr. Salvini said. Five Star has even kicked out some of those who refuse to stomach the new alliance. “I have been expelled from nothing,” Gianluigi Paragone, a right-leaning former media personality said on Facebook after his expulsion this month, suggesting that the party was now less than zero. But some of Five Star’s more liberal supporters also have had a hard time accepting the coalition with Mr. Salvini, who took a hard line against migrant landings and pulled the nebulous Five Star clearly to the right. Rebellions are breaking out all over the place. In December, members of Parliament refused to pay their dues into a party fund, prompting the party to threaten more expulsions. A couple days later, Davide Casaleggio, the son of the party’s co-founder, defended himself against accusations that he used the party’s digital platform, upon which internal votes are cast, for personal profit. Critics have long made such allegations, but now some party members are raising concerns as well. Five Star has called for a general assembly in March to sort out its problems, some of which were raised in a “manifesto” circulated this month among party members. (“First problem, political direction.”) But the letter also aired concerns about the workload of Luigi Di Maio, the party’s political leader and Italy’s foreign minister. “All his attention should be focused on foreign policy,” said Emanuele Dessì, a parliament member with Five Star and co-author of the manifesto. Five Star has long maintained an ambiguous foreign policy. It started out critical of Vladimir Putin’s Russia for human rights abuses. Then in recent years, it drew close to Russia, opposing sanctions imposed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The party’s positions on the euro and the European Union have been all over the place. Mr. Di Maio, previously known for lending support to France’s Yellow Vest protesters and gaffes such as calling Chinese President Xi Jinping “President Ping” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “Secretary Ross,” is in a difficult position. He and his government must articulate a policy on the Libyan civil war as Italy’s own interests in the area are in flux. The reviews haven’t been kind. “Diplomatic Flop,” the newspapers read. Mr. Di Maio’s focus has often been on internal politics, especially on what he has called back-stabbing. “Of this, I’m a little tired, but I’m not tired of the movement,” Mr. Di Maio said on the Tuesday night program. “So whoever hopes that I’ll get tired of the movement has made a mistake.” But Italy clearly seems to be tiring of Five Star. Mr. Corbetta, the Five Star scholar, said that given the way things were going, he saw a future for Five Star that looked more like its past. “The future route for Five Star is to be out of the government,” he said, “as a check on the government.” Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Rome.']","The populists who upended Italian politics are struggling with defections, plummeting poll numbers and the compromises of government.

Battered but Resilient After China’s Crackdown,2020-01-18,"By Chris Buckley, Steven Lee Myers and Gilles Sabrié","['YARKAND, China — The winding, crowded lanes of old Yarkand, an ancient Silk Road town, preserve patterns of life that go back centuries. On a recent morning, smoke wafted from sputtering grills of lamb and ovens lined with baking flatbread. Clangs rang from a coppersmith shaping bowls with a hammer. Twangs from a dutar, a two-stringed lute, floated from a store selling traditional musical instruments. In a dimly lit teahouse, old men in Muslim head caps murmured in conversation. Sitting on the fringe of the Taklamakan Desert, Yarkand remains a cultural cradle for Uighurs, a mostly Muslim minority in China’s far western Xinjiang region. But their way of life is under intense pressure. Uighurs have for three years endured a sweeping campaign to turn them into obedient followers of the Communist Party, to weaken their commitment to Islam and to shift them from farms to factories. Towns and cities across Xinjiang are surrounded by big police checkpoints that use facial recognition scanners to record people coming and going. Up to a million or more Uighurs have been sent to indoctrination camps since 2017. Yarkand was decimated by these detentions. In 2018, this city of approximately 200,000 people was effectively closed off to foreign journalists, with police checkpoints blocking entry by car. Since last year, though, the authorities in Xinjiang have eased up enough that we were allowed in. Our visit revealed a town scarred by recent upheavals. Bulldozers are encroaching on houses in the old town, condemned as “slums,” to make way for new neighborhoods. Yet the Uighurs there also appeared resilient. They hold onto customs woven from their history as farmers, merchants and Muslims living on the edge of deserts. We arrived in Yarkand by a morning train from Hotan, a small city 175 miles to the southeast. After some negotiations and hushed phone calls, a police officer and a propaganda official who had hurried to the station allowed us to visit as long we agreed to be on a train that night to Kashgar, the next city on our journey to see how the Xinjiang region was changing. A brief taxi ride took us to old Yarkand as stores and restaurants began to stir to life. We were watched constantly by plainclothes officers, and we limited conversations with residents to brief chats, for fear of bringing them trouble. Yarkand still offers glimpses of its ancient splendors. The main lane in the old commercial area is dotted with the two-story homes of merchants, faded and cracked. Their wooden balustrades and plaster ceilings are decorated with swirling floral patterns, recalling Yarkand’s history as a stop on trade routes crisscrossing China, Central Asia and beyond. Yarkand was the capital of an Islamic dynasty, the Yarkand Khanate, which lasted two centuries from 1514. Uighurs credit the Khanate with collecting and refining a revered set of musical performances, the Twelve Muqam. Tombs of the khans lie in a sprawling cemetery here. On the chief shopping street, knots of women in bright dresses wandered into shops selling children’s clothes, or debated over sparkling trays of necklaces and rings at jewelry stalls. Portly stall holders laid out piles of dried dates and raisins, or sanzi, a snack of fried dough. On this journey through southern Xinjiang, places we had visited in the depths of the crackdown in 2017 and 2018 seemed busier and more crowded now, suggesting that restrictions on residents had eased a bit. Police checkpoints throughout towns and cities have become less stringent in the past year, and it is easier to move around. In the bazaars, more faces had the weather-hardened features of farmers, suggesting it was easier to travel from villages. The reasons for these changes weren’t clear; officials have not offered explanations. The government may have felt more confident after detaining so many people. Or it may have felt it had to ease up a little because the restrictions were suffocating the local economy and tourism, and drawing international condemnation. Even so, Yarkand remains girded by security. Protective metal grates encased many shops. Cooks’ cleavers were chained to benches, as police rules demand, to prevent potential stabbings. The government hopes the security will bring back tourists, and Yarkand has converted a gracefully reconstructed palace of the Khans into a gaudy attraction, which doubles as a film and television set. “Chinese culture, Chinese expression,” says a sign at the entrance to the building. Inside, visitors are greeted by a billboard portrait of Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader, waving against a background showing modern apartment buildings. Some signs of change in Yarkand since the crackdown are subtle. In a dusty park, six barbers wielded razors, scraping whiskers from men’s faces, occasionally grunting to a customer to stay still or tilt his head. Not long ago, barbers were in less demand. Beginning in the 1990s, southern Xinjiang experienced an Islamic resurgence. More younger men wore Muslim skull caps and grew beards, while more women took to wearing the heavy headdresses and long dresses common in the Middle East to display their Islamic piety. The government blamed this resurgence of religion for growing ethnic resistance and violence, including a clash in Yarkand in 2014, when Uighurs with axes and knives attacked a government office and police station and killed 37 people, according to government reports. Now displays of Islamic faith have virtually all disappeared from Yarkand, and across all Xinjiang, in the wake of the mass detentions and a wave of prohibitions. Most women wore modest head scarves or none at all; only a few old men had beards. Mosques appeared closed or largely empty, even at prayer times. Observing Ramadan is officially discouraged. When we stopped outside the Juma Mosque, a man scurried out and shooed us away. “Love the Party, Love the Country,” the banner above the entrance said. That message was repeated outside other Xinjiang mosques. Not all traditions have disappeared. Amid the rubble of a demolished lot, residents bought sheep for Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, called Corban by Uighurs. They stared intensely over the local variety of sheep with their extravagantly fat rumps and pried open their jaws to check their mouths. The sheep would be killed and shared for days of feasting. Restaurants in old Yarkand were a hubbub of multigenerational families gathered around servings of noodles, samsa — baked pastry pockets of mince — and mutton soup. Signs on the restaurant walls repeated the government’s call for ethnic unity. “All ethnic groups must bind together as tightly as pomegranate seeds,” said a sign seen in most stores. In a basement-level cafe, Uighur women in their 20s in sunglasses, jeans and bright skirts chattered over sweet drinks. One woman sat beside a small, old man with a white beard, perhaps her grandfather, offering him spoonfuls of ice cream. Members of China’s Han majority were an uncommon sight. Yarkand is over 90 percent Uighur, although Chinese culture and language are spreading. A young girl passed by on the back of an electric cycle, clutching a textbook for learning Chinese — the language at school for Uighur children now. As we walked around, we wondered if passers-by might be former detainees of indoctrination camps or prisons. We watched young men absorbed in a streetside lucky draw game, shouting or grimacing at the results. We could only guess how many more men would have been around before the wave of detentions. Government records from six villages in rural areas of Yarkand in 2018 showed nearly 16 percent of 3,249 adults listed were held in indoctrination camps, prisons or criminal detention centers, Adrian Zenz, a German researcher who has closely studied Xinjiang, said in a recent report. Near the train station in Yarkand, one indoctrination camp appeared empty; the usual cordon of guards had gone. The government has said the camps across Xinjiang are shrinking. But other, bigger ones we tried to visit across southern Xinjiang were still under heavy guard, suggesting they stayed in operation. Old Yarkand may not survive much longer. “Take reform all the way,” said a slogan painted on gutted homes waiting to be pulled down.']","An ancient Muslim town, Yarkand is a cultural cradle for the Uighurs, who have experienced mass detentions.

Toll in Attack on Yemen Military Base Rises to at Least 76,2020-01-19,By Saeed Al-Batati and Ben Hubbard,"['AL MUKALLA, Yemen — The death toll in a drone and missile attack on a government military training base in central Yemen rose to at least 76 on Sunday, representing an escalation bound to complicate international efforts to end the country’s prolonged war. The attack targeted soldiers gathered Saturday near a mosque in the central province of Mareb before evening prayers. Abdu Abdullah Majali, a spokesman for the Yemeni Army, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, provided the new death toll and said at least 81 people were wounded. But Yemen’s foreign minister, Mohammed al-Hadrami, gave a higher toll, saying more than 100 people were killed. He called it a “cowardly terrorist act that violates all religious and human customs and values” in a statement on his ministry’s Twitter feed. Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran, did not claim responsibility for the attack. But there are no other forces in the area with a motive to carry it out. Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been locked in civil war since the Houthis seized much of the nation’s northwest and its capital, Sana, in 2014. The next year, an Arab military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began launching airstrikes and backing forces on the ground to push back the Houthis and restore the government. But the war has settled into a stalemate and bred one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 10,000 people have been killed, and hunger and diseases like cholera have spread. International efforts to end the war have made little headway, although United Nations officials have brokered local cease-fires that have brought down the violence in some areas. The United Nations special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the attack and said that it and military escalation elsewhere in the country endanger peacemaking efforts. “I have said before that the hard-earned progress that Yemen has made on de-escalation is very fragile,” Mr. Griffiths said in a statement on Sunday. “Such actions can derail this progress. The negotiation tables are more effective than battlefields in resolving the conflict.” Yemen’s internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has spent most of the war exiled in Saudi Arabia, and he called on government forces to be on high alert for further strikes. The attack “confirms without doubt that the Houthis have no desire for peace,” he said, according to a statement released by the Yemeni state news agency, SABA. Saeed Al-Batati reported from Al Mukalla, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.']",A top U.N. official warned that the rebel assault on government forces could set back peace efforts.
"French Strikers Shut Down the Louvre, Setting a New Target in a Pension Fight",2020-01-17,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — Visitors were turned away from the Louvre on Friday after strikers protesting the French government’s planned pension overhaul blocked entrances to the museum, leaving tourists from around the world befuddled and frustrated. The Louvre — the world’s most visited museum — was the latest target in the 44-day standoff between the government of President Emmanuel Macron and the labor unions opposed to him, with strikes that have caught commuters, business people and tourists in the middle. About 100 protesters prevented visitors from entering the museum, including through the famed glass pyramid that sits in the Louvre’s central courtyard, where they waved union placards and chanted slogans against President Emmanuel Macron as tourists looked on glumly. “Closing the Louvre to prevent tourists from visiting is very important because it’s the most visited museum in the world,” said Christophe Benoit, 52, a protesting employee of France’s Culture Ministry, although he acknowledged that some visitors were “very angry.” “We do understand that, but we feel like there is no other way to make our voices heard,” Mr. Benoit said. Not everyone was convinced. One crestfallen visitor, who gave only her first name, Chantal, said she had come from a Paris suburb to see the Leonardo da Vinci retrospective, the museum’s latest blockbuster show, which is fully booked far in advance. “I’d been planning this visit for three months,” she said, expressing irritation that her daily commute had already grown considerably longer because of the transportation strikes. “The tickets were already bought, and it took me an hour on public transit to get into Paris, so it’s a waste of time.” Others, especially foreign visitors who haven’t followed France’s strikes, were more puzzled than angered. “I don’t really understand why they are striking,” said Giuliana Maletese, a student visiting from Italy. “I just hope we’ll be refunded because we already bought our tickets online.” Labor unions, noting that Mr. Macron had given his victory speech in front of the glass pyramid after the 2017 presidential election, said in a statement that they now stood there “staunchly opposed” to his “disastrous” pension overhaul, which aims to unify 42 different public and private plans into one state-managed, point-based system. The unions also protested working conditions at the Louvre because of staff and funding cuts, the statement said. A Louvre spokeswoman said on Friday evening that tourists who had booked tickets in advance would be reimbursed. But she acknowledged it would be much harder to restore reservations for visitors who had missed their time slot for the da Vinci show. It was unclear how long the protesters, a mix of Louvre employees and strikers from other sectors, would continue to block entrances. Protesters have also staged smaller-scale actions, like closing some of the museum’s exhibition rooms, according to Christian Galani, 45, one of those demonstrating on Friday. “It’s the first time we’ve completely shut down the museum, which makes things much more visible,” said Mr. Galani, who works night shifts at the Louvre as a security guard. Train conductors, teachers, dock workers, energy workers, opera dancers and others have gone on strike and taken to the streets of Paris and other major cities over the past weeks to protest against Mr. Macron’s pension overhaul, which would abolish some special retirement plans and which protesters worry will lower their retirement payouts. About 187,000 protesters marched around France on Thursday, the latest day of demonstrations, down from 452,000 the previous week, according to the Interior Ministry. Union figures, while higher, have shown a similar dip. Public opinion is still mostly in favor of the protest movement, but support is waning. Transportation disruptions have also become less severe as railway workers, hardly mollified by government concessions but unable to forego pay any longer, are returning to work. Train traffic was almost normal around the country on Friday and some metro lines in Paris were back up and running, albeit slowly — a stark improvement from the first weeks of the strikes, which had ground transportation to a near complete halt.

Indian General Talks of ‘Deradicalization Camps’ for Kashmiris,2020-01-17,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — India’s top military commander has created shock waves by suggesting that Kashmiris could be shipped off to “deradicalization camps,” which rights activists consider an alarming echo of what China has done to many of its Muslim citizens. It was far from clear what the military commander, Gen. Bipin Rawat, chief of India’s defense staff, meant when he made the public comments on Thursday or whether a plan was afoot to set up large-scale re-education camps in the part of the disputed Kashmir region that India controls. But rights activists and Kashmiri intellectuals were deeply unsettled, saying that the general’s words revealed how the highest levels of the Indian military viewed Kashmiri people and that his comments could presage another disturbing turn of events. “It’s shocking he would even suggest this,’’ said Siddiq Wahid, a Kashmiri historian who earned his Ph.D. from Harvard. “It reminds me of the Uighur camps in China. I don’t think the general realizes the insanity of what he is talking about.” Over the past three years, the Chinese government has corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into what it calls vocational training centers but what rights activists say are internment camps and prisons. The Uighurs, like Kashmiris, are Muslims who are part of a minority that is often viewed with suspicion by the central government. Kashmir has been mired in crisis for decades and this past year the Indian government upended decades of delicate, albeit flawed policies by unilaterally revoking the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, the part of the region it controls. It sent in thousands of additional troops, arrested practically the entire intellectual class there, including elected representatives, business people and students, and shut down the internet. All of that was highly unexpected and is what makes Kashmiri intellectuals fear the general’s comments. They say that under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, just about anything — however unbelievable just a few years ago — is possible. Mr. Modi’s party has been pushing a religious nationalist ideology that critics say favors India’s Hindu majority and deeply alienates its Muslim minority. Just last month, Mr. Modi’s government passed a highly divisive law that creates a special path for migrants to get Indian citizenship — if they are not Muslim. Outrage at the law set off weeks of nationwide antigovernment protests, which are continuing. Kashmir was India’s only predominantly Muslim state until August, when Mr. Modi’s government summarily erased its statehood. Since then, it has been suspended in tension, with most internet service still shut off and schools deserted. General Rawat made the suggestion about sending Kashmiris to deradicalization camps at an international affairs conference in New Delhi attended by government officials, foreign diplomats, business executives and scholars. Responding to a question on how to fight terrorism, the general said that in Kashmir, “Girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 are now being radicalized. These people can still be isolated from radicalization in a gradual way, but there are people who have completely been radicalized.” “These people need to be taken out separately, possibly taken into some deradicalization camps,” he continued. “We’ve got deradicalization camps going on in our country.” His statements became front-page news across India on Friday and left many analysts scratching their heads. Saket Gokhale, a civil rights activist in Mumbai, said this was the first he had ever heard of deradicalization camps inside India. He said that in some areas where the security forces were battling armed groups, such as the Maoist belt in central India, the military ran deradicalization programs including community visits and vocational training. But those were voluntary and did not involve confinement. “There have been outreach programs, but a deradicalization program is very different from a deradicalization camp,” Mr. Gokhale said. Mr. Wahid, the historian, said he was concerned about the general’s use of the word “camps.” “Are we talking about summer camps or one-year camps where you strip people of their identity and rebuild them?’’ he asked. Indian military officials declined to clarify the general’s remarks. General Rawat, a four-star general, has spent much of his career leading counterinsurgency operations in northeastern India and Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan. He has a history of using hard-nosed tactics. In 2017, he gave an award to a major who had tied a young Kashmiri man to an army jeep and used him as a human shield against stone throwers. “In fact, I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us,” the general said in an interview at the time. “Then I would have been happy.” If the demonstrators had been wielding guns, the general said, then he could have done what he wanted to do, according to Indian news reports. Many Kashmiri intellectuals denied that Kashmir had a radicalization problem, at least not a religious radicalization problem. The militancy is minuscule — fewer than 300 armed fighters by most estimates — and much of the combatants’ ideology turns on political differences with the Indian government, not religious ones. Noor Ahmad Baba, a professor of political science at Central University of Kashmir, who has studied patterns of radicalization, said India was taking its cue from China and might now try to crush all political dissent. “Kashmir is a political issue — it needs a political resolution, not deradicalization camps,” he said. “And where is the radicalization?” “The general should understand that such statements are extra-constitutional and he should speak cautiously,” Professor Baba added. “Even thinking of a deradicalization camp is a dangerous precedent.” “It is not compatible with the democratic setup,” he said.

Brazil’s Top Culture Official Fired Over Speech Evoking Nazi Propaganda,2020-01-17,By Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro’s top culture official was dismissed on Friday over an address in which he used phrases and ideas from an infamous Nazi propaganda speech while playing an opera that Adolf Hitler regarded as a favorite. The address by Roberto Alvim, the culture secretary, set off an outcry across the political spectrum as Brazilians reacted with exasperation and incredulity. It was the latest flash point in a broader debate over freedom of speech and culture in the Bolsonaro era. The president campaigned on a promised course correction after an era of rule by leftist leaders, whom he accused of trying to impose “cultural Marxism.” Critics say that he and his allies are taking a dogmatic approach to the arts, the public education system and to sexuality and reproductive rights. Mr. Alvim’s speech, which was posted on the culture secretariat’s Twitter account Thursday evening, shows Mr. Alvim speaking sternly sitting at a desk. Behind him is a framed photograph of Mr. Bolsonaro. A large wooden cross on his desk is featured prominently. Careful observers were aghast after noticing that a few minutes into the address, Mr. Alvim uttered a few phrases that are remarkably similar to an infamous speech by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Germany propaganda minister. Goebbels’s speech, delivered in 1933, was one of several in which he called on artists to back the Nazi vision. Art, he said, needed to be a “tool” free of sentimentalism that served the state’s aims, according to a biography of Goebbels written by the German historian Peter Longerich. Mr. Alvim’s address included verbatim some phrases from Goebbels’s, including an exhortation to make art “in the next decade heroic.” It also includes the warning that Goebbels gave that if art doesn’t rise to the national moment, “it will cease to exist.” In the background, Richard Wagner’s opera “Lohengrin” is playing, a work Hitler described in his autobiography as one that had been decisive in his life, according to the newspaper Folha de São Paulo. Announcing a $4.8 million investment in the country’s national arts grant program, Mr. Alvim, a veteran theater director, made clear the government would fund works that hew to Mr. Bolsonaro’s worldview, works that pay homage to historical figures and emphasize conservative values. The arts grants would support operas, theater productions, painting and sculpture exhibitions, works of literature and music compositions. Mr. Alvim said Brazil needed “a culture that doesn’t destroy, but one that will save our youth.” “When culture is sickened, people become sick as well,” he said in a video recorded alongside the president, which was broadcast before the one that drew controversy. By Friday morning, Goebbels and Nazi were trending topics on Twitter in Brazil as users shared news stories and memes expressing horror. Mr. Alvim initially dismissed the criticism, accusing leftists of reading too much into his words, and saying in a radio interview that his aides chose the passages from Goebbels’s speech when he asked them to search on Google for speeches about “nationalism and art.” But later he apologized to the Jewish community for what he called “an involuntary mistake.” Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday afternoon in a statement that despite Mr. Alvin’s apology, he decided that keeping him in the job was “unsustainable.” He added that the government “repudiates totalitarian and genocidal ideologies.” Several politicians, including the speaker of the House, had called for Mr. Alvim’s immediate ouster while some prominent figures close to Mr. Bolsonaro questioned his sanity. José Antonio Dias Toffoli, the president of the Supreme Court, said in a statement that Mr. Alvim’s remarks deserved to be “repudiated with vehemence,” adding that they were “offensive to Brazilian people, especially the Jewish community.” Olavo de Carvalho, a Virginia-based writer and YouTuber from Brazil who is known for peddling conspiracy theories and informing Mr. Bolsonaro’s thinking on societal and intellectual matters, was also critical of Mr. Alvim. “It may be early to judge,” he wrote on Facebook. “But Roberto Alvim may not be of sound mind. We’ll see.” Germany’s embassy in Brazil condemned the speech in a post on Twitter, saying that it opposed “any attempt to banalize or glorify” an era that “brought infinite suffering for humanity.” Letícia Casado contributed reporting from Brasília.']",The speech by President Jair Bolsonaro’s culture secretary was the latest flash point in a debate over art and freedom of expression under the conservative government.
China Releases #MeToo Activist Who Covered Hong Kong Protests,2020-01-17,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have released a prominent #MeToo activist and journalist whose detention nearly three months ago prompted an outcry from human rights groups, her friends said on Friday. The activist, Huang Xueqin, 32, was detained by the police in October in the southern city of Guangzhou on charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a vague accusation that the government often uses to silence activists. Ms. Huang gained prominence as a #MeToo activist who confronted China’s patriarchal culture, helping dozens of women report cases of sexual harassment. More recently, she had drawn attention for traveling to Hong Kong and writing essays about the antigovernment protests there. In a message to her friends on Friday, Ms. Huang said she was grateful for their support. “This is Xueqin, and I’m back,” she wrote, according to a friend who received the message and asked not to be identified. “One second of darkness doesn’t make people blind.” China’s #MeToo movement has taken on several prominent figures in media, academia and religion, despite government censorship and the male-dominated culture. “We’re not brave enough to stand out as one individual,” Ms. Huang said in a 2018 interview with The New York Times. “But together, we can be strong.” Human rights experts welcomed Ms. Huang’s release, though they cautioned that the governing Communist Party’s campaign to silence voices of dissent was still in full force. “That she was detained at all is an indictment of Beijing’s hostility toward independent activism and journalism,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group. Under President Xi Jinping, who rose to power in 2012, the authorities have detained and imprisoned dozens of lawyers, journalists and activists. It is unclear why the authorities detained Ms. Huang. The government has in recent months harassed and detained mainland citizens who have shown support for the protests in Hong Kong, which party leaders see as a separatist movement. In her essays about the demonstrations there, Ms. Huang wrote about attending a huge march in June. She also criticized the mainland’s restrictions on free speech. Calls to the Guangzhou police Friday evening were not immediately returned. Mr. Xi’s efforts to limit dissent have continued to send waves of anxiety through China’s community of activists. Last month, as part of a nationwide crackdown, the authorities detained several prominent rights lawyers who attended a planning meeting in the eastern city of Xiamen. One of the detained lawyers, Ding Jiaxi, had previously spent several years in prison for his role in the New Citizens Movement, a group of activists who called on officials to disclose financial assets. Xu Zhiyong, another prominent leader of that movement who also attended the meeting in Xiamen, is now in hiding, activists say. “Will this persecution ever end?” said Ms. Richardson, of Human Rights Watch. “And will the responsible Chinese officials ever be held accountable?”']","Huang Xueqin, who spoke critically of China’s restrictions on free speech, spent nearly three months in detention on charges of “provoking trouble.”"
Donations Are Pouring Into Australia. Now What?,2020-01-18,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — For the rural firefighters of Australia, no donation is too small. They have long been known to canvass for dollars and cents in town markets, and their collection tins are fondly displayed in local storefronts. That hat-in-hand approach can now be put on hold. As bush fires have ravaged Australia, celebrities, business moguls and horrified people around the world have inundated the country’s fire services and other nonprofit organizations with tens of millions of dollars in donations. This outpouring has presented new challenges for a country more accustomed to handing out largess to needier nations than to being the recipient of it. Suddenly, Australia has found itself trying to efficiently distribute huge sums of money and to decipher donors’ sometimes vague intentions. “This is a seminal moment in Australia when it comes to philanthropy and giving,” said Krystian Seibert, a fellow at the Center for Social Impact at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. “I haven’t seen something like it before.” One after another, celebrities have announced large donations or money-collection efforts. A Facebook fund-raiser for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service that was started by the Australian comedian Celeste Barber has amassed $34 million, or 51 million Australian dollars. It is the largest fund-raiser ever on the platform. Fire brigades have received money from Nicole Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, as well as from Metallica and Kylie Jenner. Leonardo DiCaprio donated to wildlife organizations. Writers are auctioning off signed books, musicians are hosting concerts, and athletes like Serena Williams have pledged to direct their winnings to bush-fire relief. Since September, the fires have incinerated an area about the size of West Virginia and at least 25 people have died.  Ecologists have estimated that a billion animals have perished, with some species threatened to the point of extinction. At least 3,000 homes have been ravaged in dozens of towns, and the economic damage from the fires could be as much as $3.5 billion. “We don’t normally get phone calls from people who want to give $1 million and beyond,” said Belinda Dimovski, the director of engagement at the Australian Red Cross. She said the organization, which is providing disaster relief, had raised about $67 million from individuals, groups and companies since July 1. By comparison, it raised about $7.5 million during a drought appeal last year. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has also seen a dramatic jump in giving, as the world has watched the courageous actions of Australian volunteers called on to fight monstrous blazes. In the period between mid-2017 and mid-2018, the fire service raised $525,000, and the largest single donation was about $17,000. Now, it is flush with the tens of millions of dollars it has received from the Facebook fund-raiser and other sources. In the Facebook effort, Ms. Barber’s initial goal was to raise about $20,000 for a trust that helps fire brigades in New South Wales with equipment and other needs. “Please help anyway you can. This is terrifying,” she wrote in the appeal. As the funds have swelled to 1,700 times the original target, questions have been raised about whether the more than one million individual donors knew that they were contributing to a single state’s fire service. Legal experts said it would most likely be up to the Rural Fire Service, rather than Ms. Barber, to decide whether to distribute money to other organizations. It is a “nice challenge,” said the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons. He added that the organization was considering sending money to funds benefiting victims of the blazes and to fire services in other states. “We will need to target the money to where people intended it to go,” he said. The donations received so far could be enough to fund state-supported fire services in New South Wales for decades. But that would not provide immediate disaster relief. “This money comes with expectations,” said Michael Eburn, an associate professor at the Australian National University who specializes in emergency management law. “It’s a dilemma.” The federal government has announced a $1.4 billion national wildfire recovery fund, and has offered a list of established charities holding bush-fire appeals. The state of Victoria has asked the public to donate to groups that provide “practical” relief. Australians affected by the fires said they were heartened to know that people at home and abroad had been moved to help. But some who have lost homes say they have received minimal compensation so far from government agencies and nonprofit organizations, though the federal government says it has been processing claims at record speeds. Informing potential donors about the causes they are considering and directing their assistance to the intended recipients are the biggest challenges in crisis relief, said Maurie Stack, chairman of the Stacks Law Firm, which deals with charity law. “To get the money to the people who need it, you really need boots on the ground,” he said. Mr. Stack is raising money himself for his Rotary Club in Taree, where more than 100 homes in the area have been lost to fires. The club has raised $220,000, far outpacing its goal of $30,000, he said. Over the past decade, Australians have been the fourth-most generous givers in the world, according to the 2019 Charities Aid Foundation World Giving Index. In recent weeks, Australians have flooded fire stations, town governments and nonprofit organizations with contributions of food, clothes and other goods. The groups are now imploring people not to send any more. The most efficient way to give during a disaster is to donate cash directly to charities, said Gary Johns, the commissioner of the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission. “Think about what you want to support and give directly to a charity doing that work,” he said in a statement. Beyond the searing images of burning houses and singed wildlife, the attention that the wildfires have brought to the effects of climate change may be motivating people to donate. “We’ve been primed to do something about climate change,” said Matthew Sisco, a doctoral candidate and data scientist at Columbia University who does research on responses to climate change. “Now, this is an event linked directly to it and pulling at our heart strings.” Animals, too, have been a major focus of charitable donations. WIRES, a wildlife rescue group in New South Wales, raised $9.6 million in one fund-raiser alone. “Kangaroos and koalas are highly charismatic,” Mr. Sisco said. “We can feel empathy for them” — a high predictor of charitable behavior. The success of groups like WIRES, though, may have crowded out other organizations in need. By the time the crisis hit Victoria, the blazes had already raged in New South Wales, and international awareness of WIRES was high, said Megan Davidson, the chief executive of Wildlife Victoria. Some people, she added, mistakenly viewed WIRES as a catchall for helping the nation’s animals. Her group has since worked to rectify that perception, and it has raised $4.8 million. “Everybody is competing for the donor dollar, and people want to donate because it makes them feel good,” said Dr. Eburn, the Australian National University professor. “It makes them feel like they are contributing — and they are.” Michelle Elias contributed reporting.']","As people around the world respond to the fire crisis, organizations find themselves trying to efficiently distribute tens of millions of dollars."

Both are members of the so-called yellow economy, shops that openly support the democracy movement remaking Hong Kong as it strives to protect the freedoms differentiating the territory from the rest of China. After seven months of street protests against Beijing’s assault on these liberties, Hong Kong is color-coded — and bitterly divided. The yellow economy refers to the hue of umbrellas once used to defend demonstrators against pepper spray and streams of tear gas. That is in contrast to blue businesses, which support the police. Families and businesses have cleaved, sometimes forcefully, between those who believe Beijing must be compelled to carry out promised reforms and those who worry that the democracy crusade is destroying Hong Kong’s reputation as a stable financial capital. A middle ground between the blue and yellow factions barely exists. “I’m yellow, but my parents are blue,” said Ms. Lau, the fish ball noodle seller. “A lot of families are like that.” “Luckily, I control 90 percent of the restaurant,” she added, as diners slurped down bowls of soup. “So I can do what I want here.” Both Ms. Lau’s noodle shop and Mr. Liu’s teahouse are plastered with Post-it notes of encouragement for pro-democracy forces, mimicking the Lennon Wall in Prague where messages of dissent proliferated under Soviet domination. Maps and apps showing businesses’ perceived leanings help guide customers their way. “We want to show the Chinese Communist Party that Hong Kong people can be economically self-sufficient through the yellow economic circle,” Mr. Liu said. “We want to put pressure on blue shops to close.” Devoid of natural resources and crowded onto limited land, Hong Kong has flourished because of its people, mostly entrepreneurial immigrants who left China for better prospects in the former British colony. Hong Kong residents advanced up the economic ladder, as sweatshop laborers rose to become bosses with factories on the mainland and even real estate or shipping tycoons. Today, the territory, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, ranks behind only New York and London as a nexus of global finance. Yet months of unrest, along with the trade war between the United States and China, have battered Hong Kong’s economy, which entered recession last year. In the central business district, police officers fired live bullets and arrested unarmed students. On university campuses, students lobbed firebombs with homemade catapults. Tear gas has been unleashed in all but two of Hong Kong’s 18 districts. On Sunday the violence flared again as two police officers were beaten when officials tried to halt a pro-democracy rally in the Central district. Tourists from mainland China, a vital source of income for local businesses, have stayed away because of the turmoil. Retail sales have plummeted. Small-business owners, whose operations make up the bulk of Hong Kong’s enterprises, are bearing the brunt of the downturn, even as they contend with some of the highest rents in the world. Economic analysts fear for the city’s future. “A deterioration of the sociopolitical situation and delays in addressing structural challenges of insufficient housing supply and high income inequality could further weaken economic activity and negatively affect the city’s competitiveness in the long term,” the International Monetary Fund warned last month. Amanda Leung’s family has sold dried seafood for three generations. In recent years, mainland visitors concerned about the safety of the domestic food supply have been some of her biggest customers, she said. They bought fish maw and mollusks, abalone and sea cucumber. “They have stopped coming,” she said. Still, Ms. Leung said she understood the frustrations that have kept the protest movement going, from peaceful marches of more than a million people demonstrating against a now-withdrawn extradition bill to the passions of a hard core of brick-throwing youth. “China should leave Hong Kong alone,” she said. “We can do business our own way.” As tempers have flared, businesses on both sides of the color divide have been attacked. Down the street from Mr. Liu’s tea shop, vandals lobbed red paint at a food stall known as a yellow establishment, while a nearby snack food store considered to be pro-Beijing was damaged. The battle has gone online, too. Ken Leung helped create WhatsGap, a popular app in Hong Kong that maps businesses that are considered yellow, helping them draw customers. This month Google removed the app from its online store, saying it violated its policies related to sensitive events, but critics said the company might have been acting to placate China. Apple pulled a similar service from its app offerings last year. “The divide in Hong Kong society has only increased, not lessened,” Mr. Leung said. But in November, pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory in district council elections, the first time that Hong Kong voters had a chance to express their positions on the protests since this movement began. The yellow economy was backed up by the ballot box. “There’s a perception that Hong Kong businesspeople are not sympathetic to the protests, but look at the silent majority that spoke in large peaceful marches or in the district council elections,” said Todd Darling, an American restaurateur who has lived in Hong Kong for 16 years. As the protests gathered force last year, Rocky Siu watched as an orderly column of demonstrators, miles long, marched past one of his ramen restaurants. When the police cracked down, he opened his doors, offering half-price bowls of noodles and free saline solution to wash the tear gas from protesters’ eyes. “I’m losing money, but that’s not the point,” he said. “We have to support our young people.” Mr. Siu’s father was born in China and came to Hong Kong to seek a better life. But he owns a jewelry factory on the mainland and is, as Mr. Siu puts it, “deep blue.” “I tell him, ‘I don’t understand.

"Myanmar Unrolls a Welcome Mat for China, but Not All the Way",2020-01-17,By Hannah Beech and Saw Nang,"['BANGKOK — As the leader of China, Xi Jinping, touched down in Myanmar on Friday, his two-day visit is designed to celebrate Beijing’s expanding presence in the region, both as an economic and political role model. But relations between the two neighbors have never been so simple. China has been a top foreign investor in Myanmar, which boasts a trove of natural resources. And China also provides a road map for how one of Asia’s poorest nations might lift its citizens out of hand-to-mouth existences. “China’s remarkable poverty reduction has led it to become a modern developed nation,” said U Thein Myint Wai, a Myanmar economist and former commerce ministry official. “There will be a positive impact of working with such a nation.” Beijing also reliably defends its smaller neighbor in the international arena, where the Myanmar military has been accused of a genocidal campaign against Rohingya Muslims in the country’s far west. Yet unrest in Myanmar’s ethnic borderlands, where roughly one-third of the nation’s population lives, threatens China’s biggest investment projects in the country. A creeping fear that Beijing is creating debt traps across the developing world and monopolizing profits has compelled Myanmar officials to suspend or renegotiate hydropower and port deals. “China always says their investment is to help Myanmar’s development and the people of Myanmar,” said Hkalam Samson, the president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, a powerful group in Kachin State, which has been rived by fighting between ethnic militias and the Myanmar military. “But it’s different in reality.” Kachin is one of three states that are expected to receive Chinese investment pledges during Mr. Xi’s trip. His visit to Myanmar is the first by a Chinese leader in nearly two decades. “If the investment is not fair, then the people will oppose it,” said U Khin Maung Kyi, the executive director of the Rakhine Economic Initiative, which operates in far western Rakhine State, also the site of ethnic strife. “Investing in conflict areas is risky.” When Myanmar signed on in 2018 to the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s continent-spanning infrastructure program, it seemed like a lifeline. Western investment in Myanmar’s frontier economy had not materialized. China was promising special economic zones, roads, railways and even a sparkling expansion of Yangon, the country’s commercial capital. Myanmar’s civilian government was rapidly becoming a pariah in other parts of the world for its tacit approval of the military-led campaign of slaughter and rape that sent three quarters of a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh beginning in 2017. Conflict was also heating up in other parts of the country, where ethnic minorities have been battling the state almost since the country declared independence in 1948. As accusations that Myanmar’s military was committing war crimes grew louder, Beijing was the sole powerful voice defending Myanmar. “This has only emboldened the military’s relentless campaign of human rights violations and war crimes against ethnic minorities across the country,” Nicholas Bequelin, the regional director for Amnesty International, said in a statement. In recent months, Myanmar has grown even more isolated globally. The reputation of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto civilian leader of Myanmar and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is in tatters for refusing to show compassion for the plight of the Rohingya. Next week, the International Court of Justice will make an initial ruling related to a legal case accusing Myanmar of genocide. Yet as much as Myanmar might seem to need China’s backing, the public’s suspicion of Beijing has heightened. As in other countries, China has been criticized for bringing in armies of Chinese workers for infrastructure projects, cutting out locals from jobs. “Only Chinese employees are hired for their projects,” said Mr. Hkalam Samson, of the Kachin Baptist Convention. “They even bring in food from China and don’t buy anything from Myanmar.” In 2011, one of the most popular actions by the then transitional government was to suspend construction of a dam in Kachin, which would have submerged a spiritual landmark while sending nearly all the generated electricity over the border to China. Rumors that the dam, at Myitsone, would be restarted prompted street protests last year. A rally is planned for Saturday to call for the project to be stopped permanently. In 2018, Myanmar renegotiated the terms of an agreement for a deep seaport in Rakhine State, which critics said ran the risk of ending up in Chinese hands because of a high debt load. Rights groups also condemned the project for trampling on the rights of local populations. “The absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing,” said Mr. Bequelin, of Amnesty International. With firefights between ethnic armies and the Myanmar military continuing to flare along the border with China, Chinese investment has declined, said U Soe Nyunt Lwin, the minister of planning and finance for Shan State, another conflict-ridden region. “I hope there will somehow be a solution for peace during Xi Jinping’s visit,” he said. China’s government holds influence over some ethnic armed groups battling Myanmar’s military. Ethnic militia leaders seek refuge in China, and Beijing once chartered a plane from China to deliver ethnic representatives to a national peace conference in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. Like all others, that peace summit failed. China, ethnic kingpins and the state of Myanmar, once known as Burma, have all profited from the bounty of the nation’s war-torn borderlands. There is jade, natural gas and hydropower, gold, timber and rare earth metals. But many residents of these conflict zones have been mired in an endless cycle of displacement and poverty. “Everyone, the Burmese, the Chinese, they all want what is in our soil,” said Daw Doi Bu, an ethnic Kachin activist and former lawmaker. “We don’t get to profit.” Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Saw Nang from Mandalay, Myanmar.']","As Xi Jinping visits Myanmar, fighting in ethnic borderlands threatens China’s ambitious investment plans."

Watching the Beach Town of My Childhood Burn,2020-01-17,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['   The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. This week’s issue is written by Livia Albeck-Ripka, a reporter with the Australia bureau. When I was about 15 months old and could only say a few words, one of them was “baitfish.” My family had just returned from our annual summer vacation in Mallacoota, a beach town of a few hundred on the southeast coast of Australia, where we would catch tiny, glimmering fish and use them to lure flathead out of the water. After we returned home, a patch of light shimmered on the wall, and according to my mother, I pointed to it and described what I saw: “baitfish.” It was the Australian summer of 1990-91, and on the other side of the world, the Israeli military was handing out gas masks to its citizens because of the threat of attacks from Iraq. But in a fishing village thousands of miles away, where giant goannas scuttled through gumtrees and kookaburras laughed, my siblings were hunting for wild animal scat and leaping into the ocean.  At the end of every day, we would collapse salty and exhausted into bed. My mother, riding in a dinghy across an expanse of glittering lake, felt grateful to be so far from the world’s calamities, she recently told me. This New Year’s Eve, when blazes near Mallacoota caused smoke so thick the sky turned pitch black, my family absorbed the news and the imagery in horror. We were in Inverloch, a different beach town some 280 miles away — which, this year, escaped the blazes. But our vacation was eclipsed by haze and news of the devastating fires, which so far have burned millions of acres, killed at least 25 people and likely wiped out around a billion animals. Across the country, hardware stores began selling out of masks used to protect people from smoke inhalation. A few days into the new year, in near 100 degree temperatures and choking smoke, I left my family and drove to Hastings, another coastal town, where hundreds of evacuees from Mallacoota — now ravaged by fires that cut off power and destroyed properties — were due to arrive.  Watching them disembark was surreal; I had only ever witnessed scenes like this in Italy, covering the country’s naval rescue mission for refugees. After 20 hours on the ocean, people were weary and some of them, having lost their properties, were likely now displaced. One woman getting off the boat, Corrin Mueller, 23, carried a sign that read “inaction costs more,” which she said referred to the Australian government’s failure to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to global warming. “We’re only here because nobody’s acted quick enough,” she said. “And there’s so much more we can still do to stop more people having to go through this.” One of the things I most wanted to understand, however, was what had driven those remaining in Mallacoota to stay there, and how it felt to watch their paradise turn to ash. So I headed east, toward the firegrounds, and eventually boarded a military flight to the fishing village so mythologized and revered in my family’s collective memory. In Mallacoota, I found miles of charred bush and flattened homes, but a resilient community, determined to rebuild as soon as possible. Our photographer, Asanka Brendon Ratnayake, and I stayed in one of a number of log cabins that had miraculously been spared by the fire — the “luckiest log cabins,” as one local described them. It was surrounded by scorched gumtrees. Despite the devastation, there was a kind of magic: Inside the local pub, which was running on a generator, people drank cold beer and sang along to Don McLean (“This will be the day that I die…”). The burden they were carrying was revealed only in snippets; people became teary describing the fear they’d felt on New Year’s Eve, as they fought with buckets of water and surgical masks to protect their properties, and the sounds of the gas bottles wailing as they exploded. At 8:30 a.m. on the morning of New Year’s Eve, Debbie Preston, who runs the local caravan park, said she “thought she was gone,” and texted a friend an expletive.  At 9:30 a.m., she texted again: “Goodbye.” It was surreal to hear these stories in a beach town like so many others along the coast, where summer after summer I have taken my own vacations. The scale of the calamity created a cognitive dissonance: In many moments during the two straight weeks I spent on the road reporting, I would forget that I was in Australia. I don’t believe I was alone in feeling this way.  Across the country, people who grew up here are grappling with seeing it transformed; with experiencing summer in an oppressive and polluting smog that seeps into everything; asking themselves if this is what this time of year is going to be like from now on, if we are experiencing the apocalypse. As a reporter, I ask myself and my sources the same questions, and the answers are complex. One of the most frightening things about climate change is that we cannot predict exactly what will happen, and that at some point, we may tip into a cascading series of devastating events that we cannot reverse.

Welcoming Winter’s Cold Embrace,2020-01-17,By Ian Austen,"['As I mentioned in last week’s Canada letter, the terrible aftermath of the missile strike on Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 took me to Edmonton as it was reeling from the loss of 27 residents. Despite their shock and grief, those who knew the victims and the members of the city’s Iranian community received me with an exceptional graciousness and generosity. [Read: Plane Crash Leaves Iranian Diaspora in Canada Grief-Stricken] After I finished my article (for those of you reading it now: it was published before Iran admitted that its missiles brought down the airliner), I went for an evening run in the expansive river valley that is Edmonton’s defining geographic feature. It was the start of a cold spell that this week caused a rail to crack on Edmonton’s transit system, brought a general chill to the prairies and delivered significant, and unaccustomed, snowfall to southern British Columbia. There was already a fair amount of snow in Edmonton. So heading out of the hotel, I was a bit concerned about whether the trails down in the valley would be passable. But that worry lifted when I came to the dramatic stairway next to the relatively new funicular that runs down to the valley. All of its 156 steps had been thoroughly cleared of snow and ice. Ottawa, where I live, doesn’t even try to clear many outdoor stairways with as few as a half dozen steps and simply chains them off for the winter. Down in the river valley, every path — and there are many — had been plowed. Again, that’s novel to someone from Ottawa. None of what I found was random. For the past eight years or so, Edmonton has been rolling out an official strategy to encourage its residents to embrace winter rather than hibernate. This week, I spoke with Isla Tanaka who is Edmonton’s “winter city planner,” a post she believes no one else holds in the country. Like several other Canadian communities, she told me, Edmonton was part of a winter cities movement during the 1980s that fizzled out with few achievements. In 2012, Ben Henderson, a city councilor who came from Edmonton’s vibrant theater community, began pushing for a renewed effort and headed off on a winter tour of Scandinavian cities to see how they approach the season. A key takeaway, Ms. Tanaka said, was “that you have to remind people every year that winter can be fun.” A citizens’ group tasked with developing the city’s official winter strategy came up with 64 programs to roll out over a decade. They span a wide range. Some of them involve thinking about using color to make public spaces more appealing during the darkest period of winter. Ms. Tanaka and her colleagues work with restaurants on designing outdoor patios that can be open year-round (at least two were serving outside during this week’s deep freeze). New facilities with washrooms down in the river valley that don’t have to be shuttered in winter are opening. And the city now considers things like shelter from the winter winds when placing skating rinks and toboggan hills. “If we don’t design these spaces to be comfortable in the winter, people won’t go outside,” Ms. Tanaka said. That’s particularly an issue in the city’s downtown, where the outdoors competes with a heated, indoor “pedway” network linking most buildings. Ms. Tanaka said that Edmonton found that consistency was the key to encouraging winter cycling. If cycling routes and paths aren’t cleared promptly and regularly after every snowfall, she said, riders quickly put their bikes away for the winter. For Ms. Tanaka, the biggest surprise has been the public’s embrace of winter. She and others initially thought that winter would be a hard sell. “But that came really, really fast,” she said. “Maybe people were ready to be outside.” While other cities, of course, have many programs to encourage citizens to get outdoors in the winter, Ms. Tanaka said that she is not aware of any with as comprehensive a plan as Edmonton’s. And increasingly, she’s hearing from other cities looking for winter advice. Winnipeg, Ottawa and neighboring Gatineau, Saskatoon and, above all, Quebec City all hold winter carnivals with a variety of events. And they all have, as do other cities, season-long outdoor winter activities, even if they don’t follow Edmonton’s comprehensive approach. The Times’s Travel section this week features a tour of some of Quebec’s skating trails by Elaine Glusac. [Read: Where Trails Are for Skating, Not Hiking] Here in Ottawa, where plans often get fragmented between two municipalities in two provinces and the federal government’s National Capital Commission, volunteers have driven some of the recent efforts to get more people out in winter. In particular, Dave Adams, a cross country skier, began grooming a trail for his sport along the Ottawa River in a more or less solo effort. Now in its fourth year, the trail has become almost as much of an institution as skating on the Rideau Canal. Two more volunteer-based trails will appear elsewhere in the city this year. Looming over all of this, of course, is climate change and erratic weather. Last winter, it was often too cold for comfortable skating on the canal in Ottawa. This year, a series of thaws means that the ice still isn’t thick enough for its opening. But for now, at least, much of Canada is a wintry place. Edmonton’s recognition of that reality is one of its strengths. While it was somewhat overshadowed by the national grieving over the deaths in Iran, Canada was also in the news internationally for being the future part-time home of Prince Harry and Meghan, his wife. Dan Bilefsky took the national temperature on that news while I looked into the practical considerations facing the couple, who are formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Mark Landler, our London-based colleague, reports that “Megxit” is almost as divisive as Brexit in Britain. Michael McCain, the chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods, took to Twitter with his anger and frustration over what he saw as President Trump’s role in the airliner missile strike in Iran.

Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea,2020-01-19,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The authorities in China reported a third death from a mysterious virus and more than 130 new cases over the weekend, including ones found in Beijing and southern China for the first time. One new case was also reported in South Korea on Monday. The jump in cases raised questions about how the virus is being transmitted and added to concerns about the spread of the illness ahead of China’s busiest travel season. The health commission in Wuhan, a central Chinese city where the virus originated last month, said early Monday that 136 new cases had been detected on Saturday and Sunday, including one who died. Nine patients in the city remained critically ill. Two new cases were reported in Beijing, and one in Shenzhen, a booming metropolis in the south, near Hong Kong. That brought the total number of cases in China to around 200, more than double the number reported just a day earlier. The latest cases come amid growing concern among some experts that the outbreak could be more severe than China’s government has described. [Read: What we know about China’s new coronavirus.] The virus already appears to have spread outside China, with the authorities in South Korea reporting on Monday that a Chinese woman who arrived at the Incheon International Airport on Sunday from Wuhan had tested positive for the illness. Last week, three cases were reported in Thailand and Japan involving people who had traveled through Wuhan. And with hundreds of millions of people in China expected to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday, public health officials are working to stop a major outbreak. On Sunday, China’s central government sought to reassure the public that it had the situation under control. In Beijing’s most extensive remarks on the outbreak since it began last month, the National Health Commission said that experts agreed that an epidemic was “still preventable and controllable.” Still, the commission acknowledged that the source of the virus and its path of transmission were not fully understood. “The mutation of the virus still needs to be closely monitored,” the statement said. Of the new patients found in Wuhan over the weekend, 66 were men and 70 women, and their ages ranged from 25 to 89, the health commission reported on Monday. It said that they mostly had symptoms such as fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. Most people with the infection have contracted it through exposure to animals at a market in Wuhan that sells seafood and live animals, the authorities say. But the health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that some people who had come down with the virus had no exposure to the market. That acknowledgment raises the possibility that the virus could be present in other markets in Wuhan, experts said, adding to fears that more people might be at risk. “If you cannot find the source and control the source of the virus, you cannot extinguish the fire,” said David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Dr. Hui said the risk of the virus spreading from human to human on a broad scale appeared to be low, though he noted that the virus could mutate. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that while its analysis indicated that limited transmission of the virus is possible, it remained unclear whether it can easily spread from one person to another. The group said it would continue to examine the issue. “We do not have enough evidence to evaluate the full extent of human-to-human transmission,” its Manila office said. Some experts have suggested that there are probably far more cases of the illness than the authorities have disclosed. In previous incidents, like the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Chinese government withheld critical information. One estimate by researchers at Imperial College London suggested on Friday that there could now be as many as 1,700 cases of the new virus. The W.H.O. said on Sunday that China could potentially confirm more cases in the coming days and weeks as more people were screened for it. The new virus has brought back memories of the SARS outbreak, which was also caused by a coronavirus. SARS, which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets, originated in China and spread to other countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 800. While the new coronavirus appears to be less severe than SARS, public health officials around the world are exercising caution. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States announced that airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles would begin screening passengers from Wuhan for the virus. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University professor who worked to fight the SARS outbreak, said it was too early to know how dangerous the new virus might prove to be. “Until it becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, there’s not a major threat of a pandemic,” said Dr. Lipkin, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the university’s Mailman School of Public Health. “We need to prepare for the possibility that this could be a larger outbreak, and it could become a pandemic,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that it will.” Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul.

Harry and Meghan’s Hard Exit,2020-01-19,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — There is no such thing, it turns out, as being a part-time royal. The severance deal that Buckingham Palace announced on Saturday for Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, is most remarkable for how clean a break the royal family is making with two of its most popular, if disaffected, members — much more severe than the couple apparently expected. The British news media, which has likened the couple’s split with the royal family to Brexit, lost no time on Sunday in pronouncing the agreement the equivalent of a “hard Brexit,” similar to the uncompromising trade deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to pursue with the European Union this year. [Update: Prince Harry and Meghan exit Britain with final official engagement.] Far from carving out a “progressive new role within this institution,” as the couple hopefully declared when they unexpectedly announced their plans to “step back” from royal duties this month, Harry and Meghan will lose most of the privileges and perks of royalty once they give up their full-time status and forsake Britain for an uncertain future in Canada and the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the couple will no longer use their most exclusive titles, His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness, will forgo public funding of their activities and will repay more than $3 million for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, their residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Such trade-offs were unavoidable, experts said. “The arrangement they’ve come to is absolutely spot on,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “The family is trying to prevent a half-in, half-out arrangement, which doesn’t work.” But the deal announced left many unanswered questions, such as the tax implications of the split and who will pay for security, along with esoteric matters such as whether Harry and Meghan will ever appear on a royal balcony again. Prince Harry publicly addressed his decision for the first time on Sunday night. Speaking with a tone of regret but resolve at a charity fund-raiser, he said he and Meghan had hoped to continue carrying out some of their royal duties without public funding. But that proved impossible. “It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,” Harry said. “The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.” The prince insisted he was not abandoning his beloved country or the queen, but said, “As far as this goes, there really was no other option.” The status of the couple’s website and Instagram account, SussexRoyal, is also up in the air, according to officials at the palace, since the royal designation is usually reserved for working royals. For now, the site remains sprinkled with references to “His Royal Highness” and “Her Royal Highness.” It clearly demonstrates that Harry and Meghan envisioned a less thorough break from royal service. The site includes a lengthy section on the couple’s duties as the queen’s emissaries to the Commonwealth. But Harry was forced to relinquish the title of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. Losing the SussexRoyal name could hamper their moneymaking prospects, royal experts say, since it is imprinted on all of the couple’s charitable activities. But the experts also pointed that the HRH title, as it is informally known, carries less resonance in the United States than in Britain. The couple will retain their titles Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which the queen bestowed on them after they were married in 2018. And Harry remains a prince, sixth in line of succession, regardless of whether he asks people to address him as “Your Royal Highness.” Royal experts praised the warmth of the queen’s statement toward Meghan, and noted the monarch’s acknowledgment that the couple had pushed for these changes for months. Confronted with a challenge to the fabric of the monarchy, they said, she embraced a novel agreement that could serve as a blueprint for family members in future generations. Yet for all the warm words, Buckingham Palace is distancing itself from Harry and Meghan’s new life. It will not review or approve any of their profit-making ventures. The couple said that everything they did would “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,” deliberately vague language that officials said was intended to insulate the family from being held accountable for them. The palace will review the deal a year after it goes into effect this spring. Depending on how the transition goes, a palace official said, its terms could be modified in one direction or the other. The prince, who served as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, will give up his military titles, including captain general of the Royal Marines, which could be painful to him, according to people with ties to the family. He inherited those titles from his grandfather Prince Philip and has defined himself through his military service. But Harry will retain his connection to the Invictus Games, the global sports event for wounded, injured and sick service members that he founded in 2014. Forcing him to give that up, Ms. Junor said, would have been too wrenching, given his ties to the armed forces and injured soldiers. Among the unanswered questions is how much financial independence the couple will really have. Prince Harry has significant private holdings through a multimillion-dollar inheritance from his mother, Princess Diana. The duchess also has money from her acting career, when she was known as Meghan Markle and appeared in the legal television drama “Suits.” But they will give up public money from the Sovereign Grant, the primary vehicle for financing the royal family’s activities. According to their website, that accounts for 5 percent of their expenses. The remaining 95 percent comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, a hereditary estate owned by Prince Harry’s father, Prince Charles. He will continue to support the couple, officials say, but it is not clear that he will do so with funds from the duchy. That money is considered to be quasi-public, given that Charles owns the duchy in his capacity as the Prince of Wales. It is also not clear who will pay for the couple’s security, which could run into millions of dollars per year. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on those arrangements on Saturday. Security experts have said that Britain’s Home Office will probably continue to provide the couple with some police protection, given their status as prominent public figures. One area where the couple are likely to relish their separation from the royal family is in their relations with the tabloids. They have made it clear that they will no longer take part in the Royal Rota, the press pool that chronicles the activities of the royal family. Harry has accused the news media, particularly the tabloids, of hounding him and Meghan the same way the paparazzi did his mother, even blaming them for Diana’s death. The duchess has filed a lawsuit against a tabloid, The Mail on Sunday, for publishing a private letter that she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Prince Harry also began separate legal proceedings against the owners of The Sun and The Daily Mirror, accusing them of hacking his phone’s voice mail messages going back as far as the early 2000s. How the relationship between the couple and the press will develop, royal watchers said, will be one of the most closely watched elements of their new status.']","The couple’s wish to carve out more “progressive” roles has led to the loss of perks, privileges and titles."
Huawei Executive Meng Wanzhou’s Extradition Fight: What to Know,2020-01-19,By Dan Bilefsky and Tracy Sherlock,"['VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Global politics, big money, high technology and the intricacies of Canadian law will come together on Monday when the extradition hearing of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, begins in a Vancouver courtroom. Ms. Meng, 47, a former secretary at Huawei who rose to become a public face of the company, was arrested in Vancouver in December 2018 after the United States requested her extradition on fraud charges. She has been detained in the city since then. The arrest has put Canada in a difficult spot between two world powers — China and the United States — and severely damaged the country’s relations with China. Huawei is one of China’s most prominent companies. Shortly after Ms. Meng’s arrest, China detained — in retaliation, some say — two Canadians and accused them of espionage. It has also punished Canada by restricting imports of pork, canola oil and other Canadian products. Complicating matters, Canada is in the process of deciding whether to allow Huawei to participate in the development of its next-generation 5G network. The issue is fraught because the United States government has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying and stealing technology from its Western rivals. The Trump administration has argued that the company is in thrall to the Chinese government and a threat to national security. Huawei vehemently denies that. As the legal case unfolds at the imposing Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver, here is the background and what’s at stake. Ms. Meng is the eldest daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei. She was born in the western city of Chengdu, has a master’s degree in accounting and began her career at Huawei 25 years ago. Before her arrest, her responsibilities at the company, where she is also deputy chairwoman of the board, included announcing its financial results. Ms. Meng, who is also known as Cathy or Sabrina, is married and has four children. Since her arrest, Ms. Meng’s life has been circumscribed. She has been out on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or $7.7 million, and relatively free to travel about Vancouver, where she and her husband own two expensive homes. She is under 24-hour surveillance and must wear a GPS tracker on her ankle. She is now living in a gated seven-bedroom mansion, valued at about 14 million Canadian dollars, in the city’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. The judge in the case allowed her to move there from her other home: a six-bedroom house in another wealthy neighborhood valued at an estimated 6 million Canadian dollars. Under the terms of her bail, she is allowed to leave her house until an 11 p.m. curfew, including traveling to Richmond, a nearby city with a diverse Chinese community, food courts with regional Chinese delicacies and a vibrant cultural life. Friends and work colleagues can visit her. Her family came to Canada during the Christmas holiday period, according to a member of her security detail. Since being detained, Ms. Meng recently wrote in a letter published on Huawei’s website, she has experienced “moments of fear” but also found more time for herself. She passes the time by, among other things, reading and oil painting. Ms. Meng’s bail conditions have spurred anger in Canada because critics have contrasted her surroundings with the harsh conditions of the Canadians arrested by China, who are denied access to lawyers and their families. In January 2019, the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment that, among other things, charges that Ms. Meng fraudulently deceived four banks into clearing transactions in Iran through a subsidiary company, in violation of sanctions against Iran. Over several days, Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes will examine whether the case against Ms. Meng satisfies a fundamental requirement for extraditing a person under Canadian law: that the crime she is accused of in the United States constitutes a crime in Canada. This is known as the legal concept of “double criminality.” Prosecutors in Canada are focusing on the accusation that Ms. Meng lied to representatives of the bank HSBC in 2013 about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, a company doing business in Iran. Prosecutors contend she told HSBC that Skycom was a partner although it was, in fact, a Huawei subsidiary, putting HSBC at risk of sanctions. “Inducing a bank to extend financial services by lying to it is criminal,” the prosecution wrote in documents submitted to the court. Ms. Meng has denied the allegations. Her defense argues that the crime she is being accused of does not constitute a crime in Canada because Canada has not imposed sanctions against companies doing business in Iran. They also contend that there was no risk of financial loss for HSBC, a prerequisite for fraud to have taken place, under Canadian law. “In essence, this is a case of U.S. sanction enforcement masquerading as Canadian fraud,” Ms. Meng’s lawyers argued in documents released Friday. If the judge rules that the case doesn’t satisfy the double criminality requirement, then Ms. Meng could go free. Later this year, the court will address another argument Ms. Meng’s legal team is making: that her rights were violated when she was first detained. Canadian border officials questioned her for three hours — and seized her phones, asked for her passcodes and searched her luggage — before arresting her. Her lawyers contend that this means that Canada and the United States conducted a “covert criminal investigation.” If the judge finds that Ms. Meng’s rights were violated, the case could be dismissed. The defense has filed a separate civil case against the Canadian authorities over the manner of Ms. Meng’s arrest, and the date for that hearing has yet to be announced. Gary Botting, an extradition lawyer who has written several textbooks on Canadian extradition law, said he thought Ms. Meng had a good case that her rights were violated. And Richard Kurland, a leading immigration lawyer, said the case was significant because it could help define when people’s constitutional rights kick in after they arrive in the country. Very high. Changes to Canada’s extradition laws in 1999 — which are still widely criticized by human rights groups — mean that about 90 percent of extradition requests are granted. Legal experts say an extradition request can be turned down if it is deemed to be politically motivated or if a person extradited could face the death penalty. Shortly after Ms. Meng’s arrest, President Trump said he might consider interceding in the case if that helped him reach a trade deal with China. Her lawyers have argued that these statements were “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law” and should disqualify the United States from being able to extradite Ms. Meng. If Ms. Meng loses the extradition case, she could appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada in a process that could take years. Eventually the case would move from the legal arena to the political one. A final judicial ruling against Ms. Meng would go to the justice minister in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, who would then decide whether to issue the order to send Ms. Meng to the United States.']","A Canadian judge will hear evidence on whether to extradite Meng Wanzhou, the company’s chief financial officer, to the United States to face fraud charges.

Why Europe Is Finally Paying Attention to Libya,2020-01-17,By Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — For more than eight years, the Libyan conflict has festered and the European Union has mostly looked away. Libya mattered, if at all, as a playground for terrorism and a source of the migrants disrupting European politics. But with the recent involvement of Russia and Turkey on opposite sides of a nasty civil war, adding to the meddling of other neighbors, Europe has suddenly woken to the implications of a new Great Game, this time in North Africa, that is rapidly destabilizing its backyard. Belatedly, the Continent is paying attention. On Sunday, after months of effort, Germany and the United Nations will gather most of the main actors to try to at least bring a sustained halt to the fighting and get outside powers to give Libyans the space to attempt to find some kind of political reconciliation. It will not be easy, as potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying. Increasingly, the fate of Libya’s precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance. “There has been a major reawakening of geopolitical interest in Libya,” said Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund and an expert on Turkey and the Mediterranean. “That begins with issues of migration, energy, security and counterterrorism,” he added. “But it is just as much about the geopolitics of relations with Russia and Turkey. If they had not been so assertive, Libya would not have attracted such attention now.” The new European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel that the bloc could even send troops to safeguard a potential cease-fire, a move that Italy and Greece have already suggested they would be interested in committing troops to. “If there is a cease-fire in Libya, then the E.U. must be prepared to help implement and monitor this cease-fire — possibly also with soldiers, for example as part of an E.U. mission,” he said. But Europe looks weak and peripheral. Kristina Kausch, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said, “Now the Europeans are worried, but it’s too late and we’re out of the picture.” “Russia and regional powers are playing Europe in our own neighborhood,” she added. The Libyan mess began with the 2011 overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi after intervention by European forces, with American help. Justified on humanitarian grounds, the war produced chaos when those same Western forces largely abandoned energy-rich Libya to warring militias. Many weapons of the old regime spread all over the sub-Saharan region, feeding other militants and terrorist groups, and producing thousands of refugees and migrants seeking safety in Europe. Libya remains a major transit and jumping-off point for sub-Saharan Africans hoping to make the crossing to Europe. Since the migration crisis of 2015-16, “the E.U. viewed Libya mainly through the prism of the migration problem,” said Claudia Gazzini, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Individual European countries, at the same time, pursued their own, divergent interests in Libya, often at cross-purposes. But the entry of Russian proxies into the conflict last year and, more recently, Turkey’s pledge to send its own forces into the mix, meant Europe could no longer ignore the matter. It has also made the fissures in the Europeans’ approach to Libya more and more untenable as the civil war turns into a wider playground for outsiders. On one side, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France and now Russia support Khalifa Hifter, whose forces have laid siege to Tripoli, the capital, threatening the internationally backed government there. On the other, Qatar, Italy and now Turkey support the Government of National Accord. Created by a 2015 United Nations-sponsored political deal, the government is led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The divisions between France and Italy have already split the European Union and weakened its positioning on Libya. As the European Union’s top diplomat, Mr. Borrell has brought new thinking and “a renewed energy and willingness to look at Libya as a crisis and a war in and of itself,” said Ms. Gazzini of the International Crisis Group. In the last month, Mr. Borrell has repeatedly emphasized the dangers of Turkish military involvement in Libya and has criticized Europe’s preference for citing international law as a response to every conflict. “We Europeans, since we don’t want to participate in a military solution, we barricade ourselves in the belief there is no military solution,” he told the European Parliament this week. “Nobody will be very happy if, on the Libyan coast, there is a ring of military bases from the Russian and Turkish navies in front of the Italian coast.” He added in a Twitter message: “But this is something that could very much happen. We need to engage strongly, keep Libya united and find a peaceful solution to this conflict.” That will not be so easily done. Just last week, Russia and Turkey brought both Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj to Moscow to get them to sign a permanent cease-fire agreement, another sign of Russian diplomatic activity to fill vacuums created by Europe and the United States. But Mr. Hifter, who believes he can still take Tripoli, refused to obey his Russian backers and left Moscow without signing. Some believe that he will agree to do so on Sunday in Berlin, and that his signature, sincere or not, will be a kind of gesture from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The Trump administration, which had supported the Sarraj government and the United Nations process, reversed course last April, after a meeting with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to the International Crisis Group. But Washington is not very involved, and has just announced that it will sharply reduce the United States military presence in West Africa, intended to fight terrorism alongside the French, so the American influence will be further eroded. A senior State Department official said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who altered his schedule to attend the high-level meeting, would urge three things: the continuation of a cease-fire; the withdrawal of all external forces; and a return to a Libyan-led political process facilitated by the United Nations. But as with the European Union, there would appear to be little force behind those goals, and the messaging has stopped short of expressing support for the government of Mr. Sarraj. Historical alliances in Libya and interest in gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean are at the heart of the problem, and have raised the stakes for the outside parties. Migration aside, Italy, the former colonial power, and its energy giant, Eni, are key players in Libya. So stability matters for Rome, and the government has also tried to mediate between Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj. But with the trend of the fighting moving Mr. Hifter’s way, and Eni shifting to more commercial interests in the eastern Mediterranean, the Italian position has become more ambiguous. “Russian influence started first and foremost on gas and oil infrastructure,” said Tarek Megerisi of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “If a situation unfolds whereby Russia and Turkey make peace, and Russia makes heavy investments in oil and gas infrastructure in Libya, that means that’s one more pipeline into Europe that’s in the hands of Russians,” he added. “That’s quite dangerous.” For other Mediterranean neighbors, Greece and Cyprus, who stand to gain if gas exploration yields commercially viable finds, Libya is crucial. Despite the cacophony, the meeting in Berlin, if modestly successful, could begin turning the tide for European involvement in Libya, and ultimately for Libya itself, Mr. Megerisi said. “It’s not that Europe is incapable, it seems that it’s unwilling,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be that way. They do have tools at their disposal. They do have some cards to play.” Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jason Horowitz and Emma Bubola from Rome.']","As potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying over Libya and the fate of its precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance, the Continent is suddenly getting involved."
"As Libya Descends Into Chaos, Foreign Powers Look for a Way Out",2020-01-18,By David D. Kirkpatrick and Declan Walsh,"['TRIPOLI, Libya — Russia has sent hundreds of mercenaries to back militias laying siege to Libya’s capital. The United Arab Emirates has sent jets and drones, while Egypt has provided logistical support. To stop them, Turkey has sent dozens of military advisers and is now shipping in hundreds of Syrian militiamen. Walid Khashib, a 35-year-old Libyan bank clerk, just wishes they would all leave. “We Libyans don’t want Turkish or Syrian or Russian or any other foreign troops,” said Mr. Khashib, who had taken advantage of a temporary cease-fire to visit the rubble of his bombed-out home in eastern Tripoli. “We just want the issue to be resolved.” The conflict in oil-rich Libya has become one of the Middle East’s most intractable proxy wars. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt are backing the former Libyan army general Khalifa Hifter, who is laying siege to the capital, Tripoli. Turkey is defending the United Nations-backed government there. Most of the international powers with an interest in Libya will gather in Berlin on Sunday in the latest effort to find a way out of what has become a multinational free-for-all. Mr. Hifter, a 76-year-old would-be strongman, began an assault on the capital last April. As his advance stalled out last fall, Russia and Turkey jumped in on opposing sides, establishing themselves as potential kingmakers. But their effort to broker a cease-fire in Moscow this week ended Monday when Mr. Hifter walked out, refusing to sign the agreement. The United States and Europe, who have largely stood on the sidelines, now hope that the Berlin conference will allow them to wrest back control of the discussion of Libya’s future. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the leaders of more than a dozen other countries plan to attend. But in Tripoli expectations are low. None of the foreign powers engaged in Libya — motivated by commercial interests, geopolitical games or regional and ideological rivalries — have so far shown any willingness to back off. Mr. Hifter has said he would participate in the conference, but has never shown a willingness to accept any deal that gives him less than full control of the country. His main foreign sponsor, the United Arab Emirates, had urged him to keep fighting rather than accept a cease-fire, according to three diplomats familiar with the discussions. Leaders of the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli have also shown a recent distaste for the need to compromise with Mr. Hifter, claiming that the new influx of Turkish support gave them the potential for military victory. “Turkey will help us as much as they can to defeat the advance of Hifter’s forces,” Khalid Elmeshri, a top official of the provisional government, said in an interview on Thursday. And Libyans fear that even if the international summit meeting produces a new cease-fire, it may be no more than a pause before a new escalation of the war. Renewed fighting could be even worse, many Tripoli residents said, because it would be between professional soldiers and trained mercenaries, not Libyan amateurs. Libya has struggled to emerge from chaos since NATO forces ousted the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nine years ago. The power vacuum made Libya a tempting target for ambitious foreign powers eyeing its vast oil reserves and long Mediterranean coastline. Its permeable desert borders have also made it a pressure point for the West, as both a haven for extremists and a jumping-off point for thousands of Europe-bound migrants. For years, Washington exerted little public pressure to stop regional partners like the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar or Turkey from fueling the chaos by supporting rival Libyan militias. And the messages from Washington have been mixed. Days after Mr. Pompeo urged Mr. Hifter to stop his assault on Tripoli in April, President Trump called Mr. Hifter to commend him. The next day, Mr. Hifter began shelling civilian neighborhoods of the capital for the first time. “The United States has not been paying any attention to the Libyan file, and it is a big problem,” Mr. Elmeshri said. He said that the United States could have used its influence to force Mr. Hifter to the negotiating table. Mr. Hifter, he noted, is a former C.I.A. client and an American citizen. Europe’s Libya policy has been stymied by division. French special forces have sometimes aided Mr. Hifter as an ally against extremists, while Italy has paid rival militias to help reduce the flow of migrants. Now, though, what had long been an indirect contest among regional powers, has escalated toward a more direct conflict between Russia and Turkey. Last fall, after Mr. Hifter’s forces had stalled out for six months on the outskirts of Tripoli, Moscow surprised the West by intervening to tip the balance, dispatching as many as 1,500 Russian fighters — mainly mercenaries from the private, Kremlin-linked Wagner Group — to restart his advance. They brought skilled snipers, guided artillery, and better coordinated air support. By early this month, their assistance had helped Mr. Hifter advance several miles on multiple fronts around Tripoli and to capture the strategic coastal city of Surt. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may have been motivated by a desire to revive lucrative weapons deals and other commercial contracts that Russia had enjoyed under Colonel Qaddafi. But he also appears to simply to relish embarrassing the West at a very low cost to Russia, several foreign diplomats said. For his part, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may have intervened in part to counter the influence of Mr. Hifter’s other chief backer, the Emirates, a regional foe of Turkey in an ideological cold war over political Islam. But Mr. Erdogan has even greater financial interests. Turkish businesses had as much as several billion dollars in contracts with Libya before the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi, and Turkish construction firms stand to profit heavily from the country’s future reconstruction. In December, Mr. Erdogan signed an agreement with the Tripoli government that could give Turkey rights to exploit mineral and other resources under a broad section of the Mediterranean — an agreement that would lose all value if Mr. Hifter took over. When Mr. Hifter refused to sign the proposed Russian-Turkish cease-fire, Mr. Erdogan talked about “teaching a lesson” to the Libyan commander and said Thursday that he was sending troops. Mr. Elmeshri said about 1,000 Turkish troops were already there. But Libyan fighters and Western diplomats said that they had seen no sign of such a large contingent of Turks. Instead, Mr. Erdogan appears to have shipped over Syrian fighters from some of the same Syrian militias that Turkey recently deployed in northern Syria — transferring battle-hardened fighters directly from one intractable Middle East proxy war to another. Two Libyan fighters defending Tripoli on Friday said they had recently fought alongside as many as 200 members of a Turkish-backed Syrian militia. Two Western diplomats said that, in private conversations, Tripoli government officials acknowledged the presence of the Syrian fighters. One diplomat said at least 400 Syrians were fighting, and the other said the number could be as high as 1,200. Embarrassed by the use of mercenaries — an accusation the Tripoli government’s supporters often hurl at Mr. Hifter — the authorities there may be seeking to hide their presence. Tripoli has cut off the previously easy access to the front lines for visiting journalists. Some Western diplomats said the Tripoli government had also taken away the smartphones of the Syrian fighters to prevent them from posting their Libyan exploits on social media. Mr. Elmeshri denied Turkey has sent any “Syrian nationals.” But he acknowledged that Turkey might have sent fighters who could pass for Syrian. Some were Arabic-speaking ethnic Turkmen, he said, “who live by the Syrian border and came here to facilitate the translation and other things.” Militants in northern Syria, reached by phone, said Turkey was conducting a concerted effort to recruit young fighters to the Libyan war. Several fighters said that in the last week hundreds of men had been drawn by promises of a $2,000 monthly salary. “You could call them mercenaries,” said a fighter named Khatab, who asked to be identified by his surname only. “They are not making enough money at home, so it’s really tempting to go to Libya.” As rumors of the Turkish and Syrian newcomers circulated through Tripoli, some residents said they feared that foreign powers would now shape Libya’s future. “If one of the international powers presses with its iron hands for something, either side will do as it’s told,” said Muattasim Billah, 30, who was selling toys from a cart in the capital’s main square. “Something could happen in the blink of an eye.” David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Tripoli, and Declan Walsh from Cairo.

Bodies of Ukrainians Killed in Iran Plane Crash Are Returned Home,2020-01-19,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — In a solemn ceremony at an airport in Ukraine on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky paid his respects to the 11 citizens from his country who were killed when Iran’s military mistakenly shot down a passenger jet in Tehran this month. Mr. Zelensky has grappled with the diplomacy around the downing of the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The missile strike put his government in the middle of a conflict between the United States and Iran, and he has walked a fine line as his country sought answers from Tehran. On the morning of the crash, Iranian air defenses had been on high alert after Tehran launched ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq in response to the United States’ killing of a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Iran was anticipating retaliation to its missile strikes on the bases. Though the Ukrainian government quickly concluded that a missile had downed the plane, killing all 176 people aboard, it refrained from public criticism of Tehran until its investigative team on the ground had found irrefutable proof, including shrapnel holes in the plane’s fuselage. American, Canadian and British leaders blamed Iran for the tragedy before the Ukrainian government spoke out. But Ukrainian officials said that their patient approach had forced the Iranian government to finally acknowledge that it had shot down the plane in error, an embarrassing about-face after days of denials. That approach may be tested again as Iran, which was accused of stalling the investigation, appeared to backtrack on sending the plane’s so-called black boxes to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. A day after Hassan Rezaeifar, the Iranian official leading the investigation, was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency as saying that the devices would be transferred to Ukraine, he said on Sunday that he had no plans to turn over the flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 plane. Mr. Rezaeifar, a director at Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, previously said his organization lacked the capability to decipher the black boxes and would send them abroad for analysis. But on Sunday he said that it would try to analyze them in Iran and that “no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,” such as France or Ukraine. While the cause of the crash is no longer in dispute, the data and voice recorders may bring to light harrowing — and for Iran politically damning — details of the final moments of the pilots and passengers. For Mr. Zelensky, returning the bodies of the Ukrainian victims, including nine crew members and two passengers, had also been a priority.

Mr. Zelensky, along with his top aides and cabinet members, stood silently as the coffins passed. Later, the procession continued through a crowd of Ukraine International Airlines employees. Pilots in flight uniforms doffed their hats and knelt, while flight attendants held bouquets of flowers. The first coffins carried out were those of the three Ukrainian pilots — Aleksei Naumkin, Vladimir Gaponenko and Sergei Khomenko — who died along with their passengers. After Tehran initially hinted, without providing any evidence, that the pilots had flown erratically and therefore contributed to the crash by alarming air defense forces, Ukraine’s government pressed Iran to admit that the claim was false. The pilots, in fact, had flown the usual departure route for Tehran’s airport.']",President Volodymyr Zelensky attended a ceremony for the 11 Ukrainians killed on the airliner shot down by Iran.
"‘Chewing Gum Tycoon’ of Lotte Group, Shin Kyuk-ho, Dies at 98",2020-01-19,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Shin Kyuk-ho, who built a chewing-gum business into \u200bthe \u200bhugely successful Lotte \u200bGroup in South Korea and Japan, only to see his sons squabble over the corporate empire, died on Sunday in Seoul. He was 98. The company, South Korea’s fifth-largest business conglomerate, announced the death. Mr. Shin was the last of the rags-to-riches founders of South Korea’s major family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, and his death represented the end of an era for many South Koreans. Charismatic chaebol tycoons like Mr. Shin were credited with engineering the dramatic industrialization that transformed the country into one of Asia’s leading economies after the destruction of the Korean War in the 1950s. Like other chaebol founders, Mr. Shin’s beginnings were humble. He was born in a rural village in Ulsan, in the southeast of what is now South Korea, in 1921, when the country was still languishing under Japan’s colonial rule. He was the eldest son in a family with 10 children. The young Mr. Shin had a literary bent, and yearned to become a novelist. He was raising pigs in his village after graduating from an agricultural high school when he decided to stow away in a ship to Japan in 1941 to pursue a literary career there. In Tokyo, he delivered milk and newspapers during the day while attending college at night. His first serious business venture in Japan, a factory producing cutting oil, a lubricant used in metalworking, was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid during World War II. Mr. Shin never became a novelist, but he named his first successful business, Lotte, a company that marketed chewing gum, after Charlotte, the female character in Wolfgang von Goethe’s novel “The Sorrows of Young Werther.” Mr. Shin was especially proud of the name Lotte, calling it “the best choice in my life.” Mr. Shin began selling Lotte bubble gum in 1948, after watching American soldiers in postwar Japan handing out chewing gum to children. It was an instant success, and Lotte soon expanded into chocolate and other confections, as well as trading and real estate. Although prosperous in Japan, Mr. Shin never forgot his roots. He retained his Korean citizenship and had homes in both countries. As soon as South Korea and Japan established diplomatic ties in 1965, he began investing in his home country, building hotels and department stores in Seoul. Lotte helped spawn, and then benefited from, a rising consumer culture in South Korea as the middle class expanded with the rapid growth of an export-driven economy. In the 1980s, Lotte executives objected when Mr. Shin began building Lotte World, a landmark hotel, mall and amusement-park complex in Jamsil, which was then a sandy wilderness in southern Seoul. They said there was no market there. But Mr. Shin predicted correctly that Lotte World would attract such throngs that the area would have chronic traffic jams. Today, Lotte is a household name in South Korea, running 90 affiliates that together \u200b\u200bgenerate 100 trillion won, or $86 billion, in annual revenues. The name is on hotels, department stores and apartment buildings, as well as nationwide chains of shopping malls, theme parks, movie theaters, duty-free stores, coffee shops and fast-food restaurants. Mr. Shin kept his last promise to South Korea — building its tallest building — when Lotte completed its 123-story Lotte World Tower in Jamsil in 2017. “His generous investment in his war-devastated home\u200b \u200bcountry and his dedication helped rebuild \u200bSouth Korea and lay the foundation of its economic prosperity,” the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobby for big businesses\u200b, said in a statement on Sunday. Despite his success, Mr. Shin’s reputation \u200bwas tarnished in his last years. While he \u200binvolved his children \u200bin the company’s management, \u200bhe held on to his \u200bkinglike control, never establishing a clear heir apparent. As he slipped into dementia, his elder son, Dong-joo, \u200bwho had been put in charge of Lotte’s operation in Japan, \u200band another son, Dong-bin, who oversaw Lotte in South Korea, started a winner-take-all tussle for the leadership of the Lotte empire, \u200baccusing each other of financial wrongdoings. Shin Dong-bin, now chairman of Lotte Group, \u200bemerged victorious\u200b, staging a coup that dethroned his father \u200bas chairman\u200b of the board of directors at Lotte’s holding company. \u200bBut the brothers’ squabbling led to an investigation by \u200bSouth Korean \u200bprosecutors that led in 2016 to \u200bthe indictment of Mr. Shin, the two sons and other family members on embezzlement, tax evasion and other charges. \u200b A frail Mr. Shin appeared in court in 2017 in a wheelchair and carrying a cane and seemed unable to grasp what was happening. “Am I indicted? Who indicted me? I own everything in Lotte!” he said at a hearing. He threw a microphone and wielded the cane as his lawyers escorted him out of the courtroom at the judge’s order. Mr. Shin was sentenced to four years in prison for \u200bembezzlement and other charges. But the Seoul court decided not to imprison him because of his poor health. His son Shin Dong-bin was convicted of embezzlement and breach of trust but was \u200ballowed to run Lotte after his 20-month prison term was suspended. Mr. Shin’s first wife, who was Korean, died \u200byoung, leaving Mr. Shin with a daughter, Shin Young-ja. He then married a Japanese woman, with whom he had the two sons. Mr. Shin also maintained a common-law marriage with a former winner of the Miss Lotte contest in South Korea. They had a daughter, Shin Yoo-mi.']",Mr. Shin transformed a small business in postwar Tokyo into ​a ​corporate giant spanning South Korea and Japan.
Bodies of Ukrainians Killed in Iran Plane Crash Are Returned Home,2020-01-19,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — In a solemn ceremony at an airport in Ukraine on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky paid his respects to the 11 citizens from his country who were killed when Iran’s military mistakenly shot down a passenger jet in Tehran this month. Mr. Zelensky has grappled with the diplomacy around the downing of the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The missile strike put his government in the middle of a conflict between the United States and Iran, and he has walked a fine line as his country sought answers from Tehran. On the morning of the crash, Iranian air defenses had been on high alert after Tehran launched ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq in response to the United States’ killing of a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Iran was anticipating retaliation to its missile strikes on the bases. Though the Ukrainian government quickly concluded that a missile had downed the plane, killing all 176 people aboard, it refrained from public criticism of Tehran until its investigative team on the ground had found irrefutable proof, including shrapnel holes in the plane’s fuselage.

Clashes Shake Beirut as Anti-Government Protests Explode in Violence,2020-01-18,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Riot police used water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to clear a large protest camp in the heart of the Lebanese capital on Saturday, sparking clashes with demonstrators that wounded scores of people and turned Beirut’s commercial center into a battle zone. The violence, with tents set on fire and protesters targeting the police with stones and fireworks, was the most intense since mass protests against corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political elite erupted three months ago. Despite continued demonstrations and worsening violence, Lebanon’s politicians have proven unable to take meaningful steps to assuage the protesters’ anger or stop the country’s swift slide toward an economic crisis. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, facing the mass protests, resigned on Oct. 29. His designated successor has failed to form a government while the Lebanese pound, which has been pegged to the American dollar for decades, has been rapidly losing value on the black market, fueling the protesters’ economic grievances. “Why else would we come to protest? Because there is no work and people are hungry,” said protester Miraz al-Jundi, 35, wearing an industrial face mask and standing amid clouds of tear gas. Nearby, young men hurled stones at the security forces and a woman fell to the asphalt, choking. “If the authorities don’t respond, there will be more violence,” he said. Saturday’s protest, under the banner “We will not pay the price,” was meant to unite people from across Lebanon against the most recent effort to form a new government, by Hassan Diab, an engineering professor and former education minister who was designated premier on Dec. 19. The protesters accuse the leaders in Lebanon’s sect-based political system of widespread corruption that has left Lebanon with poor infrastructure, few services and a sinking economy. Calling for their ouster with the slogan “All of them means all of them,” the protesters have called for their replacement by a government of experts who can address the small Mediterranean country’s many crises. They see Mr. Diab as a product of the system they seek to overturn. “We want to bring down the government. We want a state that respects us,” said Khalid al-Naimi, 23, a bus driver who had joined the clashes. But like many of the protesters, when asked who he wanted to take charge if the current system were toppled, he offered only vague suggestions. “We want people who understand,” he said. “Engineers, doctors, people who have nothing to do with politics.” Saturday began with protesters from around Lebanon flooding into Beirut to join marches toward the Parliament building. After they gathered there, clashes broke out, with protesters throwing stones and shooting fireworks and the security forces firing tear gas. The confrontation spread as the security forces cleared a protest camp in Beirut’s central square, where a number of tents were set on fire. By evening, they were locked in back and forth clashes on a main commercial street in front of the Le Gray hotel, one of the city’s finest. Protesters lit dumpsters on fire and hurled stones as riot police launched volleys of tear gas and fired water cannons. The booms of fireworks ricocheted off skyscrapers and ambulances screamed by, ferrying off the wounded. More than 65 people were hospitalized and more than 100 were treated on sight, George Kittaneh, the head of the Lebanese Red Cross, said in a phone call with LBC, a local television station. Lebanon’s interior minister, Raya El Hassan, criticized the protesters for attacking security forces. “I always asserted the right to protest, but for the protests to turn into a blatant assault on the security forces, on public and private property, is condemned and not acceptable at all,” Ms. El Hassan wrote on Twitter. The Internal Security Forces said some of its officers had been wounded by protesters throwing tiles they had broken off walls in a shopping district. Violence had been building over the last week, as protesters, furious that banks have imposed unofficial capital controls and refused to let customers withdraw dollars, shattered the windows of bank branches and broke security cameras. Human rights groups have criticized the security forces for dealing violently with demonstrators. While many protesters say they long for political change, they have been driven to act by the country’s precarious economic situation. Near the clashes, Raed al-Arja, 50, said he had been laid off from his job as a truck driver in December and had little hope of finding a new job. So on Saturday, he had come with his wife, their two children and some other relatives by bus from northern Lebanon to join the protest. “The politicians don’t get it, so we came to make it clear that the Lebanese people don’t want them,” he said. “They lied to us. They told us they would fix the country, but we realized that the ones who destroyed the country can’t fix it.” He carried a Lebanese flag and his daughter, Rayan, 15, and son, Abdel-Hamid, 13, both wore hard hats, yellow rain jackets, and face masks to protect them from tear gas and flying rocks. Despite the violence, he had felt it was important from them to protest, he said. “Our generation got tricked,” he said. “We followed the leaders.

"China’s Birthrate Hits Historic Low, in Looming Crisis for Beijing",2020-01-17,By Sui-Lee Wee and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world’s most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality. About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born. Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized. Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don’t see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted. “It’s a society where nobody wants to get married and people can’t afford to have children,” said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. “On a deeper level, you would have to think about what kind of society China will become, not just demographically, but socially.” Eno Zhang, a 37-year-old engineer in a tech company in Beijing, said he had argued with his parents for 10 years about his decision not to have children. They have since given up, he said. “I value my spiritual life and hobbies,” Mr. Zhang said. “Children will consume too much of my energy. This is something I cannot accept.” While many countries are struggling with low fertility rates and aging populations, these issues are even more pressing in China, because the country’s underdeveloped social safety net means that most older adults rely heavily on their families to pay for health care, retirement and other expenses. Many young married couples are expected to shoulder the burden of taking care of their parents, in-laws and grandparents, without the support of siblings. The birthrate in China fell to 10.48 per thousand last year, the lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, a decline that has important implications for the country’s economy and labor pool. If birthrates continue to fall while life expectancy increases, there will not be enough young people to support the economy and the elderly, the fastest-growing segment of the population. That will put pressure on the country’s underfunded pension systems, its overcrowded hospitals, and companies.  Making matters worse, the slowing birthrate has meant that China’s main state pension fund, which relies on tax revenues from its work force, risks running out of money by 2035 because of a decline in the number of workers, according to research commissioned by the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Despite the looming demographic crisis, the government still maintains tight control over reproduction.  The ruling Communist Party had sought for three decades to slow population growth by limiting most couples to one child and forcing many women to undergo abortions and sterilizations. In 2015, alarmed by the slump in births, it increased that limit to two children.  Even as the government is now trying to encourage people to have babies, it is sending mixed signals. It still punishes couples who exceed the birth restrictions. The authorities fine single women who bear children, and bar them from using reproductive technologies like freezing their eggs.  The government’s effort to raise the birthrate is also running into broader economic and social changes.  Education, housing and health care costs are rising. More women are getting university degrees and are reluctant to interrupt their careers. Some among the current generation of women of childbearing age, themselves the product of the “one child” policy, don’t see what the fuss about offspring is all about. Dong Chang, a 28-year-old administrative employee at a dentist’s clinic in Beijing, said millennials like her enjoyed spending on themselves without batting an eyelid and would find it hard to sacrifice their wants for a child. “We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish,” she said. “How can I raise a child when I’m still a child myself? And take care of him and feed him at midnight?” Ms. Dong said that she was living with her boyfriend but that they had decided to not get married for the time being because they didn’t want their parents to hound them about having children. Melody Lin, a 26-year-old worker at a nonprofit, said she couldn’t think of a reason to have a child. She said she had thought about conforming to societal norms and starting a family but decided against it after reading arguments that not all women need to have children. “My parents think that I’m still young and will change my mind when I get older, but I think it’s unlikely,” she said. China’s total fertility rate — an estimate of the number of babies a woman would have over her lifetime — has fallen to 1.6 children per woman, and for years has generally remained below the “replacement” level of 2.1. That means China could soon see a shrinking population and a work force too small to support its pensioners. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said last year that China’s population contraction would begin in 2027. Others believe it will come sooner or has already begun. The accuracy and completeness of China’s population figures, like other sensitive statistics, have been questioned for years, making exact projections and comparisons difficult. Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, said he expected the low fertility rate to continue for at least a decade. “There are a lot of parallels with this demographic crisis to global warming,” Dr. Cai said. “The waters are rising slowly, and we need a longer term strategy to deal with it.” Elsie Chen contributed research.']","In a country where most older adults rely heavily on their families, the continuing drop in births could have a seismic effect in the decades to come."
S.U.V. in Forbidden City Prompts Rage at China’s Rich,2020-01-18,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The photos prompted outrage almost as soon as they were posted. They showed two women inside one of China’s most sacred spaces, the Forbidden City in Beijing, smiling as they showed off a glistening Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. On Weibo, a Twitterlike site, one of the women bragged about getting exclusive access to the palace, a notoriously congested tourist site, saying she had gone there to “run wild.” The photos, which were posted on Friday, have set off debate in China about the privileges enjoyed by wealthy families, at a time when President Xi Jinping is trying to persuade the public that he is working to eliminate corruption and to reduce the gap between rich and poor. Many people denounced the woman, who had frequently boasted about her wealth on social media, as being out of touch. They said she had desecrated the Forbidden City, the former home of emperors, which Mr. Xi has sought to turn into a global symbol of Chinese cultural heritage. “Don’t roll your privileges over China’s face,” wrote a Weibo user named Ding Lei. The palace is typically closed to vehicles, and it was unclear how the woman and the Mercedes had gained access. The Palace Museum, which was also widely criticized on social media, acknowledged in a statement on Friday that a car had entered the Forbidden City on Monday, while it was closed to the public, but gave no other details. Officials at the museum said they were “deeply distressed” by what had happened, and they vowed to impose “strict management” to prevent future mishaps. The woman who posted the photos under the user name Lu Xiaobao LL initially defended her behavior, saying in a follow-up post that she was at the Forbidden City to see an exhibit. “It’s not illegal to take a picture, right?” she wrote, according to screenshots published by the Chinese news media. “It is fine if you guys don’t know that but it is really not O.K. to curse.” Her social media posts, which drew widespread ridicule, have since been erased, and she did not immediately respond to a message on Saturday seeking comment. Photos of the woman’s visit spread swiftly across China’s internet, drawing hundreds of thousands of comments and inspiring an outpouring of memes and commentary. Some people posted novellas describing the imagined life of a wealthy Beijing ingénue looking for adventure. Others circulated fake advertisements for Mercedes-Benz, boasting that its vehicles could traverse any terrain, even the Forbidden City. The widespread anger over the photos reflects anxieties in Chinese society about the privileges enjoyed by well-connected individuals, analysts said, at a time when the government is promising equal access to education, health care and social services. “Before, people in China accepted that there was a gap between rich and poor,” said Yik Chan Chin, a lecturer in media and communication studies at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. “Now, they no longer accept this gap.” That poses a challenge for Mr. Xi, who has spoken frequently about his desire to reduce economic inequality and to eliminate corruption. “From the party’s perspective, you want to maintain domestic stability and don’t want to have these kinds of small issues, which might trigger broader backlash,” Professor Chin said. On Saturday, the Chinese government, which strictly controls the internet, appeared eager to limit discussion of the topic, censoring some posts on Weibo and other social media networks. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, published a commentary on Saturday saying that a national relic had been violated. “Under the rules, everyone is equal,” the newspaper wrote. “No one has the privilege to ‘run wild.’ ” Albee Zhang contributed research.']","Two women posed with a Mercedes in a revered site usually barred to vehicles, and became unwilling symbols of the wealth and privilege President Xi Jinping has promised to rein in."
Fire at Czech Asylum Kills at Least 8 and Injures 30 Others,2020-01-19,By Reuters,"['PRAGUE — At least eight people were killed and 30 others injured in the Czech Republic after a fire broke out on Sunday at a home for people with mental disabilities, officials said.

On Weibo, a Twitterlike site, one of the women bragged about getting exclusive access to the palace, a notoriously congested tourist site, saying she had gone there to “run wild.” The photos, which were posted on Friday, have set off debate in China about the privileges enjoyed by wealthy families, at a time when President Xi Jinping is trying to persuade the public that he is working to eliminate corruption and to reduce the gap between rich and poor. Many people denounced the woman, who had frequently boasted about her wealth on social media, as being out of touch. They said she had desecrated the Forbidden City, the former home of emperors, which Mr. Xi has sought to turn into a global symbol of Chinese cultural heritage. “Don’t roll your privileges over China’s face,” wrote a Weibo user named Ding Lei. The palace is typically closed to vehicles, and it was unclear how the woman and the Mercedes had gained access. The Palace Museum, which was also widely criticized on social media, acknowledged in a statement on Friday that a car had entered the Forbidden City on Monday, while it was closed to the public, but gave no other details. Officials at the museum said they were “deeply distressed” by what had happened, and they vowed to impose “strict management” to prevent future mishaps. The woman who posted the photos under the user name Lu Xiaobao LL initially defended her behavior, saying in a follow-up post that she was at the Forbidden City to see an exhibit. “It’s not illegal to take a picture, right?” she wrote, according to screenshots published by the Chinese news media. “It is fine if you guys don’t know that but it is really not O.K. to curse.” Her social media posts, which drew widespread ridicule, have since been erased, and she did not immediately respond to a message on Saturday seeking comment. Photos of the woman’s visit spread swiftly across China’s internet, drawing hundreds of thousands of comments and inspiring an outpouring of memes and commentary. Some people posted novellas describing the imagined life of a wealthy Beijing ingénue looking for adventure. Others circulated fake advertisements for Mercedes-Benz, boasting that its vehicles could traverse any terrain, even the Forbidden City. The widespread anger over the photos reflects anxieties in Chinese society about the privileges enjoyed by well-connected individuals, analysts said, at a time when the government is promising equal access to education, health care and social services. “Before, people in China accepted that there was a gap between rich and poor,” said Yik Chan Chin, a lecturer in media and communication studies at the Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. “Now, they no longer accept this gap.” That poses a challenge for Mr. Xi, who has spoken frequently about his desire to reduce economic inequality and to eliminate corruption. “From the party’s perspective, you want to maintain domestic stability and don’t want to have these kinds of small issues, which might trigger broader backlash,” Professor Chin said. On Saturday, the Chinese government, which strictly controls the internet, appeared eager to limit discussion of the topic, censoring some posts on Weibo and other social media networks. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, published a commentary on Saturday saying that a national relic had been violated. “Under the rules, everyone is equal,” the newspaper wrote. “No one has the privilege to ‘run wild.’ ” Albee Zhang contributed research.']","Two women posed with a Mercedes in a revered site usually barred to vehicles, and became unwilling symbols of the wealth and privilege President Xi Jinping has promised to rein in."
Fire at Czech Asylum Kills at Least 8 and Injures 30 Others,2020-01-19,By Reuters,"['PRAGUE — At least eight people were killed and 30 others injured in the Czech Republic after a fire broke out on Sunday at a home for people with mental disabilities, officials said. The fire occurred at a home in Vejprty, where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived, fire and rescue officials told the public broadcaster Czech Television. The town is on the country’s northwest border with Germany. Prokop Volenik, a spokesman for the regional rescue service, said one of the injured was in critical condition. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. It was the second-deadliest blaze in the country’s 30-year post-Communist history. Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the blaze “a terrible tragedy,” saying on Twitter that the police and firefighters were doing their utmost to investigate. The blaze was reported just before 5 a.m. local time. The newspaper Dennik N reported that the fire started in one room and that most of those killed had died from smoke inhalation. Firefighters were able to contain the fire and put it out within hours, officials said. In 2010, a fire at an abandoned building in Prague that was often used by homeless people killed nine. In 1995, a hotel fire in the capital killed eight.']","The blaze occurred at a home where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived, officials said."
"China’s Birthrate Hits Historic Low, in Looming Crisis for Beijing",2020-01-17,By Sui-Lee Wee and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — The number of babies born in China last year fell to a nearly six-decade low, exacerbating a looming demographic crisis that is set to reshape the world’s most populous nation and threaten its economic vitality. About 14.6 million babies were born in China in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was a nearly 4 percent fall from the previous year, and the lowest official number of births in China since 1961, the last year of a widespread famine in which millions of people starved to death. That year, only 11.8 million babies were born. Births in China have now fallen for three years in a row. They had risen slightly in 2016, a year after the government ended its one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children, a shift that officials hoped would drive a sustained increase in the number of newborns. But that has not materialized. Experts say the slowdown is rooted in several trends, including the rise of women in the work force who are educated and don’t see marriage as necessary to achieving financial security, at least for themselves. For Chinese couples, many cannot afford to have children as living costs increase and their jobs demand more time and energy. And attitudes have shifted. “It’s a society where nobody wants to get married and people can’t afford to have children,” said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. “On a deeper level, you would have to think about what kind of society China will become, not just demographically, but socially.” Eno Zhang, a 37-year-old engineer in a tech company in Beijing, said he had argued with his parents for 10 years about his decision not to have children. They have since given up, he said. “I value my spiritual life and hobbies,” Mr. Zhang said. “Children will consume too much of my energy. This is something I cannot accept.” While many countries are struggling with low fertility rates and aging populations, these issues are even more pressing in China, because the country’s underdeveloped social safety net means that most older adults rely heavily on their families to pay for health care, retirement and other expenses. Many young married couples are expected to shoulder the burden of taking care of their parents, in-laws and grandparents, without the support of siblings. The birthrate in China fell to 10.48 per thousand last year, the lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, a decline that has important implications for the country’s economy and labor pool. If birthrates continue to fall while life expectancy increases, there will not be enough young people to support the economy and the elderly, the fastest-growing segment of the population. That will put pressure on the country’s underfunded pension systems, its overcrowded hospitals, and companies.  Making matters worse, the slowing birthrate has meant that China’s main state pension fund, which relies on tax revenues from its work force, risks running out of money by 2035 because of a decline in the number of workers, according to research commissioned by the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Despite the looming demographic crisis, the government still maintains tight control over reproduction.  The ruling Communist Party had sought for three decades to slow population growth by limiting most couples to one child and forcing many women to undergo abortions and sterilizations. In 2015, alarmed by the slump in births, it increased that limit to two children.  Even as the government is now trying to encourage people to have babies, it is sending mixed signals. It still punishes couples who exceed the birth restrictions. The authorities fine single women who bear children, and bar them from using reproductive technologies like freezing their eggs.  The government’s effort to raise the birthrate is also running into broader economic and social changes.  Education, housing and health care costs are rising. More women are getting university degrees and are reluctant to interrupt their careers. Some among the current generation of women of childbearing age, themselves the product of the “one child” policy, don’t see what the fuss about offspring is all about. Dong Chang, a 28-year-old administrative employee at a dentist’s clinic in Beijing, said millennials like her enjoyed spending on themselves without batting an eyelid and would find it hard to sacrifice their wants for a child. “We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish,” she said. “How can I raise a child when I’m still a child myself? And take care of him and feed him at midnight?” Ms. Dong said that she was living with her boyfriend but that they had decided to not get married for the time being because they didn’t want their parents to hound them about having children. Melody Lin, a 26-year-old worker at a nonprofit, said she couldn’t think of a reason to have a child. She said she had thought about conforming to societal norms and starting a family but decided against it after reading arguments that not all women need to have children. “My parents think that I’m still young and will change my mind when I get older, but I think it’s unlikely,” she said. China’s total fertility rate — an estimate of the number of babies a woman would have over her lifetime — has fallen to 1.6 children per woman, and for years has generally remained below the “replacement” level of 2.1. That means China could soon see a shrinking population and a work force too small to support its pensioners. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said last year that China’s population contraction would begin in 2027. Others believe it will come sooner or has already begun. The accuracy and completeness of China’s population figures, like other sensitive statistics, have been questioned for years, making exact projections and comparisons difficult. Cai Yong, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, said he expected the low fertility rate to continue for at least a decade. “There are a lot of parallels with this demographic crisis to global warming,” Dr. Cai said. “The waters are rising slowly, and we need a longer term strategy to deal with it.” Elsie Chen contributed research.']","In a country where most older adults rely heavily on their families, the continuing drop in births could have a seismic effect in the decades to come."
"Juan Guaidó, Venezuela Opposition Leader, Defies Travel Ban",2020-01-19,By Julie Turkewitz and Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['MARACAIBO, Venezuela — Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, defied a travel ban and crossed into Colombia on Sunday to round up greater international support for regime change in Venezuela. Mr. Guaidó, who is recognized by the United States and more than 50 countries as Venezuela’s president, and his fellow opposition members are facing increased repression, and his popularity at home is waning. So, under growing pressure to score even a minor victory against the government of President Nicolás Maduro, he has once again turned to diplomacy — one of his strong suits — to shore up support from allies abroad. “Now in Colombia,” Mr. Guaidó said on Twitter on Sunday. “I assure you the return to our country will be full of good news.” Mr. Guaidó was to meet with the Colombian president, Iván Duque, who welcomed him with his own tweet on Sunday, and with Mike Pompeo, the United States secretary of state, who is visiting Bogotá ahead of a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Guaidó is also bound for Davos. After years in which President Maduro used repression and electoral machinations to stay in power, despite a crippling recession that left many without enough to eat or adequate medical care, Mr. Guaidó, the head of the country’s National Assembly, challenged his leadership. About a year ago, pronouncing the most recent presidential election a fraud, he declared himself interim president and called for new elections. President Trump endorsed the opposition leader just minutes after that declaration, and he has remained one of Mr. Guaidó’s strongest international supporters. He followed up his initial recognition with a series of punishing economic sanctions aimed at Mr. Maduro and his government in an attempt to force him to cede power. But as Mr. Guaidó’s campaign to take power waned over the past year, Washington eased the pressure on Mr. Maduro and turned its attention to the Middle East. That allowed Mr. Maduro to adapt to sanctions, stabilize exports and consolidate political power. In a sign of the government’s growing confidence, this month Mr. Maduro moved to take over the opposition’s last stronghold, the National Assembly. The government tried to block opposition lawmakers, including Mr. Guaidó, from entering the building, and it installed in their place a rival congressional leadership made up of defectors from the opposition. Most Western and Latin American countries considered the move illegal. Mr. Guaidó’s trip on Sunday, which he did not announce ahead of time, sets up a critical test for Mr. Maduro. If Mr. Maduro arrests Mr. Guaidó upon his return to Venezuela, that could rally domestic and international support around the opposition leader. But if Mr. Maduro allows him to return, he could seem powerless to enforce his own government’s travel ban. Mr. Guaidó had defied the travel ban in the past, crossing into Colombia through illegal trails controlled by criminal gangs in February to meet with regional leaders. He returned in spectacular fashion to cheering crowds a week later, receiving an entry stamp at the country’s main international airport, despite a series of criminal investigations opened against him by the government. While that trip created a short-term boost for Mr. Guaidó, it yielded few tangible gains and left the opposition without a leader at a crucial time in its struggle against Mr. Maduro. Julie Turkewitz reported from Maracaibo, and Anatoly Kurmanaev from Caracas.']",Mr. Guaidó crossed into Colombia in a risky move that could land him in jail.

Clashes Shake Beirut as Anti-Government Protests Explode in Violence,2020-01-18,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Riot police used water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to clear a large protest camp in the heart of the Lebanese capital on Saturday, sparking clashes with demonstrators that wounded scores of people and turned Beirut’s commercial center into a battle zone. The violence, with tents set on fire and protesters targeting the police with stones and fireworks, was the most intense since mass protests against corruption and mismanagement by the country’s political elite erupted three months ago. Despite continued demonstrations and worsening violence, Lebanon’s politicians have proven unable to take meaningful steps to assuage the protesters’ anger or stop the country’s swift slide toward an economic crisis. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, facing the mass protests, resigned on Oct. 29. His designated successor has failed to form a government while the Lebanese pound, which has been pegged to the American dollar for decades, has been rapidly losing value on the black market, fueling the protesters’ economic grievances. “Why else would we come to protest? Because there is no work and people are hungry,” said protester Miraz al-Jundi, 35, wearing an industrial face mask and standing amid clouds of tear gas. Nearby, young men hurled stones at the security forces and a woman fell to the asphalt, choking. “If the authorities don’t respond, there will be more violence,” he said. Saturday’s protest, under the banner “We will not pay the price,” was meant to unite people from across Lebanon against the most recent effort to form a new government, by Hassan Diab, an engineering professor and former education minister who was designated premier on Dec. 19. The protesters accuse the leaders in Lebanon’s sect-based political system of widespread corruption that has left Lebanon with poor infrastructure, few services and a sinking economy. Calling for their ouster with the slogan “All of them means all of them,” the protesters have called for their replacement by a government of experts who can address the small Mediterranean country’s many crises. They see Mr. Diab as a product of the system they seek to overturn. “We want to bring down the government. We want a state that respects us,” said Khalid al-Naimi, 23, a bus driver who had joined the clashes. But like many of the protesters, when asked who he wanted to take charge if the current system were toppled, he offered only vague suggestions. “We want people who understand,” he said. “Engineers, doctors, people who have nothing to do with politics.” Saturday began with protesters from around Lebanon flooding into Beirut to join marches toward the Parliament building. After they gathered there, clashes broke out, with protesters throwing stones and shooting fireworks and the security forces firing tear gas. The confrontation spread as the security forces cleared a protest camp in Beirut’s central square, where a number of tents were set on fire. By evening, they were locked in back and forth clashes on a main commercial street in front of the Le Gray hotel, one of the city’s finest. Protesters lit dumpsters on fire and hurled stones as riot police launched volleys of tear gas and fired water cannons. The booms of fireworks ricocheted off skyscrapers and ambulances screamed by, ferrying off the wounded. More than 65 people were hospitalized and more than 100 were treated on sight, George Kittaneh, the head of the Lebanese Red Cross, said in a phone call with LBC, a local television station. Lebanon’s interior minister, Raya El Hassan, criticized the protesters for attacking security forces. “I always asserted the right to protest, but for the protests to turn into a blatant assault on the security forces, on public and private property, is condemned and not acceptable at all,” Ms. El Hassan wrote on Twitter. The Internal Security Forces said some of its officers had been wounded by protesters throwing tiles they had broken off walls in a shopping district. Violence had been building over the last week, as protesters, furious that banks have imposed unofficial capital controls and refused to let customers withdraw dollars, shattered the windows of bank branches and broke security cameras. Human rights groups have criticized the security forces for dealing violently with demonstrators. While many protesters say they long for political change, they have been driven to act by the country’s precarious economic situation. Near the clashes, Raed al-Arja, 50, said he had been laid off from his job as a truck driver in December and had little hope of finding a new job. So on Saturday, he had come with his wife, their two children and some other relatives by bus from northern Lebanon to join the protest. “The politicians don’t get it, so we came to make it clear that the Lebanese people don’t want them,” he said. “They lied to us. They told us they would fix the country, but we realized that the ones who destroyed the country can’t fix it.” He carried a Lebanese flag and his daughter, Rayan, 15, and son, Abdel-Hamid, 13, both wore hard hats, yellow rain jackets, and face masks to protect them from tear gas and flying rocks. Despite the violence, he had felt it was important from them to protest, he said. “Our generation got tricked,” he said. “We followed the leaders. Now we are going to the streets to teach the youth to demand their rights.”']",Demonstrators and security forces battled in the worst violence yet after three months of protests against Lebanon’s political elite.
Canada Offers Compensation to Families of Victims of Plane Downed in Iran,2020-01-17,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government will offer payments to relatives of the dozens of Canadian citizens and permanent residents killed when a Ukrainian airliner was downed by missiles launched by Iranian forces. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trudeau said the payments are an interim measure and that Canada will not abandon its efforts to make Iran provide substantial compensation to the families of the victims. He said that Iran bears full responsibility for the incident. “I want to be clear: we expect Iran to compensate these families,” Mr. Trudeau said. “But I have met them, they can’t wait weeks. They need support now.” Canada will provide each of the families with 25,000 Canadian dollars, about $19,000, to cover the cost of funerals and travel. The prime minister said that 57 of the victims were Canadian citizens and another 29 were permanent residents of the country. Canada does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and relies on Italy as its representative there. Members of Canada’s Transportation Safety Board are participating in the investigation that Iran is leading into the downing. For three days, Iran claimed that the airplane, Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752, had crashed due to mechanical problems, despite the findings of various intelligence services that the plane was shot down. Iran then reversed its denial, admitting that a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — a powerful, hard-line military force — mistook the plane for a cruise missile. Videos verified by The New York Times indicate that two missiles struck the airliner before it crashed. In the week since the disaster, Mr. Trudeau and several senior members of his cabinet have been crisscrossing the country to meet with relatives of the victims and attend public vigils. The prime minister has stayed out of a growing debate within the country over whether President Trump shares some of the responsibility for the deaths by creating a volatile situation in Iran that some argue led to the downing. Canada expects the first remains of victims to arrive soon, Mr. Trudeau said. He also urged Iran to send the damaged cockpit voice and flight data recorders from the airliner to France for downloading and analysis.']",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the payments to Canadian families of victims do not absolve Iran from providing compensation.

Harry and Meghan Give Up Royal Titles and Forgo State Funding,2020-01-18,By Mark Landler,"['WINDSOR, England — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will stop using their loftiest royal titles, give up state funding and repay at least $3 million in taxpayer money used to refurbish their official residence at Windsor Castle under an agreement announced by Buckingham Palace on Saturday. The unusual deal, negotiated by aides to Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry and other senior family members, is intended to end a crisis that erupted 10 days ago when the couple abruptly announced plans to step back from their royal duties and spend part of each year in North America. However civil, the agreement codifies one of the most dramatic ruptures within the British royal family since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry an American woman, Wallis Simpson. It is a spectacle that has enthralled and divided Britain, overshadowing even the country’s impending departure from the European Union, and has provoked conversations around the world about race, privilege and tradition. The couple plan to spend a majority of their time outside Britain, initially in Canada but later likely in the United States as well, according to officials at the palace. They will continue to carry out limited duties on behalf of the queen and will retain another of their royal titles, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Harry will also remain a prince and sixth in line of succession. But under the deal, the couple will no longer use their most exclusive titles “His Royal Highness” or “Her Royal Highness” because they will no longer be working royals. They will be allowed to earn money in the private sector, though palace officials said the duke and duchess had agreed that whatever work they pursued would “uphold the values of Her Majesty,” a phrase intended to allay fears that they will overly commercialize their ties to the House of Windsor. [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] The queen instructed her family last Monday to come to an agreement with the duke and duchess after an extraordinary family conclave at her country residence, Sandringham, during which she said she would reluctantly accept their desire to break away and chart their own future. The drama has plunged the royal family into perhaps its greatest crisis since the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the mother of Harry and his older brother, Prince William. There have been reports of a bitter rift between the two princes and the couple’s announcement blindsided the palace. Meghan, who returned to Canada afterward to be with their son, Archie, appears increasingly isolated within the family. The couple has had a toxic relationship with Britain’s tabloids, which soured on Meghan after initially giving her rapturous coverage — a 38-year-old American actress with a mixed-race background who brought a breath of fresh air into one of the country’s most revered but hidebound institutions. In a statement, Queen Elizabeth said she recognized the challenges the couple “have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.” “I want to thank them for all their dedicated work across this country, the Commonwealth and beyond,” the queen said, adding that she was “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family.” In a separate statement, issued by Buckingham Palace on behalf of the duke and duchess, the couple thanked the queen and other members of the royal family for “their ongoing support as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.” The duke said he would relinquish his honorary military appointments and his status as a Commonwealth youth ambassador, though the couple will preserve their links to a network of private charities. The agreement takes effect later in the spring and will be reviewed by the palace after a year, according to a palace official. There are still several unanswered questions, like whether the duke and duchess will continue to receive publicly funded security, either in Britain or overseas. The palace declined to discuss security arrangements. Prince Charles will continue to provide the couple financial support, officials said, though it is not clear whether that money will come from the Duchy of Cornwall, his hereditary estate, which has funded the bulk of their expenses since they were married in 2018. Hammering out terms for Prince Harry and Meghan to shift to “part-time” status was never going to be easy. The couple draw millions of dollars a year from Prince Charles, and the state also provides extensive police security for the pair — arrangements that will now come under scrutiny. The queen gave the duke and duchess Frogmore Cottage, a historic house on the grounds of Windsor Castle, to serve as their primary residence. They came under criticism for refurbishing the house at a cost of at least 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million) in public funds. Repaying that money may buy them some good will. Reaction to the announcement on social media was generally positive, with many people praising their commitment to pay for the renovations. They will continue to use Frogmore Cottage when they are in Britain, officials said. “It will appease those people who were angry about the money,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. She said the agreement avoided what could have been a muddy situation, with the couple half in and half out of the royal family. “It means there are no blurred lines about what’s royal and what’s not,” she said. “They’ve said they want to get out, so let them get out.” Still, the palace also declined to say whether, and how, it would monitor the couple’s private-sector activities. Other members of the royal family who have tried to enter the private sector, like Prince Edward, the queen’s youngest son, or Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, have stumbled. Prince Andrew himself was banished from public life last year by the queen after he gave a disastrous interview to the BBC about his dealings with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Canadian government has been cordial about the prospect of having Prince Harry and Meghan move there, but noncommittal about whether it would pay for any of their security or other expenses. “Most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of cost is involved — there’s still lots of discussion,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last week to the Canadian broadcaster Global News. Prince Harry last Thursday made his first public appearance since the situation unfolded, presiding over a draw for the Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace. He looked tense under the glare of cameras but appeared to loosen up as he joked with a group of children playing rugby outside the palace. The duchess is staying at an estate on Vancouver Island in Canada where the couple spent the Christmas holidays. On this historic Saturday morning at Windsor Castle, age-old tradition mingled with unmistakable signs of change. Shortly before 11 a.m., the Scots Guards formed up in the castle’s lower ward for the ceremonial changing of the guard. Standing in the shadow of St. George’s Chapel, where Prince Harry and Meghan were married on a sunny Saturday morning only 18 months ago, they presented arms. After being inspected, the troops stood at attention as a detachment of new guards marched into the courtyard from a nearby barracks, preceded by the Band of the Household Cavalry, sunlight glinting off their horns. As the old and new guards faced each other, impassive under their bearskin hats, the bandleader raised his baton. Tourists jostled and cameras flashed, as the military band plunged into a jaunty rendition of “Get Lucky,” a disco funk hit co-written by Pharrell Williams, followed by “It’s Not Unusual,” the smoldering 1960s pop tune made famous by the Welsh singer Tom Jones.']","An agreement represents one of the most dramatic ruptures within the British royal family since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry an American woman, Wallis Simpson."
"The Royals Are Coming to Canada, but Where Will They Live?",2020-01-20,By Ian Austen and Dan Bilefsky,"['OTTAWA — While many Canadians have been assiduously following every twist in the plans of Prince Harry and Meghan, his wife, to take a break from royal duties, the couple may find their plan to live part time in Canada will, in the end, be greeted by a great national yawn. Half of Canadians contacted by the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling organization, “really do not care” if the couple, known formally at least for now as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, lay down roots in Canada, according to a recent survey by the group. And an overwhelming 73 percent of those polled said they don’t want Canada spending any money on their security. “The whole thing is being met with a royal shrug,” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of Angus Reid, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. “There’s a disconnect between the coverage of this story and the perceptions of what the reaction of people will be. It really signals to the royal family that Canada is not to be taken for granted.” On Tuesday morning, Harry reportedly arrived on Vancouver Island, where he joined Meghan and their 8-month-old son, Archie, but almost nothing is known about the couple’s plans for Canada. That has not limited speculation, and the main question for Canadians who are eager to see them come is where will they live. [Update: Prince Harry and Meghan exit Britain with final official engagement.] Perhaps inevitably, there are some long-shot attempts to attract the couple. The mayor of Sussex, New Brunswick, the self-proclaimed dairy capital of the province, has played along gamely with humorous suggestions that its name alone makes the community an ideal place for Harry and Meghan. But most speculation, particularly in the British press, has centered on three places: Vancouver; Victoria, also in British Columbia; and Toronto. The Sun tabloid in Britain recently claimed that the couple was looking at a six-bedroom home in Vancouver listed for 35.8 million Canadian dollars. While technically in the Kitsilano neighborhood — famous as the center of the city’s counterculture in the 1960s and ’70s — the house sits on rarefied Point Grey Road, which follows the shoreline, and is dominated by mansions. Its residents include Chip Wilson, the founder of the yoga clothing maker Lululemon, whose house was assessed last year at just under 65 million dollars. Dampening the Vancouver speculation, however, are reports in the Canadian press that the real estate agent handling the offering of the Point Grey house is unaware of any interest from Harry or Meghan. Further fueling the Vancouver speculation has been the city’s comparative proximity to Los Angeles, Meghan’s birthplace, and her recent appearance at a charity in Vancouver’s poorest neighborhood. Whatever national polls indicate, several Vancouver residents said they would welcome the couple as neighbors — although perhaps not for reasons people seeking a more private life would desire. Samantha Miller, 29, who works in human resources at the University of British Columbia, said the couple could boost tourism to Vancouver and lend the city some “sparkle.” “I feel quite bad for them for the way they have been treated,” she said. “There is excitement that they would pick Vancouver.” The area around Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, is on the list largely because the couple are renting a house in one of its suburbs. It seems like a good prospect because the winter weather in Victoria is moderate, it has long played up its British heritage and the local newspaper, which features a coat of arms granted to the colony of Vancouver Island by Queen Victoria, voluntarily withheld publishing any articles about Harry and Meghan’s Christmas retreat there until they made the news public. But greater Victoria has a population of 367,770 and is known mostly as a place where people retire rather than embark on a new life. Toronto was Meghan’s home when she was known as Meghan Markle and starred in the television drama “Suits,” which was filmed in Canada’s largest city. The city is the capital of Canada’s English-language media, and once she became romantically linked with Harry, the couple’s movements there were constantly tracked by cameras and reporters. Toronto is also home to Jessica Mulroney, a close friend of Meghan’s who recently babysat Archie when she returned briefly to Britain. Ms. Mulroney, a fashion stylist who frequently appears on Canadian television, is married to Ben Mulroney, a Canadian television host and the son of Brian Mulroney, a former prime minister. The prospect of the royal couple’s long-term presence in Canada has induced hand-wringing among some of the country’s constitutional scholars. While many polls, including the recent Angus Reid survey, show a great deal of respect for Queen Elizabeth II, Canadians are less enthusiastic about the institution of the monarchy and, in particular, about the idea of Prince Charles, Harry’s father, as the country’s king. But doing anything about the role of Britain’s queen or king as Canada’s official head of state would involve amending Canada’s Constitution, a process so fraught with disagreement that no political appetite exists to take it on. While the royal coat of arms long ago disappeared from mailboxes in Canada, the country’s laws are created and enforced in the queen’s name, public servants swear an oath to her and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet are technically her advisers. The key to public acceptance of that, several scholars have noted recently, has been that the queen has become a distant figure who lives overseas and is represented in Canada by the governor-general, an appointed figure who has since 1952 been a Canadian. Having active members of the royal family around, some argued, might upset that balance. “Canada’s version of the monarchy has been thoroughly Canadianized, and there’s really no room for the Sussexes except as private citizens,” said an editorial in The Toronto Star. Michael D. Behiels, a professor of Canadian political history at the University of Ottawa, said the couple’s decision over the weekend to take a complete break from royal duties and titles had made those concerns “moot.” Resolving the issue of who should cover their security costs might be harder to work out. Their soon-to-vanish status as active members of the royal family entitles Harry and Meghan to protection by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police under a United Nations treaty. The Mounties have remained silent on what will come next or what it will cost. Mr. Trudeau said recently that there had been no discussions on the matter. But whatever the cost and wherever they live, Matthew Tam, 45, who runs the Oh Sweet Days bake shop in Vancouver, is opposed to any taxpayer help because “they’re not Canadian citizens.” “They’re here for the long term,” he said. “I would think they should pay for their own security.” Ian Austen reported from Ottawa, and Dan Bilefsky from Vancouver, British Columbia. Winston Szeto contributed reporting from Vancouver.']","As speculation grows over where Prince Harry and Meghan will make their home in Canada, so does concern over who will pay their costs."
‘Abandoned and Forgotten’: Jailed Academic Writes of Despair in Iran,2020-01-21,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — “I am entirely alone in Iran,” she wrote in one letter. “In addition to all the pain I have endured here, I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten.” Those words were written by a British-Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who has been held in an Iranian prison for more than a year — including long stretches of solitary confinement — in a series of letters published by British news outlets this week. Ms. Moore-Gilbert was detained in Iran in September 2018 while attending a conference. She was later convicted of spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison. She is being held in Evin Prison in Tehran in solitary confinement in a high-security wing run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Detailing the harrowing conditions, Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote about her deteriorating health, begged to be released from the wing where she had spent much of her time behind bars and rejected bids by the Iranian authorities to recruit her as a spy. “I have no friends or family here and in addition to all the pain I have endured here, I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten, that after so many times of asking my embassy, I still have no money at all to endure all of this.” The letters, addressed to three Iranian officials, are believed to have been written in Persian between June and December 2019, before being smuggled out of the jail by an intermediary and published by The Times of London and The Guardian. Ms. Moore-Gilbert accused the Revolutionary Guards of “playing an awful game with me.” “I’m taking psychiatric medications, but these 10 months that I have spent here have gravely damaged my mental health,” Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote in a letter dated July 2019. “I am still denied phone calls and visitations, and I am afraid that my mental and emotional state may further deteriorate if I remain in this extremely restrictive detention ward.” The letters were revealed at a time when the already strained relationship between Iran and the West has drastically deteriorated, after the American killing of an Iranian general and subsequent retaliatory strikes from Iran. Ms. Moore-Gilbert is just one of several Westerners and dual nationals being held in Iranian prisons on charges that their families and officials say are unfounded. Ms. Moore-Gilbert, a Cambridge-educated professor in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne, denies the charges against her, as do her colleagues and family. She is being held at the same notorious Tehran prison as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage. Many fear that the women are being used as bargaining chips in the tensions between Iran and the West. Richard Ratcliffe, Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, said that he had seen the letters and that they spoke to the traumatizing conditions faced by those arbitrarily detained in Iran. He urged the British and Australian governments, as well as the broader international community, to take a harsher stance on Iran’s arbitrary detention of foreign nationals. Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a program director at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was detained in Tehran while trying to return to Britain after visiting relatives in Iran with her husband and young daughter. She was accused of plotting to overthrow Iran’s government, a charge her family and the foundation have vigorously denied. Mr. Ratcliffe said that the arrests of his wife, of Ms. Moore-Gilbert and of other foreign nationals were akin to the taking of hostages, adding that governments needed to take a stronger stance to gain their release. “I think the failure by the international community to call out Iran’s hostage-taking for what it is has enabled the growth of this practice,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. “The refusal to see things as they are does not protect the people in the middle of it.” But, he also noted, the priority should be on securing Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s release from solitary detention, which had clearly impacted her mental and physical health. “The only thing that matters is getting her out of solitary confinement,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. “Everything else can wait for another day.” The Australian authorities first confirmed Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s detention nearly a year after her arrest, when it was revealed that a British-Australian blogger and her Australian boyfriend were also being held. The blogger and her boyfriend were released in October in an apparent prisoner swap. In another letter that Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote to her Iranian case manager, she stated her “official and definitive rejection of your offer to me to work with the intelligence branch” of the Revolutionary Guards. “I am not a spy. I have never been a spy and I have no interest to work for a spying organization in any country,” she wrote, according to The Times of London. She said that she was innocent of all of the charges against her and that she had been the victim of “fabrications and trumped-up accusations.” A spokesman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s case had been raised by Marise Payne, the foreign minister, in a meeting with her Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in India last week. “While we continue to work towards her release, we are doing everything possible in relation to the conditions of her imprisonment,” the spokesman said, according to the newspaper The Australian. Ms. Moore-Gilbert and her family have been receiving consular assistance from the Australian authorities, and the British Foreign Office is working in cooperation with the Australians. She was visited by Australian consular officials in December and January after being denied consular visits in the past, including during the months that her letters were written. The British Foreign Office said in a statement that it remained “extremely concerned about the welfare of British dual nationals detained in Iran,” and noted that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had raised those concerns with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran during a Jan. 9 meeting. The British Foreign Office advises citizens against all travel to Iran, citing a risk of arrest. A request to the Iranian Embassy in London for response to the letters was not immediately answered. Human rights groups and politicians in Australia and Britain expressed outrage after the details of the letters were published. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a tweet on Monday that Ms. Moore-Gilbert had “already been in prison far too long” and urged the Australian government to “ramp up efforts to bring her home.” But Mr. Ratcliffe, along with many other activists who have campaigned for the release of the foreigners, said that he believed the diplomatic back-and-forth had fallen short and that the negotiations had stalled. “What’s going on is a game of chess,” Mr. Ratcliffe said, “where you’ve got innocent people being used.”']","A British-Australian woman, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, was detained in September 2018 while attending a conference.

These Syrian Women Rarely Left the House. Then the Men Disappeared.,2020-01-19,By Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad,"['ALEPPO, Syria — The women of eastern Aleppo were rarely visible before the war, but now they shape the bitter peace. In the poor, conservative districts of Syria’s ancient commercial capital, many women seldom used to leave the house, and only with their husbands if they did; the men not only won the bread, but also went out to buy it. Then came the civil war. Eight years and counting of bloodshed have condemned a generation of Syrian men to their deaths, to prison or to precarious lives as refugees. Now, with most of the country once again under government control, yet ruptured beyond recognition, moving forward is up to the women left behind: part survivors, part mourners, part mop-up crew. Grandmothers are raising orphaned grandchildren. Single women worry they will never find husbands. Widows are supporting families gutted by losses that once seemed unendurable, and that the world now treats as routine. In many cases, women are leaving the house on their own and working for the first time, old customs succumbing to the extremities of war and an economy in collapse — nothing new in large cities like Damascus, the capital, but a swift transformation for some of the more traditional corners of this socially and religiously conservative country. “Before, women were afraid of everything,” said Fatima Rawass, 32, who opened a beauty salon for veiled women in May, three years after her husband died in the war. “But now, there’s nothing to be afraid of.” Ms. Rawass had never met a man outside her immediate family when, at 19, she found out she was engaged to a cousin, she says. No one had consulted her. Born stubborn, with a barbed tongue that would later win her a reputation as a neighborhood brawler, she informed her parents she wasn’t interested. “You can say ‘no’ if you don’t like him,” her mother was finally hounded into saying. Then her fiancé started calling her three times a day. By the time they married, she was in love. After they settled in east Aleppo, Ms. Rawass said, she left the house so infrequently that she could wear high heels under her abaya — the long black robelike gown worn by many conservative Muslim women — all day. It was much the same as in other conservative parts of Syria, which is mostly Sunni Muslim, marbled with religious minorities: Her husband did the grocery shopping and the errands. She minded the children. In 2012, fighting between rebels in eastern Aleppo and government forces in western Aleppo tore the city in two. By the time the government reclaimed it in late 2016, after four years of relentless bloodletting, eastern Aleppo was all but pulverized. The war’s momentum swung irreversibly to the government. Ms. Rawass had begged to flee, but her husband insisted on staying to guard his carpentry workshop. He refused to join the rebels, who eventually threw him in prison. Fifteen days later, the children were hungry, and, with trepidation drumming in her veins, Ms. Rawass resolved to go out to buy some milk for what would be her first time. Government bombs and shells were falling outside, some targeting hospitals; snipers stalked the streets. It was, she recalled later, “a very long, hard walk” — the first of many. To pay her husband’s way out of jail, she sold everything she could, took in sewing work and borrowed. “I hope I die before you,” she remembered him telling her one day in July 2016, after his release, “because you’re stronger than I am.” The next day, they heard explosions. When he ran outside, flying shrapnel killed him on the spot. Ms. Rawass said she soon discarded the heels she had worn even during the war. She walked to the store through still-unfamiliar streets, dodging the glances of male strangers. She walked to the doctor who treated her for exhaustion and depression and to the beauty school where she eventually started taking classes. She saved up and got a loan from the Red Crescent. And in May, she opened a salon in her partly ruined upstairs room and hung up a sign with her name on it. “When you work, you don’t have to ask anyone for anything,” she said. “Women who need things can be taken advantage of.” She offered makeup, eyebrow and hair services to veiled women like her. They continued to attend to appearances, despite everything (“Should we die after our husbands die?”). Although she had grown up cutting hair for friends and family, her father never let her make money from it, saying employment would expose her to the predations of men. Now, her parents wanted her to quit and come live with them. She refused. Ms. Rawass had fallen in love again, she said, but she dared not defy her father’s prohibition against remarrying; he believed a widow should devote herself to her children, and her children only. If she disobeyed, he could take them away. If only she were childless, she sometimes thought. Then she would have to worry only about herself. What she had was work. It helped her forget. “It’s only at night,” she said, “that I remember all the bad things that happened.” A few hours south of Aleppo, in the coastal city of Latakia, Lekaa al-Shaekh and her fiancé were being photographed inside the ancient Egypt-themed wedding hall where they had met, and where — finally! — they would be married. They posed on a white sofa bathed in neon-pink light and crowned with fake white flowers, a fluorescent bridal fantasia. “I’ve been waiting so long to sit on this couch,” she said, rolling her eyes. She and her friends used to expect a great deal from future husbands. Traditionally, Syrian grooms paid a bride-price: a car, a house and cash in Latakia; a kilogram of gold jewelry in Aleppo. Then the fighting came, and Latakia, an area dominated by President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite minority religious sect, sent thousands of young men to battle. All over Syria, the economy buckled. Ms. al-Shaekh, 34, decided she could not afford prewar standards. “There are so few men; that’s the problem now,” she explained. “Some of my friends are waiting for men to give them everything, but it’s tough. We’re in a war, after all.” (Not, she hastened to add, that she had compromised in choosing her fiancé, a soldier she described as kind, handsome and responsible.) She had advised single friends to make concessions to the emergency, yet many remained disappointed. Some had resorted to adding eligible-looking strangers on Facebook, a stratagem unheard-of before the war. It had even worked for a few. It was rare to find a single woman who did not survey the field with some despair. “There are no men in Syria,” said Afraa Dagher, 36, a Latakian who said she had many friends in the same, perpetually solo boat. “At my age, they’re all martyrs or soldiers.” How did she meet men now? “I don’t know,” she said, with a brief, tired smile. “Leave it to God.” Paro Clothes’s business card proclaimed the Aleppo garment workshop “different & fashionable,” and its owner was both. Paro Manoukian, 44, was an Armenian Christian and a woman in a male-dominated industry. In her windowless basement headquarters, the June heat had bargained her down to a red tank top, red lipstick, red nails and a profusion of gold jewelry. Ms. Manoukian opened the workshop after getting divorced in 2011. Half her all-female work force had surrendered husbands, brothers or sons to the war. A few dozen toiled at home, applying furbelows to garments; three more worked in the back, shielded from male eyes by a teal plastic curtain. “I asked for the divorce, but I’m sure if I got married now, my husband would want a divorce because I work all day,” Ms. Manoukian said, laughing throatily. In the back, three employees chatted about their troubles — money, men, children — as their fingers disciplined the cloth. They tried not to talk too much about the people they had lost. Hayat Kashkash’s husband had forbidden her to work, but after his government salary fell behind rising prices last year, Ms. Kashkash, 53, got hired without asking permission. “I found a job,” she told him. “I’m going to work.” “O.K.,” he said. “Go.” This was sometimes as much burden as triumph. “Now you have to cook, wash, clean and take care of the kids, plus work,” she said. “Before you leave the house, you have to clean it. After work, you go home and cook.” But with two sons conscripted into the army, she wanted to keep busy. “I come to escape,” she said. “I’m here to escape my kids,” put in Fatima Kelzy, who was hot-gluing pom-poms onto a T-shirt, a cigarette dangling from one corner of her flashing smile. Everyone laughed. She was the joker, the one who got up and danced when they needed a pick-me-up. Married at 11, she had never imagined any career but housewife. Now, at 44, she was a working widow with six unmarried daughters to feed. “Actually, I’m working for my kids,” she said, serious now, “because I’m both mom and dad.” The streets around Paro Clothes were wallpapered with signs recruiting female tailors. Muhammad Dagher, 38, was surprised to be swarmed by calls from widows seeking employment when he reopened his factory three years ago. Now several women labored there in a curtained-off section, snipping extra threads, checking stitching. But he paid them less than men, judging them too inexperienced to sew. Why? “They’re slow, they’re weak,” he said. “It’s new for them.” Reading his audience, he course-corrected. “The women are becoming equal to men,” he declared. added. “They work just as hard.” Samia Hanuf, 39, was not brought up to work. She left school at 15 and married at 19, settling in Latakia. Three children followed before a sniper’s bullet killed her husband, a government soldier, in 2013. She still talked to his photo all the time, telling him everything: about how, without child care options when she started shifts at a dairy factory, she would make breakfast for the children, lock them in and hope for the best; about accidentally buying spoiled vegetables on her very first grocery run. As soon as they finished school, she vowed, their daughters would work. “I don’t want them to be like me,” she said, “not being able to take care of themselves.”']",
Ukraine’s President Said He’d Fight Corruption. Resistance Is Fierce.,2020-01-19,By Anton Troianovski,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Kateryna Rozhkova, the first deputy governor of Ukraine’s central bank, had just about learned to live with the hundreds of protesters banging metal rods and drums outside her office when they started gathering every morning outside her house. If that wasn’t enough, just before Christmas, a brass ensemble showed up at her home blaring funeral music in accompaniment of a horse-drawn hearse and men dressed like the grim reaper. The protesters presented themselves as part of a grass roots effort opposing official corruption, but Ms. Rozhkova says they were anything but. She says they were sent by a billionaire accused of defrauding the government of $5 billion and who is now locked in a fierce battle with the Ukrainian central bank. “If there is this kind of reaction,” Ms. Rozhkova said of the lawlessness she says Ukraine’s anti-corruption forces are up against, “it means that there is a fight.” President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian, sitcom star and political neophyte, catapulted to the presidency of Ukraine last spring on a promise of sweeping away the country’s shadowy web of money and influence. Now, as Mr. Zelensky faces pressure to deliver on his promises, he is finding that actually bringing the corrupt officials and oligarchs to heel is a lot harder than satirizing them on his former TV show, “Servant of the People.” Previous Ukrainian presidents came to power pledging to tackle corruption, but usually with the intent of using that pose as cover for their own corrupt deals, activists say. Whether Mr. Zelensky can show that he is different from past leaders will be a decisive litmus test for his presidency — and for Ukraine’s viability as a country moving closer to the West. Further complicating an already daunting task, Mr. Zelensky has been forced to deal with the fallout from the Trump administration’s pressure campaign in Ukraine and the impeachment trial in Washington that sprang from it. In the past, Ukraine enjoyed the steadfast support of the United States in fighting both corruption and a war against Russian-backed separatists. Now, Ukrainians say Washington’s message has grown muddled, in part because Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his Ukrainian allies see the Western-backed camp of Ukrainian anticorruption reformers as their enemies. “Giuliani flying in — rather than fighting corruption, he was supporting and meeting with all of the past corrupt people,” said Valeria Gontareva, the former head of Ukraine’s central bank. “As a result, it’s very hard to say what the message is that we now hear from America.” Nevertheless, anticorruption activists say they see signs of progress. Mr. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general is modernizing his corruption-plagued office and firing hundreds of prosecutors. A flurry of laws passed by Mr. Zelensky’s months-old parliamentary majority seeks to overhaul the justice system and criminalize illicit enrichment by public officials. The president has even signed legislation establishing a procedure for his own impeachment. When it comes to enforcing the law, however, Mr. Zelensky’s tests are just beginning. Ukraine’s mafia, for example, is trying to bribe and threaten members of Mr. Zelensky’s ruling bloc in Parliament to derail legislation to crack down on organized crime, said a senior lawmaker, David Arakhamia. “They meet them by their house and say, ‘We know where your parents live,’” said Mr. Arakhamia, the floor leader of Mr. Zelensky’s party in Parliament. And just this week Mr. Zelensky’s handpicked prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, offered his resignation after the leak of what he said was a doctored recording on which he is heard to say the president has a “primitive” understanding of economics. Mr. Honcharuk blamed the leak on forces trying to undermine the anticorruption drive. Mr. Zelensky refused his resignation. Perhaps Mr. Zelensky’s biggest challenge lies with his erstwhile patron, Ihor Kolomoisky, one of the oligarchs that Mr. Giuliani and his associates courted and the man Ms. Rozhkova believes is responsible for trying to intimidate her and her colleagues. Mr. Kolomoisky advanced Mr. Zelensky’s career by putting “Servant of the People” on his TV channel. Now, having returned from self-imposed exile in Israel and Switzerland, he is hoping to regain control of a bank that the government seized from him, alleging that he and his business partner siphoned billions of dollars out of it. “Even more than getting it back, I want to punish the guilty” responsible for seizing the bank, Mr. Kolomoisky told The New York Times in November. “The guilty must be put on the spike and the death penalty brought back for them.” In a recent phone interview, Mr. Kolomoisky denied having anything to do with the protests against the central bank, which have been covered extensively on the television channel he owns and populated by people transported in buses bearing the logo of one of his businesses. He called Mr. Giuliani an “honorable person.” Ms. Gontareva, who nationalized Mr. Kolomoisky’s bank, PrivatBank, in 2016, says she got a sample of the oligarch’s methods last year. First, she was hit by a car while in London, where she was living at the time. Then her house in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and her son’s car were hit by arson attacks. She decided to remain in London in self-imposed exile. Mr. Kolomoisky dismissed Ms. Gontareva’s allegations, saying she “has to be sent to the insane asylum.” Mr. Zelensky needs to demonstrate to Ukraine’s Western creditors that he is serious about prosecuting large-scale fraud in order to secure billions of dollars in sorely needed loans from the International Monetary Fund. In the impeachment proceedings in Washington, Ukraine has been tarnished by corruption accusations by Republicans and Democrats alike — feeding worries that Kyiv now faces a long-term challenge in winning bipartisan support even as its conflict with neighboring Russia continues. In America, “politicians are an extension of the electorate, and the electorate has already concluded that Ukraine is a corrupt country,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, who resigned as Mr. Zelensky’s national security adviser in September. “In practice, I expect the support of the United States to be minimal in the next year.” The new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, this fall allowed a longstanding case to proceed against a different business tycoon, Oleg Bakhmatyuk, who is also accused of siphoning money from his bank. But the Ukrainian authorities have not brought such charges against Mr. Kolomoisky. That has led to accusations that Mr. Zelensky is giving his media ally and former business partner special treatment — charges that both men deny. But high-profile corruption cases “won’t be credible until there’s action taken against Kolomoisky,” said Mr. Danylyuk, the former Zelensky adviser. “Bakhmatyuk won’t cut it.” Mr. Kolomoisky denies any wrongdoing in the PrivatBank matter. Mr. Bakhmatyuk also denies wrongdoing. Ukraine’s problems extend beyond Mr. Kolomoisky, however. The powerful S.B.U. intelligence agency remains in dire need of changes to stop it from intervening “in all areas of social life and business,” says the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a watchdog group. Rather than functioning as a Western intelligence service, the S.B.U. is able to take advantage of its wide-ranging powers to extract bribes and exert undue influence across Ukraine, its critics say. “Right now, corrupt elites from various agencies are trying to understand how to operate under the new political realities in Ukraine,” said the center’s executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. “They’re looking for whom to bribe, who to negotiate with.” A representative of Andriy Bohdan, Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff whom Mr. Bakhmatyuk blamed for his plight, did not respond to a request for comment. Dmytro Sologub, a deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said post-Soviet Ukraine was particularly vulnerable to corruption even compared to some other post-Communist European countries. Caught between warring European powers for centuries, the country has little legacy of its own trusted institutions. “The system we’re trying to change now was created and modified in the course of 25 years,” Mr. Sologub said. “That raises the question of how much time will be necessary to change it.”']","For Volodymyr Zelensky, taking on the oligarchs and organized crime is a domestic test with geopolitical consequences."

Ms. Rawass had fallen in love again, she said, but she dared not defy her father’s prohibition against remarrying; he believed a widow should devote herself to her children, and her children only. If she disobeyed, he could take them away. If only she were childless, she sometimes thought. Then she would have to worry only about herself. What she had was work. It helped her forget. “It’s only at night,” she said, “that I remember all the bad things that happened.” A few hours south of Aleppo, in the coastal city of Latakia, Lekaa al-Shaekh and her fiancé were being photographed inside the ancient Egypt-themed wedding hall where they had met, and where — finally! — they would be married. They posed on a white sofa bathed in neon-pink light and crowned with fake white flowers, a fluorescent bridal fantasia. “I’ve been waiting so long to sit on this couch,” she said, rolling her eyes. She and her friends used to expect a great deal from future husbands. Traditionally, Syrian grooms paid a bride-price: a car, a house and cash in Latakia; a kilogram of gold jewelry in Aleppo. Then the fighting came, and Latakia, an area dominated by President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite minority religious sect, sent thousands of young men to battle. All over Syria, the economy buckled. Ms. al-Shaekh, 34, decided she could not afford prewar standards. “There are so few men; that’s the problem now,” she explained. “Some of my friends are waiting for men to give them everything, but it’s tough. We’re in a war, after all.” (Not, she hastened to add, that she had compromised in choosing her fiancé, a soldier she described as kind, handsome and responsible.) She had advised single friends to make concessions to the emergency, yet many remained disappointed. Some had resorted to adding eligible-looking strangers on Facebook, a stratagem unheard-of before the war. It had even worked for a few. It was rare to find a single woman who did not survey the field with some despair. “There are no men in Syria,” said Afraa Dagher, 36, a Latakian who said she had many friends in the same, perpetually solo boat. “At my age, they’re all martyrs or soldiers.” How did she meet men now? “I don’t know,” she said, with a brief, tired smile. “Leave it to God.” Paro Clothes’s business card proclaimed the Aleppo garment workshop “different & fashionable,” and its owner was both. Paro Manoukian, 44, was an Armenian Christian and a woman in a male-dominated industry. In her windowless basement headquarters, the June heat had bargained her down to a red tank top, red lipstick, red nails and a profusion of gold jewelry. Ms. Manoukian opened the workshop after getting divorced in 2011. Half her all-female work force had surrendered husbands, brothers or sons to the war. A few dozen toiled at home, applying furbelows to garments; three more worked in the back, shielded from male eyes by a teal plastic curtain. “I asked for the divorce, but I’m sure if I got married now, my husband would want a divorce because I work all day,” Ms. Manoukian said, laughing throatily. In the back, three employees chatted about their troubles — money, men, children — as their fingers disciplined the cloth. They tried not to talk too much about the people they had lost. Hayat Kashkash’s husband had forbidden her to work, but after his government salary fell behind rising prices last year, Ms. Kashkash, 53, got hired without asking permission. “I found a job,” she told him. “I’m going to work.” “O.K.,” he said. “Go.” This was sometimes as much burden as triumph. “Now you have to cook, wash, clean and take care of the kids, plus work,” she said. “Before you leave the house, you have to clean it. After work, you go home and cook.” But with two sons conscripted into the army, she wanted to keep busy. “I come to escape,” she said. “I’m here to escape my kids,” put in Fatima Kelzy, who was hot-gluing pom-poms onto a T-shirt, a cigarette dangling from one corner of her flashing smile. Everyone laughed. She was the joker, the one who got up and danced when they needed a pick-me-up. Married at 11, she had never imagined any career but housewife. Now, at 44, she was a working widow with six unmarried daughters to feed. “Actually, I’m working for my kids,” she said, serious now, “because I’m both mom and dad.” The streets around Paro Clothes were wallpapered with signs recruiting female tailors. Muhammad Dagher, 38, was surprised to be swarmed by calls from widows seeking employment when he reopened his factory three years ago. Now several women labored there in a curtained-off section, snipping extra threads, checking stitching. But he paid them less than men, judging them too inexperienced to sew. Why? “They’re slow, they’re weak,” he said. “It’s new for them.” Reading his audience, he course-corrected. “The women are becoming equal to men,” he declared. added. “They work just as hard.” Samia Hanuf, 39, was not brought up to work. She left school at 15 and married at 19, settling in Latakia. Three children followed before a sniper’s bullet killed her husband, a government soldier, in 2013. She still talked to his photo all the time, telling him everything: about how, without child care options when she started shifts at a dairy factory, she would make breakfast for the children, lock them in and hope for the best; about accidentally buying spoiled vegetables on her very first grocery run. As soon as they finished school, she vowed, their daughters would work. “I don’t want them to be like me,” she said, “not being able to take care of themselves.”']",
Ukraine’s President Said He’d Fight Corruption. Resistance Is Fierce.,2020-01-19,By Anton Troianovski,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Kateryna Rozhkova, the first deputy governor of Ukraine’s central bank, had just about learned to live with the hundreds of protesters banging metal rods and drums outside her office when they started gathering every morning outside her house. If that wasn’t enough, just before Christmas, a brass ensemble showed up at her home blaring funeral music in accompaniment of a horse-drawn hearse and men dressed like the grim reaper. The protesters presented themselves as part of a grass roots effort opposing official corruption, but Ms. Rozhkova says they were anything but. She says they were sent by a billionaire accused of defrauding the government of $5 billion and who is now locked in a fierce battle with the Ukrainian central bank. “If there is this kind of reaction,” Ms. Rozhkova said of the lawlessness she says Ukraine’s anti-corruption forces are up against, “it means that there is a fight.” President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian, sitcom star and political neophyte, catapulted to the presidency of Ukraine last spring on a promise of sweeping away the country’s shadowy web of money and influence. Now, as Mr. Zelensky faces pressure to deliver on his promises, he is finding that actually bringing the corrupt officials and oligarchs to heel is a lot harder than satirizing them on his former TV show, “Servant of the People.” Previous Ukrainian presidents came to power pledging to tackle corruption, but usually with the intent of using that pose as cover for their own corrupt deals, activists say. Whether Mr. Zelensky can show that he is different from past leaders will be a decisive litmus test for his presidency — and for Ukraine’s viability as a country moving closer to the West. Further complicating an already daunting task, Mr. Zelensky has been forced to deal with the fallout from the Trump administration’s pressure campaign in Ukraine and the impeachment trial in Washington that sprang from it. In the past, Ukraine enjoyed the steadfast support of the United States in fighting both corruption and a war against Russian-backed separatists. Now, Ukrainians say Washington’s message has grown muddled, in part because Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his Ukrainian allies see the Western-backed camp of Ukrainian anticorruption reformers as their enemies. “Giuliani flying in — rather than fighting corruption, he was supporting and meeting with all of the past corrupt people,” said Valeria Gontareva, the former head of Ukraine’s central bank. “As a result, it’s very hard to say what the message is that we now hear from America.” Nevertheless, anticorruption activists say they see signs of progress. Mr. Zelensky’s new prosecutor general is modernizing his corruption-plagued office and firing hundreds of prosecutors. A flurry of laws passed by Mr. Zelensky’s months-old parliamentary majority seeks to overhaul the justice system and criminalize illicit enrichment by public officials. The president has even signed legislation establishing a procedure for his own impeachment. When it comes to enforcing the law, however, Mr. Zelensky’s tests are just beginning. Ukraine’s mafia, for example, is trying to bribe and threaten members of Mr. Zelensky’s ruling bloc in Parliament to derail legislation to crack down on organized crime, said a senior lawmaker, David Arakhamia. “They meet them by their house and say, ‘We know where your parents live,’” said Mr. Arakhamia, the floor leader of Mr. Zelensky’s party in Parliament. And just this week Mr. Zelensky’s handpicked prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, offered his resignation after the leak of what he said was a doctored recording on which he is heard to say the president has a “primitive” understanding of economics. Mr. Honcharuk blamed the leak on forces trying to undermine the anticorruption drive. Mr. Zelensky refused his resignation. Perhaps Mr. Zelensky’s biggest challenge lies with his erstwhile patron, Ihor Kolomoisky, one of the oligarchs that Mr. Giuliani and his associates courted and the man Ms. Rozhkova believes is responsible for trying to intimidate her and her colleagues. Mr. Kolomoisky advanced Mr. Zelensky’s career by putting “Servant of the People” on his TV channel. Now, having returned from self-imposed exile in Israel and Switzerland, he is hoping to regain control of a bank that the government seized from him, alleging that he and his business partner siphoned billions of dollars out of it. “Even more than getting it back, I want to punish the guilty” responsible for seizing the bank, Mr. Kolomoisky told The New York Times in November. “The guilty must be put on the spike and the death penalty brought back for them.” In a recent phone interview, Mr. Kolomoisky denied having anything to do with the protests against the central bank, which have been covered extensively on the television channel he owns and populated by people transported in buses bearing the logo of one of his businesses. He called Mr. Giuliani an “honorable person.” Ms. Gontareva, who nationalized Mr. Kolomoisky’s bank, PrivatBank, in 2016, says she got a sample of the oligarch’s methods last year. First, she was hit by a car while in London, where she was living at the time. Then her house in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and her son’s car were hit by arson attacks. She decided to remain in London in self-imposed exile. Mr. Kolomoisky dismissed Ms. Gontareva’s allegations, saying she “has to be sent to the insane asylum.” Mr. Zelensky needs to demonstrate to Ukraine’s Western creditors that he is serious about prosecuting large-scale fraud in order to secure billions of dollars in sorely needed loans from the International Monetary Fund. In the impeachment proceedings in Washington, Ukraine has been tarnished by corruption accusations by Republicans and Democrats alike — feeding worries that Kyiv now faces a long-term challenge in winning bipartisan support even as its conflict with neighboring Russia continues. In America, “politicians are an extension of the electorate, and the electorate has already concluded that Ukraine is a corrupt country,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, who resigned as Mr. Zelensky’s national security adviser in September. “In practice, I expect the support of the United States to be minimal in the next year.” The new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, this fall allowed a longstanding case to proceed against a different business tycoon, Oleg Bakhmatyuk, who is also accused of siphoning money from his bank. But the Ukrainian authorities have not brought such charges against Mr. Kolomoisky. That has led to accusations that Mr. Zelensky is giving his media ally and former business partner special treatment — charges that both men deny. But high-profile corruption cases “won’t be credible until there’s action taken against Kolomoisky,” said Mr. Danylyuk, the former Zelensky adviser. “Bakhmatyuk won’t cut it.” Mr. Kolomoisky denies any wrongdoing in the PrivatBank matter. Mr. Bakhmatyuk also denies wrongdoing. Ukraine’s problems extend beyond Mr. Kolomoisky, however. The powerful S.B.U. intelligence agency remains in dire need of changes to stop it from intervening “in all areas of social life and business,” says the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a watchdog group. Rather than functioning as a Western intelligence service, the S.B.U. is able to take advantage of its wide-ranging powers to extract bribes and exert undue influence across Ukraine, its critics say. “Right now, corrupt elites from various agencies are trying to understand how to operate under the new political realities in Ukraine,” said the center’s executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. “They’re looking for whom to bribe, who to negotiate with.” A representative of Andriy Bohdan, Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff whom Mr. Bakhmatyuk blamed for his plight, did not respond to a request for comment. Dmytro Sologub, a deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said post-Soviet Ukraine was particularly vulnerable to corruption even compared to some other post-Communist European countries. Caught between warring European powers for centuries, the country has little legacy of its own trusted institutions. “The system we’re trying to change now was created and modified in the course of 25 years,” Mr. Sologub said. “That raises the question of how much time will be necessary to change it.”']","For Volodymyr Zelensky, taking on the oligarchs and organized crime is a domestic test with geopolitical consequences."
Mining Executives Face Homicide Charges in Brazil Dam Disaster,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the former president of the Brazil-based mining giant Vale and 15 other people with homicide, faulting them for negligence in a dam disaster that killed at least 259 people a year ago. Those charged include Vale’s former chief executive, Fabio Schvartsman, and other senior officials employed by Vale and by a German firm hired to assess the stability of its dams. They were also charged with environmental crimes, as were the companies. The announcement came days before the first anniversary of one of the deadliest mining disasters in years. The dam in Brumadinho, in the state of Minas Gerais, was built to hold waste from an iron ore mine. When it burst on Jan. 25, 2019, the company cafeteria and other facilities were buried in a torrent of mud. On Tuesday, one of the state prosecutors who brought the charges, William Garcia Pinto Coelho, said Vale had executives systematically hide evidence of safety concerns and retaliated against auditing firms that flagged problems. And the German firm Tüv Süd, Mr. Pinto Coelho said, was compensated for knowingly presenting Vale with misleading reports about the stability of its dams. Prosecutors said they had found evidence that Vale officials knew Brumadinho’s dam was at risk since at least November 2017. It was on an internal list of 10 dams at risk of bursting, they learned. “The goal of these omissions, ultimately, was to avoid any negative impacts to Vale’s reputation that could affect its market value,” Mr. Pinto Coelho said. Tüv Süd and Vale, he said, knowingly took risks “that could cause environmental damage, eventual homicide and deaths.” Federal prosecutors are still conducting their own investigation, which could yield more charges. Mr. Pinto Coelho said that the Brumadinho dam had not been the only one at risk, and that throughout the investigation, prosecutors advocated for action when they learned of other Vale sites deemed unstable. Pierpaolo Bottini, Mr. Schvartsman’s lawyer, said there was no evidence that the former Vale chief had been made aware of concerns about the dam in Brumadinho. “These charges are unfair and incompatible with Fabio’s track record,” Mr. Bottini said. The company said in a statement that it was “perplexed” by the charges announced Tuesday. “Vale trusts that the causes of the rupture will be completely determined and reaffirms its commitment to continue cooperating with the authorities,” the company said. In a statement of its own, Tüv Süd said it was cooperating with the authorities in Brazil and Germany. The company said the causes of the dam bursting “have not been conclusively ascertained.” Vale has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, reconstruction and compensation efforts in Brumadinho. But Alessandra Cristina de Oliveira, a Brumadinho councilwoman, said Tuesday that the city was still reeling. While recovery and reconstruction efforts have brought money and jobs to the town, many residents are fearful the bonanza will run out soon. The mining site, which was a pillar of the local economy, is not expected to reopen. “We don’t have anything that guarantees our survival after this,” Ms. de Oliveira said. “My fear is that we end up with a city that is both sick and bankrupt.” Soon after the dam burst, law enforcement officials said they had found clear evidence that Vale and its partners put profit over safety at mining sites. A similar dam burst at another Vale mine in Minas Gerais in 2015, killing 19 people and causing widespread environmental damage. As evidence of negligence mounted, Vale’s board last March suspended Mr. Schvartsman and other top executives. In November, a Congressional committee investigating the Brumadinho disaster recommended the indictment of 22 company officials. Around the same time, the National Mining Agency announced that it had concluded that Vale hid serious problems it was aware of in mandatory government reports. Letícia Casado contributed reporting from Brasília.']","A year after a dam burst killed at least 259 people, prosecutors accused company executives of covering up safety concerns."
China Says It Will Ban Plastics That Pollute Its Land and Water,2020-01-20,By Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — It’s piled up in landfills. It clutters fields and rivers, dangles from trees, and forms flotillas of waste in the seas. China’s use of plastic bags, containers and cutlery has become one of its most stubborn and ugliest environmental blights. So the Chinese government has introduced measures to drastically cut the amount of disposable plastic items that often become a hazard and an eyesore in the country, even deep in the countryside and in the oceans. Among the new guidelines are bans on the import of plastic waste and the use of nonbiodegradable plastic bags in major cities by the end of this year. Other sources of plastic garbage will be banned in Beijing, Shanghai and wealthy coastal provinces by the end of 2022, and that rule will extend nationwide by late 2025. Previous efforts to reduce the use of plastic bags have faltered in China, but the government has indicated that, this time, it will be more serious and systematic in tackling the problem. “Consumption of plastic products, especially single-use items, has been consistently rising,” said an explanation accompanying the new guidelines, which were released on Sunday by the environment ministry and China’s chief industrial planning agency. “There needs to be stronger comprehensive planning and a systematic rollout to clean up plastic pollution.” The plan is likely to be welcomed by many Chinese, who have become increasingly worried about polluted air, water, soil and natural surroundings. But it could be a hard sell for a society used to the convenience of online retailers and couriers who deliver hot meals and packages swaddled in plastic. Although people in China generally generate less plastic waste per capita than Americans, almost three-quarters of China’s plastic waste ends up in poorly managed landfills or out in the open. Environmental campaigners in China welcomed the effort to reduce plastic use, though some said it was not strict or detailed enough. Others raised doubts about the government’s ability to develop and promote substitutes for nonbiodegradable plastics that linger in soil, waterways and oceans for decades, even centuries. Given the severity of China’s pollution problems, greater urgency is needed, said Chen Liwen, a founder of China Zero Waste Villages, which promotes recycling in rural areas. “It’s certainly better than nothing,” she said, adding, “For disposable products — disposable plastic bags or many disposable food utensils — they should be outright banned.” Tang Damin, a campaigner in Beijing for Greenpeace East Asia, said in emailed comments that while “Beijing is addressing the problem seriously and pushing reusable containers as the right solution,” the policy would be far more effective with incentives like deposit return programs. The Chinese government appears to think that companies and consumers need time to get used to life with much less single-use plastic. Even wealthy economies have moved gingerly to ban plastic bags. Last year, New York State approved a ban on most single-use plastic bags that is to take effect on March 1, making it only the second state after California to impose such a prohibition. China’s plan for ending reliance on throwaway plastic sets out three phases until 2025. The restrictions start in bigger cities like Beijing and Shanghai, then move to smaller cities and towns, and lastly to villages. By the end of the year, the guidelines say, China will ban disposable foam plastic cutlery. Shops, restaurants and markets in major cities will have to stop using nonbiodegradable plastic bags by that deadline, and restaurants and food vendors nationwide will have to stop using straws made from nonbiodegradable plastic. China’s package delivery sector will have more time to adjust. By the end of 2022, couriers in Beijing, Shanghai and wealthy coastal provinces will have to stop using nonbiodegradable plastic packaging, tape and single-use sacks woven from plastic. By late 2025, that ban will extend nationwide. The policy’s effects may not be immediately visible, said William Liu, a senior consultant in Shanghai for Wood Mackenzie, which advises businesses about chemicals, energy and related sectors. “But going forward,” he said in an email, “as the ban rolls out to more cities and substitute materials gain traction, China’s polyethylene consumption will be impacted.” One sizable obstacle — given the size of China’s consumer market, the ubiquity of plastic and the amount that ends up being dumped — is the foam plastic food containers that most restaurants use for takeout orders and that are rarely reused. Orders sold online through Alibaba, JD.com, Meituan and other Chinese e-commerce outlets often arrive wrapped in multiple layers of plastic, apparently reflecting vendors’ fears that customers will reject dented or soiled deliveries. Chinese courier services used nearly 25 billion plastic bags for deliveries in 2018, according to an industry estimate cited by Workers’ Daily and other Chinese news outlets. “The levels of environmental protection and recycling will really upgrade only if the entire supply chain follows through,” said Zheng Yixing, the founder of the Helihuo Environmental Technology Company in Beijing, which promotes commercial recycling. The government said it would consider blacklisting companies that flout the plastic bans. The cooperation of the big online retail companies will be crucial, said Mr. Tang, the plastics campaigner. “Food delivery and e-commerce ballooned China’s dependence on single-use plastics and a general throwaway culture,” he said. “It is time for Alibaba, JD.com and Meituan to stop shying away from their role in the plastics crisis.” Wen Jing, a 28-year-old office worker in Beijing’s finance industry, said she welcomed the proposed restrictions, even if they brought inconvenience. “There are too many plastic products in life, and it’s polluting the environment,” she said in an interview. “But I think all the right things need to be in place so there are substitutes.” She had just left a supermarket with groceries in a plastic bag. “I bring my own bag,” she said, “though sometimes I still don’t.” Albee Zhang contributed research.']","Though likely to be welcomed by many Chinese who worry about pollution, the measures could be a hard sell for a society used to convenience."
"Extradition Hearings Begin for Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Officer Held in Canada",2020-01-20,By Dan Bilefsky,"['VANCOUVER, British Columbia — She has passed her days painting flowers, conferring with her lawyers, reading books and improving her English, ensconced in two different multimillion-dollar mansions in exclusive sections of Vancouver. But on Friday, after the city experienced a rare snowstorm, Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei chief financial officer detained in Vancouver and awaiting an extradition hearing on fraud charges, could be seen playfully throwing a snowball outside her house. Then she spotted a photographer. Her smile turned into a frown. In the 13 months since Ms. Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver airport, her life has been circumscribed by the terms of her $10 million bail. On Monday, it entered a new phase when her extradition hearing formally began. This part of the hearing, which could last a week, will examine whether the crime Ms. Meng is accused of constitutes a crime in Canada, a prerequisite under Canadian law for her extradition to proceed. This is known as the legal concept of “double criminality.” The United States, in a January 2019 indictment, charged, among other things, that Ms. Meng had deceived four banks into clearing transactions in Iran through Skycom, a subsidiary, violating American sanctions against Iran. Prosecutors say Ms. Meng lied to representatives of the bank HSBC in 2013 about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, telling them it was a partner when it was, in fact, a subsidiary. That put HSBC at risk of sanctions. On Monday, at the beginning of the proceedings, Richard Peck, a member of Ms. Meng’s defense team, said the case should be dismissed because it was founded on the accusation of breach of United States sanctions against Iran — sanctions that Canada does not accept. The claim of fraud, he said, was “a facade.” In the courtroom, Ms. Meng, sitting in a bulletproof defendant’s box at the back of the court, appeared composed and smiling as she conferred with her legal team. If her case goes ahead, the court will also hear her lawyers’ arguments that her rights were violated when she was arrested. Ms. Meng’s arrest has pushed Canada into the center of a tense diplomatic battle between China and the United States. President Trump once said he might consider interceding in the case if that helped him reach a trade deal with China. In what many called a retaliation for the arrest of Ms. Meng — one of China’s most prominent business executives — China has arrested two Canadians, accused them of espionage and detained them in secret jails, deprived of access to lawyers and their families. It is unclear when a final ruling in Ms. Meng’s extradition case will be made. In the meantime, she could face many more months in Vancouver. Vincent Pang, a Huawei board member and longtime friend of Ms. Meng’s, visits her about once a month. He said in an interview on Friday that he and the company “believe she is innocent, and so does she.” Nevertheless, Mr. Pang said, Ms. Meng is facing enormous emotional stress because of the uncertainty about her future and from being separated for long periods from her four children, all of whom live in China. He said her two youngest children were in Vancouver schools at the time of her arrest, which upended their lives. “She feels sorry for her family,” Mr. Pang said. According to one of the security guards monitoring her house, her family came to see her during the Christmas holidays. Her mother and husband have taken turns keeping her company. Ms. Meng lives in a seven-bedroom gated mansion in Vancouver’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood, valued at about 14 million Canadian dollars. Under the terms of her bail, she is able to travel relatively freely about the city, although she has an 11 p.m. curfew and a GPS tracker around her ankle. Her bail conditions, which give her the freedom to go shopping, are in stark contrast with the two Canadians detained in China, and have been criticized in Canada. But she seldom leaves the house, said one of two unarmed guards, who was standing near a makeshift tent outside Ms. Meng’s mansion on Friday. When she does, he said, it is usually to meet with her lawyers. Mr. Pang said that while Ms. Meng lived in a mansion, it was effectively a gilded cage. He said she had lost a lot of weight. “It’s not about how big her home is but what’s in her heart,” he said, adding, “She feels trapped.” Despite entreaties by him and others friends to go out more, Ms. Meng prefers to stay at home, Mr. Pang said. “If you’re detained, you don’t feel like shopping or eating,” he said. Still, on one occasion, Ms. Meng was spotted browsing at Holt Renfrew, the luxury retailer. And on China’s National Day, she wore a bright red Gucci dress to court, adorned with an enamel Chinese flag pin. Ms. Meng has hired an A-list legal team led by David Martin, one of Canada’s most high-powered lawyers, who specializes in white-collar crime. He has argued cases at the country’s Supreme Court and has defended members of foreign governments and ultrarich captains of industry seeking to avoid extradition. While Ms. Meng retains her chief financial officer title at Huawei and continues to take a role in the business, Mr. Pang said her responsibilities had been significantly scaled back, given that Shenzhen, where Huawei has its headquarters, is 16 hours ahead of Vancouver. In December, on the first anniversary of her arrest, Ms. Meng wrote a reflective letter, published on Huawei’s website, in which she said she had experienced moments of “fear,” “pain” and “disappointment” — but also acceptance. “When I was in Shenzhen, time used to pass by very quickly,” she wrote. She continued, “Right now, time seems to pass slowly.” After the letter was released, there was a backlash on social media against Huawei and sly allusions to the story of a former company employee, Li Hongyuan, who was jailed for more than eight months after he demanded severance pay when his contract wasn’t renewed. Mr. Li was eventually released with no charges, but some compared his detainment with Ms. Meng’s luxurious surroundings. In recent interviews with international news outlets, Ms. Meng’s father, Ren Zhengfei, who is Huawei’s billionaire founder, suggested that her detention had brought the two closer together. Before her arrest, Mr. Ren said, Ms. Meng rarely called or texted him. Now the two speak regularly by phone. When Mr. Ren turned 75 in October, Ms. Meng posted a handwritten birthday greeting on social media. The post included a photo of her standing outdoors, wearing her ankle monitor. The letter was signed “Piggy” — a nickname apparently given to her when she was a chubby child. Given that Ms. Meng is wanted by the United States on fraud charges, the irony has not gone unnoticed among local residents in her neighborhood that her 8,047-square-foot house is just a few doors down from the residence of the United States consul general, where an American flag flaps in the wind. A short walk away is the hulking Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China. Ji Jiahao, 22, came to Vancouver from Shanghai to study English and lives in a mansion on the same street as Ms. Meng. He said Ms. Meng had not broken any laws and should be released. “Canada has always been the little brother of United States,” he said. “It does whatever the United States does.” Hayden Rubensohn, a doctor who works in the area, said Ms. Meng’s bail conditions showed that Canada was a humane country. But he said they did spur some resentment in a city with a vast economic gaps. “It’s hard for people to see foreigners living with so much wealth,” he said, “when people in Vancouver are struggling to make ends meet.” Tracy Sherlock and Winston Szeto contributed reporting from Vancouver, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.']","A Chinese executive wanted by the U.S. may be passing her days in a Vancouver mansion, but friends say she is “trapped” in a gilded cage."

He said her two youngest children were in Vancouver schools at the time of her arrest, which upended their lives. “She feels sorry for her family,” Mr. Pang said. According to one of the security guards monitoring her house, her family came to see her during the Christmas holidays. Her mother and husband have taken turns keeping her company. Ms. Meng lives in a seven-bedroom gated mansion in Vancouver’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood, valued at about 14 million Canadian dollars. Under the terms of her bail, she is able to travel relatively freely about the city, although she has an 11 p.m. curfew and a GPS tracker around her ankle. Her bail conditions, which give her the freedom to go shopping, are in stark contrast with the two Canadians detained in China, and have been criticized in Canada. But she seldom leaves the house, said one of two unarmed guards, who was standing near a makeshift tent outside Ms. Meng’s mansion on Friday. When she does, he said, it is usually to meet with her lawyers. Mr. Pang said that while Ms. Meng lived in a mansion, it was effectively a gilded cage. He said she had lost a lot of weight. “It’s not about how big her home is but what’s in her heart,” he said, adding, “She feels trapped.” Despite entreaties by him and others friends to go out more, Ms. Meng prefers to stay at home, Mr. Pang said. “If you’re detained, you don’t feel like shopping or eating,” he said. Still, on one occasion, Ms. Meng was spotted browsing at Holt Renfrew, the luxury retailer. And on China’s National Day, she wore a bright red Gucci dress to court, adorned with an enamel Chinese flag pin. Ms. Meng has hired an A-list legal team led by David Martin, one of Canada’s most high-powered lawyers, who specializes in white-collar crime. He has argued cases at the country’s Supreme Court and has defended members of foreign governments and ultrarich captains of industry seeking to avoid extradition. While Ms. Meng retains her chief financial officer title at Huawei and continues to take a role in the business, Mr. Pang said her responsibilities had been significantly scaled back, given that Shenzhen, where Huawei has its headquarters, is 16 hours ahead of Vancouver. In December, on the first anniversary of her arrest, Ms. Meng wrote a reflective letter, published on Huawei’s website, in which she said she had experienced moments of “fear,” “pain” and “disappointment” — but also acceptance. “When I was in Shenzhen, time used to pass by very quickly,” she wrote. She continued, “Right now, time seems to pass slowly.” After the letter was released, there was a backlash on social media against Huawei and sly allusions to the story of a former company employee, Li Hongyuan, who was jailed for more than eight months after he demanded severance pay when his contract wasn’t renewed. Mr. Li was eventually released with no charges, but some compared his detainment with Ms. Meng’s luxurious surroundings. In recent interviews with international news outlets, Ms. Meng’s father, Ren Zhengfei, who is Huawei’s billionaire founder, suggested that her detention had brought the two closer together. Before her arrest, Mr. Ren said, Ms. Meng rarely called or texted him. Now the two speak regularly by phone. When Mr. Ren turned 75 in October, Ms. Meng posted a handwritten birthday greeting on social media. The post included a photo of her standing outdoors, wearing her ankle monitor. The letter was signed “Piggy” — a nickname apparently given to her when she was a chubby child. Given that Ms. Meng is wanted by the United States on fraud charges, the irony has not gone unnoticed among local residents in her neighborhood that her 8,047-square-foot house is just a few doors down from the residence of the United States consul general, where an American flag flaps in the wind. A short walk away is the hulking Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China. Ji Jiahao, 22, came to Vancouver from Shanghai to study English and lives in a mansion on the same street as Ms. Meng. He said Ms. Meng had not broken any laws and should be released. “Canada has always been the little brother of United States,” he said. “It does whatever the United States does.” Hayden Rubensohn, a doctor who works in the area, said Ms. Meng’s bail conditions showed that Canada was a humane country. But he said they did spur some resentment in a city with a vast economic gaps. “It’s hard for people to see foreigners living with so much wealth,” he said, “when people in Vancouver are struggling to make ends meet.” Tracy Sherlock and Winston Szeto contributed reporting from Vancouver, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.']","A Chinese executive wanted by the U.S. may be passing her days in a Vancouver mansion, but friends say she is “trapped” in a gilded cage."
1945: Court in Paris Sentences Writer to Death,2020-01-20,By The International Herald Tribune,"['Robert Brasillach, thirty-five-year-old French poet and author, was condemned to death by the Special Court of Justice in Paris yesterday for treason and intelligence with the enemy. He was the fourth outstanding writer to be given the death sentence for treason, Georges Suarez, Paul Chack and Henri Beraud having preceded him. Suarez and Chack were shot, while Beraud was reprieved by General de Gaulle.  Brasillach, who was editor of the collaborationist weekly “Je suis partout,” in which he published violent attacks against America, Britain and General de Gaulle, wrote one vitriolic article insulting President and Mrs. Roosevelt. The main charge against him was that he was released from a war prisoners’ camp in Germany against a promise to help the Germans with his writings.  Brasillach held his head high during the trial, saying that he did not regret his friendly attitude towards the Germans, and that it was France’s interest to collaborate with her continental neighbor. He accused America of egotism and spoke with contempt of the Atlantic Charter, citing Poland and Greece as proofs of its failure. When the judge pronounced sentence, he said: “That is an honor for me.” Someone in the courtroom shouted “assassins” at the judge and jurors, and was seized by the guards.  — The New York Herald, European Edition, Jan. 20, 1945 ']","Robert Brasillach, a French poet and author, was condemned by the Special Court of Justice for treason and intelligence with the enemy during World War II.

Toll in Attack on Yemen Military Base Rises to at Least 76,2020-01-19,By Saeed Al-Batati and Ben Hubbard,"['AL MUKALLA, Yemen — The death toll in a drone and missile attack on a government military training base in central Yemen rose to at least 76 on Sunday, representing an escalation bound to complicate international efforts to end the country’s prolonged war. The attack targeted soldiers gathered Saturday near a mosque in the central province of Mareb before evening prayers. Abdu Abdullah Majali, a spokesman for the Yemeni Army, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, provided the new death toll and said at least 81 people were wounded. But Yemen’s foreign minister, Mohammed al-Hadrami, gave a higher toll, saying more than 100 people were killed. He called it a “cowardly terrorist act that violates all religious and human customs and values” in a statement on his ministry’s Twitter feed.

Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been locked in civil war since the Houthis seized much of the nation’s northwest and its capital, Sana, in 2014. The next year, an Arab military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began launching airstrikes and backing forces on the ground to push back the Houthis and restore the government. But the war has settled into a stalemate and bred one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 10,000 people have been killed, and hunger and diseases like cholera have spread. International efforts to end the war have made little headway, although United Nations officials have brokered local cease-fires that have brought down the violence in some areas. The United Nations special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the attack and said that it and military escalation elsewhere in the country endanger peacemaking efforts. “I have said before that the hard-earned progress that Yemen has made on de-escalation is very fragile,” Mr. Griffiths said in a statement on Sunday. “Such actions can derail this progress. The negotiation tables are more effective than battlefields in resolving the conflict.” Yemen’s internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has spent most of the war exiled in Saudi Arabia, and he called on government forces to be on high alert for further strikes.

"His Mother Worked to Find Him Love Despite War, Blindness and Loss",2020-01-20,By Mujib Mashal,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The young poet sat in the barber’s chair, facing a giant mirror on the wall that he could not see. The poet was Zaheer Ahmad Zindani, and this was the eve of his wedding. The war in Afghanistan had taken many things from him: his eyes, his father, his sister, his first love. But he had a chance at a new beginning, preparing to marry a woman his mother had worked tirelessly to find. “Make it so no matter which of the four directions I comb, it looks good,” Mr. Zindani told the barber. The narrow alleys and matchbox houses in his neighborhood of Kandahar City, in southern Afghanistan, were dark. Electricity had been patchy since the Taliban blew up a cable that fed power to the city. Despite that, he was busy entertaining relatives. Leading the celebrations for the big day last month was his mother, Bibi Sediqa, the anchor of a family devastated at every turn, drawing on all her strength to keep it together and stay hopeful. Late into the evening, she and a group of women took Mr. Zindani to the bride’s for a traditional henna party where the couple painted little full moons in each other’s palms. The next evening, she was in the front seat of the car that brought the bride to her new home. “This was my first real happiness in life,” Ms. Sediqa said after the wedding. In a deeply conservative and patriarchal society in which many women are kept out of the public eye, even Ms. Sediqa, who is the main breadwinner for her family, did not want to be pictured for this article and was reluctant to be interviewed. She said she was married at 14. In the early years of the United States-led invasion, an American airstrike killed her husband in their home district of Gereshk, in Helmand. She was 26 and left with three young daughters and two sons. Zaheer was 7. Relocating to Chaman, a border area with Pakistan, she cooked  and cleaned in Pakistani homes to feed her children. Her young boys each worked for small change as mechanic’s apprentices in Afghanistan. Zaheer was in love with a childhood friend, their teenage romance blossoming with gift exchanges and sneaky dates. Then, another tragedy. As Zaheer, 17, and a younger sister were traveling to visit relatives in western Herat Province, their bus hit a Taliban roadside bomb. She burned to death; Zaheer was left blind. Ms. Sediqa rushed him to hospital after hospital — in Kabul, in the Pakistani city of Karachi, and even in India years later when she had saved enough. “They said the nerve-endings in the eyes are finished,” Ms. Sediqa said. Ms. Sediqa moved the family to Kandahar City. For a couple of years, she worked as  a polio vaccinator, going door to door to give drops. At night she took classes, resuming an education that had been disrupted when she was in third grade. These days, Ms. Sediqa has a day job as a literacy instructor, traveling to villages to teach adults how to read and write. She continues her own education at night. (Just before the wedding, she completed her 11th-grade exams.) After Mr. Zindani returned home from a  grueling and poignant peace march against violence that captured the country’s attention, he and his younger brother sold blocks of ice. Mr. Zindani’s urge to get married, and urgently, was as much out of a hurt. The family of his teenage love rejected him after he was blinded, marrying the girl to someone else. He was determined to prove that blindness was not the end. But convincing any family to marry their daughter to a blind man was tough work, and it fell on Ms. Sediqa. She knocked on as many as 18 doors, Mr. Zindani said. “They would all say, ‘We would happily agree if he hadn’t been blind,’” Mr. Zindani recalled. “My mother would say, ‘His eyes will be fixed.’ They would say, ‘Come back when they are fixed.’” Ms. Sediqa  had not given up hope that her son’s eyes would be fixed, going so far as to sell jewelry, borrow money and fly to Kabul to pay for a solution that turned out to be a scam. During her vaccination work, Ms. Sediqa met Sima, a woman in her early 20s who was teaching children Quranic studies at her home. Ms. Sediqa would stop by to give the children polio drops. She grew to like Sima, and started talking to Sima’s family. After more than a dozen visits  over a year, Sima’s parents said yes. Mr. Zindani’s disability was not much of an issue, they said, as long as he had good character and proved he could take care of a new family. Mr. Zindani’s assurance: He possessed a disability benefits card, and his family owned a lot of land back in their village in Gereshk. Once the Taliban were gone, they could make use of that land again. Sima’s parents said she had consented. But before a final nod, Sima’s mother and sister came over to Mr. Zindani’s home for one last conversation with the future groom. “They wanted to make sure I would be nice to their daughter, that I would respect her rights, that I wouldn’t be abusive,” Mr. Zindani said. “Both my mother and I told them since I am disabled and they are being generous with me, I will treat her as my crown.” On the wedding day, a small convoy of cars set off from Mr. Zindani’s home to the bride’s, snaking through Kandahar’s streets as an excited 14-year-old drummer provided a soundtrack from the back of a three-wheeler. Mr. Zindani seemed happy and excited, too. He said that what remained of his previous love, and the heartbreak of it, was now largely limited to poetic inspiration. He recited one of his latest verses: I came to this alley to ask about my love I wander in ruins; I hoped she hears my sigh. He said that he was stuck with images of his life before he went blind; since the bombing he is unable to visualize new acquaintances. “Love with open eyes — when you have fallen in love with someone you have seen — is different with that of closed eyes,” Mr. Zindani said. “When you can’t see the person, the thirst is not fulfilled the same.” At Sima’s house, the men were led to the veranda of an open-air mosque and the women into her home. The men sipped orange soda as the sun set while the women’s voices, singing to a simple hand drum called a daf, echoed through the neighborhood. The ceremony ended in about an hour, with a prayer by a local imam who wished the newlyweds eternal love — “the kind between the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija.” As the bride made her way out of her parents’ home and into the car adorned in flowers, Mr. Zindani’s friends danced in celebration in front of it. The young drummer played a simple rhythmic beat in the dim light of the moon. When the convoy returned to Mr. Zindani’s house with the bride, the women, still singing and playing their daf, took her inside to her throne where the party would continue into the night. Mr. Zindani stayed outside, in the dark alley, as his friends continued to dance. One friend spun and spun and spun, until the young drummer’s hands tired and he signaled its end. “I wish I could see it,” Mr. Zindani said. “But my heart is happy.”']",The war in Afghanistan has taken so much from the poet Zaheer Ahmad Zindani. His mother was determined to ensure it wouldn’t take his chance to marry.
"Yellow or Blue? In Hong Kong, Businesses Choose Political Sides",2020-01-19,By Hannah Beech and Lam Yik Fei,"['HONG KONG — The tapioca pearls at Fred Liu’s bubble teahouse are springy and fresh, just like the fish balls at Elaine Lau’s noodle shop. But that is not the only reason customers flock to these eateries in Hong Kong’s bustling Causeway Bay shopping district. Both are members of the so-called yellow economy, shops that openly support the democracy movement remaking Hong Kong as it strives to protect the freedoms differentiating the territory from the rest of China. After seven months of street protests against Beijing’s assault on these liberties, Hong Kong is color-coded — and bitterly divided. The yellow economy refers to the hue of umbrellas once used to defend demonstrators against pepper spray and streams of tear gas. That is in contrast to blue businesses, which support the police. Families and businesses have cleaved, sometimes forcefully, between those who believe Beijing must be compelled to carry out promised reforms and those who worry that the democracy crusade is destroying Hong Kong’s reputation as a stable financial capital. A middle ground between the blue and yellow factions barely exists. “I’m yellow, but my parents are blue,” said Ms. Lau, the fish ball noodle seller. “A lot of families are like that.” “Luckily, I control 90 percent of the restaurant,” she added, as diners slurped down bowls of soup. “So I can do what I want here.” Both Ms. Lau’s noodle shop and Mr. Liu’s teahouse are plastered with Post-it notes of encouragement for pro-democracy forces, mimicking the Lennon Wall in Prague where messages of dissent proliferated under Soviet domination. Maps and apps showing businesses’ perceived leanings help guide customers their way. “We want to show the Chinese Communist Party that Hong Kong people can be economically self-sufficient through the yellow economic circle,” Mr. Liu said. “We want to put pressure on blue shops to close.” Devoid of natural resources and crowded onto limited land, Hong Kong has flourished because of its people, mostly entrepreneurial immigrants who left China for better prospects in the former British colony. Hong Kong residents advanced up the economic ladder, as sweatshop laborers rose to become bosses with factories on the mainland and even real estate or shipping tycoons. Today, the territory, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, ranks behind only New York and London as a nexus of global finance. Yet months of unrest, along with the trade war between the United States and China, have battered Hong Kong’s economy, which entered recession last year. In the central business district, police officers fired live bullets and arrested unarmed students. On university campuses, students lobbed firebombs with homemade catapults. Tear gas has been unleashed in all but two of Hong Kong’s 18 districts. On Sunday the violence flared again as two police officers were beaten when officials tried to halt a pro-democracy rally in the Central district. Tourists from mainland China, a vital source of income for local businesses, have stayed away because of the turmoil. Retail sales have plummeted. Small-business owners, whose operations make up the bulk of Hong Kong’s enterprises, are bearing the brunt of the downturn, even as they contend with some of the highest rents in the world. Economic analysts fear for the city’s future. “A deterioration of the sociopolitical situation and delays in addressing structural challenges of insufficient housing supply and high income inequality could further weaken economic activity and negatively affect the city’s competitiveness in the long term,” the International Monetary Fund warned last month. Amanda Leung’s family has sold dried seafood for three generations. In recent years, mainland visitors concerned about the safety of the domestic food supply have been some of her biggest customers, she said. They bought fish maw and mollusks, abalone and sea cucumber. “They have stopped coming,” she said. Still, Ms. Leung said she understood the frustrations that have kept the protest movement going, from peaceful marches of more than a million people demonstrating against a now-withdrawn extradition bill to the passions of a hard core of brick-throwing youth. “China should leave Hong Kong alone,” she said. “We can do business our own way.” As tempers have flared, businesses on both sides of the color divide have been attacked. Down the street from Mr. Liu’s tea shop, vandals lobbed red paint at a food stall known as a yellow establishment, while a nearby snack food store considered to be pro-Beijing was damaged. The battle has gone online, too. Ken Leung helped create WhatsGap, a popular app in Hong Kong that maps businesses that are considered yellow, helping them draw customers. This month Google removed the app from its online store, saying it violated its policies related to sensitive events, but critics said the company might have been acting to placate China. Apple pulled a similar service from its app offerings last year. “The divide in Hong Kong society has only increased, not lessened,” Mr. Leung said. But in November, pro-democracy candidates won a landslide victory in district council elections, the first time that Hong Kong voters had a chance to express their positions on the protests since this movement began. The yellow economy was backed up by the ballot box. “There’s a perception that Hong Kong businesspeople are not sympathetic to the protests, but look at the silent majority that spoke in large peaceful marches or in the district council elections,” said Todd Darling, an American restaurateur who has lived in Hong Kong for 16 years. As the protests gathered force last year, Rocky Siu watched as an orderly column of demonstrators, miles long, marched past one of his ramen restaurants. When the police cracked down, he opened his doors, offering half-price bowls of noodles and free saline solution to wash the tear gas from protesters’ eyes. “I’m losing money, but that’s not the point,” he said. “We have to support our young people.” Mr. Siu’s father was born in China and came to Hong Kong to seek a better life. But he owns a jewelry factory on the mainland and is, as Mr. Siu puts it, “deep blue.” “I tell him, ‘I don’t understand. You escaped China, but now you’re supporting them,’” Mr. Siu said. “To me, it’s not yellow or blue. It’s black and white, right and wrong.” Elaine Yu contributed reporting.']","Shops and restaurants are now being labeled either yellow, to note support for the city’s protest movement, or blue, in support of the police. The move is having a big economic impact."
A Surge of Migrants Rushes a Mexican Border Crossing,2020-01-19,By Brent McDonald,"['CIUDAD TECÚN UMÁN, Guatemala — After days of walking and hitchhiking, a crowd of migrants rushed a bridge at Guatemala’s border with Mexico on Saturday and clashed with Mexican police who used pepper spray and closed the crossing’s large metal gates to keep them out. More than 1,000 migrants were trying to cross the bridge spanning the Suchiate River, which delineates a section of the border between Guatemala and Mexico. After calm was restored, small groups of 20 or so migrants, many of them women and children from Central America, were allowed to file through in orderly fashion and register with Mexican migration officials. The melee was the latest test of President Andres Manuel López Obrador’s resolve to get tougher on undocumented migration and stop the flow of migrants illegally entering Mexico, many of them trying to make their way to the United States. The governments of Mexico and several Central American countries, the source of many of the undocumented migrants who have sought to cross the southwest border of the United States in recent years, have been under pressure from President Trump to help stem the flow of migrants. Mr. Trump temporarily withheld development aid and threatened tariffs to try to force his counterparts in the region to take a tougher stance. The showdown on the southern border of Mexico on Saturday involved the vanguard of a mass mobilization of migrants, most of them Hondurans who set off from the northern city of San Pedro Sula earlier this week as part of a new caravan. They are part of a tradition of mass migrations that have offered safety in numbers to participants. Over the years, such caravans have usually numbered in the hundreds and have mostly passed unnoticed. But in fall 2018, a caravan that at one point numbered more than 7,000, according to the Mexican authorities, caught the attention of Mr. Trump. He turned the matter into a campaign issue, warning against an invasion along the American border. By some estimates, the current mobilization is also in the thousands. The Guatemalan authorities say that more than 4,000 migrants, part of this scattered caravan, have entered Guatemala from Honduras since Wednesday. Many of them had been expected to arrive in the small Guatemalan border city of Tecún Umán on Saturday or Sunday.  In recent days, as the caravan approached the Guatemalan border with Mexico, the Mexican authorities announced that only migrants who registered with proper documentation seeking asylum, work permits or other protections would be allowed to enter. Once registered in Mexico, migrants were transported on white unmarked busses to another location to continue their application process. Mr. López Obrador said Friday that 4,000 jobs in southern Mexico needed to be filled, which seemed to raise hopes among migrants here that they would be offered employment at the border. But at the same time, the Mexican government also stepped up its enforcement of its border. On Saturday, dozens of armed National Guard and marines lined the banks of the Suchiate River across from Tecún Umán to prevent migrants from slipping across. A recording warned migrants over a loudspeaker that the United States would not be granting asylum and would instead send them back to Guatemala. “Mexico will offer opportunities of employment in your country of origin,” the message added. On Friday night, Alex Valladares, 28, sat on a sidewalk with other migrants bedding down on plastic and cardboard in Tecún Umán. He said he had worked for years in Indianapolis as an undocumented mechanic until he was discovered by the authorities and sent back to Honduras, his home country. “I’m searching for a better life, employment,” Mr. Valladares said. At one time, his heart was set on returning to the United States. But now, Mr. Valladares said, he sees more opportunity in Mexico. A friend who had also been deported from the United States had called to offer him a job as a mechanic in Veracruz, a Mexican city on the Gulf of Mexico. All he had to do was get there. “Better that I can stay in Mexico where they’ll give me papers to work legally,” he said. Kirk Semple contributed reporting from Mexico City.']",The latest influx from Guatemala is testing Mexico’s resolve to restrict the movement of undocumented migrants under pressure from the United States.
China Confirms New Coronavirus Spreads From Humans to Humans,2020-01-20,By Javier C. Hernández and Austin Ramzy,"['WUHAN, China — The mysterious coronavirus that has killed at least four people and sickened more than 200 in China is capable of spreading from person to person, a prominent Chinese scientist said on Monday, adding to fears of a broader epidemic. The disclosure increased pressure on the Chinese government to contain a growing public health crisis, just as China enters its busiest travel season of the year. On Tuesday, the authorities confirmed a fourth death from the illness in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The authorities had previously said the deadly virus seemed capable of spreading only from animals to humans in most cases, tracing the outbreak to a market in Wuhan. But in recent days at least two people have become infected with the pneumonialike virus even though they live hundreds of miles from Wuhan, experts said on Monday, suggesting that the illness is spreading from person to person. “Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon,” Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who is leading a government-appointed expert panel on the outbreak, said in an interview on state-run television on Monday. The World Health Organization announced Monday that it was convening an emergency meeting on Wednesday “to ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it.” Millions of Chinese are traveling this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, adding to fears that the virus could spread swiftly and on a broader scale. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would now depend on how many people, on average, a person with virus could infect. “There are now sufficient cases that it’s not going to die out by chance,” said Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College London who has studied the new virus. “The real question now is, how efficiently can this virus spread from person to person?” China’s leader, Xi Jinping, said on Monday that the outbreak “must be taken seriously” and that every possible measure should be taken to contain it, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. Also on Monday, the authorities reported that new cases had been detected for the first time in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern province of Guangdong, all hundreds of miles from Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. In many of these cases, people infected with the virus had traveled to Wuhan. Here is what we know about the virus, where it has been found, how it is spreading and what precautions are being taken: The government of Wuhan first confirmed on Dec. 31 that hospitals in the city were treating dozens of patients for pneumonia with an unknown cause. Many of the cases were connected to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. Considered a likely source of the virus, the market was closed and disinfected. The health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that the illness had also appeared in people who had not been exposed to the market, raising the possibility that the virus could be present elsewhere in the city. Local officials have pledged to handle the outbreak with transparency. But the memory of how China initially covered up the extent of a deadly SARS outbreak that infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003 has not completely faded. Although flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China remain skeptical. Over the weekend, the number of reported cases more than tripled to about 200, mostly in Wuhan. One more person in the city died, bringing the total death toll to three, while nine others remained critically ill, the city’s health commission said. Twenty-five people have recovered. The authorities have started detecting the country’s first cases outside of Wuhan. Five new cases were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong Province, and two in Shanghai. The total number of cases climbed to at least 219. The World Health Organization said the spike in reported cases was the result of increased searching and testing for respiratory illnesses. Researchers in China identified the mysterious pneumonialike illness in early January as a new coronavirus. Experts initially said that it did not appear to be readily spread by humans, but on Monday Dr. Zhong, the scientist appointed by the government to study the outbreak, said that in Guangdong, two individuals appeared to have been infected by relatives who had traveled to Wuhan. Dr. Zhong said the virus could be present in particles of saliva. In one case, he said, a patient appears to have infected 14 medical workers. Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, like the sun’s corona. Such viruses cause several illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like SARS. Dr. Zhong was China’s leading SARS expert during that outbreak. According to the World Health Organization, common signs of infection include fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties like shortness of breath. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death. The authorities in Thailand detected the new coronavirus last week in two Chinese women who had flown from Wuhan to Bangkok on separate trips. The government said the women, aged 74 and 61, were in good condition. In Japan, a Chinese man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 was also confirmed to have the disease. He was discharged after five days in a hospital. South Korea confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Monday in a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived on Sunday at Incheon International Airport, which serves Seoul. The woman was found with a fever, muscle pain and other symptoms while going through customs and was immediately quarantined for tests, said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The woman was traveling with five other people intending to spend the Lunar New Year holidays in South Korea and Japan, Ms. Jung said. South Korean officials were running tests on anyone believed to have come in contact with the woman in the plane, she said. In Hong Kong, the government initiated a disease response plan after the first cases were reported in Wuhan. Dozens of people were hospitalized after returning to Hong Kong from mainland China, but none were found to have been infected with the new virus. Five people who traveled from Wuhan to Zhejiang, a coastal Chinese province south of Shanghai, are being treated for fever but have not been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the health authorities there said. State media also reported six suspected cases on Monday, including two in Sichuan Province, one in Shanghai, one in Yunnan Province, one in Shandong Province and one in the region of Guangxi. In the southern city of Shenzhen, the authorities have started imposing temperature screening procedures at the airport and at train and bus stations. The city said it would also crack down on the illegal trading of wild animals. The W.H.O. says animals appear to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak, though it is still not known which animals are responsible. Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, like SARS, were believed to have emerged from markets where people and live animals were in regular contact. To prevent the spread of respiratory infections, the W.H.O. recommends that people wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing, and avoid direct contact with farm or wild animals. The health authorities in Hong Kong have also advised residents traveling outside the city not to touch live animals, not to eat wild animals, and to avoid markets selling fresh meat and live poultry.

"His Mother Worked to Find Him Love Despite War, Blindness and Loss",2020-01-20,By Mujib Mashal,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The young poet sat in the barber’s chair, facing a giant mirror on the wall that he could not see. The poet was Zaheer Ahmad Zindani, and this was the eve of his wedding. The war in Afghanistan had taken many things from him: his eyes, his father, his sister, his first love. But he had a chance at a new beginning, preparing to marry a woman his mother had worked tirelessly to find. “Make it so no matter which of the four directions I comb, it looks good,” Mr. Zindani told the barber. The narrow alleys and matchbox houses in his neighborhood of Kandahar City, in southern Afghanistan, were dark. Electricity had been patchy since the Taliban blew up a cable that fed power to the city. Despite that, he was busy entertaining relatives. Leading the celebrations for the big day last month was his mother, Bibi Sediqa, the anchor of a family devastated at every turn, drawing on all her strength to keep it together and stay hopeful. Late into the evening, she and a group of women took Mr. Zindani to the bride’s for a traditional henna party where the couple painted little full moons in each other’s palms. The next evening, she was in the front seat of the car that brought the bride to her new home. “This was my first real happiness in life,” Ms. Sediqa said after the wedding. In a deeply conservative and patriarchal society in which many women are kept out of the public eye, even Ms. Sediqa, who is the main breadwinner for her family, did not want to be pictured for this article and was reluctant to be interviewed. She said she was married at 14. In the early years of the United States-led invasion, an American airstrike killed her husband in their home district of Gereshk, in Helmand. She was 26 and left with three young daughters and two sons. Zaheer was 7. Relocating to Chaman, a border area with Pakistan, she cooked  and cleaned in Pakistani homes to feed her children. Her young boys each worked for small change as mechanic’s apprentices in Afghanistan. Zaheer was in love with a childhood friend, their teenage romance blossoming with gift exchanges and sneaky dates. Then, another tragedy. As Zaheer, 17, and a younger sister were traveling to visit relatives in western Herat Province, their bus hit a Taliban roadside bomb. She burned to death; Zaheer was left blind. Ms. Sediqa rushed him to hospital after hospital — in Kabul, in the Pakistani city of Karachi, and even in India years later when she had saved enough. “They said the nerve-endings in the eyes are finished,” Ms. Sediqa said. Ms. Sediqa moved the family to Kandahar City. For a couple of years, she worked as  a polio vaccinator, going door to door to give drops. At night she took classes, resuming an education that had been disrupted when she was in third grade. These days, Ms. Sediqa has a day job as a literacy instructor, traveling to villages to teach adults how to read and write. She continues her own education at night. (Just before the wedding, she completed her 11th-grade exams.) After Mr. Zindani returned home from a  grueling and poignant peace march against violence that captured the country’s attention, he and his younger brother sold blocks of ice. Mr. Zindani’s urge to get married, and urgently, was as much out of a hurt. The family of his teenage love rejected him after he was blinded, marrying the girl to someone else. He was determined to prove that blindness was not the end. But convincing any family to marry their daughter to a blind man was tough work, and it fell on Ms. Sediqa. She knocked on as many as 18 doors, Mr. Zindani said. “They would all say, ‘We would happily agree if he hadn’t been blind,’” Mr. Zindani recalled. “My mother would say, ‘His eyes will be fixed.’ They would say, ‘Come back when they are fixed.’” Ms. Sediqa  had not given up hope that her son’s eyes would be fixed, going so far as to sell jewelry, borrow money and fly to Kabul to pay for a solution that turned out to be a scam. During her vaccination work, Ms. Sediqa met Sima, a woman in her early 20s who was teaching children Quranic studies at her home. Ms. Sediqa would stop by to give the children polio drops. She grew to like Sima, and started talking to Sima’s family. After more than a dozen visits  over a year, Sima’s parents said yes. Mr. Zindani’s disability was not much of an issue, they said, as long as he had good character and proved he could take care of a new family. Mr. Zindani’s assurance: He possessed a disability benefits card, and his family owned a lot of land back in their village in Gereshk. Once the Taliban were gone, they could make use of that land again. Sima’s parents said she had consented. But before a final nod, Sima’s mother and sister came over to Mr. Zindani’s home for one last conversation with the future groom. “They wanted to make sure I would be nice to their daughter, that I would respect her rights, that I wouldn’t be abusive,” Mr. Zindani said. “Both my mother and I told them since I am disabled and they are being generous with me, I will treat her as my crown.” On the wedding day, a small convoy of cars set off from Mr. Zindani’s home to the bride’s, snaking through Kandahar’s streets as an excited 14-year-old drummer provided a soundtrack from the back of a three-wheeler. Mr. Zindani seemed happy and excited, too. He said that what remained of his previous love, and the heartbreak of it, was now largely limited to poetic inspiration. He recited one of his latest verses: I came to this alley to ask about my love I wander in ruins; I hoped she hears my sigh. He said that he was stuck with images of his life before he went blind; since the bombing he is unable to visualize new acquaintances. “Love with open eyes — when you have fallen in love with someone you have seen — is different with that of closed eyes,” Mr. Zindani said. “When you can’t see the person, the thirst is not fulfilled the same.” At Sima’s house, the men were led to the veranda of an open-air mosque and the women into her home. The men sipped orange soda as the sun set while the women’s voices, singing to a simple hand drum called a daf, echoed through the neighborhood. The ceremony ended in about an hour, with a prayer by a local imam who wished the newlyweds eternal love — “the kind between the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija.” As the bride made her way out of her parents’ home and into the car adorned in flowers, Mr. Zindani’s friends danced in celebration in front of it. The young drummer played a simple rhythmic beat in the dim light of the moon. When the convoy returned to Mr. Zindani’s house with the bride, the women, still singing and playing their daf, took her inside to her throne where the party would continue into the night. Mr. Zindani stayed outside, in the dark alley, as his friends continued to dance. One friend spun and spun and spun, until the young drummer’s hands tired and he signaled its end. “I wish I could see it,” Mr. Zindani said. “But my heart is happy.”']",The war in Afghanistan has taken so much from the poet Zaheer Ahmad Zindani. His mother was determined to ensure it wouldn’t take his chance to marry.
U.K. Police Plan Driving Classes at Air Base After Fatal Crash,2020-01-21,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The British police will offer free driver training to employees at an air base that hosts a United States Air Force communication station, after two incidents threatened a repeat of a crash that killed a British teenager and prompted a monthslong diplomatic tug of war between Britain and the United States. The teenager, Harry Dunn, 19, died in August when his motorcycle collided with a car being driven on the wrong side of the road by an American, Anne Sacoolas, whose husband, also an American, then worked at the base, R.A.F. Croughton. Ms. Sacoolas left Britain shortly after the crash under a claim of diplomatic immunity, and the United States rejected an official British request to extradite her on a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, despite emotional appeals from Mr. Dunn’s parents, who even met with President Trump. [Update: U.S. refuses extradition in fatal crash, prompting anger in the U.K.] Last Friday, another car driving on the wrong side of the road almost collided with another vehicle near the base. That prompted the chief constable of the Northamptonshire Police, which is responsible for the area, to call an urgent meeting with the base commander. “I do not underestimate how much of a concerning incident this was and how much worse it could have been, especially considering the circumstances in which 19-year-old Harry Dunn tragically died,” the chief constable, Nick Adderley, said in a statement on Saturday. He also said that a police vehicle had been hit by another car driving on the wrong side of the road in Northampton, a nearby town, in early October. No one was injured in either incident. After talking with senior officials at R.A.F. Croughton, Mr. Adderley said on Monday that road policing experts would provide free training to all employees and new arrivals at the base. “This is only the beginning,” he added on Twitter, “and I have agreed to provide that training for free to ensure every member of staff at R.A.F. Croughton receives the input and understands the requirements” for driving in Britain. Even President Trump said after the August crash that driving on the left-hand side of the road in Britain could be problematic for people accustomed to driving on the right. “You know those are the opposite roads, that happens,” he said in October. “I won’t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to driving on our system, and then you’re all of a sudden on the other system when you’re driving, it happens.” He called the death of Harry Dunn a “terrible accident.” Mr. Dunn’s family welcomed the latest move by the Northamptonshire Police. His mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC on Tuesday that numerous people had contacted the family about similar incidents across Britain, and the BBC reported that it had seen evidence of more than a dozen. Mr. Dunn’s parents said in a statement on Tuesday that the crash that killed him was “not a one off.” “One of the key objectives of our campaign after we lost Harry,” they said, “is to ensure that this never happens to another family again.”']","Harry Dunn, a British teenager, was killed by an American driving on the wrong side of the road near a military base.

The Test a Deadly Coronavirus Outbreak Poses to China’s Leadership,2020-01-21,By Javier C. Hernández,"[""WUHAN, China — Facing growing pressure to contain a deadly viral outbreak that has spread halfway around the world, China’s ruling Communist Party raced on Tuesday to confront the disease, slapping restrictions on the city where it started and warning that anyone who hides infections will be “forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.” The response by the Chinese leadership, which has come under intensifying criticism that it has been slow to acknowledge the severity of the outbreak, came as fatalities from the disease tripled to at least nine. Infections surged from 200 to 440, and global financial markets were rattled by the possibility of a pandemic emanating from the world’s most populous country during the Lunar New Year — Asia’s heaviest travel season. Already, cases of the pneumonia-like virus have been found in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and on Tuesday the first was confirmed in the United States. Airports in Atlanta and Chicago said they would screen passengers from Wuhan, joining airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and cities around the world in doing so. North Korea temporarily closed its borders to foreign tours, the vast majority of them from China. The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday over whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency. In Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million where the outbreak began, the authorities have banned group tours out of the city and ordered vehicles checked for live animals. Nervous residents are buying up face masks and flooding hospitals to report fevers and coughs. Some schools are canceling classes and even Buddhist temples are turning away the faithful. At home and abroad, the Chinese authorities are facing demands for greater transparency in their disclosures about the disease, as new cases emerge in other major Chinese cities. As of late Tuesday, there were 440 cases in 13 provinces in China. The outbreak is testing China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the party’s penchant for secrecy in moments of crisis, 17 years after Beijing drew widespread criticism for withholding information and acting slowly in handling the outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 800 people and infected more than 8,000 worldwide. Mr. Xi, who has sought to expand China’s global influence, seems eager to shake the shadow of SARS and show that Beijing can handle a public health crisis like a responsible world power. A top party committee on Tuesday said in stark terms that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections. “Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame,” the committee said in a post on a popular social media site. The post was later deleted. On Monday, China’s health commission said it would respond with measures intended to manage outbreaks of the most virulent diseases, including mandatory reporting of cases. It classified the virus as a class B infectious disease — a category that includes diseases such as SARS. But the government, wary of letting fear run rampant, is also working meticulously to control the narrative about the virus by censoring news articles and social media posts. The police in Wuhan investigated eight citizens this month for spreading what it described as rumors on the internet. Now, even as the government works to isolate sick patients amid travel by millions of people making visits for the Lunar New Year holiday,  there is concern that the party’s long-held reluctance to divulge damaging news could hinder the effort to contain the virus. For weeks, the government had largely treated the outbreak as a problem isolated to Wuhan. It was only after the Hong Kong news media reported that cases of the coronavirus had been detected elsewhere that the government began acknowledging, early Monday, that the disease had spread to other cities. Many wondered why the central government waited until Monday to allow a top health expert to speak publicly about the outbreak. The expert not only corroborated what the Hong Kong news media had already reported but confirmed vital new information: that the virus spreads between people. “The response is not fast enough, it’s not strong enough,” said Shen Zhengjiang, 57, a teacher, as he looked for masks at a pharmacy in Wuhan on Tuesday. “The local officials are paying attention to this now only because Xi Jinping spoke up.” The outbreak presents Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, with one of the most serious public health crises of his tenure. It will be a significant test of his leadership at a time when China is seeking to strengthen trust in the party and to project confidence in Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach. Any missteps could undermine the party’s credibility in the eyes of the public, experts said. “This is the sort of thing that could absolutely gnaw at the confidence and legitimacy of the whole regime,” said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London. Experts said the challenge for Mr. Xi would be daunting, as the world looks to China to stop the virus before it spreads on a global scale. Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University, said that it appeared Mr. Xi was seeking to show that the virus is under control and would not cause social unrest. But he said the government’s initial failure to detail the spread of the virus to mainland cities and to disclose that medical workers had been infected was worrying. “So far this pattern of a lack of transparency and inaction has unfortunately not changed,” said Professor Huang, an expert on the SARS epidemic. “The politics continue to constrain the government to respond effectively.” The Chinese government, which has been praised by the W.H.O. for its efforts so far, has said it took time to analyze the coronavirus, which experts believe appears to be mostly transmitted to humans by animals. The delay in reporting the spread of the disease was attributed to technological challenges, but also bureaucratic ones. Some hospitals lacked testing kits, according to remarks on Monday by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent scientist who is leading a government-appointed panel of experts helping control the outbreak. The process was also slowed down, he said, because local hospitals were required to submit cases to the central health commission in Beijing for review before going public. For weeks, the authorities in Wuhan seemed to play down the threat posed by the virus. The health department said that it had been found only in people who visited a local market that sold live fish, birds and other animals, and that workers had disinfected and shut down the site. Questions have emerged on Chinese social media about whether the Chinese government has been forthcoming. Many articles and posts, including some using the hashtag #WuhanSARS, were censored. After his stepmother died of viral pneumonia last week, Kyle Hui, 32, an architect from Shanghai, turned to Weibo, a Twitterlike site, to report her case. Mr. Hui’s stepmother was never formally tested for the virus, and he was concerned that the Wuhan government was underreporting cases of the illness. But his post soon disappeared from the internet. “People accuse me of spreading rumors, but I’m just trying to tell my stepmother's story,” he said in an interview at a cafe in Wuhan. It was not until Monday that the government changed course, after news outlets in Hong Kong reported over the weekend that there were several potential cases of the illness in Shanghai and Shenzhen, a southern city. The central government dispatched Dr. Zhong, a renowned expert with a reputation for bluntness, to Wuhan. Dr. Zhong revealed for the first time that the virus could spread from person to person — noting, for example, that one patient had infected 14 medical workers.  Dr. Zhong won wide praise from the Chinese public, and memes circulated online contrasting his urgent tone with the calm words of local officials. The spread of the virus has upended the Lunar New Year holiday this week, when millions of Chinese return to their hometowns to celebrate.  In Wuhan, some residents have canceled plans to go out to lavish meals for the new year and say they are avoiding enclosed spaces like movie theaters. Some firms have instructed employees to stay home. Many people now wear masks throughout the day, as they make dinner, play cards or chat with friends. Some residents are packing up and leaving Wuhan, vowing to stay away until the virus is contained. At the Wuhan airport on Tuesday, Luo Jie, 62, a retiree, rushed to catch a flight to Beijing that she had booked that morning. She said she wanted to “escape” because the outbreak reminded her of the SARS crisis. “I hope the government will report the epidemic honestly,” she said. “That’s how to set people’s minds at ease.” Austin Ramzy and Elaine Yu in Hong Kong contributed reporting.

International Powers Call for Cease-Fire in Libya’s Long Civil War,2020-01-19,By Katrin Bennhold and Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Russia, Turkey and a dozen other international powers with competing interests in oil-rich Libya called Sunday for a cease-fire and an arms embargo, committing to end their own interference on the ground to give Libyans space for a political reconciliation. Sunday’s gathering, hosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, offered a small glimmer of hope in the North African nation’s protracted civil war, which has been further complicated recently by an escalating proxy war between Turkey and Russia. Both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, whose countries have mercenaries on the ground, attended the meeting. But the leaders of Libya’s two warring factions — the embattled head of the United Nations-backed government and a former Libyan army general who is laying siege to the capital — refused to even spend time in the same room. Ms. Merkel said the international participants spoke only individually to the two Libyan leaders, who were not at the conference table but were kept informed of developments throughout the day. “We all agreed that we need a political solution,” Ms. Merkel said. “Recent days have shown that there is no chance for a military solution.” In a modest breakthrough, both sides in the conflict agreed to send representatives to another meeting in Geneva, where they will soon begin working out what a solution might look like. But expectations remain low that these talks will lead to any kind of a lasting peace on the ground in the near future. Even as the talks were underway, rebel forces launched fresh attacks on the Libyan capital, Tripoli. General Khalifa Hifter, the militia leader, has the upper hand on the ground, and appears to be the biggest wild card. Just last week, Russia and Turkey brought both him and Libya’s prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, to Moscow to get them to sign a permanent cease-fire agreement. But General Hifter refused to obey his Russian backers and left without signing. On Sunday, he abruptly left the chancellery in Berlin and could not be coaxed back from his hotel, officials said. He is traveling to Moscow again on Monday, officials said, where he will hold further talks with Mr. Putin. Nevertheless, negotiators at the meeting did emerge with at least a statement agreed to by the leaders of 12 countries, as well as the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union and the Arab League. “We call for the termination of all military movements by, or in direct support of, the conflict parties, in and over the entire territory of Libya, starting from the beginning of the cease-fire process,” it said. It also said: “We commit to refraining from interference in the armed conflict or in the internal affairs of Libya and urge all international actors to do the same. Only a Libyan-led and Libyan owned political process can end the conflict and bring lasting peace.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States remained committed to a political solution in Libya and expressed confidence that Sunday’s agreement represented a first step to achieving that goal. “I think we made progress,” Mr. Pompeo said. “At least progress in getting fewer new weapons systems, fewer new forces to flow into the region so that we can get at least a standstill so that we can begin to unwind this potential tragedy and get to the political resolution I know everybody that came there today wanted to achieve.” The Libyan conflict has festered for nearly nine years, and for much of that time, the United States and Europe have stayed on the sidelines. Libya began drawing attention mainly when it became a gateway for tens thousands of migrants in 2015 and 2016. But the recent involvement of Russia and Turkey on opposite sides of the prolonged civil war has created a new urgency for peace efforts. The conflict has turned into one of the Middle East’s most intractable proxy wars, with potentially cascading consequences for stability in Europe’s backyard. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt are backing General Hifter. Turkey is defending the internationally recognized government in the capital. Even within the European Union, different member countries have tacitly backed different sides, with varying intensity. France has been on General Hifter’s side, while Italy has traditionally been closer to the official government in Tripoli. “I worry about the presence of Syrian and foreign fighters in the city of Tripoli,” President Emmanuel Macron of France planned to tell fellow leaders in Berlin, according to a draft of his speech seen by The New York Times. “That has to stop,” Mr. Macron said. “No one must play a two-faced game.” António Guterres, the United Nations general secretary, said: “Today all participants committed to refrain from the armed conflict or internal affairs in Libya. These must be adhered to.” The Libyan conflict has become a test case for German and European ambitions to uphold a multilateral world order. Some saw the Berlin conference as an attempt to resurrect this sort of diplomacy in an era where multilateral agreements have been fast eroding, from the Paris climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal. “What’s at stake is whether, in the current climate with the United States absent as the world’s policeman, it is still possible to reach international agreements with diplomacy and implement multilateral solutions,” said Daniel Gerlach, editor in chief of Zenith Magazine, a German publication specializing in the Middle East. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said that Sunday’s talks represented a return to European engagement in the region. But for the endeavor to succeed, he said, Europe must find a unified voice and position and remain actively engaged to prevent the crisis in Libya from destabilizing the entire Mediterranean region. “Previous agreements in Italy, Palermo, in France in Versailles and also in Abu Dhabi were one-shot events,” Mr. Borrell said, referring to other talks on Libya in recent years. “Here is the beginning of a process, and the important thing will be the implementation of this process.” German officials hope that Sunday’s agreement is a starting point for a meaningful longer-term process to bring stability to Libya. Berlin has its own interest in preventing the conflict from spiraling further out of control. With the numbers of migrants seeking asylum in Germany at their lowest level since 2013, the government in Berlin is looking to prevent a larger crisis that could again drive hundreds of thousands of people to cross the Mediterranean Sea to seek asylum in Europe. The agreement signed in Berlin on Sunday has 55 articles and runs six pages long. For some, the sprawling nature of the document was evidence of the great divisions that remained — and above all of the difficulties looming in putting the pact into effect. “Who is going to implement that?” asked Mirco Keilberth, a North Africa expert and writer. He said, however, that “you have to give Merkel credit for bringing attention to this conflict.”   Sunday’s agreement, he said, is essentially “a long to-do list” for a next conference hosted by the United Nations. High up on the list is controlling the entry of arms into Libya, where they have been proliferating in recent years. An arms embargo was first agreed to by the United Nations Security Council in 2011, but has repeatedly been violated by member states since the country descended into chaos following the overthrow that year of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi after an intervention by European forces, with American help. The participating countries agreed Sunday to “unequivocally and fully respect and implement” the United Nations arms embargo. “In order to help to implement it, we Europeans should be strongly engaged, much more than in the past, to control the arms embargo,” Mr. Borrell said. “You cannot expect a cease-fire, even if it is agreed, to last if there is no control of arms into Libya.” Even Sunday’s key commitment of foreign powers — to cease interference in the conflict — might prove tricky, experts warned. “The foreign mercenaries make money in that war,” Mr. Keilberth said. “Smugglers make money. The war is lucrative for many people.” The facts on the ground in Libya are hopelessly complicated not least because of Libya’s oil and gas resources, he said. General Hifter’s army and the government forces are both in part funded by oil revenues.  “Berlin can only be a first step,” Mr. Keilberth said. “It will take weeks to determine whether it was a success.” Many were skeptical,  accusing leaders of not leaning strongly enough on those bombing civilians in the country. “Of course everyone wants peace,” said Ken Roth, director of Human Rights Watch. “But what happens if peace doesn’t take hold? What if, at best, it takes a long, long time to negotiate. What if, as in Syria, Russia signs up again and again to stop or suspend the fighting but then promptly ignores its pledges?” An approach that would be more likely to make a difference to the Libyan people, who face regular indiscriminate attacks particularly by bombers associated with General Hifter’s Libyan National Army, Mr. Roth said, would be to vigorously press for an end to those attacks at the same time as peace is pursued. “There is language at the end of the Berlin communiqué mentioning the need to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, but it is generic, boilerplate language,” he said. “There could have been language pointing out that these indiscriminate attacks are war crimes, that the signatories in Berlin are committed to prosecuting those responsible and that those supporting the bombing could be criminal accomplices,” he said.

Schuetze contributed reporting.']","After a Berlin meeting, Russia, Turkey and other countries pledged to end their interference in the North African nation to make way for peace efforts."
"‘Chewing Gum Tycoon’ of Lotte Group, Shin Kyuk-ho, Dies at 98",2020-01-19,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Shin Kyuk-ho, who built a chewing-gum business into \u200bthe \u200bhugely successful Lotte \u200bGroup in South Korea and Japan, only to see his sons squabble over the corporate empire, died on Sunday in Seoul. He was 98. The company, South Korea’s fifth-largest business conglomerate, announced the death. Mr. Shin was the last of the rags-to-riches founders of South Korea’s major family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, and his death represented the end of an era for many South Koreans. Charismatic chaebol tycoons like Mr. Shin were credited with engineering the dramatic industrialization that transformed the country into one of Asia’s leading economies after the destruction of the Korean War in the 1950s. Like other chaebol founders, Mr. Shin’s beginnings were humble. He was born in a rural village in Ulsan, in the southeast of what is now South Korea, in 1921, when the country was still languishing under Japan’s colonial rule. He was the eldest son in a family with 10 children. The young Mr. Shin had a literary bent, and yearned to become a novelist. He was raising pigs in his village after graduating from an agricultural high school when he decided to stow away in a ship to Japan in 1941 to pursue a literary career there. In Tokyo, he delivered milk and newspapers during the day while attending college at night. His first serious business venture in Japan, a factory producing cutting oil, a lubricant used in metalworking, was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid during World War II. Mr. Shin never became a novelist, but he named his first successful business, Lotte, a company that marketed chewing gum, after Charlotte, the female character in Wolfgang von Goethe’s novel “The Sorrows of Young Werther.” Mr. Shin was especially proud of the name Lotte, calling it “the best choice in my life.” Mr. Shin began selling Lotte bubble gum in 1948, after watching American soldiers in postwar Japan handing out chewing gum to children. It was an instant success, and Lotte soon expanded into chocolate and other confections, as well as trading and real estate. Although prosperous in Japan, Mr. Shin never forgot his roots. He retained his Korean citizenship and had homes in both countries. As soon as South Korea and Japan established diplomatic ties in 1965, he began investing in his home country, building hotels and department stores in Seoul. Lotte helped spawn, and then benefited from, a rising consumer culture in South Korea as the middle class expanded with the rapid growth of an export-driven economy. In the 1980s, Lotte executives objected when Mr. Shin began building Lotte World, a landmark hotel, mall and amusement-park complex in Jamsil, which was then a sandy wilderness in southern Seoul. They said there was no market there. But Mr. Shin predicted correctly that Lotte World would attract such throngs that the area would have chronic traffic jams. Today, Lotte is a household name in South Korea, running 90 affiliates that together \u200b\u200bgenerate 100 trillion won, or $86 billion, in annual revenues. The name is on hotels, department stores and apartment buildings, as well as nationwide chains of shopping malls, theme parks, movie theaters, duty-free stores, coffee shops and fast-food restaurants. Mr. Shin kept his last promise to South Korea — building its tallest building — when Lotte completed its 123-story Lotte World Tower in Jamsil in 2017. “His generous investment in his war-devastated home\u200b \u200bcountry and his dedication helped rebuild \u200bSouth Korea and lay the foundation of its economic prosperity,” the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobby for big businesses\u200b, said in a statement on Sunday. Despite his success, Mr. Shin’s reputation \u200bwas tarnished in his last years. While he \u200binvolved his children \u200bin the company’s management, \u200bhe held on to his \u200bkinglike control, never establishing a clear heir apparent. As he slipped into dementia, his elder son, Dong-joo, \u200bwho had been put in charge of Lotte’s operation in Japan, \u200band another son, Dong-bin, who oversaw Lotte in South Korea, started a winner-take-all tussle for the leadership of the Lotte empire, \u200baccusing each other of financial wrongdoings. Shin Dong-bin, now chairman of Lotte Group, \u200bemerged victorious\u200b, staging a coup that dethroned his father \u200bas chairman\u200b of the board of directors at Lotte’s holding company. \u200bBut the brothers’ squabbling led to an investigation by \u200bSouth Korean \u200bprosecutors that led in 2016 to \u200bthe indictment of Mr. Shin, the two sons and other family members on embezzlement, tax evasion and other charges. \u200b A frail Mr. Shin appeared in court in 2017 in a wheelchair and carrying a cane and seemed unable to grasp what was happening. “Am I indicted? Who indicted me? I own everything in Lotte!” he said at a hearing. He threw a microphone and wielded the cane as his lawyers escorted him out of the courtroom at the judge’s order. Mr. Shin was sentenced to four years in prison for \u200bembezzlement and other charges. But the Seoul court decided not to imprison him because of his poor health. His son Shin Dong-bin was convicted of embezzlement and breach of trust but was \u200ballowed to run Lotte after his 20-month prison term was suspended. Mr. Shin’s first wife, who was Korean, died \u200byoung, leaving Mr. Shin with a daughter, Shin Young-ja. He then married a Japanese woman, with whom he had the two sons. Mr. Shin also maintained a common-law marriage with a former winner of the Miss Lotte contest in South Korea. They had a daughter, Shin Yoo-mi.']",Mr. Shin transformed a small business in postwar Tokyo into ​a ​corporate giant spanning South Korea and Japan.
U.K. Promises Stronger Terrorism Laws After Knife Attack by Convict,2020-01-21,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it would toughen terrorism sentences and end early release for serious offenders, following through on promises made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in November after a convicted terrorist who had been automatically released carried out an attack that killed two people near London Bridge. The attacker, Usman Khan, 28, who was released in December 2018 after serving eight years of a 16-year sentence for his involvement in a bomb plot, began a knife attack while attending an event on prison rehabilitation at Fishmongers’ Hall, a central London conference venue. Wearing a fake explosive vest, he fled over the nearby bridge, and he was shot and killed by the police shortly afterward. The attack, during the final weeks of a British general election campaign, set off a heated debate over jail sentences for convicted terrorists and their overall reintegration into society. Under the new legislation, which could be introduced in Parliament this spring, terrorism offenders would serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The number of probation officers specializing in counterterrorism would be doubled, and the counterterrorist police would receive a 10 percent funding increase, the British Home Office, the government department responsible for policing and national security, said in a statement. “The senseless terror attack at Fishmongers’ Hall in November confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders,” Home Secretary Priti Patel said. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that law enforcement officers could also use lie detectors on terrorism offenders in order to better assess possible threats. The reliability of polygraph testing is often disputed, but Britain already uses it with some sexual offenders — though the use that can be made of the results is limited and they are not admissible in British courts. “We get a lot of people who are superficially very compliant with the regime,” Mr. Buckland told the British broadcaster Sky News, referring to terrorist offenders in prison. “You can get people who are in fact ‘sleepers’ for many years and then suddenly back come the hatreds and the prejudices.” While in jail, Mr. Khan had assured officials in letters that he wanted to follow a deradicalization program and that he no longer embraced radical views. He had been given an indeterminate sentence in 2012 for his involvement in a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the London Stock Exchange, which was later replaced by a 16-year fixed-term sentence. Referring to Mr. Khan and two other defendants in the same case, a judge said in 2012 that “these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on license in the community.” David Videcette, a former antiterrorism detective, said on Tuesday that some of the proposed changes were incremental, such as the use of lie detector tests, while others, like more funding for counterterrorism police, seemed more urgent. He said the domestic terrorism landscape had changed, with fewer “large scale attacks, and more lower-tech ones.” “The individuals involved in them are much harder to catch because they don’t always interact with wider networks,” Mr. Videcette added. “So it’s more labor intensive to monitor them and potentially catch them.” Several European countries have been grappling in recent years with their response to the threat posed by radicalized individuals who may carry small-scale attacks on their own, or regroup with larger cells. They have warned that zero-risk situations do not exist, while trying to reassure a wary public with additional funding and tougher security measures whose impact often takes years to assess. In France, officials have reinforced intelligence resources in prison to monitor soon-to-be-released inmates, as a majority of its 500 terrorist convicts and more than 1,200 inmates suspected of radicalization are scheduled to leave prison within the next few years. After the November attack in London, politicians on both ends of the spectrum accused their opponents of having slashed resources dedicated to the monitoring of convicted terrorists. It was also seen as an echo of a terrorist attack near London Bridge in 2017 that left eight people dead, also during the closing stages of an election campaign. The political response to that attack included a focus on cuts to police numbers under Mr. Johnson’s predecessors, David Cameron and Theresa May — cuts that Mr. Johnson began his own campaign by promising to reverse. “I have long argued that it is a mistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early,” Mr. Johnson said in November, as he announced that the security services would review the parole conditions of 74 people who had been convicted of terrorism and released early. Mr. Johnson was later accused of exploiting the attack for political gain, including by the father of one of the victims. David Merritt, the father of Jack Merritt, a rehabilitation worker who was killed by Mr. Khan, said that his son would have been furious at Mr. Johnson’s response to the attack. “He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against,” Mr. Merritt wrote of his son in The Guardian. On Tuesday, Mr. Merritt called the potential use of lie detectors on convicted terrorists “a cynical, headline-grabbing gimmick to distract our attention.”']",Proposals include tougher jail sentences for terrorism convicts and more resources for counterterrorism police.

"North Korea Bans Foreign Tourists Over Coronavirus, Tour Operator Says",2020-01-21,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has temporarily barred foreign tourists as a protection against the mysterious virus from China that has killed at least nine people and sickened more than 400, a leading tour operator reported on Tuesday. The operator, Young Pioneer Tours, which specializes in taking tourists from China to North Korea, said on its website that the country was closing its border to foreign \u200btourists starting on Wednesday. Practically all foreign tours to North Korea come through China, and the vast majority of tourists are Chinese. Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which also takes tourists to North Korea, said his company had been told that “action was being considered” by the North Korean authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have been informed that we will be told more information in the morning,” he said Tuesday night. State-run media in North Korea, which tightly controls information from the outside world, reported on the Chinese outbreak of the coronavirus Wednesday, though the reports did not mention a tourist ban. A television news program said officials were working with the World Health Organization to keep the virus from spreading to the North, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, which monitors North Korean media. The virus has been spreading rapidly from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. That is bad news for North Korea, where Chinese tourists have become an increasingly important source of cash for the country, hobbled by international sanctions. \u200b Tourism is one of the few North Korean industries not covered by the sanctions, which have been imposed by the United Nations Security Council and the United States in response to the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently declared that his country no longer expected a breakthrough in deadlocked negotiations with Washington over how to denuclearize his country and ease or end the sanctions. Mr. Kim said his country would therefore strengthen its economy without relief from the sanctions, and boosting tourism is a key part of that strategy. To attract foreign tourists, North Korea has recently completed or is building seafront resorts or ski and spa complexes. The number of Chinese tourists to North Korea has been rapidly rising since\u200b President Xi Jinping of China visited Pyongyang\u200b last June. \u200bChina has gone along with Security Council sanctions on North Korea in recent years but does not want the Communist government in Pyongyang to collapse.']",The spread of the virus from China is bad news for Kim Jong-un; North Korea depends on Chinese tourists for cash.
Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea,2020-01-19,By Javier C. Hernández,"['BEIJING — The authorities in China reported a third death from a mysterious virus and more than 130 new cases over the weekend, including ones found in Beijing and southern China for the first time. One new case was also reported in South Korea on Monday. The jump in cases raised questions about how the virus is being transmitted and added to concerns about the spread of the illness ahead of China’s busiest travel season. The health commission in Wuhan, a central Chinese city where the virus originated last month, said early Monday that 136 new cases had been detected on Saturday and Sunday, including one who died. Nine patients in the city remained critically ill. Two new cases were reported in Beijing, and one in Shenzhen, a booming metropolis in the south, near Hong Kong. That brought the total number of cases in China to around 200, more than double the number reported just a day earlier. The latest cases come amid growing concern among some experts that the outbreak could be more severe than China’s government has described. [Read: What we know about China’s new coronavirus.] The virus already appears to have spread outside China, with the authorities in South Korea reporting on Monday that a Chinese woman who arrived at the Incheon International Airport on Sunday from Wuhan had tested positive for the illness. Last week, three cases were reported in Thailand and Japan involving people who had traveled through Wuhan. And with hundreds of millions of people in China expected to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday, public health officials are working to stop a major outbreak. On Sunday, China’s central government sought to reassure the public that it had the situation under control. In Beijing’s most extensive remarks on the outbreak since it began last month, the National Health Commission said that experts agreed that an epidemic was “still preventable and controllable.” Still, the commission acknowledged that the source of the virus and its path of transmission were not fully understood. “The mutation of the virus still needs to be closely monitored,” the statement said. Of the new patients found in Wuhan over the weekend, 66 were men and 70 women, and their ages ranged from 25 to 89, the health commission reported on Monday. It said that they mostly had symptoms such as fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. Most people with the infection have contracted it through exposure to animals at a market in Wuhan that sells seafood and live animals, the authorities say. But the health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that some people who had come down with the virus had no exposure to the market. That acknowledgment raises the possibility that the virus could be present in other markets in Wuhan, experts said, adding to fears that more people might be at risk. “If you cannot find the source and control the source of the virus, you cannot extinguish the fire,” said David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Dr. Hui said the risk of the virus spreading from human to human on a broad scale appeared to be low, though he noted that the virus could mutate. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that while its analysis indicated that limited transmission of the virus is possible, it remained unclear whether it can easily spread from one person to another. The group said it would continue to examine the issue. “We do not have enough evidence to evaluate the full extent of human-to-human transmission,” its Manila office said. Some experts have suggested that there are probably far more cases of the illness than the authorities have disclosed. In previous incidents, like the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Chinese government withheld critical information. One estimate by researchers at Imperial College London suggested on Friday that there could now be as many as 1,700 cases of the new virus. The W.H.O. said on Sunday that China could potentially confirm more cases in the coming days and weeks as more people were screened for it. The new virus has brought back memories of the SARS outbreak, which was also caused by a coronavirus. SARS, which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets, originated in China and spread to other countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 800. While the new coronavirus appears to be less severe than SARS, public health officials around the world are exercising caution. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States announced that airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles would begin screening passengers from Wuhan for the virus. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University professor who worked to fight the SARS outbreak, said it was too early to know how dangerous the new virus might prove to be. “Until it becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, there’s not a major threat of a pandemic,” said Dr. Lipkin, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at the university’s Mailman School of Public Health. “We need to prepare for the possibility that this could be a larger outbreak, and it could become a pandemic,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that it will.” Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul.

Harry and Meghan’s Hard Exit,2020-01-19,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — There is no such thing, it turns out, as being a part-time royal. The severance deal that Buckingham Palace announced on Saturday for Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, is most remarkable for how clean a break the royal family is making with two of its most popular, if disaffected, members — much more severe than the couple apparently expected. The British news media, which has likened the couple’s split with the royal family to Brexit, lost no time on Sunday in pronouncing the agreement the equivalent of a “hard Brexit,” similar to the uncompromising trade deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to pursue with the European Union this year. [Update: Prince Harry and Meghan exit Britain with final official engagement.] Far from carving out a “progressive new role within this institution,” as the couple hopefully declared when they unexpectedly announced their plans to “step back” from royal duties this month, Harry and Meghan will lose most of the privileges and perks of royalty once they give up their full-time status and forsake Britain for an uncertain future in Canada and the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the couple will no longer use their most exclusive titles, His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness, will forgo public funding of their activities and will repay more than $3 million for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, their residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Such trade-offs were unavoidable, experts said. “The arrangement they’ve come to is absolutely spot on,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “The family is trying to prevent a half-in, half-out arrangement, which doesn’t work.” But the deal announced left many unanswered questions, such as the tax implications of the split and who will pay for security, along with esoteric matters such as whether Harry and Meghan will ever appear on a royal balcony again. Prince Harry publicly addressed his decision for the first time on Sunday night. Speaking with a tone of regret but resolve at a charity fund-raiser, he said he and Meghan had hoped to continue carrying out some of their royal duties without public funding. But that proved impossible. “It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,” Harry said. “The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.” The prince insisted he was not abandoning his beloved country or the queen, but said, “As far as this goes, there really was no other option.” The status of the couple’s website and Instagram account, SussexRoyal, is also up in the air, according to officials at the palace, since the royal designation is usually reserved for working royals. For now, the site remains sprinkled with references to “His Royal Highness” and “Her Royal Highness.” It clearly demonstrates that Harry and Meghan envisioned a less thorough break from royal service. The site includes a lengthy section on the couple’s duties as the queen’s emissaries to the Commonwealth. But Harry was forced to relinquish the title of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. Losing the SussexRoyal name could hamper their moneymaking prospects, royal experts say, since it is imprinted on all of the couple’s charitable activities. But the experts also pointed that the HRH title, as it is informally known, carries less resonance in the United States than in Britain. The couple will retain their titles Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which the queen bestowed on them after they were married in 2018. And Harry remains a prince, sixth in line of succession, regardless of whether he asks people to address him as “Your Royal Highness.” Royal experts praised the warmth of the queen’s statement toward Meghan, and noted the monarch’s acknowledgment that the couple had pushed for these changes for months. Confronted with a challenge to the fabric of the monarchy, they said, she embraced a novel agreement that could serve as a blueprint for family members in future generations. Yet for all the warm words, Buckingham Palace is distancing itself from Harry and Meghan’s new life. It will not review or approve any of their profit-making ventures. The couple said that everything they did would “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,” deliberately vague language that officials said was intended to insulate the family from being held accountable for them. The palace will review the deal a year after it goes into effect this spring. Depending on how the transition goes, a palace official said, its terms could be modified in one direction or the other. The prince, who served as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, will give up his military titles, including captain general of the Royal Marines, which could be painful to him, according to people with ties to the family. He inherited those titles from his grandfather Prince Philip and has defined himself through his military service. But Harry will retain his connection to the Invictus Games, the global sports event for wounded, injured and sick service members that he founded in 2014. Forcing him to give that up, Ms. Junor said, would have been too wrenching, given his ties to the armed forces and injured soldiers. Among the unanswered questions is how much financial independence the couple will really have. Prince Harry has significant private holdings through a multimillion-dollar inheritance from his mother, Princess Diana. The duchess also has money from her acting career, when she was known as Meghan Markle and appeared in the legal television drama “Suits.” But they will give up public money from the Sovereign Grant, the primary vehicle for financing the royal family’s activities. According to their website, that accounts for 5 percent of their expenses. The remaining 95 percent comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, a hereditary estate owned by Prince Harry’s father, Prince Charles. He will continue to support the couple, officials say, but it is not clear that he will do so with funds from the duchy. That money is considered to be quasi-public, given that Charles owns the duchy in his capacity as the Prince of Wales. It is also not clear who will pay for the couple’s security, which could run into millions of dollars per year. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on those arrangements on Saturday. Security experts have said that Britain’s Home Office will probably continue to provide the couple with some police protection, given their status as prominent public figures. One area where the couple are likely to relish their separation from the royal family is in their relations with the tabloids. They have made it clear that they will no longer take part in the Royal Rota, the press pool that chronicles the activities of the royal family. Harry has accused the news media, particularly the tabloids, of hounding him and Meghan the same way the paparazzi did his mother, even blaming them for Diana’s death. The duchess has filed a lawsuit against a tabloid, The Mail on Sunday, for publishing a private letter that she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Prince Harry also began separate legal proceedings against the owners of The Sun and The Daily Mirror, accusing them of hacking his phone’s voice mail messages going back as far as the early 2000s. How the relationship between the couple and the press will develop, royal watchers said, will be one of the most closely watched elements of their new status.']","The couple’s wish to carve out more “progressive” roles has led to the loss of perks, privileges and titles."
Huawei Executive Meng Wanzhou’s Extradition Fight: What to Know,2020-01-19,By Dan Bilefsky and Tracy Sherlock,"['VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Global politics, big money, high technology and the intricacies of Canadian law will come together on Monday when the extradition hearing of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, begins in a Vancouver courtroom. Ms. Meng, 47, a former secretary at Huawei who rose to become a public face of the company, was arrested in Vancouver in December 2018 after the United States requested her extradition on fraud charges. She has been detained in the city since then. The arrest has put Canada in a difficult spot between two world powers — China and the United States — and severely damaged the country’s relations with China. Huawei is one of China’s most prominent companies. Shortly after Ms. Meng’s arrest, China detained — in retaliation, some say — two Canadians and accused them of espionage. It has also punished Canada by restricting imports of pork, canola oil and other Canadian products. Complicating matters, Canada is in the process of deciding whether to allow Huawei to participate in the development of its next-generation 5G network. The issue is fraught because the United States government has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying and stealing technology from its Western rivals. The Trump administration has argued that the company is in thrall to the Chinese government and a threat to national security. Huawei vehemently denies that. As the legal case unfolds at the imposing Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver, here is the background and what’s at stake. Ms. Meng is the eldest daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei. She was born in the western city of Chengdu, has a master’s degree in accounting and began her career at Huawei 25 years ago. Before her arrest, her responsibilities at the company, where she is also deputy chairwoman of the board, included announcing its financial results. Ms. Meng, who is also known as Cathy or Sabrina, is married and has four children. Since her arrest, Ms. Meng’s life has been circumscribed. She has been out on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or $7.7 million, and relatively free to travel about Vancouver, where she and her husband own two expensive homes. She is under 24-hour surveillance and must wear a GPS tracker on her ankle. She is now living in a gated seven-bedroom mansion, valued at about 14 million Canadian dollars, in the city’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. The judge in the case allowed her to move there from her other home: a six-bedroom house in another wealthy neighborhood valued at an estimated 6 million Canadian dollars. Under the terms of her bail, she is allowed to leave her house until an 11 p.m. curfew, including traveling to Richmond, a nearby city with a diverse Chinese community, food courts with regional Chinese delicacies and a vibrant cultural life. Friends and work colleagues can visit her. Her family came to Canada during the Christmas holiday period, according to a member of her security detail. Since being detained, Ms. Meng recently wrote in a letter published on Huawei’s website, she has experienced “moments of fear” but also found more time for herself. She passes the time by, among other things, reading and oil painting. Ms. Meng’s bail conditions have spurred anger in Canada because critics have contrasted her surroundings with the harsh conditions of the Canadians arrested by China, who are denied access to lawyers and their families. In January 2019, the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment that, among other things, charges that Ms. Meng fraudulently deceived four banks into clearing transactions in Iran through a subsidiary company, in violation of sanctions against Iran. Over several days, Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes will examine whether the case against Ms. Meng satisfies a fundamental requirement for extraditing a person under Canadian law: that the crime she is accused of in the United States constitutes a crime in Canada. This is known as the legal concept of “double criminality.” Prosecutors in Canada are focusing on the accusation that Ms. Meng lied to representatives of the bank HSBC in 2013 about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, a company doing business in Iran. Prosecutors contend she told HSBC that Skycom was a partner although it was, in fact, a Huawei subsidiary, putting HSBC at risk of sanctions. “Inducing a bank to extend financial services by lying to it is criminal,” the prosecution wrote in documents submitted to the court. Ms. Meng has denied the allegations. Her defense argues that the crime she is being accused of does not constitute a crime in Canada because Canada has not imposed sanctions against companies doing business in Iran. They also contend that there was no risk of financial loss for HSBC, a prerequisite for fraud to have taken place, under Canadian law. “In essence, this is a case of U.S. sanction enforcement masquerading as Canadian fraud,” Ms. Meng’s lawyers argued in documents released Friday. If the judge rules that the case doesn’t satisfy the double criminality requirement, then Ms. Meng could go free. Later this year, the court will address another argument Ms. Meng’s legal team is making: that her rights were violated when she was first detained. Canadian border officials questioned her for three hours — and seized her phones, asked for her passcodes and searched her luggage — before arresting her. Her lawyers contend that this means that Canada and the United States conducted a “covert criminal investigation.” If the judge finds that Ms. Meng’s rights were violated, the case could be dismissed. The defense has filed a separate civil case against the Canadian authorities over the manner of Ms. Meng’s arrest, and the date for that hearing has yet to be announced. Gary Botting, an extradition lawyer who has written several textbooks on Canadian extradition law, said he thought Ms. Meng had a good case that her rights were violated. And Richard Kurland, a leading immigration lawyer, said the case was significant because it could help define when people’s constitutional rights kick in after they arrive in the country. Very high. Changes to Canada’s extradition laws in 1999 — which are still widely criticized by human rights groups — mean that about 90 percent of extradition requests are granted. Legal experts say an extradition request can be turned down if it is deemed to be politically motivated or if a person extradited could face the death penalty. Shortly after Ms. Meng’s arrest, President Trump said he might consider interceding in the case if that helped him reach a trade deal with China. Her lawyers have argued that these statements were “intimidating and corrosive of the rule of law” and should disqualify the United States from being able to extradite Ms. Meng. If Ms. Meng loses the extradition case, she could appeal the decision all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada in a process that could take years. Eventually the case would move from the legal arena to the political one.

Bodies of Ukrainians Killed in Iran Plane Crash Are Returned Home,2020-01-19,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — In a solemn ceremony at an airport in Ukraine on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky paid his respects to the 11 citizens from his country who were killed when Iran’s military mistakenly shot down a passenger jet in Tehran this month. Mr. Zelensky has grappled with the diplomacy around the downing of the plane, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The missile strike put his government in the middle of a conflict between the United States and Iran, and he has walked a fine line as his country sought answers from Tehran. On the morning of the crash, Iranian air defenses had been on high alert after Tehran launched ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq in response to the United States’ killing of a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Iran was anticipating retaliation to its missile strikes on the bases. Though the Ukrainian government quickly concluded that a missile had downed the plane, killing all 176 people aboard, it refrained from public criticism of Tehran until its investigative team on the ground had found irrefutable proof, including shrapnel holes in the plane’s fuselage. American, Canadian and British leaders blamed Iran for the tragedy before the Ukrainian government spoke out. But Ukrainian officials said that their patient approach had forced the Iranian government to finally acknowledge that it had shot down the plane in error, an embarrassing about-face after days of denials. That approach may be tested again as Iran, which was accused of stalling the investigation, appeared to backtrack on sending the plane’s so-called black boxes to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. A day after Hassan Rezaeifar, the Iranian official leading the investigation, was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency as saying that the devices would be transferred to Ukraine, he said on Sunday that he had no plans to turn over the flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the Boeing 737-800 plane. Mr. Rezaeifar, a director at Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, previously said his organization lacked the capability to decipher the black boxes and would send them abroad for analysis. But on Sunday he said that it would try to analyze them in Iran and that “no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,” such as France or Ukraine. While the cause of the crash is no longer in dispute, the data and voice recorders may bring to light harrowing — and for Iran politically damning — details of the final moments of the pilots and passengers. For Mr. Zelensky, returning the bodies of the Ukrainian victims, including nine crew members and two passengers, had also been a priority. On the windy tarmac of Kyiv’s main airport on Sunday, an honor guard stood at attention as pallbearers carried the victims’ flag-draped coffins from the cargo bay of an airplane to a convoy of waiting hearses. Mr. Zelensky, along with his top aides and cabinet members, stood silently as the coffins passed. Later, the procession continued through a crowd of Ukraine International Airlines employees. Pilots in flight uniforms doffed their hats and knelt, while flight attendants held bouquets of flowers. The first coffins carried out were those of the three Ukrainian pilots — Aleksei Naumkin, Vladimir Gaponenko and Sergei Khomenko — who died along with their passengers. After Tehran initially hinted, without providing any evidence, that the pilots had flown erratically and therefore contributed to the crash by alarming air defense forces, Ukraine’s government pressed Iran to admit that the claim was false. The pilots, in fact, had flown the usual departure route for Tehran’s airport.']",President Volodymyr Zelensky attended a ceremony for the 11 Ukrainians killed on the airliner shot down by Iran.
75 Drug Cartel Members Tunnel Out of Paraguay Prison,2020-01-19,By Santi Carneri and Ernesto Londoño,"['ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — At least 75 members of a powerful Brazilian drug cartel escaped from a prison in northern Paraguay through a tunnel on Sunday, pulling off an escape plan that officials had known about for more than a month but were unable to stop. The breach is the latest and most serious sign that Brazilian cartels, which use Paraguay as a transit point to smuggle arms and drugs into Brazil, have penetrated the security agencies. “This is a prison break without precedent,” Paraguay’s justice minister, Cecilia Pérez, said on Sunday. “This is the biggest prison break from our facilities.” Members of the cartel, the First Capital Command, had spent weeks digging the tunnel from their wing of the Pedro Juan Caballero prison, piling dozens of bags of dirt into a cell, according to officials in Paraguay. On Sunday around 4 a.m., aided by guards at the prison, the cartel members sneaked out, officials said. The prison is near the Brazilian border, and “by now they’ve probably crossed over to the other side,” Ms. Pérez said. “This is very serious.” Pedro Juan Caballero has long been regarded as a particularly troubled prison, said Dante Leguizamón, the president of the National Mechanism to Prevent Torture, an independent government agency that monitors conditions in prisons in Paraguay. “We consider it the prison with the most severe corruption problems,” Mr. Leguizamón said Sunday in an interview. “Considering the fragility of the system as a whole and crowding conditions, this is not a terribly surprising situation.” According to statistics compiled by the organization, the prison was until recently holding 1,005 inmates, slightly more than double the capacity for which a facility of its size is equipped. A month ago, Ms. Pérez announced that Paraguay’s government had learned of a plot by the cartel — known as the P.C.C., its initials in Portuguese —\xa0to pay guards $80,000 to facilitate the escape of a cartel leader. Ms. Pérez said on Sunday that it was clear that corrections officials had enabled the plan to be carried out. At least five prison guards have been suspended and are under investigation, she said. “We are certain that there was a scandalous conspiracy with security guards,” Ms. Pérez said. “They had been working on this for several days.” Paraguay’s interior minister, Euclides Acevedo, said the government was in a state of “maximum alert” and had dispatched its “best investigators” to the area in an effort to recapture the prisoners. The government also alerted officials in Brazil, where state and federal law enforcement officials were deployed to the border area to search for the escapees. “We are working with state officials to prevent criminals who escaped from prison in Paraguay from returning to Brazil,” Brazil’s justice minister, Sérgio Moro, said Sunday afternoon in a statement on Twitter. “If they make it back to Brazil, they will get a one-way ticket to a federal prison.” The Brazilian drug cartel, which has tens of thousands of members, dominates the cocaine industry in São Paulo. Ms. Pérez said the most senior cartel leader who fled was David Timoteo Ferreira, a Brazilian P.C.C. leader who had been in custody in Paraguay since 2017. Paraguay’s prison system has long been underfunded, understaffed and prone to corruption. In much of the country, cartel leaders effectively run prisons, which have become hubs where the P.C.C. and other drug trafficking groups plan operations and recruit new members. After a mutiny at a prison last June in which 10 inmates were killed —\xa0and some decapitated —\xa0during a clash between rival gangs, Paraguay passed a new law giving the state additional powers to address the system’s shortcomings. It included funding for an additional 500 prison guards and gave the national police and the military the authority to reinforce prison security. The measures in the emergency law clearly “were not enough,” Ms. Pérez said on Sunday. Mr. Acevedo said that in Sunday’s case the tunnel may have been built to provide a cover for complicit prison guards. “There’s complicity from people in the inside, and this is a phenomenon that affects all prison facilities,” he said. Paraguay has long struggled to detain and prosecute powerful drug traffickers as Brazilian cartels have become deeply entrenched in the tiny South American nation. In November 2018, a prominent Brazilian drug trafficker, Marcelo Pinheiro Veiga, killed a teenage prostitute who had been taken to a special cell designed for him in a heavily secured police station. Officials believe Mr. Veiga killed her in an effort to prevent his extradition to Brazil, where he faces numerous charges.

Why These Australia Fires Are Like Nothing We’ve Seen Before,2020-01-21,By Jamie Tarabay,"['SYDNEY, Australia — In late October, lightning struck brittle earth on Gospers Mountain in New South Wales. The remains of trees bone dry from consecutive winters with little to no rain were ignited, and the fire quickly spread. Three months later, it is still burning. The Gospers Mountain fire, which became Australia’s largest “megablaze” as it grew to link several separate fires, offers a sense of the scale of the country’s most disastrous fire season ever. The blaze has burned two million acres, enveloping hinterland and wine country, and prompted a special mission to save prehistoric trees so rare that their exact location is kept secret. That fire is now largely contained. But dozens of others are still burning in the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, some out of control, despite heavy rain in some areas in recent days. And fire season is far from over — hot and windy conditions are expected to return this week, and a month of summer remains. Here is a look at the devastation. The modern world has never seen anything quite like these Australia fires. About 16 million acres have burned in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. That’s an area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned in other parts of the country. What sets these blazes apart, in terms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. Until now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern Canada or Siberia, where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled. “What we’re seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are fires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things that we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,” said Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales. “We’re looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,” he added. The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years. The bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered nearly two million acres and were the worst in that state’s recorded history. They are also far larger than the estimates of 2.2 million acres burned by September last year in the Amazon basin, where farmers, some emboldened by the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, ignited tens of thousands of fires to clear land. “It’s quite phenomenal and far exceeds anything you would see in the western U.S.A., which is a very fire-prone area, the southwest of Canada, the Mediterranean and parts of South America,” Dr. Bradstock said. “It’s so much bigger than anything else.” Australia has had deadlier fire seasons: The Black Saturday bushfires, which began in February 2009 when downed power lines ignited blazes that were spread by 60-mile-per-hour winds, killed 173 people in Victoria. The 2018 California fires killed 103 people. But the losses Australia is experiencing in lives and property are still staggering, and not yet over. At least 29 people have been killed. Hundreds of millions of animals, by some estimates, have perished or are facing starvation or dehydration in devastated habitats. And more than 2,500 homes have been destroyed. Smoke generated by the fires has blanketed Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, at times giving them some of the worst air in the world. The prolonged exposure of bushfire smoke to millions of people has raised fears of health effects that could last for years. Early this month, NASA began tracking a plume of smoke from the fires that was the size of the continental United States. By Jan. 14, smoke had circumnavigated the globe, returning to eastern Australia. Along the way, it caused hazardous breathing conditions in New Zealand and discolored skies in South America. The fires have also produced huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon emissions. A top expert on greenhouse gas emissions at Australia’s national research agency told NPR that the fires in southeastern Australia had produced as much carbon as the entire country emits from man-made sources in more than eight months of the year. Why have these fires been so vast? While Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, climate change is bringing longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat. That makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and some regions have been gripped by drought for years. This season, the fires started earlier than usual — some as soon as July — and they are expected to last well into February and even March. High temperatures, strong winds and dry forests have combined to create the conditions for powerful fires. There have even been blazes in wetlands and rainforests that have not contended with this threat before. To combat the flames, tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers, have been called on to work long days over extended periods. Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have misleadingly pointed to arson in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian government’s inaction on the issue. Others have argued that the drought is unrelated to climate change, though there is evidence that warming temperatures have been a major contributor to it, in part by pushing rain out of areas where it once fell. “The wildfires decimating Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and coalescing into the country’s worst peacetime catastrophe precisely because of climate change,” said Paul Read, a co-director of the National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University in Melbourne. In Australia’s history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El Niño pattern. But that is not the case this time, showing how much this season stands out and the danger the country faces with more unpredictable weather patterns in the future. While scientists have long predicted that climate change would bring longer and more intense fire seasons, the blazes were not expected to be this bad this soon, Dr. Bradstock said. Under his projections, Australia would not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years, he said. “I guess I’m as shocked as anyone about what’s unfolding and, probably, like everyone else who’s involved and affected, we’ll very quickly recalibrate thinking about what we’re doing,” he said. Recalibrating means expecting these phenomenal fires to continue to occur, particularly as Australia’s drought shows few signs of ending and temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade on record. “We would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off phenomenon,” Dr. Bradstock said. “I think we have to get ready to deal with a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.”']","More than 16 million acres have gone up in flames. And it has happened in populated areas, unlike most of the world’s other blazes of this scale."
Big Changes? Or Maybe Not. Putin’s Plans Keep Russia Guessing.,2020-01-21,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Nobody knows what’s going on inside the Kremlin right now. And perhaps that’s precisely the point. President Vladimir V. Putin announced constitutional changes last week that could create new avenues for him to rule Russia for the rest of his life. But will they? How? And will he? Mr. Putin’s new prime minister announced his roster of ministers on Tuesday, with the most prominent officials keeping their posts. Yet as more details of what appears to be Russia’s biggest governmental overhaul in a decade trickle out, the true nature of Mr. Putin’s long-term plan — and whether he even has one — is shrouded in mystery. Ever since his opening salvo at the end of his annual state-of-the-nation speech last Wednesday, nearly every day has brought news of high-level resignations, unexpected appointments and cryptic new legislation. Decoding these clues — and arguing over whether one should even try — has thrown the international cottage industry of Kremlin experts into a contradictory cacophony of prediction and interpretation. Mr. Putin’s proposals, sure to be adopted by his rubber-stamp Parliament, mean “potentially very little change at all,” Sam Greene, the director of the Russia Institute at King’s College in London, said in an 11-part thread on Twitter. “Or potentially quite a lot of change.” Marat Guelman, a former Kremlin media strategist, wrote on Facebook, “I’m going to make a risky forecast, but I’m almost convinced it’s true.” Mr. Putin, he said, is surely on the verge of resigning. “Soon, we will lose him.” “Alas!” Alexei Venediktov, the editor of the Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy, posted on the messaging app Telegram, responding to the latest news on Monday by quoting a 19th-century poet. “Not even a quarter-hour passed, and I already sensed that it was high time to drink vodka.” The first response by many analysts to Mr. Putin’s speech last week laying out a constitutional overhaul was that it was meant to provide the groundwork for the president to maintain his grip on power even after his fourth term ends in 2024. A strengthened Parliament might allow Mr. Putin to become a highly influential prime minister, the thinking went. Or new powers set to be granted to an obscure body called the State Council could give Mr. Putin, who is now 67, a venue to fill a father-of-the-nation role in semi-retirement. But events since then have been so fast-paced and chaotic by the standards of Mr. Putin’s deliberate, no-drama style of domestic leadership that many observers now wonder whether something else might be afoot. Kremlin control of Russian television has kept a full-fledged debate off the country’s airwaves. But in Twitter threads, lengthy Facebook posts and screeds on Telegram, political commentators have put forward so many different theories that they paint a picture of a nation in collective befuddlement. Given Mr. Putin’s penchant for trying to keep his adversaries off balance, the befuddlement might be part of the Kremlin’s goal. “The president put up a smokescreen behind which he is determined to reform the political system based on a new ideological project,” political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov wrote in the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. “It is impossible to make out what is actually going on.” The fine art of making educated guesses as to what Russia’s leadership is up to — also known as Kremlinology — dates back to Soviet times. But few moments in recent history have left the chattering classes as off-kilter as this one. In addition to proposing sweeping constitutional changes, Mr. Putin last week accepted the resignation of his entire government and replaced the longtime prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, with a man few Russians had ever heard of — the tax-office chief, Mikhail V. Mishustin. One school of thought held that Mr. Medvedev’s career was all but over and that Mr. Putin had tapped Mr. Mishustin as a potential presidential heir. Another was that Mr. Mishustin was in fact a mere technocrat, while Mr. Medvedev, in his new role in the newly created position of vice chairman of Russia’s Security Council, was parked in a vice-president-style function that made him the heir apparent. The bigger question was what would happen to Mr. Putin himself. New clues came on Monday with the publication of a 29-page bill to enact the constitutional changes that he outlined last week. Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist, wrote that the first thing she noticed about the bill was the commas: So many of them seemed to be missing that it appeared the bill had been drafted and published in haste. The fine print of the legislation showed that the prime minister’s powers would not be expanded as much as first advertised, while members of the State Council would still appear to serve at the pleasure of the president. So maybe Mr. Putin’s plan is to stay president, after all? Theories that seemed far-fetched on the surface soon gained currency. While Russia’s Constitution currently prohibits the president from serving more than two “consecutive” terms, Mr. Putin’s proposed changes included a tweak to ban a president from serving more than two terms, period. Perhaps this one-word change was the real aim, some postulated: Down the road, the Kremlin could argue that the amendment had reset the term-limit counter, allowing Mr. Putin to stay in office for two additional six-year terms. Others claimed, citing no evidence, that the remarkable haste with which the Kremlin was pushing through the constitutional changes and remaking the government was evidence that Mr. Putin might want to call it quits — or was trying to head off a coup. The drip-drip of revelations continued with what seemed to be a wide-ranging reorganization of senior officials. Yuri Y. Chaika, the powerful prosecutor general, abruptly left his post on Monday, only to resurface as Mr. Putin’s new representative to Russia’s northern Caucasus region on Tuesday. A demotion? So it seemed, but one couldn’t be so sure. By Tuesday afternoon, the guessing game over who would form the rest of the new cabinet was in full swing. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the pro-Kremlin television network RT, posted a plea to Telegram asking journalists to stop calling her to confirm rumors that she would be taking this or that senior post. “I’m not going anywhere and won’t be going anywhere,” she wrote. The new cabinet, announced on Tuesday evening, kept the most prominent members of the old one — Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu. The roster of ministries that received new heads — including health care, sports, education and economy — suggested that Mr. Putin wanted to show he was taking Russians’ domestic problems seriously while not planning any shifts in foreign policy. “The most important goal is to raise the well-being of our people, to strengthen our statehood and the international standing of our country,” he told the new cabinet. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian economist at the University of Chicago, took his colleagues to task for tying Mr. Putin’s changes to any transition plan for 2024. Given the Kremlin’s track record of adjusting in real time to major unforeseen events, it was hard to see Mr. Putin’s tacticians gaming out such a long-term plan, he wrote. Rather, he said, the developments could be the result of a power struggle between conservative and progressive factions in Mr. Putin’s orbit. “I don’t know how this story ends,” Mr. Sonin wrote on Facebook. The debate quickly escalated to whether there should be a debate at all. Nothing could change the most important fact of political life in Russia, the popular blogger Aleksandr Gorbunov wrote: Mr. Putin’s system is a “one-man regime.” “All this reshuffling is only necessary to make sure the framework doesn’t change, and rather is cemented even further,” Mr. Gorbunov wrote on Telegram. A journalist, Yury Saprykin, offered a similar sentiment on Facebook, but in verse: We’ll be debating over how he won’t leave,We’ll be guessing, will he leave or won’t he.And then — lo! — he won’t be leaving.That is, before the elections he won’t leave,And after that, he definitely won’t leave. Ivan Nechepurenko, Sophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev contributed research.']",Is he setting the stage to lead Russia for years to come? Is he planning to step down?

Others claimed, citing no evidence, that the remarkable haste with which the Kremlin was pushing through the constitutional changes and remaking the government was evidence that Mr. Putin might want to call it quits — or was trying to head off a coup. The drip-drip of revelations continued with what seemed to be a wide-ranging reorganization of senior officials. Yuri Y. Chaika, the powerful prosecutor general, abruptly left his post on Monday, only to resurface as Mr. Putin’s new representative to Russia’s northern Caucasus region on Tuesday. A demotion? So it seemed, but one couldn’t be so sure. By Tuesday afternoon, the guessing game over who would form the rest of the new cabinet was in full swing. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the pro-Kremlin television network RT, posted a plea to Telegram asking journalists to stop calling her to confirm rumors that she would be taking this or that senior post. “I’m not going anywhere and won’t be going anywhere,” she wrote. The new cabinet, announced on Tuesday evening, kept the most prominent members of the old one — Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu. The roster of ministries that received new heads — including health care, sports, education and economy — suggested that Mr. Putin wanted to show he was taking Russians’ domestic problems seriously while not planning any shifts in foreign policy. “The most important goal is to raise the well-being of our people, to strengthen our statehood and the international standing of our country,” he told the new cabinet. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian economist at the University of Chicago, took his colleagues to task for tying Mr. Putin’s changes to any transition plan for 2024. Given the Kremlin’s track record of adjusting in real time to major unforeseen events, it was hard to see Mr. Putin’s tacticians gaming out such a long-term plan, he wrote. Rather, he said, the developments could be the result of a power struggle between conservative and progressive factions in Mr. Putin’s orbit. “I don’t know how this story ends,” Mr. Sonin wrote on Facebook. The debate quickly escalated to whether there should be a debate at all. Nothing could change the most important fact of political life in Russia, the popular blogger Aleksandr Gorbunov wrote: Mr. Putin’s system is a “one-man regime.” “All this reshuffling is only necessary to make sure the framework doesn’t change, and rather is cemented even further,” Mr. Gorbunov wrote on Telegram. A journalist, Yury Saprykin, offered a similar sentiment on Facebook, but in verse: We’ll be debating over how he won’t leave,We’ll be guessing, will he leave or won’t he.And then — lo! — he won’t be leaving.That is, before the elections he won’t leave,And after that, he definitely won’t leave. Ivan Nechepurenko, Sophia Kishkovsky and Oleg Matsnev contributed research.']",Is he setting the stage to lead Russia for years to come? Is he planning to step down? The confusion may be part of President Vladimir Putin’s strategy.
Iran Admits Firing 2 Missiles at Jet and Says It’s Studying Effect,2020-01-21,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Iran acknowledged on Tuesday that its forces had fired two surface-to-air missiles at a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed this month near Tehran, confirming for the first time that more than one missile was launched at the jet. The Iranian authorities also asked officials in the United States and France to send the equipment needed to decode the jet’s flight data recorders, or “black boxes,” a request certain to frustrate countries that have called for greater international involvement in investigating the disaster, which killed all 176 onboard. The downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8 came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that included tit-for-tat military strikes, and after the killing of the top Iranian security commander, Maj. General Qassim Suleimani, in a United States drone strike at the Baghdad airport. The plane was shot down the same day Iran fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house United States troops, in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani. After days of denials, Iranian officials acknowledged that the downing was the result of “human error,” prompting angry protests across Iran. A preliminary report from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, released on Tuesday, corroborated a video verified by The New York Times last week that showed two missiles, fired from a military site, exploding near the plane. Iranian investigators had established that two Tor-M1 missiles had been fired at the plane, the statement said, adding that the investigation was looking into their effect on the crash. The crash’s victims included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, heightening calls for an international investigation. But many have accused Iran of dragging its feet, a complaint likely to be bolstered by the suggestion on Tuesday that the plane’s black boxes would be analyzed in Iran instead of being sent abroad. The Iranian aviation organzation said it had asked United States and French aviation authorities to provide the equipment needed to decode the data recorders on the Boeing 737 because it did not have the necessary technology. “If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time,” the agency said in its report. “Until now, these countries have not given a positive response to sending the equipment.” That appeared to contradict a statement by Hassan Rezaifar, a head investigator for the same organization, who on Saturday said the jet’s data recorders would be sent to Ukraine at the request of the country’s authorities. It also appeared odd that Tehran would request help from the United States, a longtime adversary whose president has embarked on a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran, including stepping up sanctions that have prevented Iran from importing sensitive technologies. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called for Iran to hand over the recorders and accused it of violating protocols for accident sites by bulldozing debris from the crash before the investigation was complete. Canada, too, has criticized Iran’s level of cooperation, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Iran should give the recorders to France for analysis. There was no immediate comment from officials in the United States, Canada or Ukraine about Iran’s equipment request.']",
"Putin Outlines Political Overhaul, Including Possible Post for Himself",2020-01-20,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia submitted constitutional amendments on Monday that empower a previously toothless advisory council as a powerful policy arbiter, setting up what could be a future role for himself as Russia’s long-term paramount leader. Short on vital details, the proposed changes shed little light on Mr. Putin’s exact plans and set off another round of speculation about the future of Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin. The amendments sharply increase the role of the State Council, turning what is currently a largely decorative body into a new locus of power that will “determine the main direction of domestic and foreign policy.” Not specified, however, is how the council’s head will be chosen and whether the body will be subordinate to the presidency. The council is currently chaired by Mr. Putin in his role as president, a position he first took when President Boris N. Yeltsin resigned on New Year’s Eve 1999. But Mr. Putin is barred from seeking re-election once his current term runs out in 2024. His constitutional changes, first announced in a state of the nation address last Wednesday, are widely viewed as an effort to prolong his hold on power after the end of his presidential term. In another development in Russia’s long somnolent but suddenly fast-moving political scene, Mr. Putin on Monday removed the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika, a central pillar of the country’s capricious law enforcement system throughout his 20-year rule. The sudden flurry of changes has spawned a host of often contradictory theories about what Mr. Putin is up to and why he is moving so fast to reshape a political order largely unchanged for more than quarter of a century. One theory is that, as a former K.G.B. agent, Mr. Putin has embarked on a lightning “special operation” that, swift and unexpected, aims at subduing potential resistance by not giving time for anyone to figure out what is happening. Another unsubstantiated theory is that he could be ill and needs to move quickly before he is forced to bow out. But, said Ivan Kurilla, a political analyst in St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin’s hometown, “the most plausible explanation is that he wants to become the elder statesman who still holds power like the former Chinese leader or Nazarbayev,” references to the deceased Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and to Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. Mr. Nazarbayav stepped down as president of that Central Asian country last year after nearly three decades. But he retained his influence by assuming the new title of “leader of the nation” and declaring himself chairman for life of a strengthened Security Council. After Mr. Putin announced his proposed constitutional changes last week, the prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, and his entire government promptly resigned, giving Mr. Putin a free hand to reappoint ministers or name new ones. That process is expected to start this week. Monday’s removal of the prosecutor general indicated that the shake-up would extend beyond the cabinet. Mr. Chaika, a former justice minister and senior prosecutor since shortly before Mr. Putin took power, is being moved to another, so far unspecified position, the Interfax news agency reported. Taking over his powerful post as prosecutor general, roughly the equivalent of the attorney general in the United States, is Igor Krasnov, the deputy head of Russia’s version of the F.B.I., the Investigative Committee. The office of the prosecutor general and the Investigative Committee have frequently feuded over turf, and the appointment of Mr. Krasnov could be an attempt by Mr. Putin to calm potentially destabilizing rivalries in the law enforcement system as he retools Russia’s entire political order. To some, Mr. Putin’s revision of the Constitution suggests a strategy to replicate the prolonged rule in China of Mr. Deng, who stepped down from the Communist Party’s ruling Politburo Standing Committee in 1987 but retained his position as the country’s paramount leader through his leadership of an advisory body made up of party elders. But Mr. Deng, who died in 1997 and whose only formal position in his final years was the chairmanship of China’s Bridge Association, enjoyed vast authority and prestige as a veteran revolutionary who, though purged for a time, had been a prominent figure in the Communist Party leadership for half a century. He also enjoyed huge prestige as the main architect of a radical reordering of China’s economic and political priorities after the 1976 death of Mao Zedong. Mr. Putin, by contrast, was until the 1990s a little known municipal official in St Petersburg. But he has amassed such overwhelming power and personal popularity that he can probably reshape the system pretty much as he pleases. Whether the State Council would provide a sufficiently secure perch from which Mr. Putin could control events is unclear. The proposed amendments stipulate that the council will be “formed” by the president, which could well be someone else after 2024. The amendments submitted Monday give little comfort to those who had interpreted Mr. Putin’s speech last week as endorsing the creation of a more powerful role for Parliament, which under the current system serves as little more than an echo chamber and rubber stamp for the Kremlin. Those amendments give no major new powers to the Parliament and, if anything in some areas broaden powers of the president, who will appoint much of the security leadership, nominate the prime minister and form the strengthened State Council. Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst with the Moscow Carnegie Center, wrote that the advantage of the State Council for Mr. Putin is that its work “brings together all the main institutions of power: the presidential administration, the government, ministers and governors, the leadership of the ruling United Russia party and even the heads of state corporations and banks.” But how much power it will have, she added, is “one of the biggest questions arising from Putin’s plans for constitutional reform. Most probably, its authority will be directly proportionate to Putin’s concern that the next president could break free of his control.” The current Constitution bars the president from having more than “two consecutive terms,” but Monday’s proposed amendments remove the “consecutive” qualification and prohibit more than two terms outright. This would suggest that Mr. Putin will not try to engineer a way around term limits as he did in 2008, though some observers believe that he could stay on in the Kremlin, arguing that the clock will start from zero once the revised Constitution is adopted. After serving two terms as president, Mr. Putin in 2008 stepped away from the Kremlin to become prime minister, installing Mr. Medvedev, a longtime ally, as a presidential place holder until he returned as president for a third term in 2012. But that maneuver, announced in tandem with the results of tainted parliamentary elections, stirred widespread street protests, something that Mr. Putin wants to avoid in the future.']","By proposing to empower a toothless advisory body, President Vladimir V.

Fire at Czech Asylum Kills at Least 8 and Injures 30 Others,2020-01-19,By Reuters,"['PRAGUE — At least eight people were killed and 30 others injured in the Czech Republic after a fire broke out on Sunday at a home for people with mental disabilities, officials said. The fire occurred at a home in Vejprty, where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived, fire and rescue officials told the public broadcaster Czech Television. The town is on the country’s northwest border with Germany. Prokop Volenik, a spokesman for the regional rescue service, said one of the injured was in critical condition. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. It was the second-deadliest blaze in the country’s 30-year post-Communist history. Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the blaze “a terrible tragedy,” saying on Twitter that the police and firefighters were doing their utmost to investigate. The blaze was reported just before 5 a.m. local time. The newspaper Dennik N reported that the fire started in one room and that most of those killed had died from smoke inhalation. Firefighters were able to contain the fire and put it out within hours, officials said. In 2010, a fire at an abandoned building in Prague that was often used by homeless people killed nine. In 1995, a hotel fire in the capital killed eight.']","The blaze occurred at a home where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived, officials said."
Winter Storm Lashing Spain Leaves 4 Dead and Leads to Power Cuts,2020-01-21,By The Associated Press,"['MADRID — A winter storm lashed much of Spain for a third day Tuesday, leaving about 200,000 people without electricity, schools closed and roads blocked by snow as it killed four people.

Much of the northeastern province of Gerona was without electricity Tuesday because of a fault in the power connection with France, emergency services said on their Twitter account. Many schools remained closed in the northeastern region of Catalonia as well as the Valencia region further south and the inland region of Aragon, Spanish media said. Traffic authorities said dozens of roads remained impassable because of the snow, including the A7 highway between the northeastern town of Figueres and the French border.

ISIS Wife’s Return to Norway Divides Government,2020-01-20,By Henrik Pryser Libell,"['OSLO, Norway — Before the woman left for Syria in 2013, she had grown up on the eastern side of Oslo in a Norwegian-Pakistani family, playing soccer and attending university, according to a recent profile. In Syria, she ended up living in Islamic State territory, marrying twice in the Caliphate and having two children, officials say. When she and her children were plucked from a Kurdish-controlled detention camp in Syria and arrived back on Norwegian soil on Saturday, she was taken into custody for fear that she was a security risk.  The family was being kept under surveillance and medical observation in an Oslo hospital, and Norwegian news outlets reported on Monday that the woman would remain in custody for at least four more weeks.  The Norwegian government suggested that the decision to bring back the unidentified woman, now 29, had been a humanitarian one: One of her two children — a boy, 5, and a girl, 3 — was believed to be seriously ill. But the move has prompted a national debate over what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said was “a difficult consular case,” and had threatened to bring down the government. The decision was met with staunch opposition from the government’s coalition partner, the anti-immigrant and law-and-order Progress Party, and there were suggestions that if the matter was not settled to its liking, it could blow up the coalition that holds up the government. The party stopped short of doing that on Monday, while still registering its discontent. After an emergency meeting on Monday, the Progress Party said that it would withdraw from the four-party governing coalition, but that it would still continue to support the government. A spokesman for the party, Jon Engen-Helgheim, said last week that he strongly disagreed with the decision to bring the woman home. She has been charged by the Norwegian Security Police with “participation in a terrorist organization” for joining the Nusra Front and the Islamic State. The charge is punishable by up to six years in prison on conviction. “This woman has turned her back on us,” Mr. Engen-Helgheim said. “She hates all that we stand for. She joined a gruesome terror army and contributed to prosecution, decapitation, burnings and the murder of innocent women, children and adults.” “We do not want her kind in Norway, and we certainly don’t want Norwegian authorities spending enormous resources getting them to Norway,” he added. With the defeat of the Islamic State and the militants’ loss of territory in the Middle East, countries across Europe have had to grapple with the return of those associated with the group. Turkey’s decision to release ISIS detainees has also forced Western European nations to confront a problem they had long sought to avoid: what to do about the potential return of radicalized, often battle-hardened Europeans to countries that do not want them back. By November 2019, there were 12,300 foreigners detained in camps in Syria, including over 8,700 children from more than 40 nations, according to estimates by the charity Save the Children. A report from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy showed similar figures. Preparation to repatriate the woman to Norway began in October, according to officials. Since March 2019, she had been held in the Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, along with thousands of other women and children. (Four other ISIS-affiliated women from Norway remain in Syrian camps.) Officials said that she was married to an ISIS fighter named Bastian Vasquez, a Norwegian with a Chilean background. He went missing under unclear circumstances in 2015. Later, the woman married another ISIS fighter. Both of their stories were told by the author Asne Seierstad in her biography of foreign fighters in Syria, “Two Sisters.” In the book, the woman is identified by the name “Emira.” Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that she and her children had been repatriated because of fears that her son was seriously ill.  Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway told the state broadcaster NRK on Thursday, “What is important is that the presumably ill child now can get medical treatment in Norway.”  During a Monday news conference, Ms. Solberg explained that the government originally preferred to just bring the sick child back to the country but could not separate him from his mother. “Our dilemma was hence to bring home a child with his mother, or risk that a sick 5-year-old child might die,” she said.  “To me it was important that the boy came home to Norway.” Norway is led by a center-right coalition of four parties — Ms. Solberg’s Conservatives, along with the Progress Party, and the smaller Liberal and Christian parties — that has governed Norway since 2013.  Its most recent incarnation took shape last year, when it included all four parties for the first time, but the decision by the Progress Party to pull out means that Ms. Solberg will continue to lead but as the head of a minority government. Under Norway’s penal code, raising children within Islamic State territory qualifies as participation in a terrorist organization, prosecutors argued in the first case against a Norwegian woman who had left for Syria. The woman, who was caught on her way to the country, was convicted. Many Norwegians say they feared that the 29-year-old woman’s return posed a security threat to the country, but the police did not raise the terrorism threat level. “Norway is well equipped with legal framework to deal with returnees from the Islamic State,” said Magnus Ranstorp, an associate professor and head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm. Mr. Ranstorp has served as an expert witness in some of the trials against fighters returning to Norway from Syria.  Mr. Ranstorp said that about 140 people had left Norway for Syria, and that the Scandinavian country had given about 10 returnees “severe convictions” since 2012. In neighboring Sweden, in contrast, about 300 had left for Syria, 150 returned, and only two have been prosecuted. “The woman remains a security concern,” he acknowledged. “But at least she will be under control and surveillance in Norway. Apart from France, no European-born returnees from the war in Syria had carried out new terror attacks in Europe.” “France has 500 terrorist convicts and 1,200 people in jail who are involved in Islamic State ideology,” Mr. Ranstorp noted. “Within the next two years, many of them will be released from prison. The security services will be very busy handling this situation.” The woman in Norway will plead not guilty to all charges, her lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, said on Sunday. He said that she was willing to cooperate with the police and had been questioned. “This is a woman who wants to face her past,” Mr. Nordhus said, but added: “It is up to the prosecutors to prove their charge. She is not charged with combat or having a military role. The core of the case is the fact that she was in Syria and had relations to people connected to terrorist organizations.” He declined to answer questions about whether she had become radicalized. “She has had a gruesome time, especially the time in camp,” he said, “but she says that her entire time in Syria was a nightmare.” ']","A woman and her children were retrieved from a detention camp in Syria, spurring debate at home after she was charged with being part of a terrorist organization."
Serbia-Kosovo Flights to Resume Under U.S.-Brokered Deal,2020-01-20,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Serbia and Kosovo agreed on Monday to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades, in a step toward reconciliation brokered by the United States at a time when the European Union is urging the two Balkan countries to resume talks. The deal will open passenger and cargo flights between Belgrade and Pristina by the German-owned carrier Eurowings. It came after months of intense shuttle diplomacy by Richard Grenell, the United States ambassador to Germany, who was named special envoy for Serbia-Kosovo relations by President Trump last year. Mr. Grenell said the key to reaching the agreement signed on Monday was ignoring the longstanding political conflicts between the two countries and focusing instead on the potential for economic ties. “What we heard from the business community in Kosovo and from the business community in Serbia is we want a more normalized commerce structure and we need a flight,” Mr. Grenell said. “It’s the reason why we went after trying to figure out how do we make a direct flight for the first time in a generation.” In 1998 and 1999, Serbian forces brutally suppressed an uprising by ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which was then part of Serbia, until a NATO bombing campaign against Serbia, led by the United States, forced Serbia to give up on the war. Kosovo gained autonomy after the war and in 2008 it formally declared independence, but its relations with Serbia have remained tense. About half of the world’s nations recognize Kosovo’s independence, including the United States and most of its Western allies, and about half do not, including Serbia and its most powerful ally, Russia. The resumption of flights is a step toward normalization, however small, at a time when a new European Union leadership is eager to resolve the simmering dispute between Kosovo and Serbia as part of its overall effort to instill peace in Europe’s historically turbulent southeastern flank. Since the end of the Balkan wars in 2001, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, integrating the former combatants into the European Union has been a central part of fulfilling the longstanding vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. Two nations created from the breakup of Yugoslavia — Slovenia and Croatia — have joined the bloc. The others — Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro — are being considered for membership. The new foreign policy chief for the European Union, Josep Borrell Fontelles of Spain — a country that has not yet recognized Kosovo as independent — said one goal of his term in office would be to revive talks between leaders in Pristina and Belgrade. Previous negotiations lasted several years without much progress before stalling in 2018, after the government of Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj of Kosovo imposed 100 percent tariffs on imports from Serbia and passed legislation to form an army. Mr. Haradinaj resigned in July, after he was summoned for questioning about crimes against ethnic Serbs during and after the 1998-99 war, in which he served as an officer in the Kosovo Liberation Army. His departure triggered an early election, held in October. Since then, Kosovo has been without a government, hindering the resumption of any progress on negotiations. In a call last week to Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaci, Mr. Borrell stressed the need for a new government to be in place for negotiations to be able to proceed. Mr. Borrell also spoke by telephone with Aleksandar Vucic, the president of Serbia. On Monday, Mr. Thaci nominated Albin Kurti of the nationalist Self-Determination party as prime minister, three months after the election failed to deliver a majority. The agreement on flights was signed by Milun Trivunac, the state secretary of Serbia’s ministry of economy; Eset Berisha, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Kosovo; and Michael Knitter, the chief operating officer of Eurowings, a budget carrier owned by Lufthansa. After the signing at the American Embassy in Berlin, Mr. Knitter said that flights would begin after both countries removed regulatory hurdles. It takes only 25 minutes to fly between Belgrade and Pristina, compared with more than five hours by road, including going through a border check, he said. Eurowings has a plane and a crew stationed in Pristina and already flies from there to several destinations in Germany and Austria. Lufthansa flies in and out of Belgrade. No schedule has been set for when flights might resume, Mr. Knitter said.']","It takes more than five hours to drive between the capitals of the two countries, but only 25 minutes to fly. A deal on flights is seen as a step toward détente between the neighbors."
Glenn Greenwald Charged With Cybercrimes in Brazil,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the American journalist Glenn Greenwald with cybercrimes for his role in bringing to light cellphone messages that have embarrassed prosecutors and tarnished the image of an anticorruption task force. In a criminal complaint made public on Tuesday, prosecutors in the capital, Brasília, accused Mr. Greenwald of being part of a “criminal organization” that hacked into the cellphones of several prosecutors and other public officials last year. Mr. Greenwald, an ardent critic of Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a deeply polarizing figure in Brazil, where his work is lionized by leftists and condemned as partisan and heavy handed by officials in the Bolsonaro administration. The news organization Mr. Greenwald co-founded, The Intercept Brasil, published articles last year based on the leaked cellphone messages that raised questions about the integrity and the motives of key members of Brazil’s justice system. The articles cast doubt on the impartiality of a former judge, Sérgio Moro, and of some of the prosecutors who worked on a corruption investigation that landed several powerful political and business figures in prison. Among those charged in connection with the corruption investigation was a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular leftist whose conviction paved the way for the election of Mr. Bolsonaro. Mr. Moro was the judge who handled that case, and he is now Mr. Bolsonaro’s minister of justice. The charges against Mr. Greenwald raise concerns among journalists and advocates for a free press because journalists often rely on confidential or leaked information, sometimes obtained by whistle-blowers or hackers. Mr. Greenwald has been part of a team that won some of the most important prizes in journalism — the George Polk Award and the Pulitzer Prize for public service — for reporting on documents that described government surveillance. The documents were passed on to him by Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor with the National Security Agency of the United States who later faced espionage charges in connection with the leak. In a statement Mr. Greenwald called the charges “an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about Minister Moro and the Bolsonaro government.” Mr. Greenwald, who has not been detained, said he intended to continue publishing and cast the case against him as a test of Brazil’s democracy. “We will not be intimidated by these tyrannical attempts to silence journalists,” he said. In a 95-page criminal complaint, prosecutors say that The Intercept Brasil, the news organization Mr. Greenwald co-founded, did more than merely receive the hacked messages and oversee the publication of newsworthy information. Citing intercepted messages between Mr. Greenwald and the hackers, prosecutors say the journalist played a “clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime.” For instance, prosecutors contend that Mr. Greenwald encouraged the hackers to delete archives that had already been shared with The Intercept Brasil, in order to cover their tracks. Prosecutors also say that Mr. Greenwald was communicating with the hackers while they were actively monitoring private chats on Telegram, a messaging app. The complaint charged six other individuals, including four who were detained last year in connection with the cellphone hacking. Legal experts and leftist politicians criticized the decision to charge Mr. Greenwald, calling the evidence outlined against him thin. Thiago Bottino, a legal expert at Fundação Getúlio Vargas University in Rio de Janeiro, said prosecutors had not described evidence that suggests Mr. Greenwald broke the law. “There’s nothing in the complaint showing that he helped or guided” the hackers, he said. Mr. Bottino said Brazil’s case law gave journalists broad protections. “You can’t punish a journalist for divulging a document that was obtained through criminal means,” he said. Gleisi Hoffman, the president of the Workers’ Party, the largest opposition party, called the charge an abuse of power. “They want a police state, with more farces, illegalities and arbitrary acts,” she wrote in a message on Twitter. Mr. Greenwald moved to Brazil in 2005 after meeting David Miranda, a Brazilian man whom he later married and who became a federal congressman last year. Mr. Greenwald first became widely known for his role in the release of classified national security documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. He co-founded The Intercept Brasil in 2016. Mr. Greenwald expressed concern last year that the authorities might charge him criminally as a reprisal for The Intercept Brasil’s reporting based on the leaked messages. Mr. Bolsonaro left little doubt that he would relish seeing the journalist punished. In late July, the president used a derisive term to refer to Mr. Greenwald and said the journalist “might wind up in jail.” Mr. Greenwald’s concerns were partly based on reports that federal officials were investigating his finances. Those reports led a Supreme Court justice, Gilmar Mendes, to issue an extraordinary order barring the federal police from investigating Mr. Greenwald’s role in the dissemination of the hacked messages. Prosecutors on Tuesday said they had abided by that order until they found audio messages which, they argued, implicated Mr. Greenwald in criminal activity. The charges came as a “huge surprise,” Mr. Greenwald said in an interview on Tuesday, because the Federal Police issued a report in December that cleared him of having engaged in criminal conduct related to the phone hacks. Mr. Greenwald said he had been methodical in his dealings with the source who gave him the leaked chats, mindful of the lessons he had learned in the Snowden case. “The one thing I could not do is give direction,” Mr. Greenwald said. “That’s crossing a line. I was very careful.” The prosecutor who filed the case, Wellington Oliveira, last month charged the president of Brazil’s bar association with libel for making disparaging remarks about Mr. Moro. A federal judge recently dismissed the case, ruling that Mr. Oliveira’s argument lacked a solid legal base. The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed alarm over the case against Mr. Greenwald. “Charging journalists with criminal activity based on interactions with sources sends a chilling message to reporters working on sensitive stories at a time when the Brazilian media is increasingly under attack from officials in its own government,” said Natalie Southwick, the program coordinator at the committee who monitors press freedom in Latin America. Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Letícia Casado from Brasília.']",Mr. Greenwald is accused of being part of a “criminal investigation” that hacked into the cellphones of prosecutors and public officials.
‘I Can’t Bring Back the Dead’: Sri Lanka Leader Ends Search for War Missing,2020-01-21,By Maria Abi-Habib and Dharisha Bastians,"['Dashing the hopes of thousands of families desperate for word about loved ones who went missing during Sri Lanka’s long, grisly civil war, the country’s new president has offered an unsparing rebuff to their quest for closure. The missing are in fact dead, said the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and “I can’t bring back the dead.” The government, eager to close a painful chapter in the country’s history, plans to issue death certificates for the missing Sri Lankans, after conducting investigations and issuing death warrants. More than 24,000 Sri Lankans are registered as missing across the country. But not all Sri Lankans missing relatives in the 26-year war that ended in 2009 were ready to accept that the cases are closed. Some rejected the notion that the years they had spent searching for loved ones in the hope that they survived had been in vain. “Even after 21 years, I still do not accept that my son is no more,” said Visakha Dharmadasa, whose son disappeared at the height of the civil war between the government and Tamil Tiger insurgents. “I haven’t seen a dead body. I am still waiting for him.” She said she planned to keep her son’s certificate of absence, a document that allowed the families of the missing to make legal decisions on their behalf. Sri Lanka is haunted by the scars of its civil war. Even as the country tries to move on, devastating reminders of the carnage crop up. It is not uncommon for mass graves and old weapons caches to be uncovered during excavations to build shopping centers or upscale hotels in the country, which became a tourist hot spot after the conflict had ended. Now, President Rajapaksa appears to be seeking to usher in a new era for the country by trying to close one of the final chapters of the war: the file of the missing. Mr. Rajapaksa was defense secretary during the last years of the civil war, and was accused of gross human rights abuses as he crushed the insurgency and brought the conflict to an end. Thousands of civilians were killed. The president has consistently denied any wrongdoing during his time as defense secretary. Not all missing-person cases are from the war years. Several journalists and political dissidents disappeared off Sri Lanka’s streets after the guns had gone silent, when Mr. Rajapaksa and his brothers were spearheading the government. When Mr. Rajapaksa was defense secretary, his brother Mahinda served as president for a decade. The family lost elections in 2015, and in 2017 the country’s Criminal Investigation Department told a court that during Mr. Rajapaksa’s time as defense secretary, he ran a death squad that had targeted opponents. He denied the allegation. After the family’s 2015 defeat, the police ended a kidnapping racket run by Sri Lankan navy officers that investigators said had abducted and killed 11 young men. For more than a decade, mothers of the 11 men have trudged to court and listened to the investigators’ findings, never giving up hope that the children survived. “My son is alive, and I am still searching for him,” said one of the mothers, Jennifer Weerasinghe. “My son’s case is still ongoing. I will wait for that outcome. I will not accept death certificates.” The Rajapaksas returned to power last fall. The president’s assertion that there was no point in pursuing the search for the missing came over the weekend, at a meeting with a top United Nations official. Most of the missing, President Rajapaksa said, had been forcefully conscripted by the Tamil Tigers, who were seeking to establish their own state in the north, and most likely had died on the battlefield. A statement from his office said that “steps would be taken to issue a death certificate to these missing persons.” But for some families, presidential finality was not enough. They want hard evidence, like remains. “The Sri Lankan government cannot dismiss their grievances and simply issue them death certificates — that is not only illegal but also unconscionable,” said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, an Amnesty International researcher based in Colombo, the capital. The government, she said, had acted “without conducting an effective and independent investigation, where the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the disappeared person is found and shared with relatives.” In 2013, a presidential commission to investigate missing-person complaints was appointed. “The history of conflict in Sri Lanka is characterized by the agony of individuals and families who are seeking closure to the pain of not knowing what has become of their relations and loved ones,” the commission declared in its final report. The commission said it had registered 24,000 cases, at least 5,000 of them involving combatants who disappeared during the war. Its report also pointed a finger at the Sri Lankan military. The evidence, it said, “had clearly established that several individuals who surrendered to the Sri Lankan military"" were “among the disappeared.” With a long history of insurgency and conflict, Sri Lanka is responsible for the second-largest caseload before the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, trailing only Iraq. The history of Sri Lanka’s missing goes back further than the civil war. Amnesty International has estimated that there have been up to 100,000 disappearances in Sri Lanka since the 1970s. Tens of thousands of Sinhalese youth, for example, disappeared during two Marxist insurgencies. [This article has been updated to reflect a statement by the Sri Lankan government released after publication, saying that Sri Lanka’s president had not estimated how many of the missing are thought to be dead.]']","A decade after the close of a bloody civil war, 24,000 remain missing.

Salvini Remains at the Eye of Italy’s Political Storm,2020-01-22,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — Chaos once again reigns over Italian politics. The government is adrift. The political parties are cratering and cracking. But there remains one center of gravity around which everything revolves. Matteo Salvini, the tough former interior minister and leader of the anti-migrant League party, is that organizing force, despite having lost his powerful position and grip on the government in a dramatic shake-up last summer. Any semblance of stability comes from coalitions awkwardly forged to prevent him from prompting early elections and taking what he has called “full powers.” But on Sunday, Mr. Salvini will have an opportunity to apply what he hopes will be unbearable pressure on the tenuous bonds between his enemies in the fragile governing alliance.  Polls show that his hard-right League party is well positioned to win in regional elections in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, which has for decades been synonymous with the Italian left, and in the region of Calabria — in the country’s south, from which Mr. Salvini not so long ago advocated secession. If the rabble-rousing nationalist can win in these places, he will solidify his centrality and his case that he can win anywhere. “That’s the goal,” he said in an interview this month in Emilia-Romagna after a long day of posing for selfies and campaigning in front of a floating Nativity scene, and dictating, quite literally, the day’s news cycle to reporters. “It would be a clear sign on a national level, but also on a European level.” Sitting under an “Italians First” banner and surrounded by 400 party activists at a dinner in Lugo di Romagna, he ate pasta, sipped local red wine and spoke about how a victory in this traditionally left-leaning region would “absolutely” demonstrate that he should be the one leading the country. Mr. Salvini predicted that his victory would “open an enormous problem” between the governing coalition of his former allies the Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, and make its collapse, and early elections, more likely. Some damage had already been done. On Wednesday, Luigi Di Maio, the embattled political leader of Five Star, resigned his position amid falling poll numbers and climbing internal dissatisfaction. But Mr. Salvini’s problem is that the stronger he gets, the less incentive his opponents have to face him in new national elections. “They can’t delay forever,” Mr. Salvini said. In the meantime, liberals worry about the national significance of Mr. Salvini winning in Emilia-Romagna, long the Communist buckle of Italy’s Red Belt. A victory “would mean that society has different values from before and wants an alternative,” said Elly Schlein, a liberal candidate for local office, who took part in a tiny demonstration outside a Bologna theater where Mr. Salvini was warmly greeted at a holiday celebration for the children of police officers. “A nationalist turn.” A victory in Calabria would also clearly signal the national reach of Mr. Salvini’s League, a party born as a northern secessionist movement that exalted an imaginary region called Padania. For years, the party denigrated the south as a thieving leech on the resources of the more prosperous north. But as Mr. Salvini has shifted his ire to migrants coming illegally from Africa, he has expanded his base to the south. “Calabrians and Italians first,” he now says. “Then the rest of the world.” In Emilia-Romagna, he has tirelessly campaigned for his candidate, the League politician Lucia Borgonzoni, seeking to turn out his base in rural districts with his usual recipe of anti-migrant language and nostalgic appeals to the Italian good old days. But Mr. Salvini has also sought to convince frustrated workers in the cities that the traditional left had abandoned them for big banking interests and that he was the working man’s choice. Above all, Mr. Salvini has sought to nationalize the election. “It’s not a regional election. Because for the first time in 50 years we can win,” he told supporters in front of an enormous bonfire in Terra del Sole, referring to the left’s longtime dominance of the region. “And it’s in your hands.” Nationalizing the race is a strategy that makes particular sense in Emilia-Romagna, a wealthy region governed by the Democratic Party, where unemployment has shrunk, health care services are admired and the quality of life is high. “The region has always been governed by the left, also governed well,” said Claudio Casari, a 64-year-old carpenter who cheered Mr. Salvini as his “captain” outside a marine museum in Cesenatico. But he said that a general Italian malaise had led young people to leave the country and the region, and that Italy needed a strong leader like Mr. Salvini to restore faith. “He brings hope to Italy,” Mr. Casari said. Mr. Salvini’s many detractors argued that he used his time in government to draw attention to himself and increase his political support with publicity stunts rather than help get Italy out of its slump. On Tuesday, Mr. Salvini streamed video of himself buzzing the doorbell of a Tunisian family in a working class section of Bologna and asking the person who answered the intercom if their son dealt drugs, as locals asserted. The Tunisian ambassador protested that the incident “was a deplorable provocation” that “stigmatized the whole Tunisian community in Italy.” But national leaders of the Democratic Party are loath to make their case on the ground in Emilia-Romagna, and have largely steered clear of the region to keep the race local and play down the consequences if they lose. Enthusiasm there has largely come from the Sardines, a liberal grass-roots movement created to stop Mr. Salvini. The Sardines packed Bologna’s main square with tens of thousands of people on Sunday night and plan to close out the race with a rally in the beach club where Mr. Salvini spent most of the summer. They have repeatedly taken credit for infusing the candidacy of the region’s incumbent governor, Stefano Bonaccini, with life. Mr. Bonaccini has himself urged voters to recall that Mr. Salvini is not on the ballot and that Ms. Borgonzoni, who picked fights with France over Leonardo da Vinci paintings as a Ministry of Culture under secretary and who struggled to name Emilia-Romagna’s bordering regions in a radio interview, was the “ghost candidate.” “After Jan. 26, Salvini will leave,” Mr. Bonaccini, who has not included his party’s symbol in campaign posters, has repeatedly said. “But Borgonzoni will stay in the region.” Instead of delving into local issues, Mr. Salvini, who often dressed in the uniforms of Italy’s law enforcement during his time in power, has fully immersed himself in the corduroy pants and jackets, sweaters and suede shoes associated with the liberal intellectuals and Communists who long held sway here. He sings the folk song “Romagna Mia” at events. He waxes poetic about tortellini and elevated Parmesan cheese to a moral value. But for Mr. Salvini, the substance of the remarks is often Matteo Salvini. He has developed a knack for victimization, a tactic in Italian politics perfected by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who Mr. Salvini has fully eclipsed as the central player of Italy’s right. In the interview, Mr. Salvini clearly relished the attacks of his opponents. “Surely it doesn’t scare me, or do me harm,” he said, adding: “When there are protests against the League and Salvini, it only makes me happy. Because the regular Italian chooses — either Salvini or that other stuff there.”  Most recently, Mr. Salvini has identified Italy’s judicial system as his preferred foil in an effort to motivate voters. Specifically, Mr. Salvini talks about the efforts of Sicilian magistrates to prosecute him for “abduction,” related to his refusal as interior minister to let a Coast Guard ship full of rescued migrants dock in Italy. By trying him, he told the cheering crowd in Cesenatico, “they will put the entire Italian people on trial.” On Tuesday, he kicked off a “FastForSalvini” campaign, in which he urged his supporters to show solidarity with him in a daylong hunger strike. He began it with a cup of ginseng and vitamins. More broadly, Mr. Salvini has managed to remain the object of obsession for Italy’s varying political parties and media. His Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok posts reliably generate articles in the country’s politically obsessed, and clubby, media. At the marine museum in Cesenatico, when Italian reporters pleaded with him for a sound bite, he used the moment to decide what the day’s subject of conversation would be. “I haven’t even read the papers today,” Mr. Salvini, a little glassy-eyed, said as he popped some mints into his mouth. He opened up Il Corriere Della Sera newspaper on his cellphone and took a minute to scan through while the reporters waited silently. A reporter of the state broadcaster RAI gave his microphone to a local Salvini supporter who stood next to him. “Let’s do it on the trial and the road deaths,” Mr. Salvini said, pausing to collect his thoughts. “And go.” Then, they asked about the trial and the road deaths.']","The hard-right leader may be poised for a breakthrough in two traditionally hostile regions.

Powerful Winter Storm in Spain Kills at Least 10,2020-01-23,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A powerful winter storm in Spain has killed at least 10 people after battering the country for days, destroying bridges, cutting off roads and railway lines and flooding vast swaths of farmland. Even as the storm moved north, setting off weather alerts for parts of France, tens of thousands of people across Spain were still recovering on Thursday from driving rains and pounding waves that wreaked havoc in coastal towns and villages. Farther inland, residents began the process of digging themselves out after heavy snowfalls that left villages cut off from assistance. Since last weekend, the eastern coast of Spain has been regularly hit by winds that reached over 60 miles per hour, the strongest in the country since 1992, according to the Spanish weather service. Videos posted to social media showed giant waves crashing into the shoreline, streets buried under mountains of sea foam and whole beaches seemingly swallowed by the sea. In the Balearic Islands, which are in the Mediterranean off eastern Spain, waves cresting at more than 45 feet swept away some popular beaches and smashed into seafront houses. Dani Palacios, the head of beach services for Barcelona, told the local broadcaster Betevé that it was the worst storm the region had seen in decades. On Wednesday, another 600 people were evacuated from their homes in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain. The authorities advised other residents living near the Ter and Onyar rivers to either leave their houses or move to an upstairs floor, amid fears that further rainfall could cause both rivers to burst their banks. The death toll climbed to 10 on Wednesday after the authorities confirmed that a man was killed in the port of Palamós, a town in Catalonia, as he tried to check the state of his boat. Emergency services in Palamós were continuing to search for another person who is believed to have fallen into the sea, one of several people in the area still reported missing since the passage of the storm. Three other people are missing in the Balearic Islands, including a British man who was exploring the area’s canyons when the storm hit. One of the worst affected spots was the delta of the Ebro River, where rice paddies were flooded by the surge of the sea, which advanced nearly two miles inland. “We can’t remember anything similar ever happening,” Mayor Lluis Soler of Deltebre told the radio station Cadena SER. “It’s dramatic to see how the river has overflowed and the sea has traveled.” Deadly storms have hit Spain this winter. A few days before Christmas, six people were killed in different parts of the country by storms that also swept through Portugal and southern France, also forcing flight cancellations and the temporary closing of part rail and road networks. It could be some time before the full extent of the damage wrought by this storm comes into focus, particularly in the farming areas of eastern Spain.']","Coastal towns were lashed by 45-foot waves, and villages farther inland were buried under mountains of snow."
"China Expands Virus Lockdown, Encircling 35 Million",2020-01-23,By Chris Buckley and Javier C. Hernández,"['WUHAN, China — The authorities drastically expanded a travel lockdown in central China on Thursday, essentially penning in more than 35 million residents to contain a deadly virus that is overwhelming hospitals and fueling fears of a pandemic. The new limits — abruptly decreed ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season — were an extraordinary step that underscored the ruling Communist Party’s deepening fears about the outbreak of a little understood coronavirus. It has killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 800 in China and at least six other countries, including the United States, according to statistics from health officials. In Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital of 11 million where the outbreak began, anxiety and anger prevailed as worried residents crowded into hospitals and teams of medical workers in hazmat suits sought to identify the infected. “They can’t take proper care of all the people here,” said Sun Ansheng, a man in his 50s who was waiting outside a hospital while his wife was tested for the coronavirus, so named because of the spiky halo around the microorganism. “The city government told us there was a virus, but they didn’t explain enough what we should do,” Mr. Sun said. “They left it sounding too minor. Now look.” Even as the Chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions — blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put — experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity. The updated death toll, announced early Friday by Chinese officials, jumped by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours. The World Health Organization’s emergency committee, meeting in Geneva on Thursday for the second consecutive day, said it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would reconvene in 10 days or less to reassess the outbreak. The images in Wuhan offered a jarring contrast to the attempts by Chinese leaders in Beijing to project confident composure. President Xi Jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in Beijing to the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests. Even so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across China, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. In Beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the Forbidden City. On Thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, the industrial city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to Wuhan, leaving thousands of people stranded. Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents. And by Friday, restrictions had extended to Xiantao and Qianjiang, two other cities that include large rural populations. “This was a very difficult choice,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan and the other locked-down cities, told Chinese state television. “Although Wuhan has taken a series of measures to ease things, there are certainly many hardships.” An announcement Friday in the Hubei Daily, the province’s official newspaper, indicated that the restrictions could vary from city to city. In Zhijiang, one of the cities listed, shops and businesses were ordered to close, except for supermarkets, food markets, and other ones essential for daily life. Some residents in Wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints. “It’s serious, but not that serious,” said Wang Mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the Wuhan Railway Station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in Henan Province for the Lunar New Year celebrations. “If we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver,” he said. Anger and frustration spread among Wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. Most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. But many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles. “I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” said Yang Lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.” Several residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted. Doctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. Some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases. “The government did not fulfill its duty,” Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. “They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.” The Wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late. Experts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside China, as many infected people had already left Wuhan. “The horse is already out of the barn,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who had assisted the Chinese authorities in the response to SARS. In an unusually blunt rebuke, Dr. Guan Yi, a prominent Hong Kong scientist who also assisted in the SARS crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to Wuhan this week. “I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said in an interview published Thursday by the influential magazine Caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.” On Thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the Chinese authorities released details about 18 of the people who had died in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. But the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the Wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the SARS crisis. But they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people. Wuhan sits astride the mighty Yangtze River, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks — usually busy in the holiday season — were mostly shut. Retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty. But cars crowded around seven hospitals across Wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. Some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor. After SARS broke out nearly 20 years ago, the Chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. But the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of SARS and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements. Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that while the current response has benefited from China’s improved technical capabilities since the SARS crisis, “what I find astounding was how the Wuhan authorities consistently downplayed the seriousness of the situation.” The lessons from SARS, he said in an email, were “that it’s important to let the public know and get the public to modify their behavior.” Still, China’s leaders maintained an unruffled face. The Communist Party’s most influential news outlets did not feature the crisis, choosing instead to promote Mr. Xi’s New Year speech and cheery reports about the holiday season. On Thursday, China Central Television, the state broadcaster, treated the situation in Wuhan as a footnote in its evening newscast, one of the most watched television programs in China, airing a roughly one-minute report on the outbreak. Experts said Mr. Xi appeared to be trying to prevent a sense of panic and to limit criticism of the party’s response. “The top priority will be to keep coverage from asking more probing questions about how China’s institutions have responded, questions that might lead to criticism of the government,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a group affiliated with the University of Hong Kong. Some internet users found ways around government censorship to criticize the response by local officials, saying on social media that they worried about a repeat of the SARS crisis. Many said they were also concerned about possible food shortages and higher prices on everyday goods. Mao Shoulong, a professor of public administration at Renmin University in Beijing, said the Wuhan government had made a series of missteps that had eroded public confidence. “They failed the test,” Professor Mao said. “They just copied the SARS situation, making small things turn into a big problem.” Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, and Javier C. Hernández from Beijing. Elsie Chen, Yiwei Wang and Zoe Mou contributed research.']","The new travel restrictions include 12 cities as the death toll climbed to 26.

Mining Executives Face Homicide Charges in Brazil Dam Disaster,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the former president of the Brazil-based mining giant Vale and 15 other people with homicide, faulting them for negligence in a dam disaster that killed at least 259 people a year ago. Those charged include Vale’s former chief executive, Fabio Schvartsman, and other senior officials employed by Vale and by a German firm hired to assess the stability of its dams. They were also charged with environmental crimes, as were the companies. The announcement came days before the first anniversary of one of the deadliest mining disasters in years. The dam in Brumadinho, in the state of Minas Gerais, was built to hold waste from an iron ore mine. When it burst on Jan. 25, 2019, the company cafeteria and other facilities were buried in a torrent of mud. On Tuesday, one of the state prosecutors who brought the charges, William Garcia Pinto Coelho, said Vale had executives systematically hide evidence of safety concerns and retaliated against auditing firms that flagged problems. And the German firm Tüv Süd, Mr. Pinto Coelho said, was compensated for knowingly presenting Vale with misleading reports about the stability of its dams. Prosecutors said they had found evidence that Vale officials knew Brumadinho’s dam was at risk since at least November 2017. It was on an internal list of 10 dams at risk of bursting, they learned. “The goal of these omissions, ultimately, was to avoid any negative impacts to Vale’s reputation that could affect its market value,” Mr. Pinto Coelho said. Tüv Süd and Vale, he said, knowingly took risks “that could cause environmental damage, eventual homicide and deaths.” Federal prosecutors are still conducting their own investigation, which could yield more charges. Mr. Pinto Coelho said that the Brumadinho dam had not been the only one at risk, and that throughout the investigation, prosecutors advocated for action when they learned of other Vale sites deemed unstable. Pierpaolo Bottini, Mr. Schvartsman’s lawyer, said there was no evidence that the former Vale chief had been made aware of concerns about the dam in Brumadinho. “These charges are unfair and incompatible with Fabio’s track record,” Mr. Bottini said. The company said in a statement that it was “perplexed” by the charges announced Tuesday. “Vale trusts that the causes of the rupture will be completely determined and reaffirms its commitment to continue cooperating with the authorities,” the company said. In a statement of its own, Tüv Süd said it was cooperating with the authorities in Brazil and Germany. The company said the causes of the dam bursting “have not been conclusively ascertained.” Vale has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, reconstruction and compensation efforts in Brumadinho. But Alessandra Cristina de Oliveira, a Brumadinho councilwoman, said Tuesday that the city was still reeling. While recovery and reconstruction efforts have brought money and jobs to the town, many residents are fearful the bonanza will run out soon. The mining site, which was a pillar of the local economy, is not expected to reopen. “We don’t have anything that guarantees our survival after this,” Ms. de Oliveira said. “My fear is that we end up with a city that is both sick and bankrupt.” Soon after the dam burst, law enforcement officials said they had found clear evidence that Vale and its partners put profit over safety at mining sites. A similar dam burst at another Vale mine in Minas Gerais in 2015, killing 19 people and causing widespread environmental damage. As evidence of negligence mounted, Vale’s board last March suspended Mr. Schvartsman and other top executives. In November, a Congressional committee investigating the Brumadinho disaster recommended the indictment of 22 company officials. Around the same time, the National Mining Agency announced that it had concluded that Vale hid serious problems it was aware of in mandatory government reports. Letícia Casado contributed reporting from Brasília.']","A year after a dam burst killed at least 259 people, prosecutors accused company executives of covering up safety concerns."
Lebanon Names New Cabinet Amid Political and Economic Crisis,2020-01-22,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon announced the formation of a new cabinet on Tuesday, breaking a monthslong deadlock with the nomination of 20 new government ministers who will have to address a perplexing mix of political and economic crises. The government is deep in debt, the currency has lost much of its value on the black market and protesters have taken to the streets for more than three months to condemn the country’s political class for years of corruption and mismanagement. It remained unclear whether the new cabinet, which still must be confirmed by the Parliament, could take swift action to prevent an economic collapse or to appease the protesters. In addition, the new government’s support from Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant movement that the United States considers a terrorist organization, could dissuade Western and Persian Gulf nations from coming to Lebanon’s aid. Hassan Diab, an engineering professor and former education minister who was designated prime minister last month, told reporters Tuesday that his new cabinet met the needs of the country’s “exceptional situation” and that it would seek to recover stolen funds and fight unemployment. “Every minister in this government is a technocrat minister,” he said, referring to the protesters’ demand for a government of experts, not politicians. But many of the new ministers have clear connections to established parties and to the very politicians the protesters have been rallying against since mid-October. Late Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere to burn tires and garbage and block roads in rejection of the new cabinet. Lebanon is governed according to a complex power-sharing system among the country’s 18 recognized sects. Many of the country’s top politicians have roots as warlords in the country’s hugely destructive 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then, they have become the heads of political parties that largely represent individual sects and provide their constituents with perks, such as access to government jobs. But as Lebanon’s finances have constricted, that system has broken down, leading protesters to call for the ouster of the traditional political leadership and the sectarian system itself. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that to effectively face Lebanon’s current problems, a new cabinet would have to be able to take on the established politicians while providing wins to protesters — a tall order. “For me at least, it is not a government that will be able to do stand up to the warlords,” she said. “And at the same time, it is not a government that will inspire confidence with the protesters.” If it fails on those two counts, Ms. Slim said, “then I don’t know what this government will deliver except for more stalemate.” Analysts say that to prevent a wider collapse, the government must take decisive measures that could prove painful to the population, such as imposing capital controls on dollars, cutting the government budget and slimming down the civil service. Such onerous reforms would be even more difficult without buy-in from the population, analysts say. The new cabinet most likely does not have that, because the agreement that brought on Mr. Diab as prime minister relied on Hezbollah and its allies while excluding other key politicians, such as Saad Hariri, the former prime minister, who is often seen as the top representative of the country’s Sunni Muslims. Mr. Hariri resigned on Oct. 29. While the new premier is also a Sunni, he lacks broad support among his sect, and that may take away from his cabinet’s legitimacy. Many of the new ministers were little known beforehand or had backgrounds that did not clearly relate to the ministries they are supposed to lead. The new defense minister, for example, has no military experience. But making Lebanon a rarity in the Arab world, six of the ministers are women, including those for defense, justice and labor. Members of the cabinet were expected to meet on Wednesday to draft a political program to present to Parliament in hopes of getting the vote of confidence required to take office. It was not immediately clear when the vote would take place. In comments to the news media on Wednesday, some of the new ministers asked the country to give them time to work and appealed for unity. “I am not going to deal with politics,” Ghazi Wazni, the new finance minister, told a local television station. “My role is to restore confidence. We have big challenges. We need everybody’s support, and outside support.”']","The new ministers will immediately face a falling currency, a stagnant economy and angry street protests."
Starving Lions in Sudan Spur Campaign to Save Them,2020-01-22,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['The lions, held in cages in a park in the capital of Sudan, limp weakly in the photos and videos circulating on social media. Their bones protrude from their skin. They are clearly malnourished. The plight of the five starving animals in Al-Qureshi Park in Khartoum has riveted global attention in recent days and drawn an outpouring of efforts to help them. But it has also brought into sharp focus the state of the African nation they call home but that can’t seem to care for them during a crucial transitional period. The country is in the midst of political and economic turmoil after the ouster of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir in April, following protests prompted by escalating food prices and a cash crisis. Because of the fragile economy, about 9.3 million of the population of 43 million require humanitarian assistance in 2020, according to the United Nations. But ordinary Sudanese have stepped in to help after the condition of the beasts — a mix of male and female — was first highlighted by Osman Salih, a Sudanese national who on Sunday visited the park, which is run by the Khartoum municipality. “I was shocked,” Mr. Salih wrote on Facebook, noting the state of “hunger and neglect” in which the lions lived. Officials did not say why the animals weren’t being fed, but Mr. Salih noted in his post that the authorities had suggested they weren’t able to care for them because of a lack of resources. Within hours of Mr. Salih’s post, the Sudanese authorities, park officials and local residents responded, providing urgently needed medicine and food. The case was publicized under the hashtag #SudanAnimalRescue. The response has so far alleviated the lions’ suffering, with some of them responding to medication and finishing meat they were fed. Mr. Salih said in another Facebook post, however, that one of the sick lionesses died on Monday. Katharina Braun, a spokeswoman for the animal welfare organization Four Paws, which has its headquarters in Vienna, said in a statement that the group was “closely monitoring” the situation and was seeking approval from the national authorities to send in veterinarians and wildlife experts. There is no available data on the number of lions in Sudan, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists African lions as a “vulnerable” species, with an estimated 20,000 alive today across the continent. Sudan is in a transitional period after having faced protracted economic decline in recent years, especially after the secession of South Sudan in 2011, which took crucial oil revenues with it. Years of economic mismanagement under Mr. al-Bashir also precipitated an economic crisis in 2018 that featured double-digit inflation growth, a tripling of bread prices and street protests across towns and cities. In December, Mr. al-Bashir was convicted of corruption and sentenced to two years in detention. The Sudanese attorney general also opened investigations into the crimes committed under Mr. al-Bashir’s rule in the western Darfur region, where 300,000 people were killed and some 2.7 million were forced from their homes, according to the United Nations. Following a landmark power-sharing agreement last August between the military and civilian leaders that aims to oversee elections in three years, the northeast African state is now led by a transitional government. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s administration has undertaken important economic, political and social reforms aimed at opening up the country and fulfilling the demands of pro-democracy protesters. In December, the Trump administration said it would send an ambassador to Khartoum for the first time in 23 years. But the United States still keeps Sudan on a list of state sponsors of terrorism — a move that has crippled the economy and made the country ineligible for debt relief and financing from global institutions like the World Bank. The designation has also affected the relief effort to support the lions, Mr. Salih said. The crowdfunding site GoFundMe suspended a campaign to aid the lions, noting that it was raising funds for a cause in a country still under American sanctions. GoFundMe did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, and Mr. Salih could not be reached for comment. In a video posted on Facebook on Tuesday, he said the campaign was looking for “secure” ways to receive funds without “breaking any rules local or international.” Besides praising the global outpouring of support, he commended the Sudanese public for its assistance during times of turmoil. “It’s really special to see local citizens getting together to help especially in the current climate we are in,” Mr. Salih wrote. “Sudan is still in recovery mode. We just came out of a revolution. We have a new transitional government. Inflation has hit Sudan really bad. Everything has skyrocketed. Normal people cannot afford to eat these days,” he said. “Despite that, people are coming together and looking for solutions.”']","Images show the lions, held in cages in Khartoum, with their bones protruding from their skin."
"Wuhan, Center of Coronavirus Outbreak, Is Being Cut Off by Chinese Authorities",2020-01-22,By Amy Qin and Vivian Wang,"['BEIJING — Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan — a city of more than 11 million people and the epicenter of a pneumonia-like virus that has spread halfway around the world —\xa0by canceling planes and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. The announcement, shared on Chinese state media just hours before it was to take effect, was a significant escalation from just the day before, when the authorities had urged people not to travel to or from the central Chinese city but had stopped short of shutting down transportation. The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 570, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. In recent days, governments around the world have introduced special screening measures at ports of entry, and the World Health Organization is weighing the declaration of an international emergency. The Chinese authorities said that the measures in Wuhan were needed to “effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people.” They said they would later announce an end date for the restrictions. The news spread quickly. On Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media site, the hashtag #WuhanLockdown was the top trending topic, with more than 1.6 million views. Chinese users left comments on the government’s announcement expressing support for the lockdown and concern for the residents of the city. “Go Wuhan,” several posted. Others wondered how sick residents would get from their homes to hospitals without public transportation. Some who said they lived in Wuhan asked what would happen to them. “Who will think of the lives of those of us who are healthy in Wuhan? We are also afraid,” wrote one user, who described herself as a designer living in Wuhan. “Even before the city was closed, we protected ourselves and hid at home. Now we are lambs who will still be slaughtered, and we can only leave our fates to the heavens.” Extreme measures during outbreaks have been imposed elsewhere before. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, Sierra Leone ordered everyone in the nation to stay home for three days as the authorities went door-to-door checking for new cases, retrieving dead bodies and trying to stop the disease from spreading further. In Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, a sprawling neighborhood with tens of thousands of people was put under strict quarantine by the government and guarded by police officers in riot gear, setting off violent clashes with penned-in residents. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, anyone in China who displayed symptoms of the disease was hospitalized, and students were examined daily. In Singapore, people suspected of having SARS were confined to their homes and monitored with webcams and electronic bracelets. Still, medical experts were startled by the scale of the shutdown in Wuhan, which has more people than the entire country of Sierra Leone. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that a city the size of Wuhan has “tens of thousands of connections with the outside world that are coming and going all the time, bringing food and medicine.” ”The complexity and downside cost of that will be potentially very high,” Dr. Inglesby said. Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data analyzed by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. The city is the hub of industry and commerce in central China, home to the region’s biggest airport and deep-water port and sometimes known as the Chicago of China. It is popular among tourists for its colonial architecture, spicy noodles and proximity to the Yangtze River. In the short term, the sudden restrictions could upend the travel plans of millions of Chinese citizens, who travel in huge numbers during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Friday. The government said it would close Wuhan’s airport and train stations to departures, and it urged residents not to leave the city — a major transportation hub —\xa0unless they had an urgent reason to do so. The Lunar New Year in China is typically the world’s largest annual migration of people, with hundreds of millions of travelers fanning out across the country and the world, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent on hotels, restaurants and shopping. Before the virus emerged, the Chinese government had estimated that domestic travelers would make three billion trips over the holiday period, also known as the Spring Festival. But with the new coronavirus, the mass migration is also an epidemiologist’s nightmare. On Wednesday, a senior Chinese health official delivered a stark warning: The tide of travel during the holiday would make it more difficult to contain the outbreak. In addition, “the possibility exists that the virus could mutate, and there are risks that the epidemic could spread further,” said the official, Li Bin, a deputy head of China’s health commission. Chinese officials had already classified the virus as a class B infectious disease, a category that includes SARS. Before the transportation shutdown, the Wuhan government had also issued a ban on large public gatherings and performances at hotels and sightseeing destinations. They had announced that all locals were required to wear masks in public to help prevent the spread of the virus. Tour companies had promised penalty-free refunds for hotel bookings and air and train tickets to and from the city. Travel operators had suspended itineraries with stops there. Outside of Wuhan, many Chinese have also already canceled travel plans, forgoing vacations and what for some is their only chance to return home for family reunions during the year.  “After we heard how bad the situation was on Monday, we held a family meeting and decided that it just wasn’t worth the risk,” said Yan Chaowei, 32, a Shanghai resident who was planning on taking a seven-hour bullet train to her family home in southeastern Jiangxi Province. “It just wouldn’t be a relaxing trip, especially with a small child,” she added. “When we finally made the decision to stay home, we sighed with relief.” For Chinese companies, the outbreak could deal yet another blow at a time of slowing economic growth. According to official estimates, Chinese spent $74 billion on travel and $145 billion on shopping and food during the Spring Festival holiday last year.  But this week, the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, said that all travel by tour groups between Wuhan and Taiwan would be suspended. North Korea also temporarily banned foreign tourists, many of whom come from China, according to a leading tour operator. Some international health experts, including the World Health Organization, have praised the Chinese government’s response as timely. But the government, particularly in Wuhan, has drawn public criticism at home for what some see as a delay in the reporting of cases that evoked the memory of the SARS outbreak, in which the Chinese government withheld critical information. A top committee of the ruling Communist Party warned officials on Tuesday in a social media post that anyone who sought to hide infections would be “forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.” And new cases were continuing to emerge. In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning that the Mexican health authorities had identified a possible case in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The patient was “under observation,” the president said during a news conference. Gloria Molina, the health secretary for the state of Tamaulipas, said that the patient is a 57-year-old researcher in a university biotechnology laboratory who had visited Wuhan recently and works in Reynosa, a border town near McAllen, Texas. Despite the spread of the virus, some experts are urging the public to remain calm. “This is a SARS-like event but not as severe as SARS,” said Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious disease program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “During an outbreak like this from an unknown pathogen, overreacting might be better than underreacting, but we still have to be realistic.” Zhu Niancheng, 19, a chemistry major at a university in Wuhan, appeared to be heeding that advice on Wednesday as he sat on a suitcase outside a Beijing train station smoking a cigarette. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to Wuhan,” he said, as a phalanx of People’s Liberation Army soldiers in green uniforms and black face masks marched behind him. Asked if he was concerned about his classmates back in Wuhan, the teenager laughed and said, “I’m not really afraid. We just make fun of each other on WeChat, like ‘Yo, you still alive?’” Amy Qin reported from Beijing and Vivian Wang from New York.

Starving Lions in Sudan Spur Campaign to Save Them,2020-01-22,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['The lions, held in cages in a park in the capital of Sudan, limp weakly in the photos and videos circulating on social media. Their bones protrude from their skin. They are clearly malnourished. The plight of the five starving animals in Al-Qureshi Park in Khartoum has riveted global attention in recent days and drawn an outpouring of efforts to help them. But it has also brought into sharp focus the state of the African nation they call home but that can’t seem to care for them during a crucial transitional period. The country is in the midst of political and economic turmoil after the ouster of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir in April, following protests prompted by escalating food prices and a cash crisis.

"China Expands Virus Lockdown, Encircling 35 Million",2020-01-23,By Chris Buckley and Javier C. Hernández,"['WUHAN, China — The authorities drastically expanded a travel lockdown in central China on Thursday, essentially penning in more than 35 million residents to contain a deadly virus that is overwhelming hospitals and fueling fears of a pandemic. The new limits — abruptly decreed ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season — were an extraordinary step that underscored the ruling Communist Party’s deepening fears about the outbreak of a little understood coronavirus. It has killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 800 in China and at least six other countries, including the United States, according to statistics from health officials. In Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital of 11 million where the outbreak began, anxiety and anger prevailed as worried residents crowded into hospitals and teams of medical workers in hazmat suits sought to identify the infected. “They can’t take proper care of all the people here,” said Sun Ansheng, a man in his 50s who was waiting outside a hospital while his wife was tested for the coronavirus, so named because of the spiky halo around the microorganism. “The city government told us there was a virus, but they didn’t explain enough what we should do,” Mr. Sun said. “They left it sounding too minor. Now look.” Even as the Chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions — blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put — experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity. The updated death toll, announced early Friday by Chinese officials, jumped by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours. The World Health Organization’s emergency committee, meeting in Geneva on Thursday for the second consecutive day, said it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would reconvene in 10 days or less to reassess the outbreak. The images in Wuhan offered a jarring contrast to the attempts by Chinese leaders in Beijing to project confident composure. President Xi Jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in Beijing to the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests. Even so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across China, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. In Beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the Forbidden City. On Thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, the industrial city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to Wuhan, leaving thousands of people stranded. Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents. And by Friday, restrictions had extended to Xiantao and Qianjiang, two other cities that include large rural populations. “This was a very difficult choice,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan and the other locked-down cities, told Chinese state television. “Although Wuhan has taken a series of measures to ease things, there are certainly many hardships.” An announcement Friday in the Hubei Daily, the province’s official newspaper, indicated that the restrictions could vary from city to city. In Zhijiang, one of the cities listed, shops and businesses were ordered to close, except for supermarkets, food markets, and other ones essential for daily life. Some residents in Wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints. “It’s serious, but not that serious,” said Wang Mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the Wuhan Railway Station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in Henan Province for the Lunar New Year celebrations. “If we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver,” he said. Anger and frustration spread among Wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. Most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. But many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles. “I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” said Yang Lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.” Several residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted. Doctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. Some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases. “The government did not fulfill its duty,” Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. “They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.” The Wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late. Experts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside China, as many infected people had already left Wuhan. “The horse is already out of the barn,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who had assisted the Chinese authorities in the response to SARS. In an unusually blunt rebuke, Dr. Guan Yi, a prominent Hong Kong scientist who also assisted in the SARS crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to Wuhan this week. “I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said in an interview published Thursday by the influential magazine Caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.” On Thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the Chinese authorities released details about 18 of the people who had died in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. But the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the Wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the SARS crisis. But they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people. Wuhan sits astride the mighty Yangtze River, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks — usually busy in the holiday season — were mostly shut. Retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty. But cars crowded around seven hospitals across Wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. Some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor. After SARS broke out nearly 20 years ago, the Chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. But the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of SARS and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements. Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that while the current response has benefited from China’s improved technical capabilities since the SARS crisis, “what I find astounding was how the Wuhan authorities consistently downplayed the seriousness of the situation.” The lessons from SARS, he said in an email, were “that it’s important to let the public know and get the public to modify their behavior.” Still, China’s leaders maintained an unruffled face. The Communist Party’s most influential news outlets did not feature the crisis, choosing instead to promote Mr. Xi’s New Year speech and cheery reports about the holiday season. On Thursday, China Central Television, the state broadcaster, treated the situation in Wuhan as a footnote in its evening newscast, one of the most watched television programs in China, airing a roughly one-minute report on the outbreak. Experts said Mr. Xi appeared to be trying to prevent a sense of panic and to limit criticism of the party’s response. “The top priority will be to keep coverage from asking more probing questions about how China’s institutions have responded, questions that might lead to criticism of the government,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a group affiliated with the University of Hong Kong. Some internet users found ways around government censorship to criticize the response by local officials, saying on social media that they worried about a repeat of the SARS crisis. Many said they were also concerned about possible food shortages and higher prices on everyday goods. Mao Shoulong, a professor of public administration at Renmin University in Beijing, said the Wuhan government had made a series of missteps that had eroded public confidence. “They failed the test,” Professor Mao said. “They just copied the SARS situation, making small things turn into a big problem.” Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, and Javier C. Hernández from Beijing. Elsie Chen, Yiwei Wang and Zoe Mou contributed research.']","The new travel restrictions include 12 cities as the death toll climbed to 26.

Lebanon Names New Cabinet Amid Political and Economic Crisis,2020-01-22,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon announced the formation of a new cabinet on Tuesday, breaking a monthslong deadlock with the nomination of 20 new government ministers who will have to address a perplexing mix of political and economic crises. The government is deep in debt, the currency has lost much of its value on the black market and protesters have taken to the streets for more than three months to condemn the country’s political class for years of corruption and mismanagement. It remained unclear whether the new cabinet, which still must be confirmed by the Parliament, could take swift action to prevent an economic collapse or to appease the protesters. In addition, the new government’s support from Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant movement that the United States considers a terrorist organization, could dissuade Western and Persian Gulf nations from coming to Lebanon’s aid. Hassan Diab, an engineering professor and former education minister who was designated prime minister last month, told reporters Tuesday that his new cabinet met the needs of the country’s “exceptional situation” and that it would seek to recover stolen funds and fight unemployment. “Every minister in this government is a technocrat minister,” he said, referring to the protesters’ demand for a government of experts, not politicians. But many of the new ministers have clear connections to established parties and to the very politicians the protesters have been rallying against since mid-October. Late Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere to burn tires and garbage and block roads in rejection of the new cabinet. Lebanon is governed according to a complex power-sharing system among the country’s 18 recognized sects. Many of the country’s top politicians have roots as warlords in the country’s hugely destructive 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then, they have become the heads of political parties that largely represent individual sects and provide their constituents with perks, such as access to government jobs. But as Lebanon’s finances have constricted, that system has broken down, leading protesters to call for the ouster of the traditional political leadership and the sectarian system itself. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that to effectively face Lebanon’s current problems, a new cabinet would have to be able to take on the established politicians while providing wins to protesters — a tall order. “For me at least, it is not a government that will be able to do stand up to the warlords,” she said. “And at the same time, it is not a government that will inspire confidence with the protesters.” If it fails on those two counts, Ms. Slim said, “then I don’t know what this government will deliver except for more stalemate.” Analysts say that to prevent a wider collapse, the government must take decisive measures that could prove painful to the population, such as imposing capital controls on dollars, cutting the government budget and slimming down the civil service. Such onerous reforms would be even more difficult without buy-in from the population, analysts say. The new cabinet most likely does not have that, because the agreement that brought on Mr. Diab as prime minister relied on Hezbollah and its allies while excluding other key politicians, such as Saad Hariri, the former prime minister, who is often seen as the top representative of the country’s Sunni Muslims. Mr. Hariri resigned on Oct. 29. While the new premier is also a Sunni, he lacks broad support among his sect, and that may take away from his cabinet’s legitimacy. Many of the new ministers were little known beforehand or had backgrounds that did not clearly relate to the ministries they are supposed to lead. The new defense minister, for example, has no military experience. But making Lebanon a rarity in the Arab world, six of the ministers are women, including those for defense, justice and labor. Members of the cabinet were expected to meet on Wednesday to draft a political program to present to Parliament in hopes of getting the vote of confidence required to take office. It was not immediately clear when the vote would take place. In comments to the news media on Wednesday, some of the new ministers asked the country to give them time to work and appealed for unity. “I am not going to deal with politics,” Ghazi Wazni, the new finance minister, told a local television station. “My role is to restore confidence. We have big challenges. We need everybody’s support, and outside support.”']","The new ministers will immediately face a falling currency, a stagnant economy and angry street protests."
Mining Executives Face Homicide Charges in Brazil Dam Disaster,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the former president of the Brazil-based mining giant Vale and 15 other people with homicide, faulting them for negligence in a dam disaster that killed at least 259 people a year ago. Those charged include Vale’s former chief executive, Fabio Schvartsman, and other senior officials employed by Vale and by a German firm hired to assess the stability of its dams. They were also charged with environmental crimes, as were the companies. The announcement came days before the first anniversary of one of the deadliest mining disasters in years. The dam in Brumadinho, in the state of Minas Gerais, was built to hold waste from an iron ore mine. When it burst on Jan. 25, 2019, the company cafeteria and other facilities were buried in a torrent of mud. On Tuesday, one of the state prosecutors who brought the charges, William Garcia Pinto Coelho, said Vale had executives systematically hide evidence of safety concerns and retaliated against auditing firms that flagged problems. And the German firm Tüv Süd, Mr. Pinto Coelho said, was compensated for knowingly presenting Vale with misleading reports about the stability of its dams. Prosecutors said they had found evidence that Vale officials knew Brumadinho’s dam was at risk since at least November 2017. It was on an internal list of 10 dams at risk of bursting, they learned. “The goal of these omissions, ultimately, was to avoid any negative impacts to Vale’s reputation that could affect its market value,” Mr. Pinto Coelho said. Tüv Süd and Vale, he said, knowingly took risks “that could cause environmental damage, eventual homicide and deaths.” Federal prosecutors are still conducting their own investigation, which could yield more charges. Mr. Pinto Coelho said that the Brumadinho dam had not been the only one at risk, and that throughout the investigation, prosecutors advocated for action when they learned of other Vale sites deemed unstable. Pierpaolo Bottini, Mr. Schvartsman’s lawyer, said there was no evidence that the former Vale chief had been made aware of concerns about the dam in Brumadinho. “These charges are unfair and incompatible with Fabio’s track record,” Mr. Bottini said. The company said in a statement that it was “perplexed” by the charges announced Tuesday. “Vale trusts that the causes of the rupture will be completely determined and reaffirms its commitment to continue cooperating with the authorities,” the company said. In a statement of its own, Tüv Süd said it was cooperating with the authorities in Brazil and Germany. The company said the causes of the dam bursting “have not been conclusively ascertained.” Vale has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, reconstruction and compensation efforts in Brumadinho. But Alessandra Cristina de Oliveira, a Brumadinho councilwoman, said Tuesday that the city was still reeling. While recovery and reconstruction efforts have brought money and jobs to the town, many residents are fearful the bonanza will run out soon. The mining site, which was a pillar of the local economy, is not expected to reopen. “We don’t have anything that guarantees our survival after this,” Ms. de Oliveira said. “My fear is that we end up with a city that is both sick and bankrupt.” Soon after the dam burst, law enforcement officials said they had found clear evidence that Vale and its partners put profit over safety at mining sites. A similar dam burst at another Vale mine in Minas Gerais in 2015, killing 19 people and causing widespread environmental damage. As evidence of negligence mounted, Vale’s board last March suspended Mr. Schvartsman and other top executives.

‘Abandoned and Forgotten’: Jailed Academic Writes of Despair in Iran,2020-01-21,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — “I am entirely alone in Iran,” she wrote in one letter. “In addition to all the pain I have endured here, I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten.” Those words were written by a British-Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who has been held in an Iranian prison for more than a year — including long stretches of solitary confinement — in a series of letters published by British news outlets this week. Ms. Moore-Gilbert was detained in Iran in September 2018 while attending a conference. She was later convicted of spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison. She is being held in Evin Prison in Tehran in solitary confinement in a high-security wing run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Detailing the harrowing conditions, Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote about her deteriorating health, begged to be released from the wing where she had spent much of her time behind bars and rejected bids by the Iranian authorities to recruit her as a spy. “I have no friends or family here and in addition to all the pain I have endured here, I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten, that after so many times of asking my embassy, I still have no money at all to endure all of this.” The letters, addressed to three Iranian officials, are believed to have been written in Persian between June and December 2019, before being smuggled out of the jail by an intermediary and published by The Times of London and The Guardian. Ms. Moore-Gilbert accused the Revolutionary Guards of “playing an awful game with me.” “I’m taking psychiatric medications, but these 10 months that I have spent here have gravely damaged my mental health,” Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote in a letter dated July 2019. “I am still denied phone calls and visitations, and I am afraid that my mental and emotional state may further deteriorate if I remain in this extremely restrictive detention ward.” The letters were revealed at a time when the already strained relationship between Iran and the West has drastically deteriorated, after the American killing of an Iranian general and subsequent retaliatory strikes from Iran. Ms. Moore-Gilbert is just one of several Westerners and dual nationals being held in Iranian prisons on charges that their families and officials say are unfounded. Ms. Moore-Gilbert, a Cambridge-educated professor in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne, denies the charges against her, as do her colleagues and family. She is being held at the same notorious Tehran prison as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage. Many fear that the women are being used as bargaining chips in the tensions between Iran and the West. Richard Ratcliffe, Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, said that he had seen the letters and that they spoke to the traumatizing conditions faced by those arbitrarily detained in Iran. He urged the British and Australian governments, as well as the broader international community, to take a harsher stance on Iran’s arbitrary detention of foreign nationals. Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a program director at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was detained in Tehran while trying to return to Britain after visiting relatives in Iran with her husband and young daughter. She was accused of plotting to overthrow Iran’s government, a charge her family and the foundation have vigorously denied. Mr. Ratcliffe said that the arrests of his wife, of Ms. Moore-Gilbert and of other foreign nationals were akin to the taking of hostages, adding that governments needed to take a stronger stance to gain their release. “I think the failure by the international community to call out Iran’s hostage-taking for what it is has enabled the growth of this practice,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. “The refusal to see things as they are does not protect the people in the middle of it.” But, he also noted, the priority should be on securing Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s release from solitary detention, which had clearly impacted her mental and physical health. “The only thing that matters is getting her out of solitary confinement,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. “Everything else can wait for another day.” The Australian authorities first confirmed Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s detention nearly a year after her arrest, when it was revealed that a British-Australian blogger and her Australian boyfriend were also being held. The blogger and her boyfriend were released in October in an apparent prisoner swap. In another letter that Ms. Moore-Gilbert wrote to her Iranian case manager, she stated her “official and definitive rejection of your offer to me to work with the intelligence branch” of the Revolutionary Guards. “I am not a spy. I have never been a spy and I have no interest to work for a spying organization in any country,” she wrote, according to The Times of London. She said that she was innocent of all of the charges against her and that she had been the victim of “fabrications and trumped-up accusations.” A spokesman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s case had been raised by Marise Payne, the foreign minister, in a meeting with her Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in India last week. “While we continue to work towards her release, we are doing everything possible in relation to the conditions of her imprisonment,” the spokesman said, according to the newspaper The Australian. Ms. Moore-Gilbert and her family have been receiving consular assistance from the Australian authorities, and the British Foreign Office is working in cooperation with the Australians. She was visited by Australian consular officials in December and January after being denied consular visits in the past, including during the months that her letters were written. The British Foreign Office said in a statement that it remained “extremely concerned about the welfare of British dual nationals detained in Iran,” and noted that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had raised those concerns with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran during a Jan. 9 meeting. The British Foreign Office advises citizens against all travel to Iran, citing a risk of arrest. A request to the Iranian Embassy in London for response to the letters was not immediately answered. Human rights groups and politicians in Australia and Britain expressed outrage after the details of the letters were published. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a tweet on Monday that Ms. Moore-Gilbert had “already been in prison far too long” and urged the Australian government to “ramp up efforts to bring her home.” But Mr. Ratcliffe, along with many other activists who have campaigned for the release of the foreigners, said that he believed the diplomatic back-and-forth had fallen short and that the negotiations had stalled. “What’s going on is a game of chess,” Mr. Ratcliffe said, “where you’ve got innocent people being used.”']","A British-Australian woman, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, was detained in September 2018 while attending a conference.

Mining Executives Face Homicide Charges in Brazil Dam Disaster,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Manuela Andreoni,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the former president of the Brazil-based mining giant Vale and 15 other people with homicide, faulting them for negligence in a dam disaster that killed at least 259 people a year ago. Those charged include Vale’s former chief executive, Fabio Schvartsman, and other senior officials employed by Vale and by a German firm hired to assess the stability of its dams. They were also charged with environmental crimes, as were the companies. The announcement came days before the first anniversary of one of the deadliest mining disasters in years. The dam in Brumadinho, in the state of Minas Gerais, was built to hold waste from an iron ore mine. When it burst on Jan. 25, 2019, the company cafeteria and other facilities were buried in a torrent of mud. On Tuesday, one of the state prosecutors who brought the charges, William Garcia Pinto Coelho, said Vale had executives systematically hide evidence of safety concerns and retaliated against auditing firms that flagged problems. And the German firm Tüv Süd, Mr. Pinto Coelho said, was compensated for knowingly presenting Vale with misleading reports about the stability of its dams. Prosecutors said they had found evidence that Vale officials knew Brumadinho’s dam was at risk since at least November 2017. It was on an internal list of 10 dams at risk of bursting, they learned. “The goal of these omissions, ultimately, was to avoid any negative impacts to Vale’s reputation that could affect its market value,” Mr. Pinto Coelho said. Tüv Süd and Vale, he said, knowingly took risks “that could cause environmental damage, eventual homicide and deaths.” Federal prosecutors are still conducting their own investigation, which could yield more charges. Mr. Pinto Coelho said that the Brumadinho dam had not been the only one at risk, and that throughout the investigation, prosecutors advocated for action when they learned of other Vale sites deemed unstable. Pierpaolo Bottini, Mr. Schvartsman’s lawyer, said there was no evidence that the former Vale chief had been made aware of concerns about the dam in Brumadinho. “These charges are unfair and incompatible with Fabio’s track record,” Mr. Bottini said. The company said in a statement that it was “perplexed” by the charges announced Tuesday. “Vale trusts that the causes of the rupture will be completely determined and reaffirms its commitment to continue cooperating with the authorities,” the company said. In a statement of its own, Tüv Süd said it was cooperating with the authorities in Brazil and Germany. The company said the causes of the dam bursting “have not been conclusively ascertained.” Vale has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup, reconstruction and compensation efforts in Brumadinho. But Alessandra Cristina de Oliveira, a Brumadinho councilwoman, said Tuesday that the city was still reeling. While recovery and reconstruction efforts have brought money and jobs to the town, many residents are fearful the bonanza will run out soon. The mining site, which was a pillar of the local economy, is not expected to reopen. “We don’t have anything that guarantees our survival after this,” Ms. de Oliveira said. “My fear is that we end up with a city that is both sick and bankrupt.” Soon after the dam burst, law enforcement officials said they had found clear evidence that Vale and its partners put profit over safety at mining sites. A similar dam burst at another Vale mine in Minas Gerais in 2015, killing 19 people and causing widespread environmental damage. As evidence of negligence mounted, Vale’s board last March suspended Mr. Schvartsman and other top executives. In November, a Congressional committee investigating the Brumadinho disaster recommended the indictment of 22 company officials. Around the same time, the National Mining Agency announced that it had concluded that Vale hid serious problems it was aware of in mandatory government reports.

Lebanon Names New Cabinet Amid Political and Economic Crisis,2020-01-22,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon announced the formation of a new cabinet on Tuesday, breaking a monthslong deadlock with the nomination of 20 new government ministers who will have to address a perplexing mix of political and economic crises. The government is deep in debt, the currency has lost much of its value on the black market and protesters have taken to the streets for more than three months to condemn the country’s political class for years of corruption and mismanagement. It remained unclear whether the new cabinet, which still must be confirmed by the Parliament, could take swift action to prevent an economic collapse or to appease the protesters. In addition, the new government’s support from Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant movement that the United States considers a terrorist organization, could dissuade Western and Persian Gulf nations from coming to Lebanon’s aid. Hassan Diab, an engineering professor and former education minister who was designated prime minister last month, told reporters Tuesday that his new cabinet met the needs of the country’s “exceptional situation” and that it would seek to recover stolen funds and fight unemployment. “Every minister in this government is a technocrat minister,” he said, referring to the protesters’ demand for a government of experts, not politicians. But many of the new ministers have clear connections to established parties and to the very politicians the protesters have been rallying against since mid-October. Late Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere to burn tires and garbage and block roads in rejection of the new cabinet. Lebanon is governed according to a complex power-sharing system among the country’s 18 recognized sects. Many of the country’s top politicians have roots as warlords in the country’s hugely destructive 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then, they have become the heads of political parties that largely represent individual sects and provide their constituents with perks, such as access to government jobs. But as Lebanon’s finances have constricted, that system has broken down, leading protesters to call for the ouster of the traditional political leadership and the sectarian system itself. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said that to effectively face Lebanon’s current problems, a new cabinet would have to be able to take on the established politicians while providing wins to protesters — a tall order. “For me at least, it is not a government that will be able to do stand up to the warlords,” she said. “And at the same time, it is not a government that will inspire confidence with the protesters.” If it fails on those two counts, Ms. Slim said, “then I don’t know what this government will deliver except for more stalemate.” Analysts say that to prevent a wider collapse, the government must take decisive measures that could prove painful to the population, such as imposing capital controls on dollars, cutting the government budget and slimming down the civil service. Such onerous reforms would be even more difficult without buy-in from the population, analysts say. The new cabinet most likely does not have that, because the agreement that brought on Mr. Diab as prime minister relied on Hezbollah and its allies while excluding other key politicians, such as Saad Hariri, the former prime minister, who is often seen as the top representative of the country’s Sunni Muslims. Mr. Hariri resigned on Oct. 29. While the new premier is also a Sunni, he lacks broad support among his sect, and that may take away from his cabinet’s legitimacy. Many of the new ministers were little known beforehand or had backgrounds that did not clearly relate to the ministries they are supposed to lead. The new defense minister, for example, has no military experience. But making Lebanon a rarity in the Arab world, six of the ministers are women, including those for defense, justice and labor. Members of the cabinet were expected to meet on Wednesday to draft a political program to present to Parliament in hopes of getting the vote of confidence required to take office. It was not immediately clear when the vote would take place. In comments to the news media on Wednesday, some of the new ministers asked the country to give them time to work and appealed for unity. “I am not going to deal with politics,” Ghazi Wazni, the new finance minister, told a local television station. “My role is to restore confidence. We have big challenges. We need everybody’s support, and outside support.”']","The new ministers will immediately face a falling currency, a stagnant economy and angry street protests."

Mystery of the Royal Family of Oudh Unravels a Bit More,2020-01-23,By Ellen Barry and Suhasini Raj,"['For 40 years, a reclusive family in Delhi presented itself as the last surviving heirs to the princely state of Oudh, which once ruled a swath of northern India. The three of them — the mother, and her adult son and daughter — were an incredible story, living in a ruined palace in a forest, a living link to India’s ancient, traumatic past. In November, The Times published an investigation of the family’s true origins, revealing that their claims of royal lineage were in large part invention. They were an ordinary family displaced by Partition, the bloody separation of Pakistan and India in 1947. The Begum, or queen of Oudh, was actually Wilayat Butt, the widow of a Pakistani civil servant. Her son, Prince Cyrus, was actually Mickey Butt; her daughter, Princess Sakina, was Farhad Butt. After the article ran, The Times received hundreds of letters and emails, including a few valuable leads that helped unearth more information about the family. Special thanks to two sharp-eyed readers, Venkat Singh and Iftikhar Drabu, who contacted us with new information. Here is some of what we’ve been able to find out since then. 1) How was this Pakistani family able to return to India, 15 years after Partition? Wilayat Butt and her children were Pakistani citizens, but they used political connections to secure the right to resettle in Kashmir, where she and her husband had family roots, a dogged effort that was documented in a 58-page dossier by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. In petitions starting in 1962, Mrs. Butt argued that she faced persecution in Pakistan because of her political activism. She claimed that her husband, a top official at Pakistan Aviation, was fatally poisoned in 1951; that one of her sons was killed in an “Air Force plane crash”; and that she had suffered “inhuman tortures” at the hands of the authorities after she publicly confronted Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra over the status of Kashmir. “As long as we lived there, our lives, property, future and everything was constantly in danger due to the conspiracy and the policy of the ruling authorities to ruin us, just because of difference in political views,” she wrote. She makes no mention of any connection to the royal family of Oudh. She also omits any mention of her oldest son, who was a decorated officer in Pakistan’s Air Force — a fact that would have unsettled her Indian patrons — and says nothing about the existence of family and property in Pakistan. The dossier suggests Indian officials were split on what to do about the family. “We are of the view that there appear to be no reasonable grounds on which she could base her claim to resettle in the Jammu and Kashmir State,” an Intelligence Bureau official wrote. But she was viewed sympathetically by senior officials in Jammu and Kashmir, including an old friend who had become the state’s leader. In July 1963, the government concluded that Mrs. Butt and her children should be allowed to legally remain in India on a year-to-year basis, “subject to good behavior,” but that they would not receive Indian citizenship. So their legal status was tenuous. 2) Why was she so well-connected politically? Before Partition, Mrs. Butt and her husband had been active in Kashmiri politics, and had struck up a friendship with G.M. Sadiq, who later became the leader of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, said Iftikhar Sadiq, 52, the official’s grandson. She continued her activism in Pakistan, where she argued for Kashmiri independence, and served as president of the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, mentions her in a memoir as an activist who was particularly troublesome to Mr. Bogra, Pakistan’s third prime minister. Mr. Nehru describes her as “a Kashmiri woman by the name of Bhat who did a lot of mischief.” In 1954, she confronted Mr. Bogra at a public event in Karachi and argued with him about Kashmir. Family members said she was subsequently arrested and confined for six months to a mental hospital in Lahore. Some relatives said she received electroshock therapy there. After she left Pakistan for Kashmir, she lived under the patronage of Mr. Sadiq, her old friend. “They used to be very close to the ‘who’s who’ who mattered here in the valley at that time,” his grandson said. “In those days, people used to really care about these bonds. They used to develop them into personal relationships — they would never get rid of them.” 3) When did she first publicly claim she was the Begum of Oudh? The family stayed in Kashmir from 1962 until the early 1970s, living in housing provided by Mr. Sadiq. It was during that time that Mrs. Butt told neighbors she and her children were the heirs to Oudh. She would not allow her children to associate with the neighbors, saying they were royalty and the neighbors were “commoners,” said Sabia Rashid, 56, an ophthalmologist who lived a few doors away. She had even ordered workers to demolish the interior walls of her house so that the children could play cricket inside, Dr. Rashid said. “She looked like the witch from ‘Hansel and Gretel,’” Dr. Rashid said. “She would not talk to anybody. People were scared of her.” She lived with two sons and a daughter, who made no claim to royal lineage, Dr. Rashid said. Her daughter, Farhad, who was then known as Marzia, told neighbors they were a Jewish family who had moved to Kashmir from Iran. The youngest, a boy known as Raza, was the friendliest, and a talented cricketer. Mrs. Butt and the two younger children left Kashmir in the early 1970s. Her departure seemed to coincide with the death of G.M. Sadiq, her patron, in 1971. “I remember my grandaunt saying once, ‘She left, and she never came back, and they never knew where she was,’” Iftikhar Sadiq said. “Maybe she felt she didn’t have anyone to fall back on.” Her older son, known as Assad, remained in the government house in Kashmir in near-complete isolation. Years after the rest of the family left, his body was discovered in a state of decomposition. Dr. Rashid said it was widely believed that, left alone in the abandoned house, he had starved to death. 3) What happened then? Mrs. Butt and her two youngest children relocated to Lucknow, and demanded the restoration of the properties of Oudh. They now called themselves Begum Wilayat, Princess Sakina and Prince Ali Raza. They became objects of pity, said Satya Pal Malik, who was a member of the state parliament in Uttar Pradesh when he went to visit them at the Lucknow train station, “with the belief that they must belong to the royal family.” “Actually, she was the creation of the local press,” Mr. Malik said. “She never told me that she was from the royal family. But to look at and talk, they were good looking. Even the children were very beautiful looking. So it would seem, that yes, they are blue-blooded people.” Eventually, state officials offered the family a house, but Mrs. Butt was haughty and rude, Mr. Malik said, even to those who were trying to assist her. They eventually relocated to a train station in New Delhi. Officials from Uttar Pradesh continued to work on their behalf for permanent housing. Ammar Rizvi, a high-ranking state official who was then with the Congress Party, said he had briefed Indira Gandhi about the case, and that she also felt sorry for them. “She was a very kind, very generous person,” he said. “She said, ‘Ammar, see to it that she is not put to any inconvenience.’” Mr. Rizvi said he was never certain whether there was any basis to the claim, because the family said all their documents had burned in a fire. No one in the government had seen proof. “Maybe some of her relatives might have some relationship, contacts with him, only God knows,” he said “Unless I know for certain, I cannot blame her, and I cannot accuse her, and I cannot pass any verdict. That would be unfair.” He said he lost contact with the family when they were resettled in Malcha Mahal, the ruined 14th-century hunting lodge where they lived until their deaths. Mr. Rizvi said the fate of the family made him profoundly sad. “It’s sort of a psycho case,” he said. “Like Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Psycho.’ They thought themselves to the real successor or heir apparent to the throne of Oudh. That was the tragedy.”']",Times readers and government documents have provided new information about a family who for decades convinced journalists and Indian officials that they were royalty.
"China Expands Virus Lockdown, Encircling 35 Million",2020-01-23,By Chris Buckley and Javier C. Hernández,"['WUHAN, China — The authorities drastically expanded a travel lockdown in central China on Thursday, essentially penning in more than 35 million residents to contain a deadly virus that is overwhelming hospitals and fueling fears of a pandemic. The new limits — abruptly decreed ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season — were an extraordinary step that underscored the ruling Communist Party’s deepening fears about the outbreak of a little understood coronavirus. It has killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 800 in China and at least six other countries, including the United States, according to statistics from health officials. In Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital of 11 million where the outbreak began, anxiety and anger prevailed as worried residents crowded into hospitals and teams of medical workers in hazmat suits sought to identify the infected. “They can’t take proper care of all the people here,” said Sun Ansheng, a man in his 50s who was waiting outside a hospital while his wife was tested for the coronavirus, so named because of the spiky halo around the microorganism. “The city government told us there was a virus, but they didn’t explain enough what we should do,” Mr. Sun said. “They left it sounding too minor. Now look.” Even as the Chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions — blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put — experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity. The updated death toll, announced early Friday by Chinese officials, jumped by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours. The World Health Organization’s emergency committee, meeting in Geneva on Thursday for the second consecutive day, said it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would reconvene in 10 days or less to reassess the outbreak. The images in Wuhan offered a jarring contrast to the attempts by Chinese leaders in Beijing to project confident composure. President Xi Jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in Beijing to the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests. Even so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across China, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. In Beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the Forbidden City. On Thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, the industrial city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to Wuhan, leaving thousands of people stranded. Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents. And by Friday, restrictions had extended to Xiantao and Qianjiang, two other cities that include large rural populations. “This was a very difficult choice,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan and the other locked-down cities, told Chinese state television. “Although Wuhan has taken a series of measures to ease things, there are certainly many hardships.” An announcement Friday in the Hubei Daily, the province’s official newspaper, indicated that the restrictions could vary from city to city. In Zhijiang, one of the cities listed, shops and businesses were ordered to close, except for supermarkets, food markets, and other ones essential for daily life. Some residents in Wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints. “It’s serious, but not that serious,” said Wang Mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the Wuhan Railway Station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in Henan Province for the Lunar New Year celebrations. “If we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver,” he said. Anger and frustration spread among Wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. Most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. But many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles. “I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” said Yang Lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.” Several residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted. Doctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. Some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases. “The government did not fulfill its duty,” Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. “They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.” The Wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late. Experts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside China, as many infected people had already left Wuhan. “The horse is already out of the barn,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who had assisted the Chinese authorities in the response to SARS. In an unusually blunt rebuke, Dr. Guan Yi, a prominent Hong Kong scientist who also assisted in the SARS crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to Wuhan this week. “I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said in an interview published Thursday by the influential magazine Caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.” On Thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the Chinese authorities released details about 18 of the people who had died in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. But the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the Wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported. Experts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the SARS crisis. But they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people. Wuhan sits astride the mighty Yangtze River, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks — usually busy in the holiday season — were mostly shut. Retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty. But cars crowded around seven hospitals across Wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. Some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor. After SARS broke out nearly 20 years ago, the Chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. But the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of SARS and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements. Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that while the current response has benefited from China’s improved technical capabilities since the SARS crisis, “what I find astounding was how the Wuhan authorities consistently downplayed the seriousness of the situation.” The lessons from SARS, he said in an email, were “that it’s important to let the public know and get the public to modify their behavior.” Still, China’s leaders maintained an unruffled face. The Communist Party’s most influential news outlets did not feature the crisis, choosing instead to promote Mr. Xi’s New Year speech and cheery reports about the holiday season. On Thursday, China Central Television, the state broadcaster, treated the situation in Wuhan as a footnote in its evening newscast, one of the most watched television programs in China, airing a roughly one-minute report on the outbreak. Experts said Mr. Xi appeared to be trying to prevent a sense of panic and to limit criticism of the party’s response. “The top priority will be to keep coverage from asking more probing questions about how China’s institutions have responded, questions that might lead to criticism of the government,” said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a group affiliated with the University of Hong Kong. Some internet users found ways around government censorship to criticize the response by local officials, saying on social media that they worried about a repeat of the SARS crisis. Many said they were also concerned about possible food shortages and higher prices on everyday goods. Mao Shoulong, a professor of public administration at Renmin University in Beijing, said the Wuhan government had made a series of missteps that had eroded public confidence. “They failed the test,” Professor Mao said. “They just copied the SARS situation, making small things turn into a big problem.” Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, and Javier C. Hernández from Beijing. Elsie Chen, Yiwei Wang and Zoe Mou contributed research.']","The new travel restrictions include 12 cities as the death toll climbed to 26.

Bulgaria Charges 3 Russian Agents in Poisoning Case,2020-01-23,By Michael Schwirtz,"['Prosecutors in Bulgaria announced criminal charges on Thursday against three Russian spies from a secretive assassination unit for the 2015 poisoning of a prominent Bulgarian arms manufacturer. The three men slipped into the country using fake passports and, according to prosecutors, used an organophosphate poison in an attempt “to deliberately kill” the arms manufacturer, Emilian Gebrev, along with his son and a top executive in his company. Though the victims survived, the poisoning in central Sofia, Bulgaria’s capital, endangered the lives of numerous people, the Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. Prosecutors released few details about the Russian spies on Thursday. But an investigation published in The New York Times last month identified them as operatives from Unit 29155, an elite group within Russia’s military intelligence agency that carries out assassinations and disruption operations in Europe. Members of the unit have also been involved in an attempted coup in Montenegro and an operation in Moldova, as well as the poisoning in 2018 of a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in the English town of Salisbury. The Skripal poisoning touched off a geopolitical showdown between Russia and the West that continues to reverberate. In response, more than 120 Russian diplomats were expelled from the European Union and the United States, and Britain filed criminal charges against two operatives later identified as officers with Unit 29155. Bulgaria had initially been reluctant to confront Russia, though experts and officials say Russian spies often use Bulgaria as a staging ground for operations throughout Europe. The Bulgarian government declined to expel any diplomats in the wake of the Skripal poisoning and had closed the inquiry into the Gebrev poisoning years earlier because of a lack of evidence. But after the British presented evidence of Unit 29155’s activities on Bulgarian soil, the authorities there reopened the case. The Times identified six operatives from Unit 29155 who appear to have been involved in the operation to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others. The three charged on Thursday arrived in Bulgaria shortly before Mr. Gebrev fell ill at a dinner with business partners in late April 2015. Though the men were not named by prosecutors, using travel information, The Times was able to identify them by their aliases: Sergei Fedotov, Sergei Pavlov and Georgi Gorshkov. (The operatives using the names Fedotov and Pavlov were also involved in overseeing and planning the Skripal poisoning, according to European security officials.) In Sofia, the operatives checked into a hotel near Mr. Gebrev’s offices and insisted on rooms with windows facing the entrance of an underground parking garage, investigators said. One of the men then slipped into the garage, and, according to grainy surveillance video, appears to smear a substance on the door handles of cars belonging to the victims. That was just the first poisoning. Investigators say that after failing to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others, Mr. Fedotov and another operative returned a month later and poisoned him and his son again while they were convalescing at their home on the Black Sea. Again, they failed to kill their victims, though Mr. Gebrev says his business continues to suffer. In the statement on Thursday, the Prosecutor General’s office said European arrest warrants and Interpol red notices — requests that other countries arrest suspects — had been filed for the three men involved in the first poisoning. It is not clear whether investigators plan to charge the other men involved in the operation. The Kremlin is unlikely to hand over its operatives to face prosecution. After Britain announced charges against the two officers accused of involvement in the Skripal case, the men went on Russian state television to explain that they were merely sports nutritionists who had visited Salisbury to tour its famous cathedral. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment, though in the past he has dismissed reporting on Unit 29155 as “pulp fiction.” At times, though, Mr. Putin, who signed a law in 2006 allowing Russian operatives to carry out assassinations abroad, has been less equivocal. When asked last month about Russian involvement in the assassination of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin last year, he pointedly declined to deny it, calling the victim “an absolutely bloodthirsty murderer.”']","The trio, members of a secretive group within Russia’s military intelligence agency, are accused of trying to kill an arms dealer, his son and one of his top executives in 2015."
"China’s Battle With a Deadly Coronavirus, in Photos",2020-01-23,By The New York Times,"['The spread of a mysterious respiratory virus has prompted the authorities to limit travel in cities in China, including Wuhan, where the disease was first found last month.

Ex-President of Interpol Is Sent to Prison for Bribery in China,2020-01-21,By Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — A former senior Chinese police official who also served as president of Interpol was sentenced on Tuesday to 13 and a half years in prison for bribery, in a case that his wife has denounced as stemming from a political vendetta. When the official, Meng Hongwei, was elected president of Interpol, the French-based international body that provides global coordination in fighting crime, in 2016, the appointment raised fears among rights groups that China would use the connection to abuse the organization’s powers. But two years later, Mr. Meng disappeared abruptly on a return visit to China, whose ruling Communist Party later disclosed that he was under investigation. On Tuesday, a court in Tianjin, a port city in northern China, found that Mr. Meng had taken bribes worth more than $2 million from 2005 to 2017, when he was rising in China’s domestic security apparatus. The judgment, and the lengthy prison sentence, followed a one-day trial in June last year. An online report about the sentencing from China’s main state broadcaster, CCTV, said, “Meng Hongwei told the courtroom that he accepted the court’s judgment and would not appeal.” The judges took competing factors into consideration, according to the report. On the one hand, Mr. Meng had “truthfully confessed to all the facts of the crimes,” it said. On the other, the report said, the Chinese authorities have been unable to recover all the money that they say Mr. Meng took in return for business opportunities, promotions and other favors. Chinese news coverage of Mr. Meng’s trial last year showed him as a humbled figure, gray-haired and overshadowed by two hulking guards. His imprisonment is likely to be promoted by China’s state media as proof that President Xi Jinping remains committed to his anticorruption campaign, which has seen a number of powerful figures jailed. Mr. Meng’s wife, Grace Meng, has rejected the allegations against her husband and, unusually for the spouse of a senior Chinese official, sought protection abroad. She has stayed in France since his detention. Ms. Meng accompanied her husband to France when he became president of Interpol, a traditionally ceremonial post that he tried to turn into a position of real power, according to The Wall Street Journal. When Mr. Meng disappeared in China, his wife raised the alarm and later went public with accusations that he was the victim of Mr. Xi’s drive for power. “I think the anticorruption campaign in China has already been damaged,” she told the British newspaper The Guardian. “It has become a way of attacking people who are your enemy.” Ms. Meng did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the sentence, and neither did her lawyer. Before his downfall, Mr. Meng, 66, had been one of China’s most prominent police officials. As Interpol’s president, he was part of Mr. Xi’s effort to expand Beijing’s influence. Mr. Meng served concurrently as a vice minister of public security; before that, he oversaw the Chinese Coast Guard and led a counterterrorism office. After taking power as head of the Communist Party in 2012, Mr. Xi started an increasingly fierce campaign against official corruption and disloyalty, and the Chinese domestic security service was a focus of that drive. Zhou Yongkang, once the seemingly untouchable head of the Communist Party’s law-and-order apparatus, was sentenced in 2015 to life in prison for corruption. Li Dongsheng, who like Mr. Meng was a vice minister of public security, was sentenced in 2016 to 15 years in prison for taking bribes. For a while, Mr. Meng had appeared to enjoy Mr. Xi’s confidence. In 2017, Mr. Xi gave the opening address at an Interpol meeting in Beijing presided over by Mr. Meng, declaring that “China is willing to share its experience in security governance with every country in the world.” Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.']","Meng Hongwei, once a high-ranking Chinese police official, was sentenced to 13 and a half years.

E.U. Farm Chief Pledges to Tackle Corruption in Subsidy Program,2020-01-23,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — The European Union’s new top agricultural official promised on Thursday to introduce anticorruption measures in response to a New York Times investigation that revealed how the bloc’s huge farm subsidy program underwrites a system of political patronage and land grabbing. The $65-billion-a-year fund is one of the world’s largest subsidy schemes. The money, which many farmers regard as a birthright and which dates to the founding of the European Union, has helped transform the continent into a dominant agricultural producer. But the Times investigation showed how populist far-right politicians have used the program to enrich themselves and their political allies at the expense of small farmers. It also showed how the program has contributed to devastating environmental problems — among them rising greenhouse gas emissions, polluted rivers and sharp reductions in bird populations. The bloc’s new agricultural commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, told members of the European Parliament on Thursday that he would work to tighten controls. “I would like to introduce a list of preventive anticorruption measures,” he said. He was responding to a question about the Times investigation from Francisco Guerreiro, a European lawmaker from Portugal. Mr. Wojciechowski’s response, if short on specifics, signaled that top officials in Brussels are considering direct steps to combat corruption in the subsidy program. European officials had previously said that it was up to national leaders — including those who have manipulated and benefited from the subsidies — to institute reforms or crack down on abuses. The Times tracked at least $49 million in subsidies to companies controlled by Prime Minister Andrej Babis of the Czech Republic, for example. And reporters mapped government farmland sales in Hungary that made the family and friends of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, eligible for millions of dollars in subsidies. Despite such problems, any significant changes proposed by Mr. Wojciechowski are likely to be hotly contested. Some of the European lawmakers who write the subsidy policy also benefit personally from the program, a situation that is allowed by Europe’s weak and murky conflict-of-interest rules. Cracking down will also be difficult because much of the abuse documented by The Times can be traced to the subsidy formula itself. The European Union pays farmers based on how much land they control, a system that encourages farmers to acquire more and more property. In Hungary, leaders have doled out huge swaths of government-owned farmland, making the new owners eligible for subsidies. In Bulgaria, a handful of grain barons receive most of the subsidies. Slovakian farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for farmland. These sorts of abuses are typically left to the national governments to police. Just this month, Italian officials arrested 94 people suspected of being involved in a Mafia scheme to make millions from European farm subsidies. Mr. Wojciechowski reiterated his office’s longstanding support for a subsidy cap, a measure intended to reduce the amount of subsidies that go to the biggest farmers. Currently, about 80 percent of subsidies go to the wealthiest 20 percent of recipients. But such a change would need approval from national leaders, many of whom are organizing against it. “I think large farms — at some level this is more of an enterprise than a farm, so financing such holdings should be limited,” Mr. Wojciechowski said. “Whether it happens or not, that’s up to member states.” The subsidies are at a crossroads this year as lawmakers in Brussels debate their renewal. European leaders have not said how the farm program fits into their ambitious new environmental agenda, known as the Green Deal. Agriculture is by far the biggest item in the European budget, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all spending.']","The vow follows a New York Times investigation showing how one of the world’s largest subsidy programs enriches far-right leaders, bankrolls oligarchs and underwrites Mafia tactics."

Lawyers for Harry and Meghan Warn British Media Over Photos,2020-01-22,By Ian Austen and Megan Specia,"['OTTAWA — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, may have hoped that by relinquishing their official duties as members of the royal family and moving to Canada, they would escape the scrutiny of the British press. But even before they have picked a permanent place to live in Canada, the couple has been followed by press photographers who use telephoto lenses and all possible methods, including subterfuge, to capture potentially valuable images of them in private moments for Britain’s tabloid press. Now lawyers representing the couple, known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have sent a letter to some British news outlets threatening legal action over the purchase and publication of photos of Meghan walking with her infant son, Archie, in a public park near a house the couple has rented in an exclusive suburb of Victoria, British Columbia. The letter, addressed to the Daily Mail and The Sun tabloids, was sent by Schillings, a law firm that is also representing Meghan in a separate legal case against another British tabloid, the Mail on Sunday. The lawyers say the photographs, taken while the duchess was walking the family’s dogs, were made by photographers hiding in bushes. The letter took special issue with the commentary around the pictures that suggested they had been taken with Meghan’s consent. [Update: Prince Harry and Meghan exit Britain with final official engagement.] Other photographers, the letter said, have tried to take pictures of the couple through windows when they were inside the house in North Saanich, and some have set up camp outside the home. The letter also expressed concerns for the safety of the pair because of the way the paparazzi were driving. After the letter was sent on Tuesday, both the Daily Mail and The Sun  posted additional photos of Meghan’s walk in the park, mostly slight variations. The Mail also offered a video that, among other things, criticized Meghan’s baby holding technique and estimated the cost of her clothing. The Mail did not respond to a request for comment about the letter. A spokeswoman for The Sun’s parent company, News Group, said she was unable to immediately comment. The letter is a latest skirmish in a long-running privacy battle between the British royal family and the country’s press. Last year, Prince Harry compared the treatment of his wife by tabloids to the experience of his mother, Princess Diana, who was constantly followed by paparazzi particularly after her marriage to Prince Charles collapsed. She died in Paris in 1997, after her car crashed while trying to escape photographers. Prince Harry began legal proceedings against two of the tabloids, The Sun and The Daily Mirror, in which he claimed their reporters hacked into his voice mail messages. The duchess’s suit against the Mail on Sunday accuses it of breaching her privacy and copyright by publishing the contents of a letter she sent to her father. Last weekend, the couple said they would drop all of their official royal duties, having announced that they intended to divide their time between Britain and Canada while no longer using British government money set aside for the royal family. Unlike the British press, Canadian news media outlets generally avoid publishing photos of celebrities or politicians — including of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — in private situations. The Times Colonist, the newspaper in Victoria, held back reporting that the Sussexes were in town for a Christmas holiday until it had ended. “The separation of Harry and Meghan from the royal family is big news around the world,” Dave Obee, the newspaper’s editor and publisher wrote in column. “Their connection to our island is worthy of note, but their day-to-day existence here is not. Let them be.” The owner of a water taxi service in North Saanich told a local television station that he refused to carry three British photographers out to the waterfront home rented by the duke and duchess. “Hard to turn down business but most importantly I have to live with myself,” the taxi service owner, Miles Arsenault, said. Recent coverage of their changed roles and move to Canada has been largely illustrated with photographs of their appearances at official events. In Canada, where Prince Harry rejoined the duchess on Tuesday, privacy law is mostly a provincial matter. David Elder, a privacy law specialist with Stikeman Elliott, said the couple could bring a lawsuit under British Columbia’s Privacy Act over photos taken without their consent. But he added that the legislation contains many exemptions intended for news media, as does Canada’s constitution, and that Canadian courts have generally ruled that people in public places and public figures have little expectation of privacy. Any lawsuit by the couple in Canada, he said, “is unlikely to be a slam-dunk and, in fact, may be a difficult claim to make out successfully.” Ian Austen reported from Ottawa, and Megan Specia from London.']","Pictures of the former Meghan Markle carrying her son, Archie, were published in British publications."
"Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul",2020-01-22,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — On a recent evening, Amar Sitayeb squeezed behind a tiny counter at the minimart that he and his older brother Ali have run for more than 35 years in the Marais district of central Paris. A plump gray tabby cat prowled the floor, and faded photos of neighborhood babies, many now grown-ups, were taped to an old cash register. A stream of regulars filed in, grabbing potato chips, gum and soda, and lingering to exchange gossip and pleasantries. One neighbor with the sniffles bought honey and tea. Mr. Sitayeb fished mint for her from a refrigerator. “This should help,” he said. Ten minutes later, she returned and asked for rum. “That’ll attack the cold quicker!” he laughed, pulling a bottle from the shelf. The purchases were mainly an excuse to spend precious moments bantering with the Sitayeb brothers, known to residents around the rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie, a boutique-studded Marais street, as the eyes, ears and unofficial mayors of the area. For soon, the unthinkable is set to happen: On Jan. 31, their store, Au Marché du Marais, will close, swept away in a tide of moneyed gentrification, like nearly every other independent shop and cafe around them. “We know everyone here, we’ve lived our lives with them and we’re sad to leave,” said Ali Sitayeb, a fatherly figure who recently turned 70, but exuded a much younger energy. In place of the daily necessities that his store offers, like toilet paper and freshly squeezed orange juice, he announced, a Princesse Tam Tam lingerie chain would be installed. When I first heard the news, I was stunned. I had settled near the épicerie after moving to Paris in 2000. Since then, an incursion of designer boutiques had accelerated, turning the area into an outdoor shopping arena that draws thousands of visitors. The brothers, who originally came from Morocco, remained steady fixtures throughout, greeting me on my way to work, dispensing witticisms and advice, and peppering me with questions about a succession of American presidents. My neighbors were in mourning. The épicerie was a rare gathering spot, and the brothers, with alert eyes and sunny mustachioed faces, kept vigil over everyone. They held people’s keys and knew all the latest news on marriages, divorces, children, thefts, rivalries, real estate deals — the list goes on. Theirs, however, is a tale of a rapidly changing Paris. And the closing of their shop, on a street where boutiques now sell 585 euro designer sneakers, has sparked angst among residents who see a warning in how big money-backed luxury brands aimed at wealthy tourists are consuming neighborhoods and eroding cultural identity. “This changes everything,” said Eva Beau, a doctor who has lived near the shop for 20 years. “I feel like breaking all of this — it’s too sad,” Dr. Beau added, her eyes brimming with tears as she scrutinized the luxury storefronts. Dr. Beau used to lower a basket with a rope from her fourth-floor apartment, into which the brothers would place coffee and other orders. “The neighborhood doesn’t need more boutiques,” she said. “We need the human contact of people like Ali and Amar.” The brothers had long debated when to retire. When an electrical fire ravaged the shop five years ago, support from neighbors was so strong that they decided to keep going. But then the lingerie chain, run by Fast Retailing, a Japanese retail giant that owns Uniqlo, Theory and Comptoir des Cotonniers, made an advantageous offer for the space. The pattern is playing out in cities across France. From Aix-en-Provence to Reims, Tours and Strasbourg, bakeries, cafes and shops are increasingly being taken over by retail conglomerates with vast financial resources. The stores look like quaint boutiques, yet the money behind them is formidable. Near the Sitayebs’ shop, the Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot clothing chains expanded under the ownership of the American private equity firm KKR before being taken over by the Chinese textile giant Shandong Ruyi. Lacoste and Kooples, which replaced a bakery and bookstore, belong to Maus Frères, Switzerland’s largest privately held retail group. Chanel and LVMH Moët Hennessy opened perfume and makeup stores, intensifying a surge in Marais real estate prices. Adding to the pressure is the rise of late-night convenience stores backed by the supermarket giants Casino Groupe and Carrefour. The increased competition has shuttered scores of corner shops in Paris, many run by immigrants from North Africa. “It’s money that makes the laws,” said Ali Sitayeb’s son, Tariq, 34, who helps run the épicerie but no longer counts on taking over. The Sitayebs left Morocco in the 1970s as teenagers to earn a living as waiters and dishwashers in Parisian restaurants. But they found they could prosper more by operating a convenience mart well past the traditional 7 p.m. closing time of French retailers. When the brothers opened the shop in 1984, François Mitterrand was president, prices were in French francs and the Marais, the historic Jewish quarter of Paris, was evolving from a gritty working-class textile and metal factory district. Butchers and boulangeries honeycombed the area. Yiddish was heard everywhere along the rue des Rosiers. As cafes, bars and artisanal boutiques moved in, the Marais became the center for Paris’s L.G.B.T. community, drawing more visitors and prompting an ever more vibrant makeover. While the Marais had already developed when I arrived, the influx of luxury storefronts has exploded since Europe’s economic and debt crisis ended in 2012, squeezing out residential and L.G.B.T. commerce, and taking over the historic Jewish center. “This used to be a real neighborhood, with families and kids,” Amar Sitayeb said, as crowds of tourists strolled past on a recent weekend. “Now, all that’s disappeared.” Jean Luc Rouillard, 67, a denizen since 1980, chimed in. “The Marais has lost its soul,” he declared. “That’s closing,” Mr. Rouillard said, pointing to a 45-year-old antique shop being dismantled for a luxury hotel. “And that’s closing,” he added, eyeing Au Rendez-Vous des Amis, a neighborhood cafe that had just shuttered to make way for a hamburger joint. “That too,” he continued, nodding to Les Mots à la Bouche, the oldest L.G.B.T. bookseller in the Marais, rumored to be converted soon to a Doc Martens shoe store after the lease became unaffordable. “It’s dramatic,” he said. As locals contemplated the end of an era, they arranged a surprise party for the brothers on a recent weekday at Le Point Virgule, a small comedy theater next to the shop. Neighbors filed in silently: Dr. Beau and her daughter Manon, 21; Vincent Douget, a former chef at the cafe; Henriette Delyfer, an art boutique owner who knew the brothers since she was a child; local police officers who had dropped in regularly to chat over orange juice. At last the brothers arrived. They were speechless at the surprise. Tears misted their eyes. While they were looking forward to spending time with their families, “it’s very hard for us to go,” Amar Sitayeb said. “They were the heart of this area,” said George Fischer, a retiree who has lived next to the shop for two decades. Back at the épicerie, Tariq Sitayeb had prepared a potent rum punch and Moroccan pastries to welcome a growing crowd. Ariel Weil, the mayor of Paris’s 4th arrondissement, appeared and shook Ali Sitayeb’s hand. A circle formed as neighbors lamented the Marais’ latest transformation. “It’s just clothes, clothes, clothes,” Mr. Fischer said. “How is a bra going to replace my orange juice?” “On a personal level I’m sad,” Mr. Weil said. “And as mayor, I’m worried that we can’t find a solution to keep small businesses from leaving.” Ali Sitayeb looked at his watch and sighed. It was his brother’s turn to man the register, and he had to get home to rest. Tomorrow, they would continue the sobering task of winding down the store. “People don’t want things to change,” said Tariq Sitayeb, as his father faded into the dark night. “But a page is turning.”']","An influx of luxury stores is driving out local businesses in the Marais, the historic Jewish and L.G.B.T. center of Paris.

E.U. Farm Chief Pledges to Tackle Corruption in Subsidy Program,2020-01-23,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — The European Union’s new top agricultural official promised on Thursday to introduce anticorruption measures in response to a New York Times investigation that revealed how the bloc’s huge farm subsidy program underwrites a system of political patronage and land grabbing. The $65-billion-a-year fund is one of the world’s largest subsidy schemes. The money, which many farmers regard as a birthright and which dates to the founding of the European Union, has helped transform the continent into a dominant agricultural producer. But the Times investigation showed how populist far-right politicians have used the program to enrich themselves and their political allies at the expense of small farmers. It also showed how the program has contributed to devastating environmental problems — among them rising greenhouse gas emissions, polluted rivers and sharp reductions in bird populations. The bloc’s new agricultural commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, told members of the European Parliament on Thursday that he would work to tighten controls. “I would like to introduce a list of preventive anticorruption measures,” he said. He was responding to a question about the Times investigation from Francisco Guerreiro, a European lawmaker from Portugal. Mr. Wojciechowski’s response, if short on specifics, signaled that top officials in Brussels are considering direct steps to combat corruption in the subsidy program. European officials had previously said that it was up to national leaders — including those who have manipulated and benefited from the subsidies — to institute reforms or crack down on abuses. The Times tracked at least $49 million in subsidies to companies controlled by Prime Minister Andrej Babis of the Czech Republic, for example. And reporters mapped government farmland sales in Hungary that made the family and friends of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, eligible for millions of dollars in subsidies. Despite such problems, any significant changes proposed by Mr. Wojciechowski are likely to be hotly contested. Some of the European lawmakers who write the subsidy policy also benefit personally from the program, a situation that is allowed by Europe’s weak and murky conflict-of-interest rules. Cracking down will also be difficult because much of the abuse documented by The Times can be traced to the subsidy formula itself. The European Union pays farmers based on how much land they control, a system that encourages farmers to acquire more and more property. In Hungary, leaders have doled out huge swaths of government-owned farmland, making the new owners eligible for subsidies. In Bulgaria, a handful of grain barons receive most of the subsidies. Slovakian farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for farmland. These sorts of abuses are typically left to the national governments to police. Just this month, Italian officials arrested 94 people suspected of being involved in a Mafia scheme to make millions from European farm subsidies. Mr. Wojciechowski reiterated his office’s longstanding support for a subsidy cap, a measure intended to reduce the amount of subsidies that go to the biggest farmers. Currently, about 80 percent of subsidies go to the wealthiest 20 percent of recipients. But such a change would need approval from national leaders, many of whom are organizing against it. “I think large farms — at some level this is more of an enterprise than a farm, so financing such holdings should be limited,” Mr. Wojciechowski said. “Whether it happens or not, that’s up to member states.” The subsidies are at a crossroads this year as lawmakers in Brussels debate their renewal. European leaders have not said how the farm program fits into their ambitious new environmental agenda, known as the Green Deal. Agriculture is by far the biggest item in the European budget, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all spending.']","The vow follows a New York Times investigation showing how one of the world’s largest subsidy programs enriches far-right leaders, bankrolls oligarchs and underwrites Mafia tactics."
The Test a Deadly Coronavirus Outbreak Poses to China’s Leadership,2020-01-21,By Javier C. Hernández,"[""WUHAN, China — Facing growing pressure to contain a deadly viral outbreak that has spread halfway around the world, China’s ruling Communist Party raced on Tuesday to confront the disease, slapping restrictions on the city where it started and warning that anyone who hides infections will be “forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame.” The response by the Chinese leadership, which has come under intensifying criticism that it has been slow to acknowledge the severity of the outbreak, came as fatalities from the disease tripled to at least nine. Infections surged from 200 to 440, and global financial markets were rattled by the possibility of a pandemic emanating from the world’s most populous country during the Lunar New Year — Asia’s heaviest travel season. Already, cases of the pneumonia-like virus have been found in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea, and on Tuesday the first was confirmed in the United States. Airports in Atlanta and Chicago said they would screen passengers from Wuhan, joining airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and cities around the world in doing so. North Korea temporarily closed its borders to foreign tours, the vast majority of them from China. The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday over whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency. In Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million where the outbreak began, the authorities have banned group tours out of the city and ordered vehicles checked for live animals. Nervous residents are buying up face masks and flooding hospitals to report fevers and coughs. Some schools are canceling classes and even Buddhist temples are turning away the faithful. At home and abroad, the Chinese authorities are facing demands for greater transparency in their disclosures about the disease, as new cases emerge in other major Chinese cities. As of late Tuesday, there were 440 cases in 13 provinces in China. The outbreak is testing China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and the party’s penchant for secrecy in moments of crisis, 17 years after Beijing drew widespread criticism for withholding information and acting slowly in handling the outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 800 people and infected more than 8,000 worldwide. Mr. Xi, who has sought to expand China’s global influence, seems eager to shake the shadow of SARS and show that Beijing can handle a public health crisis like a responsible world power. A top party committee on Tuesday said in stark terms that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections. “Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history’s pillar of shame,” the committee said in a post on a popular social media site. The post was later deleted. On Monday, China’s health commission said it would respond with measures intended to manage outbreaks of the most virulent diseases, including mandatory reporting of cases. It classified the virus as a class B infectious disease — a category that includes diseases such as SARS. But the government, wary of letting fear run rampant, is also working meticulously to control the narrative about the virus by censoring news articles and social media posts. The police in Wuhan investigated eight citizens this month for spreading what it described as rumors on the internet. Now, even as the government works to isolate sick patients amid travel by millions of people making visits for the Lunar New Year holiday,  there is concern that the party’s long-held reluctance to divulge damaging news could hinder the effort to contain the virus. For weeks, the government had largely treated the outbreak as a problem isolated to Wuhan. It was only after the Hong Kong news media reported that cases of the coronavirus had been detected elsewhere that the government began acknowledging, early Monday, that the disease had spread to other cities. Many wondered why the central government waited until Monday to allow a top health expert to speak publicly about the outbreak. The expert not only corroborated what the Hong Kong news media had already reported but confirmed vital new information: that the virus spreads between people. “The response is not fast enough, it’s not strong enough,” said Shen Zhengjiang, 57, a teacher, as he looked for masks at a pharmacy in Wuhan on Tuesday. “The local officials are paying attention to this now only because Xi Jinping spoke up.” The outbreak presents Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, with one of the most serious public health crises of his tenure. It will be a significant test of his leadership at a time when China is seeking to strengthen trust in the party and to project confidence in Mr. Xi’s authoritarian approach. Any missteps could undermine the party’s credibility in the eyes of the public, experts said. “This is the sort of thing that could absolutely gnaw at the confidence and legitimacy of the whole regime,” said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London. Experts said the challenge for Mr. Xi would be daunting, as the world looks to China to stop the virus before it spreads on a global scale. Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University, said that it appeared Mr. Xi was seeking to show that the virus is under control and would not cause social unrest. But he said the government’s initial failure to detail the spread of the virus to mainland cities and to disclose that medical workers had been infected was worrying. “So far this pattern of a lack of transparency and inaction has unfortunately not changed,” said Professor Huang, an expert on the SARS epidemic. “The politics continue to constrain the government to respond effectively.” The Chinese government, which has been praised by the W.H.O. for its efforts so far, has said it took time to analyze the coronavirus, which experts believe appears to be mostly transmitted to humans by animals. The delay in reporting the spread of the disease was attributed to technological challenges, but also bureaucratic ones. Some hospitals lacked testing kits, according to remarks on Monday by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent scientist who is leading a government-appointed panel of experts helping control the outbreak. The process was also slowed down, he said, because local hospitals were required to submit cases to the central health commission in Beijing for review before going public. For weeks, the authorities in Wuhan seemed to play down the threat posed by the virus. The health department said that it had been found only in people who visited a local market that sold live fish, birds and other animals, and that workers had disinfected and shut down the site. Questions have emerged on Chinese social media about whether the Chinese government has been forthcoming. Many articles and posts, including some using the hashtag #WuhanSARS, were censored. After his stepmother died of viral pneumonia last week, Kyle Hui, 32, an architect from Shanghai, turned to Weibo, a Twitterlike site, to report her case. Mr. Hui’s stepmother was never formally tested for the virus, and he was concerned that the Wuhan government was underreporting cases of the illness. But his post soon disappeared from the internet. “People accuse me of spreading rumors, but I’m just trying to tell my stepmother's story,” he said in an interview at a cafe in Wuhan. It was not until Monday that the government changed course, after news outlets in Hong Kong reported over the weekend that there were several potential cases of the illness in Shanghai and Shenzhen, a southern city. The central government dispatched Dr. Zhong, a renowned expert with a reputation for bluntness, to Wuhan. Dr. Zhong revealed for the first time that the virus could spread from person to person — noting, for example, that one patient had infected 14 medical workers.  Dr. Zhong won wide praise from the Chinese public, and memes circulated online contrasting his urgent tone with the calm words of local officials. The spread of the virus has upended the Lunar New Year holiday this week, when millions of Chinese return to their hometowns to celebrate.  In Wuhan, some residents have canceled plans to go out to lavish meals for the new year and say they are avoiding enclosed spaces like movie theaters. Some firms have instructed employees to stay home. Many people now wear masks throughout the day, as they make dinner, play cards or chat with friends. Some residents are packing up and leaving Wuhan, vowing to stay away until the virus is contained. At the Wuhan airport on Tuesday, Luo Jie, 62, a retiree, rushed to catch a flight to Beijing that she had booked that morning. She said she wanted to “escape” because the outbreak reminded her of the SARS crisis. “I hope the government will report the epidemic honestly,” she said. “That’s how to set people’s minds at ease.” Austin Ramzy and Elaine Yu in Hong Kong contributed reporting. Albee Zhang in Beijing and Elsie Chen in Wuhan contributed research.""]","The new virus has killed at least nine and infected more than 400 people in China, with confirmed cases in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea."
"Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul",2020-01-22,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — On a recent evening, Amar Sitayeb squeezed behind a tiny counter at the minimart that he and his older brother Ali have run for more than 35 years in the Marais district of central Paris. A plump gray tabby cat prowled the floor, and faded photos of neighborhood babies, many now grown-ups, were taped to an old cash register. A stream of regulars filed in, grabbing potato chips, gum and soda, and lingering to exchange gossip and pleasantries. One neighbor with the sniffles bought honey and tea. Mr. Sitayeb fished mint for her from a refrigerator. “This should help,” he said. Ten minutes later, she returned and asked for rum. “That’ll attack the cold quicker!” he laughed, pulling a bottle from the shelf. The purchases were mainly an excuse to spend precious moments bantering with the Sitayeb brothers, known to residents around the rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie, a boutique-studded Marais street, as the eyes, ears and unofficial mayors of the area. For soon, the unthinkable is set to happen: On Jan. 31, their store, Au Marché du Marais, will close, swept away in a tide of moneyed gentrification, like nearly every other independent shop and cafe around them. “We know everyone here, we’ve lived our lives with them and we’re sad to leave,” said Ali Sitayeb, a fatherly figure who recently turned 70, but exuded a much younger energy. In place of the daily necessities that his store offers, like toilet paper and freshly squeezed orange juice, he announced, a Princesse Tam Tam lingerie chain would be installed. When I first heard the news, I was stunned. I had settled near the épicerie after moving to Paris in 2000. Since then, an incursion of designer boutiques had accelerated, turning the area into an outdoor shopping arena that draws thousands of visitors. The brothers, who originally came from Morocco, remained steady fixtures throughout, greeting me on my way to work, dispensing witticisms and advice, and peppering me with questions about a succession of American presidents. My neighbors were in mourning. The épicerie was a rare gathering spot, and the brothers, with alert eyes and sunny mustachioed faces, kept vigil over everyone. They held people’s keys and knew all the latest news on marriages, divorces, children, thefts, rivalries, real estate deals — the list goes on. Theirs, however, is a tale of a rapidly changing Paris. And the closing of their shop, on a street where boutiques now sell 585 euro designer sneakers, has sparked angst among residents who see a warning in how big money-backed luxury brands aimed at wealthy tourists are consuming neighborhoods and eroding cultural identity. “This changes everything,” said Eva Beau, a doctor who has lived near the shop for 20 years. “I feel like breaking all of this — it’s too sad,” Dr. Beau added, her eyes brimming with tears as she scrutinized the luxury storefronts. Dr. Beau used to lower a basket with a rope from her fourth-floor apartment, into which the brothers would place coffee and other orders. “The neighborhood doesn’t need more boutiques,” she said. “We need the human contact of people like Ali and Amar.” The brothers had long debated when to retire. When an electrical fire ravaged the shop five years ago, support from neighbors was so strong that they decided to keep going. But then the lingerie chain, run by Fast Retailing, a Japanese retail giant that owns Uniqlo, Theory and Comptoir des Cotonniers, made an advantageous offer for the space. The pattern is playing out in cities across France. From Aix-en-Provence to Reims, Tours and Strasbourg, bakeries, cafes and shops are increasingly being taken over by retail conglomerates with vast financial resources. The stores look like quaint boutiques, yet the money behind them is formidable. Near the Sitayebs’ shop, the Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot clothing chains expanded under the ownership of the American private equity firm KKR before being taken over by the Chinese textile giant Shandong Ruyi. Lacoste and Kooples, which replaced a bakery and bookstore, belong to Maus Frères, Switzerland’s largest privately held retail group. Chanel and LVMH Moët Hennessy opened perfume and makeup stores, intensifying a surge in Marais real estate prices. Adding to the pressure is the rise of late-night convenience stores backed by the supermarket giants Casino Groupe and Carrefour. The increased competition has shuttered scores of corner shops in Paris, many run by immigrants from North Africa. “It’s money that makes the laws,” said Ali Sitayeb’s son, Tariq, 34, who helps run the épicerie but no longer counts on taking over. The Sitayebs left Morocco in the 1970s as teenagers to earn a living as waiters and dishwashers in Parisian restaurants. But they found they could prosper more by operating a convenience mart well past the traditional 7 p.m. closing time of French retailers. When the brothers opened the shop in 1984, François Mitterrand was president, prices were in French francs and the Marais, the historic Jewish quarter of Paris, was evolving from a gritty working-class textile and metal factory district. Butchers and boulangeries honeycombed the area. Yiddish was heard everywhere along the rue des Rosiers. As cafes, bars and artisanal boutiques moved in, the Marais became the center for Paris’s L.G.B.T. community, drawing more visitors and prompting an ever more vibrant makeover.

The Case of the 5 Missing Dogs: What Happened to the ‘Tamworth 5’?,2020-01-23,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON —\xa0Becky Parsons was in a taxi from Birmingham Airport when her mother called to give her the bad news: The daughter’s two dogs had gone missing. Before traveling to Spain for a vacation, Ms. Parsons had left them in the care of a licensed dog sitter whom she had previously trusted with her pets. But this time around the sitter replied to text messages only “hours and hours later,” she said. And when Ms. Parsons’ mother went to pick up the dogs, the sitter said told her that the animals had disappeared during a walk in the woods. When her mother relayed the news, Ms. Parsons recalled, “Absolute panic washed over me.” On Thursday, Birmingham Magistrates’ Court disqualified the sitter, Louise Lawford, 49, from having custody of a dog for five years and fined her nearly 3,500 pounds (more than $4,500) over animal welfare offenses. Although those offenses did not cover the dogs’ disappearance, the sentencing brought partial closure in a case that has prompted anger and sadness in Britain, even in the absence of criminal charges against her. The case had been brought by Birmingham City Council, which accused her of nine animal welfare offenses, including having too many dogs in her care at one time. The BBC reported last week that her dog-sitting license was also revoked after the dogs went missing. “This is an unusual and upsetting case where license conditions for home dog boarding were flouted,” Vikki Allwood, a senior animal welfare officer with the Council, said after the sentencing. “Ms Lawford put the health and welfare of dogs in her care at risk,” she said of the offenses, which included breaching conditions attached to her license and failing to provide veterinary care for a dog that had a skin infection. “I trust this case has brought some comfort to the owners,” Ms. Allwood said. Several elements of the disappearances, which occurred last June, have piqued widespread interest in Britain. Of particular curiosity is that Ms. Parsons’ dogs — Maddie, a 6-year-old pug mix, and Pablo, a 7-year-old black pug — were not the only dogs to disappear under Ms. Lawford’s care that day. No trace of the animals has been found. Ms. Lawford told the court on Thursday that after separating from her husband in March, she had suffered a nervous breakdown and had made the “foolish decision” to continue looking after dogs, the BBC reported. Ms. Parsons’ mother realized that other dogs were missing when she went to look for Maddie and Pablo in the woods, near the town of Tamworth, about eight miles from Ms. Lawford’s home in central England. During that search, Ms. Parsons said in a telephone interview on Tuesday, the mother met other owners who were also trying to find their pets there. Several of the dogs under Ms. Lawford’s care at the time had health problems: One was blind, another was deaf and a third had a deformed leg. The other two were old or timid. All of which made it hard to believe that they had run away, Ms. Parsons said. She also said that the pet owners had discovered that the woods where Ms. Lawford had claimed to be out walking the dogs were closed for military exercises that day. And she said that Ms. Lawford changed her story about the dogs’ disappearance several times and had since avoided all contact. The owners were stumped, Ms. Parsons said. “We thought maybe she was being blackmailed or they’d been stolen.” That is where the case —\xa0which British news outlets have dubbed the “Tamworth Five” — took a sinister turn. Ms. Parsons said that she received a phone call on July 30 from someone who claimed to be close to Ms. Lawford and said that the dogs were dead. The person said the call was “to put us out of our torture and misery,” Ms. Parsons said. The owners notified the police, but the person who had made the phone call declined to speak to officers. In the absence of any bodies, the owners were told that there was not enough evidence for a criminal prosecution. That left the council in Birmingham, which had issued Ms. Lawford’s license, to pursue the matter. Such stories about pets in Britain tend to get outsize attention in the news media. Reports of the killing and mutilation of hundreds of cats over several years in London provoked intense interest until the mystery was solved in 2018: After a three-year investigation, the police concluded that foxes were to blame. But the case of the Tamworth Five appears far from resolution. April Lock, whose two pugs, Ralph and Charlie, were among the dogs that disappeared under Ms. Lawford’s care, wrote of her anguish on Facebook in August. “When does it get better? When does the pain go?” she posted. “I thought you would get the best care,” she wrote, “and here I am left with nothing but pain and sadness without you both.” Ms. Parsons said she had found the experience traumatic. “It’s been my worst nightmare,” she said.']","After five pets disappeared while in the care of a licensed sitter in central England, their owners went looking for answers."
Holocaust Gathering Lets Some Leaders Score Present-Day Political Points,2020-01-23,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called for vigilance “not to miss when the first sprouts of hatred, of chauvinism, of xenophobia and anti-Semitism start to rear their ugly head.” Prince Charles warned that hatred and intolerance “still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises and still seek new victims.” And Vice President Mike Pence urged world leaders to “stand strong” against Iran — “the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.” As dignitaries from scores of western nations met in Jerusalem to remember the liberation of Auschwitz 75 years ago and express their resolve to combat anti-Semitism, the invocations of the past were as often aimed at scoring present-day geopolitical points as at sounding the alarm about a resurgence of bigotry and anti-Jewish violence. The president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said his country now resists “the poison that is nationalism.” Then he hauntingly cited the attack last fall on a synagogue in Halle, Germany. “I wish I could say that we Germans have learned from our history once and for all, but I cannot say that when hatred is spreading,” he said. “I cannot say that when Jewish children are spat on in the schoolyard. I cannot say that when crude anti-Semitism is cloaked in supposed criticism of Israeli policy. And I cannot say that when only a thick wooden door prevents a right-wing terrorist from causing a massacre, a blood bath, in a synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur.” Mr. Putin, as nationalist as they come, noted that “the Soviet nation was the one that put an end to the Nazis’ malicious plan,” and took credit for the Red Army having “liberated Europe.” Alluding to his war of dueling historical narratives with Poland’s president over their countries’ actions during the Holocaust and roles in the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Putin said that “the memory of the Holocaust will continue being a lesson and a warning only if the true story is told, without omitting the facts.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, like Mr. Pence, did not let the opportunity pass to urge world leaders to follow the United States’ example in confronting Iran. “The tyrants of Tehran that subjugate their own people and threaten the peace and security of the entire world, they threaten the peace and security of everyone in the Middle East and everyone beyond,” he said. In a proud, if slightly bellicose address, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was “eternally grateful” to the Allied powers that defeated Hitler, but noted that during Hitler’s rise, “when the Jewish people faced annihilation, the world largely turned its back on us.” He called Auschwitz “the ultimate symbol of Jewish powerlessness,” adding, “Today, we have a voice, we have a land, and we have a shield,” the Israeli armed forces. “And what a shield it is.” The unusual gathering, with streams of royals and republican rulers all but shutting the Holy City down under high security, comes before Monday’s anniversary of the 1945 liberation of Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi death camp in Poland where some 1.1 million people perished, most of them Jews. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, angered that Mr. Putin was given a speaking slot but he was not, stayed home. But their dispute bled over into a memorial book printed in advance of the commemoration. Mr. Putin has sought to portray Poland as a perpetrator rather than a victim of the Holocaust, claiming the Polish ambassador to Berlin had lauded Hitler’s effort to rid Europe of Jews. In the memorial book, Mr. Duda promised to “always uphold the truth about the tragedy that struck our country.” And Mr. Putin criticized efforts “to distort the truth about the Second World War and rehabilitate the aggressors and their accomplices.” Mr. Putin had a busy schedule on his day trip. He unveiled a monument in Jerusalem’s central Sacher Park to the victims of the siege of Leningrad, a grisly 900-day national trauma that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Russian civilians. And he cheered Israelis by hinting broadly that Russia would soon release an Israeli-American woman who was given a long prison sentence last year after several grams of marijuana were found in her checked bags while she was changing planes in Moscow. The Palestinians were not invited to the Holocaust commemoration, but they were not merely watching from the sidelines. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, met with President Emmanuel Macron of France late Wednesday, and with Mr. Putin Thursday evening. Still, those meetings paled next to what some critics of Mr. Abbas said was the embarrassment of so many leaders visiting Israel, after President Trump in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as its capital. Amer Hamdan, 38, a lawyer and activist in Nablus, said the gathering amounted to “an implicit recognition that Jerusalem is the de facto capital of Israel” and “a catastrophic failure of Palestinian diplomacy.” Prince Charles was to meet with the Palestinian leader in Bethlehem on Friday after visiting the Church of Nativity, and before a stop in East Jerusalem at the Mount of Olives, where his grandmother, Princess Alice, is buried. In his remarks at Yad Vashem, the prince noted that in 1943 his grandmother had taken a Jewish family into her home in Athens, saving them from the Nazis, “a fact which gives me and my family immense pride.” It was left to Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, who at age 8 was liberated from Buchenwald, then rose to become Israel’s chief rabbi and chairman of the Yad Vashem Council, to bring the proceedings back to earth in the end. “Leaders of the world, the world is in your arms, in your hands,” he said, smiling. “With one sentence, one signature, you can decide upon millions of people.

Africa’s Richest Woman Set to Face Charges in Angola Over Embezzlement,2020-01-23,"By Michael Forsythe, Gilberto Neto and Megan Specia","['Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman and the daughter of Angola’s former president, is set to be charged with committing crimes to enrich herself, after an investigation into embezzlement of millions of dollars from a state oil company she once headed, Angolan officials said. Angola’s attorney general, Hélder Pitta Grós, said on late Wednesday that Ms. dos Santos would be charged with “money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management” and “forgery of documents, among other economic crimes” committed when she ran the oil company. “I can say that from the investigation we conducted, we will now move to criminal charges,” Mr. Pitta Grós said, speaking at a news conference in Luanda, the country’s capital. The announcement came days after a trove of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The New York Times revealed Ms. dos Santos’s efforts to profit on business dealings tied to the Angolan government. Those connections helped her build a fortune worth over $2 billion, according to Forbes. The heart of the Angolan investigation involves her tenure at Sonangol, the state oil monopoly, particularly during November 2017, the month she was fired as its chairwoman. More than $57 million was withdrawn at the time from Sonangol’s account at EuroBic — a Portuguese bank where Ms. dos Santos is the biggest shareholder — to pay for a flurry of invoices issued by a Dubai company owned by her friend.  On Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that a EuroBic banker who managed the Sonangol account, Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, had been found dead on Wednesday night at his house in Lisbon. Lusa cited a police source saying it was probably a suicide. Mr. da Cunha’s name appears extensively in the leaked documents as a banker facilitating business for Ms. dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo. The couple increasingly relied on EuroBic, the Portuguese arm of an Angolan lender, as bigger, global banks declined to do business with her. Lenders in the European Union and the United States are bound by rules constraining their ability to work with politically exposed persons and are required to report suspicious transactions to regulators.  The banker’s name is on an email confirming a payment to a Dubai shell company on Nov. 15, 2017. Ms. dos Santos was fired from Sonangol that day, and some of the funds were paid out after the new Angolan president, who had replaced her father, announced her dismissal, the documents show. Ms. dos Santos, 46, speaking to the BBC earlier this month, said the payments were earmarked for firms including the Boston Consulting Group, PwC and McKinsey & Company, with the shell company acting as an intermediary overseeing their work with Sonangol. None of the firms, when asked, would provide billing information to verify her claim.  EuroBic announced on Monday that it was ending its “commercial relationship” with Ms. dos Santos, and would be investigating transfers worth tens of millions of dollars. Ms. dos Santos said in a statement on Thursday that the leaking of the documents, and their subsequent publication, stemmed from “a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.” ""It is an attempt to neutralize me and to discredit the legacy of President dos Santos and his family,” she said. Her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, was president for 38 years until he stepped down in 2017. As scrutiny of Ms. dos Santos increased in recent months, she turned to lawyers and public relations professionals to defend her record. In December, she hired a Washington lobbying firm, Sonoran Policy Group, to set up “meetings and interactions” in the United States and Britain, according to a disclosure the firm filed. That contract, as well as another one signed with the firm on Jan. 2 to work with the media on her behalf, total more than $2 million. Sonoran, founded by the lobbyist Robert Stryk, leapt to prominence in the early days of the Trump presidency when it landed big contracts with foreign governments and leaders — including a Saudi ministry — eager for help navigating the administration, The Times reported in 2017. Ms. dos Santos and several business associates, all Portuguese nationals, would face charges, Mr. Pitta Grós said, adding, “We have enough reasons to prosecute these people.” “At this moment our concern is that they be notified of the charges brought against them, and that they present themselves voluntarily to the court in order for them to be able to defend themselves,” he said.  When asked if his office knew of Ms. dos Santos’s whereabouts, he seemed unsure. “We only know from the social media that she has been living in London and Russia,” he said. Ms. dos Santos owns homes around the world, including in Dubai, Lisbon, London and Monte Carlo.  Álvaro João, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, clarified in a Thursday interview that formal charges had not yet been filed, but were likely, and that they were part of an investigation that began in 2018. “These are not yet formal charges, as investigations continue and if needed we will then charge her and the others,” he said.   Angola has sought help in the corruption investigation from Portugal, where Ms. dos Santos has links to several companies. Mr. Pitta Grós traveled to Lisbon on Thursday to meet with the Portuguese attorney general, according to Portugal’s public service broadcaster, Rádio e Televisão de Portugal. Angola has immense oil and mineral wealth, but many of its people live in deep poverty, without access to basic services, and the country is rife with corruption. The recently leaked documents provide a detailed account of how Ms. dos Santos exploited her country’s resources, acquiring stakes in Angola’s lucrative diamond industry, banks, its leading cement manufacturer and its largest mobile phone company — often through orders signed by her father. She has denied any wrongdoing and has long maintained that she is a self-made woman. Daphné Anglès contributed reporting.']",
"At Holocaust Memorial, a Survivor and Towering Moral Voice Says He ‘Cannot Forgive’",2020-01-23,"By David M. Halbfinger, Isabel Kershner and Katie Rogers","['This briefing has ended. Read about how some of the world leaders gathered in Jerusalem invoked the past to score present-day political points.  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Vice President Mike Pence and the Prince of Wales joined dozens of Western leaders in Jerusalem on Thursday morning at Yad Vashem, the hillside memorial to the Holocaust, for an extraordinary demonstration of resolve to fight anti-Semitism. “We certainly all bear responsibility to make sure that the terrible tragedies of the past should never repeat themselves,” Mr. Putin said. “We have to make sure that future generations remember the horrors of the Holocaust.” “We have to be vigilant not to miss when the first sprouts of hatred, of chauvinism, of xenophobia and anti-Semitism start to rear their ugly head,” he added. The afternoon ceremony recalled the Jan. 27, 1945, liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in occupied Poland where 1.1 million people perished, by Red Army troops. But it drew pointed connections to the resurgence of anti-Semitism across much of Europe and North America. In a proud if slightly bellicose address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “eternally grateful” to the Allied powers that defeated Hitler, but noted that during Hitler’s rise, “when the Jewish people faced annihilation, the world largely turned its back on us.” He called Auschwitz “the ultimate symbol of Jewish powerlessness,” adding, “Today, we have a voice, we have a land, and we have a shield,” the Israeli armed forces. Mr. Netanyahu did not let the opportunity pass to urge world leaders to follow the example of President Trump in confronting Iran. “The tyrants of Tehran that subjugate their own people and threaten the peace and security of the entire world, they threaten the peace and security of everyone in the Middle East and everyone beyond,” he said. It is the biggest political gathering in Israel’s history, and the Holy City was teeming with police officers, with some schools canceling classes and the main highway from the airport closed as motorcades streamed through with arriving heads of state. For Mr. Netanyahu, the presence of so many global chieftains — and the opportunity to meet with them in bilateral talks — was an important boon at an opportune time. Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader, is battling for his political life, awaiting trial on serious corruption charges even as he campaigns for re-election in the third ballot in a year, set to take place on March 2. The previous two elections were inconclusive. His centrist opponent, Benny Gantz, a former army chief, was holding his own meetings, including a morning session with a bipartisan delegation from the United States Congress that included the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Speaking on behalf of the Holocaust survivors at the Yad Vashem ceremony was Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, 82, who was sent with his brother to the Buchenwald concentration camp as a child, was liberated at the age of 8 by American forces and rose to become the chief rabbi of Israel and a towering moral voice of his generation. At the age of 7, he said, he had no name, only a number. “I came especially to tell you I cannot forgive,” he said, “because I am not authorized.” He said his parents, before they were taken away, “did not ask me to forgive. They asked me to continue the chain, so the Jewish chain will be unbroken, unbroken forever.” The scion of an old rabbinical dynasty and now the chairman of the Yad Vashem Council, Rabbi Lau added, “I can never forget.” In a powerful address taking full responsibility for the crimes of Nazi Germany and for the continuing fight against anti-Semitism, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany cautioned that “the spirits of evil are emerging in a new guise.” He opened and concluded his remarks at Yad Vashem with a Hebrew blessing and said he wished he could say Germans had learned from history, “but I cannot say that when hatred is spreading.” “I cannot say that when Jewish children are spat on in the schoolyard; I cannot say that when crude anti-Semitism is cloaked in supposed criticism of Israeli policy,” he added. “I cannot say that when only a thick wooden door prevents a right-wing terrorist from causing a blood bath in a synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur.” He was referring to an averted massacre in October when a gunman failed to break through the door of a small synagogue in Halle, Germany, but killed two people nearby. “Our age is a different age,” he said, “the words are not the same, the perpetrators are not the same perpetrators but it is the same evil, and there remains only one answer: Never again.” “This Germany will only live up to itself if it lives up to its historical responsibility,” he added. “We fight anti-Semitism. We resist the poison that is nationalism. We protect Jewish life. We stand with Israel. Here at Yad Vashem, I renew this promise before the eyes of the world.” President Emmanuel Macron of France appealed for unity and for states to put aside controversy over history. “This is not just history that one can read this way or another,” he said, speaking in French. “No. There was justice and there is history with proof and evidence, and there is the life of our nations, of our states. Let us not confuse between these things so we won’t be engulfed once again in those horrific and dismal, dire times.” Calling for “friendship, not hatred,” he said, “What better or greater symbol is there than to see us all convened her today, united.” he added, “It is incumbent on Europe to remain united.” Prince Charles called the Holocaust’s lessons “searingly relevant to this day.” “Hatred and intolerance still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises and still seek new victims,” he said, adding that the language used too often “turns disagreement into dehumanization.” “Real violence ensues, and acts of unspeakable cruelty are still perpetrated around the world against people for reasons of their religion, their race or their beliefs,” Charles said. He recalled his own grandmother Princess Alice of Battenberg, who sheltered and saved a Jewish family in occupied Athens in the 1930s and is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. She has a tree planted in her name as one of Yad Vashem’s honored “Righteous among the Nations.” This, Prince Charles said, brings “me and my family immense pride.” After months of hope and suspense in Israel, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia hinted soon after his arrival that the painful saga of a young Israeli woman imprisoned in Russia might be coming to an end, telling her mother, “Everything will be fine.” The Israeli-American citizen, Naama Issachar, 26, was sentenced last year to a long prison term in Russia after the authorities found a few grams of marijuana in her luggage as she waited at a Moscow airport to board a connecting flight home. Ms. Issachar’s mother, Yaffa Issachar, joined Mr. Putin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for part of a breakfast meeting in Jerusalem. She had spent months in Russia dealing with lawyers and the authorities and leading an emotional public campaign for her daughter’s release, winning the hearts of many Israelis. Ms. Issachar and the two leaders, along with Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister’s wife, emerged from the meeting on Thursday smiling. “I have just met with Naama’s mother,” Mr. Putin said, speaking in Russian. “It’s clear to me that Naama comes from a very good and decent family.” “The mother is very worried, and I see this,” he added. “I told her, and I would like to repeat it, that everything will be fine.” In a choreographed move later on Thursday, Ms. Issachar met in prison with the person responsible for maintaining human rights in Russia. Russian news outlets broadcast images of Ms. Issachar smiling after seeing the images of her mother with Mr. Putin in Jerusalem. During his visit, Vice President Mike Pence invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his chief political rival, Benny Gantz, to the White House to discuss the administration’s plan for Middle East peace — a proposal that had appeared to stall in recent months. “President Trump asked me to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House next week to discuss regional issues as well as the prospect of peace here in the Holy Land,” Mr. Pence said to reporters in Jerusalem. “At the prime minister’s suggestion, I also extended an invitation to Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party, and he has accepted the invitation to join the prime minister with the president at the White House next week.” Mr. Netanyahu said he had “gladly” accepted the invitation. Mr. Pence told reporters that Mr. Gantz had accepted as well. The invitation to discuss the plan provides a dose of counterprogramming — for President Trump, to help distract from his impeachment trial, and for Mr. Netanyahu, who has been indicted on corruption charges and has struggled to win re-election. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz, his chief political rival, have been locked in a stalemate with neither able to form a government after two elections. Palestinian officials have refused to participate in discussions about the peace plan with Washington, which it sees as biased in Israel’s favor. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine arrived in Israel before dawn on Thursday and quickly stirred up dust, announcing that he would not attend the Yad Vashem commemoration. He asked that his delegation’s few seats be given instead to Holocaust survivors, following the lead of several Israeli government ministers who had done so after learning that only a few dozen survivors would be among the nearly 800 guests at the ceremony. “These people deserve these honors most of all,” Mr. Zelensky, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, said on Twitter. He headed instead to the Western Wall for a private visit. But officials at Yad Vashem said that it was far too late to arrange to bring frail survivors to the ceremony, and called Mr. Zelensky’s decision regrettable. “It is a shame he decided to take such a step at an event under the banner of the memory of the Holocaust and fighting anti-Semitism,” the officials said in a statement. The pomp and circumstance surrounding the Jerusalem gathering at a time when 45,000 survivors of the Holocaust live below the poverty line in Israel has drawn growing anger. Some protesters picketed outside Yad Vashem with signs calling it unseemly that such a somber event had been turned into a “celebration.” Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, arrived in Israel on Air Force Two on Thursday morning. It was not his first official visit to commemorate the camp’s liberation: Last winter, he visited the concentration camp, alongside President Andrzej Duda of Poland. “We just felt waves of emotion,” Mr. Pence said about his time there. Later Thursday, Mr. Pence was scheduled to visit the Western Wall and meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the new, and hotly contested, location of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Not even an event as solemn as one centered on Holocaust remembrance could escape its share of high-level schmoozing. At Yad Vashem, the memorial to the Holocaust, world leaders delayed the beginning of the program by engaging in a lengthy round of hellos, good-jobs and handshakes before they took their seats. For his part, Mr. Netanyahu flitted from leader to leader, offering praise and smiles. “That was a great speech last night,” he told King Felipe VI of Spain before moving on. As he greeted other dignitaries with laughs and half-hugs, Mr. Netanyahu huddled with President Emmanuel Macron of France before the two turned away from a wall of cameras, apparently to speak privately. Vice President Mike Pence was less discreet about their interaction as he appeared to broach political matters back home. “We’re contending,” Mr. Pence told Mr. Netanyahu. “He’s unstoppable. Like somebody else I know,” the vice president added, an unmistakable nod to the impeachment battle that President Trump was waging at home. The surge in hotel reservations by visiting dignitaries had led to at least one unexpected lodging scenario: Mr. Pence was staying in the same hotel as Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker who led the impeachment effort against President Trump. Later, Mr. Pence spoke of his trip to the concentration camp, remarking on the scale of human suffering. “One cannot walk the grounds of Auschwitz without being moved beyond words,” he said. “One cannot see the piles of shoes, the lone boxcar on the rail, the gate to the camp, and the grainy photographs of men, women, and children being sent to their deaths without asking: ‘How could they?’” As he called for a global effort to combat the “rising tide of vile anti-Semitism fueling hate,” Mr. Pence tucked in a pointed reference to the United States’ recent conflicts with Iran, which he called “the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy.” When Piotr Cywinski took over as the director of Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland more than a decade ago, every day he would meet a survivor. Their stories were invariably wrenching, often surprising and always stirring. But as the years have passed, he said, those encounters have grown scarce. “We barely meet with survivors now in our daily educational work,” he said. So the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp seemed like a chance — perhaps the last one — to bring together as many as they could to mark the occasion. On Monday, when the liberation will be observed by a solemn ceremony, some 200 survivors will make their way back to the camp. While the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, will speak — given that the German death camp was in occupied Poland — Mr. Cywinski said, they had sought to keep the event as free from politics as possible. Instead, the focus will be on survivors and their stories. The philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder, who is also to speak at the event, said that was as it should be. “Almost half the survivors have died in the last five years,” Mr. Lauder noted in an interview. He has been involved in conservation efforts at Auschwitz for more than three decades. In view of the rise in anti-Semitism across Europe, he said, their voices needed to be heard both as a reminder and a warning. Mr. Lauder and Mr. Cywinski said those conservation efforts were essential in battling those who would distort or deny what had taken place here. But the burden of telling that story, he said, should no longer fall on the shoulders of the survivors. “They have done their job,” he said. “It is our responsibility now.” A prominent Muslim cleric from Saudi Arabia was to visit Auschwitz on Thursday as part of a joint delegation between the Mecca-based Muslim World League and the American Jewish Committee. The cleric, Mohammad al-Issa, served as the Saudi justice minister before being named to lead the league by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. He has since become the most public face of Prince Mohammed’s efforts to rebrand Saudi Arabia as an Islamic society open to other religions through his meetings with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders around the world. In a statement, the American Jewish Committee hailed Dr. al-Issa’s visit at the head of a delegation including Muslims from 28 countries as “the most senior Islamic leadership delegation to ever visit Auschwitz or any Nazi German death camp.” “I believe that by paying my respects to the victims of Auschwitz, I will encourage Muslims and non-Muslims to embrace mutual respect, understanding and diversity,” Dr. al-Issa was quoted as saying by the committee statement during the signing last April of an agreement between it and his organization. After visiting Auschwitz on Thursday, the joint delegation will see a Jewish history museum and a synagogue in Warsaw on Friday before an interfaith dinner to observe the start of the Jewish Sabbath. President Andrzej Duda of Poland stayed away from the Jerusalem event after he was refused a speaking slot at the ceremony at Yad Vashem, though President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was given one as the leader of one of the Allied powers that liberated Europe and the world from Nazi tyranny. The backdrop to the dispute: A monthslong bitter conflict between Poland and Russia over apportioning blame for the outbreak of World War II and the Holocaust. Mr. Putin has sought to portray Russia as having saved the world from Nazism and Poland as a perpetrator rather than a victim, claiming the Polish ambassador to Berlin had lauded Hitler’s effort to rid Europe of Jews. Still, Mr. Duda got to have at least part of his say in an entry printed in a commemorative album of statements from world leaders invited to the World Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem. Mr. Duda argues that the Soviet Union’s 1939 pact with Germany paved the way to war. “It began on Sept. 1, 1939, with the assault of Nazi Germany on independent Poland, which was preceded by the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact,” Mr. Duda wrote in the album. “The Polish state was destroyed, my people were deprived of their freedom and sovereignty. Both these dates come as a shocking memento for us, the contemporaries.” He concluded: “We will always uphold the truth about the tragedy that struck our country and its people those days. Hail to all Holocaust victims, may their memory live forever!” In his entry, Mr. Putin paid tribute “to the courage of the heroic Soviet soldiers and officers, our allies and Resistance fighters who risked their lives to save the world from the ‘brown plague’. Unfortunately, nowadays, several states openly promote hateful ideas of racism and anti-Semitism and hold neo-Nazi rallies.” Alluding to the present-day battle over narratives, he continued, “Attempts are made to distort the truth about the Second World War and rehabilitate the aggressors and their accomplices. Monuments to the warriors-liberators are desecrated and destroyed.” The Palestinians were not invited to the Holocaust commemoration, but they were not merely watching from the sidelines. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, arranged several bilateral meetings with world leaders and prominent figures who have come to Jerusalem. Mr. Abbas met with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Ramallah, on the West Bank, last Wednesday, is expected to talk on Thursday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Bethlehem. Prince Charles is also scheduled to meet with the Palestinian leader at Mr. Abbas’s palace in Bethlehem on Friday. Still, those meetings paled next to what some critics of Mr. Abbas said was the embarrassment of so many leaders visiting Israel. Amer Hamdan, 38, a lawyer and activist in Nablus, said the spectacle amounted to “an implicit recognition that Jerusalem is the de facto capital of Israel” and “a catastrophic failure of Palestinian diplomacy.” From Gaza, Hamas issued a statement calling on world leaders to “remember that millions of Palestinians” were living in “Israeli apartheid ghettos,” just hundreds of yards from where the Holocaust-related events were taking place.

"Coronavirus Deaths Are So Far Mostly Older Men, Many With Previous Health Issues",2020-01-23,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — When the man finally went to a hospital, he had been sick for a week. It was Dec. 26, and Mr. Zeng, 61, was weak with a cough. He got worse. A day later he was transferred to intensive care, and on Dec. 30 he was put on a ventilator to try to keep him alive. He was moved to another hospital and attached to another machine that oxygenated his blood. Still, he got worse, and on Jan. 9 his heart stopped. Mr. Zeng, whom the authorities have identified only by his surname, became the first confirmed death from the new coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan and has since spread around the country and beyond. China’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, on Thursday released details about the first 17 confirmed deaths from the disease. (Several more deaths were announced early Friday, bringing the death toll to 25.)  The detailed information was released as the authorities canceled transportation within Wuhan and several nearby cities and largely blocked residents from leaving. Medical experts have questioned whether the measures in Wuhan have come too late to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has been found in infected travelers in Washington State, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan. Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who visited Wuhan this week, warned that there was a potential for the virus to spread rapidly despite the controls put in place on Thursday morning. “We have a chance to have a pandemic outbreak,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of the team that identified the coronavirus that caused the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. Dr. Guan also told Caixin, an influential Chinese magazine known for investigative reports, that he had traveled to Wuhan hoping to help track the virus’s animal source and control the epidemic. But he left, he said, feeling “powerless, very angry.” Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised the Chinese government and the World Health Organization during the SARS outbreak, said that infected people outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease. “The horse is already out of the barn,” he said. An examination of the information provided by the government about the initial deaths show a disease that has thus far largely killed older men, many of who had underlying health problems. Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three did not have fevers when they were admitted, according to the health commission’s statement. Among the first 17 victims were 13 men and four women. All were identified only by their last names. The youngest was a 48-year-old woman, Yin, who died on Monday, more than a month after her symptoms were first recorded. The oldest cases were two 89-year-old men who died on Saturday and Sunday. The median age was 75. Many had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Most spent more than a week in hospitals, with some undergoing treatment for a month or longer. But two died just four days after they were admitted. While much about the virus remains unknown, medical experts found some positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people. It was a somewhat reassuring sign, Dr. Lipkin wrote, that “the majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases.” The Chinese health commission said more than 570 cases had been confirmed in the country by the end of Wednesday, with 95 in grave condition. The outbreak has happened as China was preparing for the Lunar New Year holiday, the biggest travel period of the year, increasing the likelihood of the coronavirus circulating further beyond Wuhan. Dr. Guan, in his interview with Caixin, was critical of the local government, saying it had not done enough earlier this week to stop the coronavirus in Wuhan. “Even though the central authorities have said in the past two days they were attaching a high degree of importance, local health protections had not been upgraded at all,” he said. “At the time I thought this was going to be a ‘state of war.’ Why hadn’t the alarm been sounded?” Dr. Guan said he was disturbed by the lack of safety measures being put in place. At the airport he saw no disinfection being carried out and only a few random places like a Starbucks had put out liquid hand sanitizer dispensers. The situation was so surprising, “my jaw dropped,” he said. He said he continually ran into obstacles when trying to find researchers to work with on tracing the source of the virus. The seafood and poultry market believed to the source had been thoroughly cleaned, he complained, preventing any effective investigation. “There’s no crime scene,” he said. The path of the coronavirus could prove harder to trace and control than SARS, when a small number of highly infectious superspreaders helped transmit the disease to a large number of people, Dr. Guan said. “I’ve experienced a lot, and I’ve never felt scared, most of these are controllable,” he said, citing previous battles with SARS, avian influenza and other outbreaks. “But this time I’m scared.” Javier Hernández contributed reporting from Beijing, and Amber Wang contributed research.']","As China released details about the first 17 people who have died in the outbreak, a well-known SARS expert raised an alarm about the virus’s spread, saying he felt “powerless.”"
"North Korea Bans Foreign Tourists Over Coronavirus, Tour Operator Says",2020-01-21,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has temporarily barred foreign tourists as a protection against the mysterious virus from China that has killed at least nine people and sickened more than 400, a leading tour operator reported on Tuesday. The operator, Young Pioneer Tours, which specializes in taking tourists from China to North Korea, said on its website that the country was closing its border to foreign \u200btourists starting on Wednesday. Practically all foreign tours to North Korea come through China, and the vast majority of tourists are Chinese. Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which also takes tourists to North Korea, said his company had been told that “action was being considered” by the North Korean authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have been informed that we will be told more information in the morning,” he said Tuesday night. State-run media in North Korea, which tightly controls information from the outside world, reported on the Chinese outbreak of the coronavirus Wednesday, though the reports did not mention a tourist ban. A television news program said officials were working with the World Health Organization to keep the virus from spreading to the North, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, which monitors North Korean media. The virus has been spreading rapidly from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. That is bad news for North Korea, where Chinese tourists have become an increasingly important source of cash for the country, hobbled by international sanctions. \u200b Tourism is one of the few North Korean industries not covered by the sanctions, which have been imposed by the United Nations Security Council and the United States in response to the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently declared that his country no longer expected a breakthrough in deadlocked negotiations with Washington over how to denuclearize his country and ease or end the sanctions. Mr. Kim said his country would therefore strengthen its economy without relief from the sanctions, and boosting tourism is a key part of that strategy. To attract foreign tourists, North Korea has recently completed or is building seafront resorts or ski and spa complexes. The number of Chinese tourists to North Korea has been rapidly rising since\u200b President Xi Jinping of China visited Pyongyang\u200b last June. \u200bChina has gone along with Security Council sanctions on North Korea in recent years but does not want the Communist government in Pyongyang to collapse.']",The spread of the virus from China is bad news for Kim Jong-un; North Korea depends on Chinese tourists for cash.
American Journalist Is Arrested in Indonesia Over Visa Issue,2020-01-22,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — An American journalist whose work for a conservation website exposed environmental degradation and corporate malfeasance in Indonesia has been jailed by the country’s immigration authorities on suspicion that he violated the conditions of his visa, his attorney said on Wednesday. Philip Jacobson, an editor for the environmental science website Mongabay, was traveling on a business visa in the city of Palangkaraya on Borneo when he was detained on Dec. 17 and ordered to remain in the city while the authorities investigated his case, according to an article on Mongabay’s website. On Tuesday, the immigration authorities took him into custody and put him in the main jail in Palangkaraya, said his lawyer, Aryo Nugroho, the head of Indonesian Legal Aid in the city. Mr. Aryo said the case appeared to focus on Mr. Jacobson’s use of a business visa instead of a journalism visa during his travels in the country and did not appear to be motivated by concern over a particular article produced by Mongabay. “He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Mr. Aryo said. Mr. Jacobson, 30, was first detained after he attended a meeting between the Central Kalimantan Provincial Parliament and the local chapter of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, Indonesia’s largest indigenous rights group. As a reporter for Mongabay, Mr. Jacobson wrote articles about a paper company that illicitly set up a shell company to secretly clear forest land, and another that analyzed the environmental record of the country’s president, Joko Widodo. He faces up to five years in prison if found to have violated immigration law. At this point, the best outcome for Mr. Jacobson would appear to be a quick deportation, Mr. Aryo said. A letter of arrest dated Tuesday said that it was necessary to take Mr. Jacobson into custody for further investigation since he was “strongly alleged to commit a crime based on sufficient initial evidence.” The letter was signed by immigration officials and Mr. Jacobson. Mongabay, which covers environmental issues around the world, said that it was working to free him. “We are supporting Philip in this ongoing case and making every effort to comply with Indonesia’s immigration authorities,” said Mongabay’s founder and chief executive, Rhett A. Butler, who is based in the United States. “I am surprised that immigration officials have taken such punitive action against Philip for what is an administrative matter.” Arvin Gumilang, a spokesman for the immigration department, said Mr. Jacobson had visited Indonesia several times on a business visa. Mr. Arvin said that the immigration office in Palangkaraya had received a report in December that a foreign journalist was interviewing people. The department investigated and found that Mr. Jacobson did not have a journalism visa, a requisite for foreign reporters working in the country, he said. Mr. Arvin said that he did not know whether any information from the interviews had been published, and that Mr. Jacobson had not been detained because of any articles published by Mongabay. The executive committee of the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club issued a statement expressing concern over the arrest. “While we of course urge all foreign journalists visiting Indonesia to ensure they follow immigration rules, if a journalist is simply attending meetings or happens to be present during a news event this should not be cause for punitive action or detention,” the organization said.

‘No Room for Indifference’: Leaders Issue Warning at Holocaust Commemoration,2020-01-22,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['Reaching back to Hitler’s prewar correspondence, a pre-eminent Holocaust scholar warned world leaders at a state dinner at the Israeli presidential residence Wednesday night that anti-Semitism “is not a Jewish illness, but a non-Jewish one” that threatened all their countries with a “deadly cancer.” Jerusalem was overflowing with Western presidents, premiers and potentates, all descending on the Holy City to recall the Holocaust and speak out against anti-Semitism some 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz. But an event that might seem to be focused squarely on the past has been caught up in controversies and concerns of the present, with violence against Jews on the rise in Europe and North America, and with a noisy row between Russia and Poland over their roles in the start of World War II, playing out this week on Israeli turf. Yehuda Bauer — a 95-year-old historian and adviser to Yad Vashem, the hillside Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem — told the monarchs, presidents and premiers at the dinner that Hitler had pushed for war not to give Germany living space, or “lebensraum,” but because he believed war was inevitable to prevent “all of humanity” from being subjected to “international Jewry.” “A central Nazi motivation for the war was a hatred of Jews,” Mr. Bauer said. “This was no propaganda, but a deeply held belief that demanded action to prevent the physical annihilation of the German people at the hands of the chimera he and millions of others believed, and still believe in — of a secret cabal, of an invented international Jewry, that controls both East and West. “Isis and Qaeda disseminate this today,” Mr. Bauer added. “World war was a result.” Noting that World War II had killed some 35 million people, of whom only about 5.6 to 5.7 million were Jews who died in the Holocaust, Mr. Bauer said: “Some 29 million were non-Jews from Europe and North America, who died in large part because of the hatred of Jews — and the majority of these victims were Soviet citizens. “Anti-Semitism is not a Jewish illness, but a non-Jewish one,” he continued. “It is a cancer that kills and destroys your nations and your societies and your countries. So there are, my friends, 29 million reasons for you to fight anti-Semitism. Not because of the Jews, but to protect your societies from a deadly cancer. “Don’t you think,” he concluded, “that 29 million reasons are enough?” The ongoing battle among Russia, Poland and other nations over the history of the Holocaust and responsibility for World War II, which overshadowed the gathering in Jerusalem, came in for pointed criticism from Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin. “Historical research should be left to historians,” Mr. Rivlin said in remarks at the start of the state dinner Wednesday night. “The role of political leaders is to shape the future. Leave history for the historians.” Mr. Rivlin — who shared a head table with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the monarchs of Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg — urged that the point of the Holocaust forum not be lost in the noise of such nationalist-tinged disputes. “I hope and pray that from this room, the message will go out to every country on earth: that the leaders of the world will stand united, will stand united together in the fight against racism, anti-Semitism and extremism,” he said. “In defending democracy and democratic values,” he added. “This is the call of our time. This is our challenge.” Those in the soaring reception room, repurposed to accommodate a state dinner, included only a handful of senior Israeli officials: the foreign minister, Supreme Court chief justice, military chief of staff, speaker of Parliament and mayor of Jerusalem. Others were relegated to an outside tent. The Israeli opposition leader, Benny Gantz, who is battling Mr. Netanyahu in a third straight election in March, was seated next to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who officials said had been invited by Mr. Rivlin’s office in an acknowledgment of the importance to Israel of maintaining bipartisan ties to the United States. The two would seem to have plenty to discuss: Ms. Pelosi has the impeachment process against President Trump, while Mr. Gantz is seeking to dislodge Mr. Netanyahu at the ballot box and has vowed to deny him parliamentary immunity from prosecution on outstanding corruption charges. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser on matters including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was expected to attend the Rivlin dinner but canceled, citing bad weather in Davos, Switzerland, where he participated in the World Economic Forum. The kings of Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, Britain’s Prince Charles and the presidents of Russia, France, Germany, Italy and Ukraine are among those leading nearly 50 delegations attending the events. They began with a Wednesday dinner at the residence of President Reuven Rivlin of Israel and culminate in an afternoon ceremony Thursday at Yad Vashem. Auschwitz, the largest of the Nazi death camps, was a vast complex in occupied Poland near the town of Oswiecim that received some 1.1 million Jews and 200,000 Poles, Russians, Roma and others between 1940 and 1945, of whom 1.1 million were killed. For Israel, the participation of so many world leaders is a point of pride: Only the funerals of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former President Shimon Peres attracted more, officials say. But the turnout also points to the seriousness with which anti-Semitic rhetoric and violence is viewed in the West and in Israel — and offers representatives of countries considered hotbeds of anti-Jewish hatred a chance at least to demonstrate their revulsion for it on an international stage. The event at Yad Vashem will feature speeches by representatives from four of the main Allied powers: Vice President Mike Pence, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Prince Charles and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has called World War II a “German crime” and apologized for the Holocaust, will also speak, as will Mr. Rivlin, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and event organizers. Jerusalem is only the first stop for some of the leaders participating. The actual anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Red Army troops, on Jan. 27, 1945, will be observed, as it is each year, at the site of the infamous death camp on Monday. In addition, Mr. Rivlin is to address the German Bundestag, in Hebrew, at Mr. Steinmeier’s invitation on Jan. 29. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, was invited to the Jerusalem gathering but declined to attend over a perceived snub: He was not given a speaking slot, though Mr. Putin was. The two have been engaged in a bitter dispute for months, with each accusing the other of trying to rewrite — and weaponize — history: Mr. Putin has sought to portray the Soviet Union as having saved the world from Nazism and to ignore its own 1939 nonaggression pact with Germany, and has framed Poland as more a perpetrator than a victim of the Holocaust. Mr. Duda argues that the Soviet agreement with Germany paved the way to war, and that Mr. Putin is reviving old Stalinist propaganda as a modern-day cudgel. “I am sorry to say this, but President Putin is knowingly spreading historical lies,” Mr. Duda said in an interview with Israeli public television that aired Tuesday. Fueling speculation that the Jerusalem gathering was being given a pro-Russian tilt is that its main organizer is Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, a Russian-Jewish billionaire with close ties to Mr. Putin. His group, the World Holocaust Forum Foundation, held similar events in Poland in 2005 and 2010, Ukraine in 2006, and the Czech Republic in 2015. But Yad Vashem’s chairman, Avner Shalev, said in an interview that Mr. Kantor had not exerted any such influence: “It’s not true.” Decisions on who would speak were made many months ago, he said, and to bend to accommodate Mr. Duda would be untenable when many other leaders were denied similar requests. Mr. Shalev said he believed that having so many heads of state, government and parliaments making such a collective demonstration of resolve to fight anti-Semitism was well worth it, though he acknowledged that the Russia-Poland crossfire has been a headache. “We’re in the business of historical truth,” he said. “We don’t want to play any political game.” A last-minute casualty of the dispute was President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, who pulled out of the Yad Vashem event on Tuesday, reportedly in solidarity with Mr. Duda. Mr. Nauseda has joined Mr. Duda in accusing Mr. Putin of trying to sanitize Russia’s 1939 pact with Hitler. President Emmanuel Macron of France erupted at Israeli security officers late Wednesday before entering a French church in the Old City of Jerusalem, apparently angered by something that had occurred outside. Witnesses said he demanded to enter the Church of St. Anne, a 12th-century Roman church near Lion’s Gate that was restored by the French government after the 1967 Six-Day War, with his own security only, and not with Israeli bodyguards. “Please respect the rules,” Mr. Macron said in English, his voice at times rising into a shout. “They are for centuries. They will not change with me, I can tell you. So everybody respects the rules. Please.” Mr. Macron appeared to be objecting to something that occurred before entering the church. “I don’t like what you did in front of me,” he told Israeli security officers. “Go outside. I’m sorry. But we know the rules. Nobody — nobody has to provoke. Nobody! O.K.?” The French presidency said later on Wednesday that Mr. Macron had reacted to an “altercation” between French and Israeli security forces but that there was “nothing serious” and that his visit had continued without further issue. The French Consulate in Jerusalem is the protector of French holy sites and religious communities in the city, among them the Church of St. Anne. France formally treats Jerusalem as a “corpus separatum” with special legal status under United Nations Resolution 181, dating to 1947, a consulate spokeswoman said. The fracas was reminiscent of a scuffle between the Israeli police and then-President Jacques Chirac in 1996, in which he accused them of aggressively pushing and shoving his entourage and preventing him from mingling with bystanders. The rough treatment drew an apology from the young Israeli prime minister, then in his first year in office: Benjamin Netanyahu. That is not a mistake. In a little-known historical footnote, King Felipe VI of Spain is the current holder of that title, a holdover from the Crusader era. The short-lived Kingdom of Jerusalem was founded in 1099 by Godfrey of Bouillon, who called himself “Defender of the Holy Sepulcher.” His successor, Baldwin I, was the first King of Jerusalem. The kingdom collapsed with the fall of Acre in 1291, but the title bounced around through the centuries, passing from one European noble house to another, then spawning competing claims by royals as far afield as Cyprus, Naples and Austria. It currently rests with King Felipe. Chosen to speak on behalf of the gathered dignitaries Wednesday night, Felipe invoked the Spanish-born Jewish philosopher Maimonedes, saying that “all the great evils” originate in ignorance. He called on other world leaders to show an “unyielding commitment” to fighting “the ignorant intolerance, hatred and the total lack of human empathy that permitted and gave birth to the Holocaust.” “There is no room for indifference in the presence of racism, xenophobia, hate speech and anti-Semitism,” he added. Tiny Israel has never had to tend to so many V.I.P.s at once, complete with overnight stays and scores of elaborate schedules, and its diplomatic corps, police force and other government agencies were scrambling to prepare. (Leaders who attended the Rabin and Peres funerals mostly flew in and out on the same day.) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs employs only five protocol officers, but many others were pitching in, including retirees. At Ben-Gurion Airport, the ministry’s director-general, Yuval Rotem, was running from plane to plane to greet officials as their planes landed. Some 10,000 police officers were being deployed to provide security and direct traffic, more than a third of the 29,000-strong nationwide force. Asked on television what he feared most, Ofer Shomer, a local police commander, replied, “Fear is not a word that exists with us.” The Israel Police force, he said, was prepared for every scenario, from freak weather to sabotage. King David Street, with its luxury hotels housing many leaders, was being “hermetically sealed,” the police said. And no-fly zones for all aircraft, including drones, were established over the main gathering points: Yad Vashem, the Israeli president’s residence, and the Crowne Plaza hotel, where Mr. Pence will be staying. At the presidential residence, the turnstile-like parade of important visitors made for broad comedy when there were logjams: Mr. Macron, leaving a meeting with Mr. Rivlin, grabbed a camera and played photographer as the president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, took his seat. Residence officials, meanwhile, detailed the preparations for Wednesday’s dinner with breathless detail, noting even that “the grand piano has been tuned.” But the home’s modest proportions were not enough to accommodate all 250 attendees. Only 60 ranking guests were to be seated indoors, in a soaring room showcasing 1970s-era Israeli art. Their “plus-ones” were to dine in a tent outside. The gathering came smack in Israel’s wintry rainy season. And with heavy downpours and even some flurries drenching Jerusalem on Tuesday, the president’s aides also mustered hundreds of portable heaters to keep the luminaries stuck outside from freezing. For Israel, the gathering comes at a somewhat awkward time, when its political system is paralyzed by a deadlock that has prevented the country from forming a new government. Two elections last year each ended more or less in a tie. A third ballot is set for March 2, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the longtime right-wing leader, is again being challenged by Benny Gantz, a centrist who was once the army chief of staff. Mr. Netanyahu, who awaits trial on corruption charges, remains at the helm of an interim government. At a campaign kickoff Tuesday night, Mr. Netanyahu resumed inciting against Arab Israelis, saying Mr. Gantz would need their support to form a government. “What’s worse: A fourth election or a left-wing government dependent for its survival on parties that support terrorism?” he asked. Mr. Netanyahu also sought to make the most of a series of bilateral meetings with leaders in Jerusalem for the event, officials say. At breakfast with the French president, Mr. Netanyahu said in a video he posted afterward, he pressed Mr. Macron to “deal with” the murder of Sarah Halimi, 65, a French Jew who was killed and thrown from her Paris window in 2017. A French court ruled in December that the killer, a native of Mali, was “not criminally responsible” for his actions. French Jews are a small but growing constituency in Israel. Mr. Gantz, who also met with Mr. Macron and was expected to sit with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as well, has been courting right-wing support, and on Tuesday he sought to match Mr. Netanyahu’s pledge to annex the Jordan Valley, a strategic strip of the occupied West Bank. But Mr. Gantz said he would only do so in coordination with the international community, and then dared Mr. Netanyahu to act on his own promise to prove it was not just empty campaign rhetoric. The one-upsmanship prompted Nikolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special envoy to the region, to warn that Israeli annexation would deal a “devastating blow” to the chances for reviving peace talks and to the prospects for a two-state solution. Many Israelis were hoping that Mr. Putin, the Russian leader, would arrive bearing good news about the fate of one young woman. The country has been gripped for months by the plight of Naama Issachar, an Israeli-American citizen who was arrested before boarding a connecting flight at the Moscow airport on her way home to Israel last April when the authorities found a few grams of marijuana in her luggage. She was sentenced in October to seven and a half years in prison on drug possession and smuggling charges, prompting an outcry in Israel. It soon became clear that Ms. Issachar, 26, had become an unwitting player in a proposed international prisoner swap involving a Russian hacker who was facing extradition from Israel to the United States on computer crime charges, and whom Russia wanted back. The hacker has since been extradited. Ms. Issachar remains in a Russian prison. Mr. Netanyahu, who spoke by phone with Mr. Putin last week, said he discerned a “genuine readiness to reach a solution” and anticipated talking about a pardon for Ms. Issachar in a meeting with the Russian president set for Thursday. Reports on Wednesday, citing an unnamed Kremlin aide, said Mr. Putin was to meet Ms. Issachar’s mother during his visit to Israel on Thursday. Speculation about the price Israel could pay for a pardon, or at least for Ms. Issachar’s transfer to Israeli detention, has centered on historical Russian claims to valuable properties in downtown Jerusalem or in the Old City, or an Israeli show of support for Mr. Putin in his current dispute with Poland over World War II history. Israel and Russia have also been working to ease simmering tensions over a crackdown in Israel on Russians entering the country as tourists, then overstaying or seeking asylum in order to work. In a tit-for-tat, Israeli tourists have been held up at Moscow airport. Israeli officials maintain that quiet diplomacy is the best way to free Ms. Issachar. Her mother, Yaffa Issachar, urged activists campaigning for her daughter’s release not to hold protests and to treat Mr. Putin “with respect.” Israel is also paying deference to Russia with a symbolic gesture: Mr. Putin will speak Thursday morning at the dedication of a monument in Jerusalem’s popular Sacher Park to the victims of the German siege of Leningrad, a 900-day ordeal that led to the deaths of some 1 million civilians and left enduring scars on the Russian national psyche. The party-like mood created by the gathering in Jerusalem, despite its somber purpose, gave rise to a good deal of bitterness and ridicule from some in Israel. Reports that only 30 or 40 Holocaust survivors would attend the centerpiece event at Yad Vashem — out of nearly 800 guests in total, including many politicians and wealthy donors to the various organizations involved — led several government ministers to offer up their seats to survivors. About 215,000 survivors are living in Israel, 45,000 of them below the poverty line, according to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims in Israel. An editorial cartoon in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot depicted one survivor in a decrepit room, a debt notice beside him, warming his hands on a space heater and watching a red-carpet arrival on television, saying, “How nice that the leaders are coming to honor us.” The hosts of a public radio show derided what they said had become the “Holocaust forum holiday,” including a reception being held by the mayor of Jerusalem, complete with a disc jockey and an after-party, in an ancient cave beneath the old city. “I think we’ve lost it,” said one, Assaf Lieberman. His co-host, Kalman Liebskind, complained about the doting coverage of a chef preparing food for some of the world leaders. “I thought of my mother, who in October 1944 was in Birkenau, she was naked and starving,” he said. “If she were sitting in front of the television, alive, yesterday,” he said, “she would explode.” And Shoshana Chen, a survivor’s daughter, said in a radio interview that world leaders needed to do more than give lip service to fighting violence against Jews. “It’s not enough to say never again,” she said. “What are the steps they intend to take to combat anti-Semitism? The honorable Mr. Macron, what exactly is he doing to root out anti-Semitism in his country? Paris Jews are afraid to walk in the street.”']",Leaders spoke out in Jerusalem against the rise of anti-Semitism and commemorated the liberation of Auschwitz.
"Coronavirus Death Toll Climbs in China, and a Lockdown Widens",2020-01-23,By The New York Times,"['This briefing has ended. Read about developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.  The Chinese National Health Commission reported early Friday that there have been 25 deaths from and 830 cases of the coronavirus, a sharp increase.  The death toll increased by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours, while the number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 200.   Earlier, the first death was confirmed outside the virus epicenter.  A patient died in the province of Hebei — more than 600 miles north of the city where the outbreak began — after contracting the coronavirus, the provincial authorities announced on Thursday.  The victim was an 80-year-old man who had lived in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, for more than two months, according to Hebei’s provincial health department. Wuhan is a major port city of 11 million in the province of Hubei, where all of the 17 previously reported deaths have taken place.  The victim died on Wednesday, but officials did not confirm that he had died of the coronavirus until Thursday, the Hebei provincial announcement said. The announcement did not say when the man had returned to Hebei Province from Wuhan, but said that he had developed chest tightness and difficulty breathing after his return. Like many of the other confirmed victims of the virus, he appeared to have other underlying health issues: After being admitted to a hospital, he also was treated for high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the authorities said. After two days of deliberations, an emergency committee convened by the World Health Organization decided not to declare a global health emergency — but planned to meet again within 10 days, acknowledging the “urgency” of the situation. The committee had first planned to issue a recommendation on Wednesday about whether to declare an emergency (the decision ultimately falls to the W.H.O.’s director general). Such a declaration would give the W.H.O. broader authority to shape different countries’ responses. But committee members were split. On Thursday, after news of Wuhan’s travel restrictions and the increased death count emerged, the committee met again, and decided not to recommend the declaration. Several members thought it was “still too early,”  the W.H.O. said in a news release.  Agency officials explained that although the disease has reached beyond China, the number of cases in other countries is still relatively small, and the disease does not seem to be spreading within those countries.  “At this time, there is no evidence of human to human transmission outside China,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said at a news conference in Geneva. “That doesn’t mean it won’t happen.” “Make no mistake,” he said. “This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.” Only five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past. The decisions are fraught, with health authorities wary of causing panic, or of suggesting that governments cannot handle outbreaks on their own. Still, the W.H.O. called on the Chinese government to share more information on how it was handling the crisis.  The authorities expanded travel restrictions to several Chinese cities near Wuhan hours after announcing that the death toll and number of cases had risen sharply. Currently, at least 18 victims have been confirmed dead and more than 600 infected, according to Chinese officials. The restrictions on train and other forms of travel will apply to tens of millions of people and come just days before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel around and out of the country.  The Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. Late on Thursday, the local authorities also announced that they would suspend for-hire vehicles and limit taxis, beginning at noon on Friday.  Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars.  By evening, officials planned to also close off Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan, shut rail stations in the nearby city of Ezhou, which has about one million residents, and impose travel restrictions on the smaller cities of Chibi and Zhijiang. In Huanggang, public transportation and departing trains stopped at midnight. Residents are not allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, all rail stations were to be closed. Separately, the provincial authorities in Hubei announced late Thursday some restrictions for the entire province, not just specific cities. Travel agencies are prohibited from taking customers and organizing tours, for example, and business trips are being suspended.  Schools throughout the province, which have breaks scheduled for the Lunar New Year holiday, will postpone their post-break start dates indefinitely.  The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has sickened people in Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. In Beijing, the government said it would cancel large public gatherings for the holiday, including fairs at temples that usually draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and the Forbidden City, a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the capital, will close starting on Saturday.  Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like SARS. Symptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be about two weeks. While the headlines are alarming, health experts cautioned that it was too early to gauge the severity of the outbreak. There are too many unknowns: Where did it start? How easily does it spread? How does it compare to other coronaviruses, like SARS? Dr. William Schaffner, a specialist in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the illness should be viewed in perspective. While a new virus spreading internationally gets more attention, the much more common influenza virus is the bigger hazard for most people, he said.  “If I look at this winter respiratory season, influenza is going to cause many more illnesses and more deaths than this coronavirus,” he said. “It’s one of those circumstances where, if familiarity doesn’t breed contempt, it certainly breeds a certain nonchalance.” As anxiety about the virus has grown, governments around the world have taken precautions to isolate anyone displaying symptoms, though several cases have proved not to be the coronavirus. Health officials in the United States said on Thursday that there could be a second infection in the country, after the authorities in Washington State confirmed earlier this week that a man there had fallen sick with the Wuhan coronavirus. The second possible patient was in Brazos County, Texas, where officials said they were keeping a patient isolated at home while they did additional testing. Vietnam’s Ministry of Health announced on Thursday that it had confirmed two cases of the coronavirus, in two male Chinese patients. In Mexico, two out of five potential coronavirus cases were officially ruled out by the Health Ministry on Thursday after comprehensive tests were conducted, according to state and federal government officials. A health official said that one of the patients, a 57-year-old professor, had been diagnosed with a common cold. The three other cases, in the western state of Jalisco, were under observation and were being tested, according to the Health Ministry report. The patients include a 42-year old man who returned to Mexico from Wuhan on Jan. 10, and two other women who had contact with him. Across Wuhan on Thursday, residents — some wearing masks, some sniffing or coughing — visited hospitals and clinics seeking treatment. In interviews with a New York Times correspondent in the city, some said they were angry about the sudden lockdown. Others said they were confused by the restrictions. Outside the Wuhan No. 3 Hospital, Yang Lin, said she had come to the hospital to see if a sniffling cold she had might be the coronavirus. After a quick check, the doctors told her not to worry. But she was not reassured. “They said it was just a common cold, and told me to get some medicine and go home,” Ms. Yang, 28, said. “But how am I to know? They didn’t even take my temperature. It’s just not responsible.” The outbreak is testing Wuhan’s health care system. Several Wuhan residents said on social media websites that they had gone from hospital to hospital, waiting in lines for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment later if symptoms persisted in a few days. Doctors told some patients that there was a shortage of hospital beds as well as testing kits, according to posts on Chinese social media sites.  China’s Ministry of Finance said on Thursday that it would allocate 1 billion yuan, or about $144 million, to officials in Hubei to fight the virus, though it did not specify how the money would be used. Wuhan officials also said that they would construct a new hospital specifically for coronavirus patients. The new hospital was ordered built within six days, according to People’s Daily, the ruling Communist Party’s main newspaper. Cheng Shidong, a doctor at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, said in an interview that his hospital had set up 100 beds to receive infected patients, but that it didn’t have enough protective material, such as masks and suits, for the medical staff.  In Wuhan, Ms. Yang said that while she was in a pharmacy buying medicine, another person complained that he thought he had the coronavirus but had not been isolated. The city’s medical system, especially its smaller hospitals, seems unprepared for the influx of patients, she said. “I’m willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,” she said. “You shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That’s unfair.” China’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, released on Thursday its most detailed list of the people who have died of the disease. The first 17 people were largely older men, many with underlying health problems. All died in Hubei Province, which includes the city of Wuhan. The first confirmed death was a 61-year-old man who went to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, weak with a fever and a cough. He was transferred to another hospital as his condition worsened, and he was later attached to a machine that helped oxygenate his blood. But he died on Jan. 9. Twelve of the other 17 deaths in Hubei were also men, and four were women, officials said. The youngest victim was a 48-year-old woman who died on Monday. The oldest were two 89-year-old men. Separately on Thursday, the health authorities in Hebei Province, to the north of Hubei Province, announced that an 80-year-old man there had died, bringing the death count to 18. Many of the victims had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three had no fever when they were admitted, according to the health commission. While a full picture of the virus is still unknown, medical experts found positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people. “The majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. In an unusually blunt interview, Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong and expert on SARS, criticized the authorities in Wuhan for acting too slowly and obstructing his efforts to investigate the outbreak. Dr. Guan, who helped successfully identify the coronavirus that caused SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak in China, told the influential Chinese magazine Caixin that he was deeply frustrated by the city government’s response to the spread of the virus. He and his team had visited Wuhan on Tuesday hoping that they could track the animal that was the source of the coronavirus but were shocked to find that residents at a market were not taking any precautions or wearing masks. No special measures were in place at the airport to disinfect surfaces and floors, either. This showed that the city government was being complacent despite the urgent orders handed down by Beijing, he said. “I thought at the time, we had to be in a ‘state of war’, but how come the alarm has not been raised?” he told Caixin. “Poor citizens, they were still preparing to ring in the New Year in peace and had no sense about the epidemic.” He also criticized the local authorities for disinfecting the market where many infections had been traced to, saying that made it difficult for researchers to investigate where the virus came from. “I consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. “But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.”  There are growing concerns that the Chinese authorities are underreporting the number of people who are ill with the virus. Relatives of patients say that some hospitals, strapped for resources as they deal with an influx of patients, are turning sick people away or refusing to test them for the coronavirus. Many people remain skeptical of the government’s official statistics, with memories of the effort to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak still fresh. In Wuhan, Kyle Hui, an architect from Shanghai, said that doctors at Tongji Hospital declined to test his stepmother for the virus, even though she was showing symptoms like a cough and a fever. She died on Jan. 15 of “severe pneumonia,” according to a copy of her death certificate. Mr. Hui said that hospital workers treated his stepmother as if she had the coronavirus, wearing hazmat suits. After she died, the hospital instructed the family to cremate the body immediately. Mr. Hui said that after her death, doctors informed the family that they suspected his stepmother had the coronavirus. “I’m very sad my stepmother left without any dignity,” Mr. Hui said during an interview this week in a cafe in Wuhan. “There was no time to say goodbye.” Chris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, headed to Wuhan from Beijing to cover the outbreak. He is sending live dispatches from his trip. 11 a.m. — Aboard the G79 high speed train The G79 high speed train from Beijing to Hong Kong, which stops in Wuhan, was crowded with holiday passengers. The train was a hubbub of conversation, much of it about the deadly coronavirus and the lockdown around Wuhan. Guo Jing, a worker from northeast China, was headed with two friends for a holiday in Macau. After some hesitation, they had taken off their masks. “They’re too uncomfortable inside,” Mr. Guo said. “My view is we have to be careful but not panic. If you’re the panicky type, then you wouldn’t be on this train.” 1:37 p.m. — Aboard the G79 high speed train Half an hour out from Wuhan, the train is quite crowded with passengers. When I explain that I’m getting off at Wuhan, the reactions vary from advice — wear masks, don’t go, drink lots of water — to mordant jokes that I may be there a long time. “You should know that they probably won’t let people out until the New Year holiday is over,” said one woman, who would only give her family name, Yang.  2:29 p.m. — Wuhan Wuhan Railway Station, usually thronging with people in the days before the Lunar New Year holiday, is very empty. An announcement playing on a loop over the speakers tells the few people here that residents cannot leave the city and the station is temporarily closed.  Scientists have been scrambling to understand the source of the coronavirus, in particular, the animals from which the virus may have jumped to humans. Many of the cases in Wuhan were connected to a market that sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. The market was closed and disinfected. Early epidemiological research is indicating that it may have come from wild animals such as bamboo rats and badgers, said Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent Chinese scientist who was the country’s leading expert during the SARS outbreak, during an interview with state media on Monday. Named for its bamboo-heavy diet, the cat-sized bamboo rat has become a somewhat popular delicacy in recent years in China, promoted for its purported health properties. A group of Chinese researchers from the eastern city of Tianjin and Nanjing in the south, said the Wuhan coronavirus may have originated from Chinese horseshoe bats, according to a study they published in the Chinese Journal of Bioinformatics on Tuesday. China’s National Genomics Data Center said the Wuhan virus was 88 percent genetically similar to a SARS-like coronavirus that was collected from bats in China in 2017. Still another group of Chinese scientists suggested that snakes were the “most probable wildlife animal reservoir” for the novel coronavirus, then transmitted to humans, in an article published in the Journal of Medical Virology Wednesday. But that assessment immediately drew fire from the international health community. The study’s lead author, Wei Ji of the Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, did not actually find the new coronavirus in a snake, noted David Robertson, a professor at the University of Glasgow. Instead, Dr. Ji and his colleagues compared the genomes of an assortment of viruses and hosts and claimed to find a similarity between the genomes of the new virus and snakes. Dr. Ji did not respond to an email query by the time of publication. The announcement that the city of Wuhan would be temporarily sealed off from the outside world starting at 10 a.m. on Thursday came while most residents were asleep at 2 a.m. Some decided to flee the city. Residents were seen hauling their luggage to a train station in the early hours before the citywide lockdown took effect, the Chinese news outlet Caixin reported. Several people said they would buy tickets for any destination as long as they could leave Wuhan, the magazine reported. Lines of passengers in masks and down jackets, lugging suitcases, formed outside the major Hankou railway station just 20 minutes before the cutoff time, a live video by media outlet The Paper showed. Han Zhen and Wang Mengkai, two migrant workers from Henan Province, said they had rushed to the railway station in order to leave on Wednesday night, but missed the last train out. Both said they were frustrated by the sudden lockdown and were scrambling to find a way home. “It’s serious but not that serious,” said Mr. Wang, who works in an electronics parts factory. “We’re trying to figure out how we can get home. If we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver.” Asked if they were motivated to leave by fear of the virus, Mr. Han said: “No, we are not scared.” “It’s the New Year, we just have to go home,” he said.

"North Korea Bans Foreign Tourists Over Coronavirus, Tour Operator Says",2020-01-21,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has temporarily barred foreign tourists as a protection against the mysterious virus from China that has killed at least nine people and sickened more than 400, a leading tour operator reported on Tuesday. The operator, Young Pioneer Tours, which specializes in taking tourists from China to North Korea, said on its website that the country was closing its border to foreign \u200btourists starting on Wednesday. Practically all foreign tours to North Korea come through China, and the vast majority of tourists are Chinese. Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which also takes tourists to North Korea, said his company had been told that “action was being considered” by the North Korean authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. “We have been informed that we will be told more information in the morning,” he said Tuesday night. State-run media in North Korea, which tightly controls information from the outside world, reported on the Chinese outbreak of the coronavirus Wednesday, though the reports did not mention a tourist ban. A television news program said officials were working with the World Health Organization to keep the virus from spreading to the North, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, which monitors North Korean media. The virus has been spreading rapidly from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. That is bad news for North Korea, where Chinese tourists have become an increasingly important source of cash for the country, hobbled by international sanctions. \u200b Tourism is one of the few North Korean industries not covered by the sanctions, which have been imposed by the United Nations Security Council and the United States in response to the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently declared that his country no longer expected a breakthrough in deadlocked negotiations with Washington over how to denuclearize his country and ease or end the sanctions. Mr. Kim said his country would therefore strengthen its economy without relief from the sanctions, and boosting tourism is a key part of that strategy. To attract foreign tourists, North Korea has recently completed or is building seafront resorts or ski and spa complexes. The number of Chinese tourists to North Korea has been rapidly rising since\u200b President Xi Jinping of China visited Pyongyang\u200b last June. \u200bChina has gone along with Security Council sanctions on North Korea in recent years but does not want the Communist government in Pyongyang to collapse.']",The spread of the virus from China is bad news for Kim Jong-un; North Korea depends on Chinese tourists for cash.
Big Changes? Or Maybe Not. Putin’s Plans Keep Russia Guessing.,2020-01-21,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Nobody knows what’s going on inside the Kremlin right now. And perhaps that’s precisely the point. President Vladimir V. Putin announced constitutional changes last week that could create new avenues for him to rule Russia for the rest of his life. But will they? How? And will he? Mr. Putin’s new prime minister announced his roster of ministers on Tuesday, with the most prominent officials keeping their posts. Yet as more details of what appears to be Russia’s biggest governmental overhaul in a decade trickle out, the true nature of Mr. Putin’s long-term plan — and whether he even has one — is shrouded in mystery. Ever since his opening salvo at the end of his annual state-of-the-nation speech last Wednesday, nearly every day has brought news of high-level resignations, unexpected appointments and cryptic new legislation. Decoding these clues — and arguing over whether one should even try — has thrown the international cottage industry of Kremlin experts into a contradictory cacophony of prediction and interpretation. Mr. Putin’s proposals, sure to be adopted by his rubber-stamp Parliament, mean “potentially very little change at all,” Sam Greene, the director of the Russia Institute at King’s College in London, said in an 11-part thread on Twitter. “Or potentially quite a lot of change.” Marat Guelman, a former Kremlin media strategist, wrote on Facebook, “I’m going to make a risky forecast, but I’m almost convinced it’s true.” Mr. Putin, he said, is surely on the verge of resigning. “Soon, we will lose him.” “Alas!” Alexei Venediktov, the editor of the Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy, posted on the messaging app Telegram, responding to the latest news on Monday by quoting a 19th-century poet. “Not even a quarter-hour passed, and I already sensed that it was high time to drink vodka.” The first response by many analysts to Mr. Putin’s speech last week laying out a constitutional overhaul was that it was meant to provide the groundwork for the president to maintain his grip on power even after his fourth term ends in 2024. A strengthened Parliament might allow Mr. Putin to become a highly influential prime minister, the thinking went. Or new powers set to be granted to an obscure body called the State Council could give Mr. Putin, who is now 67, a venue to fill a father-of-the-nation role in semi-retirement. But events since then have been so fast-paced and chaotic by the standards of Mr. Putin’s deliberate, no-drama style of domestic leadership that many observers now wonder whether something else might be afoot. Kremlin control of Russian television has kept a full-fledged debate off the country’s airwaves. But in Twitter threads, lengthy Facebook posts and screeds on Telegram, political commentators have put forward so many different theories that they paint a picture of a nation in collective befuddlement. Given Mr. Putin’s penchant for trying to keep his adversaries off balance, the befuddlement might be part of the Kremlin’s goal. “The president put up a smokescreen behind which he is determined to reform the political system based on a new ideological project,” political scientist Vladimir Pastukhov wrote in the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. “It is impossible to make out what is actually going on.” The fine art of making educated guesses as to what Russia’s leadership is up to — also known as Kremlinology — dates back to Soviet times. But few moments in recent history have left the chattering classes as off-kilter as this one. In addition to proposing sweeping constitutional changes, Mr. Putin last week accepted the resignation of his entire government and replaced the longtime prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, with a man few Russians had ever heard of — the tax-office chief, Mikhail V. Mishustin. One school of thought held that Mr. Medvedev’s career was all but over and that Mr. Putin had tapped Mr. Mishustin as a potential presidential heir. Another was that Mr. Mishustin was in fact a mere technocrat, while Mr. Medvedev, in his new role in the newly created position of vice chairman of Russia’s Security Council, was parked in a vice-president-style function that made him the heir apparent. The bigger question was what would happen to Mr. Putin himself. New clues came on Monday with the publication of a 29-page bill to enact the constitutional changes that he outlined last week. Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist, wrote that the first thing she noticed about the bill was the commas: So many of them seemed to be missing that it appeared the bill had been drafted and published in haste. The fine print of the legislation showed that the prime minister’s powers would not be expanded as much as first advertised, while members of the State Council would still appear to serve at the pleasure of the president. So maybe Mr. Putin’s plan is to stay president, after all? Theories that seemed far-fetched on the surface soon gained currency. While Russia’s Constitution currently prohibits the president from serving more than two “consecutive” terms, Mr. Putin’s proposed changes included a tweak to ban a president from serving more than two terms, period. Perhaps this one-word change was the real aim, some postulated: Down the road, the Kremlin could argue that the amendment had reset the term-limit counter, allowing Mr. Putin to stay in office for two additional six-year terms. Others claimed, citing no evidence, that the remarkable haste with which the Kremlin was pushing through the constitutional changes and remaking the government was evidence that Mr. Putin might want to call it quits — or was trying to head off a coup. The drip-drip of revelations continued with what seemed to be a wide-ranging reorganization of senior officials. Yuri Y. Chaika, the powerful prosecutor general, abruptly left his post on Monday, only to resurface as Mr. Putin’s new representative to Russia’s northern Caucasus region on Tuesday. A demotion? So it seemed, but one couldn’t be so sure. By Tuesday afternoon, the guessing game over who would form the rest of the new cabinet was in full swing. Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the pro-Kremlin television network RT, posted a plea to Telegram asking journalists to stop calling her to confirm rumors that she would be taking this or that senior post. “I’m not going anywhere and won’t be going anywhere,” she wrote. The new cabinet, announced on Tuesday evening, kept the most prominent members of the old one — Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu. The roster of ministries that received new heads — including health care, sports, education and economy — suggested that Mr. Putin wanted to show he was taking Russians’ domestic problems seriously while not planning any shifts in foreign policy. “The most important goal is to raise the well-being of our people, to strengthen our statehood and the international standing of our country,” he told the new cabinet. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian economist at the University of Chicago, took his colleagues to task for tying Mr. Putin’s changes to any transition plan for 2024. Given the Kremlin’s track record of adjusting in real time to major unforeseen events, it was hard to see Mr. Putin’s tacticians gaming out such a long-term plan, he wrote. Rather, he said, the developments could be the result of a power struggle between conservative and progressive factions in Mr. Putin’s orbit. “I don’t know how this story ends,” Mr. Sonin wrote on Facebook. The debate quickly escalated to whether there should be a debate at all. Nothing could change the most important fact of political life in Russia, the popular blogger Aleksandr Gorbunov wrote: Mr. Putin’s system is a “one-man regime.” “All this reshuffling is only necessary to make sure the framework doesn’t change, and rather is cemented even further,” Mr. Gorbunov wrote on Telegram. A journalist, Yury Saprykin, offered a similar sentiment on Facebook, but in verse: We’ll be debating over how he won’t leave,We’ll be guessing, will he leave or won’t he.And then — lo! — he won’t be leaving.That is, before the elections he won’t leave,And after that, he definitely won’t leave.

Iran Admits Firing 2 Missiles at Jet and Says It’s Studying Effect,2020-01-21,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Iran acknowledged on Tuesday that its forces had fired two surface-to-air missiles at a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed this month near Tehran, confirming for the first time that more than one missile was launched at the jet. The Iranian authorities also asked officials in the United States and France to send the equipment needed to decode the jet’s flight data recorders, or “black boxes,” a request certain to frustrate countries that have called for greater international involvement in investigating the disaster, which killed all 176 onboard. The downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8 came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that included tit-for-tat military strikes, and after the killing of the top Iranian security commander, Maj. General Qassim Suleimani, in a United States drone strike at the Baghdad airport. The plane was shot down the same day Iran fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house United States troops, in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani. After days of denials, Iranian officials acknowledged that the downing was the result of “human error,” prompting angry protests across Iran. A preliminary report from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, released on Tuesday, corroborated a video verified by The New York Times last week that showed two missiles, fired from a military site, exploding near the plane. Iranian investigators had established that two Tor-M1 missiles had been fired at the plane, the statement said, adding that the investigation was looking into their effect on the crash. The crash’s victims included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, heightening calls for an international investigation. But many have accused Iran of dragging its feet, a complaint likely to be bolstered by the suggestion on Tuesday that the plane’s black boxes would be analyzed in Iran instead of being sent abroad. The Iranian aviation organzation said it had asked United States and French aviation authorities to provide the equipment needed to decode the data recorders on the Boeing 737 because it did not have the necessary technology. “If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time,” the agency said in its report. “Until now, these countries have not given a positive response to sending the equipment.” That appeared to contradict a statement by Hassan Rezaifar, a head investigator for the same organization, who on Saturday said the jet’s data recorders would be sent to Ukraine at the request of the country’s authorities. It also appeared odd that Tehran would request help from the United States, a longtime adversary whose president has embarked on a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran, including stepping up sanctions that have prevented Iran from importing sensitive technologies. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called for Iran to hand over the recorders and accused it of violating protocols for accident sites by bulldozing debris from the crash before the investigation was complete. Canada, too, has criticized Iran’s level of cooperation, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Iran should give the recorders to France for analysis. There was no immediate comment from officials in the United States, Canada or Ukraine about Iran’s equipment request.']",
Why These Australia Fires Are Like Nothing We’ve Seen Before,2020-01-21,By Jamie Tarabay,"['SYDNEY, Australia — In late October, lightning struck brittle earth on Gospers Mountain in New South Wales. The remains of trees bone dry from consecutive winters with little to no rain were ignited, and the fire quickly spread. Three months later, it is still burning. The Gospers Mountain fire, which became Australia’s largest “megablaze” as it grew to link several separate fires, offers a sense of the scale of the country’s most disastrous fire season ever. The blaze has burned two million acres, enveloping hinterland and wine country, and prompted a special mission to save prehistoric trees so rare that their exact location is kept secret. That fire is now largely contained. But dozens of others are still burning in the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, some out of control, despite heavy rain in some areas in recent days. And fire season is far from over — hot and windy conditions are expected to return this week, and a month of summer remains. Here is a look at the devastation. The modern world has never seen anything quite like these Australia fires. About 16 million acres have burned in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. That’s an area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned in other parts of the country. What sets these blazes apart, in terms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. Until now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern Canada or Siberia, where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled. “What we’re seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are fires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things that we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,” said Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales. “We’re looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,” he added. The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years. The bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered nearly two million acres and were the worst in that state’s recorded history. They are also far larger than the estimates of 2.2 million acres burned by September last year in the Amazon basin, where farmers, some emboldened by the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, ignited tens of thousands of fires to clear land. “It’s quite phenomenal and far exceeds anything you would see in the western U.S.A., which is a very fire-prone area, the southwest of Canada, the Mediterranean and parts of South America,” Dr. Bradstock said. “It’s so much bigger than anything else.” Australia has had deadlier fire seasons: The Black Saturday bushfires, which began in February 2009 when downed power lines ignited blazes that were spread by 60-mile-per-hour winds, killed 173 people in Victoria. The 2018 California fires killed 103 people. But the losses Australia is experiencing in lives and property are still staggering, and not yet over. At least 29 people have been killed. Hundreds of millions of animals, by some estimates, have perished or are facing starvation or dehydration in devastated habitats. And more than 2,500 homes have been destroyed. Smoke generated by the fires has blanketed Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, at times giving them some of the worst air in the world. The prolonged exposure of bushfire smoke to millions of people has raised fears of health effects that could last for years. Early this month, NASA began tracking a plume of smoke from the fires that was the size of the continental United States. By Jan. 14, smoke had circumnavigated the globe, returning to eastern Australia. Along the way, it caused hazardous breathing conditions in New Zealand and discolored skies in South America. The fires have also produced huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon emissions. A top expert on greenhouse gas emissions at Australia’s national research agency told NPR that the fires in southeastern Australia had produced as much carbon as the entire country emits from man-made sources in more than eight months of the year. Why have these fires been so vast? While Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, climate change is bringing longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat. That makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and some regions have been gripped by drought for years. This season, the fires started earlier than usual — some as soon as July — and they are expected to last well into February and even March. High temperatures, strong winds and dry forests have combined to create the conditions for powerful fires. There have even been blazes in wetlands and rainforests that have not contended with this threat before. To combat the flames, tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers, have been called on to work long days over extended periods. Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have misleadingly pointed to arson in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian government’s inaction on the issue. Others have argued that the drought is unrelated to climate change, though there is evidence that warming temperatures have been a major contributor to it, in part by pushing rain out of areas where it once fell. “The wildfires decimating Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and coalescing into the country’s worst peacetime catastrophe precisely because of climate change,” said Paul Read, a co-director of the National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University in Melbourne. In Australia’s history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El Niño pattern. But that is not the case this time, showing how much this season stands out and the danger the country faces with more unpredictable weather patterns in the future. While scientists have long predicted that climate change would bring longer and more intense fire seasons, the blazes were not expected to be this bad this soon, Dr. Bradstock said. Under his projections, Australia would not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years, he said. “I guess I’m as shocked as anyone about what’s unfolding and, probably, like everyone else who’s involved and affected, we’ll very quickly recalibrate thinking about what we’re doing,” he said. Recalibrating means expecting these phenomenal fires to continue to occur, particularly as Australia’s drought shows few signs of ending and temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade on record. “We would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off phenomenon,” Dr. Bradstock said. “I think we have to get ready to deal with a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.”']","More than 16 million acres have gone up in flames. And it has happened in populated areas, unlike most of the world’s other blazes of this scale."
This 3-Year-Old May Be Smarter Than You,2020-01-22,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — He reads fluently (while wearing a Gruffalo costume), he does math with ease and he can explain scientific concepts such as how rain forms. He is also 3 years old. The toddler, Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, was invited last week to join Mensa, a British society whose membership rules require an I.Q. in the top 2 percent of the population. Haryz, as his family calls him, received an invitation to the society after meeting with a consultant psychologist who assigned him a score of 142 using the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. Scoring above 145 is considered “genius or near genius,” according to the test’s website. The 3-year-old is now Mensa’s youngest current member, the society said in an email on Wednesday. The youngest-ever member was age 2 years 4 months at the time of joining. Haryz’s mother, Nur Anira Asyikin, said on Instagram, “My mini brainbox just got invited at his little age to be part of Mensa,” and congratulated her “very very clever” son. Mensa was formed in Oxford, England, in 1946 by Roland Berrill, an Australian lawyer, and Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. It has more than 110,000 members across the world. Meeting the membership criteria usually means taking an I.Q. test supervised by the society. For children under age 10 and a half, Mensa says on its website, an assessment by an educational psychologist must be made. That report is then submitted as evidence to support membership, as happened in the case of Haryz. Ms. Asyikin could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, but she said in a CNN report that her son was “very much your typical 3-year-old,” adding that he particularly enjoyed playing with modeling clay and toy bricks. Ms. Asyikin is an engineer and the family lives in Durham, in northeastern England, according to CNN. An Instagram page dedicated to Haryz’s exploits includes a video of the youngster reading books, including “The Gruffalo,” by Julia Donaldson, singing nursery rhymes, and — just before his second birthday — recounting the story of the Gingerbread Man. In a video posted on his Instagram profile on Tuesday, Haryz does simple mathematics: “Two plus six equals eight,” he tells the camera, drawing numbers and symbols in the air. Ann Clarkson, a Mensa spokeswoman, said in an email on Wednesday that a high I.Q. was “like a toolbox — it gives children the equipment to learn, but they still have to put in the effort and practice to become expert at something.” Though all children are unique, she said, what makes Haryz different is “his ability to learn very quickly and process information fast.” Child prodigies have long caused admiration and interest. Alma Deutscher, from Austria, was composing piano melodies at age 4 and played Carnegie Hall in New York in December at age 14. In Belgium, Laurent Simons, a 9-year-old, was on course last year to become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university. But the pressure that comes with such gifts can take a toll in the long term. Saul Chandler, a former violin prodigy who played Carnegie Hall twice before age 13 and suffered a nervous breakdown by 16, told The New York Times in 2018, then age 70, that if he could forget music, he would. “They turned me into a trained monkey,” he said, adding that he would not want to be remembered for his childhood achievements. “Because I ended up doing a lot of other great things in my life, too.” Despite her obvious delight in Haryz’s talents, Ms. Asyikin hinted at the pressures in an Instagram post. Whatever her son went on to achieve, she wrote, “we will always be proud of you.”']",Muhammad Haryz Nadzim became the youngest current Mensa member after scoring 142 on an I.Q. test.

"World Leaders, Gathering to Mark Holocaust, Are Urged to Fight ‘Deadly Cancer’",2020-01-22,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — Dozens of presidents, premiers and potentates descended upon the Holy City on Wednesday in an extraordinary show of collective resolve to fight anti-Semitism, and a 95-year-old Holocaust scholar warned them that such hatred threatened their countries with a “deadly cancer.” The gathering in Jerusalem, timed ahead of Monday’s 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, was orchestrated to focus even more on the present day, with anti-Jewish violence and rhetoric spreading across Europe and North America. At a state dinner the likes of which Israel has never seen, King Felipe VI of Spain — whose inherited titles include the Crusader-era King of Jerusalem — urged other world leaders to show an “unyielding commitment to fighting the ignorant intolerance, hatred and the total lack of human empathy that permitted and gave birth to the Holocaust.” “There is no room for indifference in the presence of racism, xenophobia, hate speech and anti-Semitism,” he said. Yehuda Bauer, at 95 considered the dean of Holocaust experts, told the assembled monarchs and chiefs of state that of the 35 million people killed in World War II, “some 29 million were non-Jews,” who died “in large part because of the hatred of Jews.” “Anti-Semitism is not a Jewish illness, but a non-Jewish one,” he said pointedly. “It is a cancer that kills and destroys your nations and your societies and your countries. So there are, my friends, 29 million reasons for you to fight anti-Semitism. Not because of the Jews, but to protect your societies from a deadly cancer.” “Don’t you think,” he concluded, to a loud ovation, “that 29 million reasons are enough?” The focal point for the Jerusalem gathering is a commemoration Thursday at the campus of Yad Vashem, the hillside Holocaust memorial and research institute, which will feature addresses by representatives from four of the main Allied powers: Vice President Mike Pence, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Prince Charles and President Emmanuel Macron of France. Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has called World War II a “German crime” and apologized for the Holocaust, will also speak. The actual anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where 1.1 million people were slaughtered, most of them Jews, will be observed in Poland on Monday at the site of the infamous death camp near the town of Oswiecim. For Israel, the participation of so many world leaders is a point of pride: Only the funerals of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and President Shimon Peres attracted more, officials say. But the turnout also points to the seriousness with which anti-Semitism is viewed in the West and in Israel, and offered representatives of countries considered hotbeds of anti-Jewish hatred a chance at least to demonstrate their revulsion for it on a global stage. Dampening that sense of international single-mindedness, however, was a noisy row between Russia and Poland over their roles in the start of World War II, now playing out on Israeli turf. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, was invited to the Jerusalem gathering but declined to attend over a perceived snub: He was not given a speaking slot, though Mr. Putin was. The two have been engaged in a bitter dispute for months, with each accusing the other of trying to rewrite — and weaponize — history: Mr. Putin has sought to portray the Soviet Union as having saved the world from Nazism, and to ignore its own 1939 nonaggression pact with Germany, framing Poland as more a perpetrator than a victim of the Holocaust. Mr. Duda argues that the Soviet agreement with Germany paved the way to war, and that Mr. Putin is reviving Stalinist propaganda as a modern-day cudgel. “I am sorry to say this, but President Putin is knowingly spreading historical lies,” Mr. Duda said in an interview with Israeli public television that aired Tuesday. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nauseda, who has made similar accusations against Mr. Putin, pulled out of the Jerusalem event on Tuesday. Fueling speculation that the gathering in Israel was being given a pro-Russian tilt was that its main organizer was Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, a Russian-Jewish billionaire with close ties to Mr. Putin who leads the World Holocaust Forum Foundation. But Yad Vashem’s chairman, Avner Shalev, said in an interview that Mr. Kantor had not exerted any such influence. Mr. Shalev acknowledged that the Russia-Poland crossfire had caused a headache. “We’re in the business of historical truth,” he added. “We don’t want to play any political game.” President Reuven Rivlin, in remarks as host of the dinner, urged that the point of the Holocaust forum not be lost in the noise of such nationalist-tinged disputes. “The role of political leaders is to shape the future,” he said. “Leave history for the historians.” “I hope and pray that from this room, the message will go out to every country on Earth: that the leaders of the world will stand united, will stand united together in the fight against racism, anti-Semitism and extremism,” Mr. Rivlin said. “In defending democracy and democratic values. This is the call of our time.” Israeli officials worked frantically to cope with the demands of mounting the event, mustering more than a third of its 29,000-strong national police force to provide security and close highways and streets for motorcades, setting no-fly zones over hotels and key venues, and drafting retired diplomats to help manage what the foreign ministry’s five full-time protocol officers could not. The storied King David Hotel, accustomed to accommodating one visiting ruler at a time, had to manage three kings, two crown princes, six presidents and a governor-general — as well as their senior aides, bodyguards and tasters. Not everything went smoothly: President Emmanuel Macron shouted at Israeli security officers on a stop at a church in the Old City that France considers its sovereign territory, recalling a similar tussle in Jerusalem involving his predecessor Jacques Chirac in 1996, but tensions were quickly smoothed over on the spot. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had just been elected to his first term in 1996 and is seeking another one now in what has been a yearlong electoral stalemate — while also awaiting trial on corruption charges — made the most of the chance to show himself meeting with heads of state and pressing the interests of Israelis and Jews. He quickly posted a video after his meeting with Mr. Macron, saying he had urged the French president to “deal with” the murder of Sarah Halimi, 65, a French Jew who was killed and thrown from her Paris window in 2017. A French court ruled in December that the killer was “not criminally responsible” for his actions. French Jews are a small but growing constituency in Israel. Some Holocaust survivors and their offspring took umbrage at the parade of dignitaries and the breathlessness with which their appearances were being covered in the Israeli news media. Shoshana Chen, a survivor’s daughter, said in a radio interview that world leaders needed to do more than give lip service to fighting violence against Jews. “It’s not enough to say never again,” she said, adding: “The honorable Mr. Macron, what exactly is he doing to root out anti-Semitism in his country? Paris Jews are afraid to walk in the street.” Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.']","The extraordinary meeting, timed to Monday’s 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, heard warnings about the present-day rise in anti-Jewish violence."
"Di Maio Quits as Five Star Leader in Italy, Deepening Party’s Disarray",2020-01-22,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME —\xa0When the Five Star Movement took power in Italy in 2018, the party’s boyish and immaculately dressed political leader, Luigi Di Maio, emerged as the reassuring face of a political force transitioning from protest movement to a mature governing party. On Wednesday, Mr. Di Maio became the face of a party in disarray and a governing coalition in deep difficulty as he resigned his leadership position amid falling poll numbers and climbing internal dissatisfaction. His exit raises the prospect of yet another government crisis for Italy and early elections that could open the door to the hard-right leader Matteo Salvini. “Today I am here to tender my resignation as the political leader of the Five Star Movement,” said Mr. Di Maio, now 33 as he delivered an often angry speech against his internal enemies in front of a backdrop reading, “the future is now.” “As far as I’m concerned,” he added, “this is only the end of a phase.” Mr. Di Maio apparently will retain his role as Italy’s foreign minister. His resignation as party leader comes after months of cratering poll numbers, defections and infighting as Five Star has struggled to keep its bold, pie-in-the-sky promises and allay concerns about its inexperience on the economy and foreign policy. The announcement also comes just days before critical regional elections in which Five Star is expected to do miserably, piling even more pressure on the party and on its governing coalition with the center-left Democratic Party. Mr. Salvini, in contrast, is expected to perform very well in the vote. Last summer, Mr. Salvini dramatically broke his alliance with Five Star and Mr. Di Maio, his fellow deputy prime minister, and fell out of power in an overreach. Five Star then stayed in office by forming a new governing coalition with its traditional enemies in the Democratic Party. That coalition has proved wobbly as Mr. Salvini, an increasingly strong force of opposition, has agitated for early national elections. By Wednesday, Mr. Salvini had moved beyond attacking Mr. Di Maio, saying that “another will arrive after him,” and that Five Star voters would continue to “make it pay” for its alliance with the Democratic Party. “You will see Sunday,” he said, referring to the day of the regional elections. Mr. Di Maio’s other former allies, including Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a law professor who was plucked from obscurity by Five Star to become Italy’s leader in 2018, were more measured in their reaction to Mr. Di Maio’s stepping back. “If this will be his decision, I will respect him,” Mr. Conte told Italian radio on Wednesday morning, saying that it would be an initiative taken by Mr. Di Maio “with great responsibility.” He would be sad, he added, “on a personal level.” Mr. Di Maio’s retreat reflects a steep plunge in a trajectory that seemed to rise out of nowhere. A college dropout and former soccer stadium usher, he became an early favorite in the new Five Star universe. He won 189 votes on the party’s online nomination platform, enough to get his name on the national ballot and put him in Parliament when Five Star shocked Italy with strong results in 2013. At age 26, Mr. Di Maio — who is often called by the nickname Gigi — became vice president of the lower house of Parliament. He served as a jacket-and-tie man to his party’s co-founder Beppe Grillo, a provocative comedian, as they campaigned around the country. Behind the scenes, he was a trusted ally of Davide Casaleggio, a web entrepreneur and son of the party’s other co-founder, who many say is the party’s true power. In March 2018, under Mr. Di Maio’s leadership, the party won 33 percent of the Italian vote, and then formed a nationalist and anti-establishment coalition with Mr. Salvini’s League. The European establishment deeply feared the populist government, given the parties’ antagonism to the euro, support for Russia and opposition to European demands that Italy lower its astronomic debt. Italy’s economy struggled during their government, and the partnership took a toll on Five Star’s popularity, which fell by half. That erosion of support has not stopped under the new alliance with the Democratic Party, and in recent weeks Mr. Di Maio faced a raft of defections, some to Mr. Salvini’s party, and demands that he involve lawmakers more in decision making.  On Italian television he said that his party was trying to stab him in the back. “Enough already,” he was quoted as saying in the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Jan. 11.  “If they keep going like this, I’ll quit.”   On Wednesday he did just that. Mr. Di Maio’s nearly-hour long speech sought to project optimism about the future of his party, which he urged to remain in the current government so that it could be properly judged, and perhaps rebound in the polls, after completing its full term in 2023. “I think the government should go forward,” he said. A strong note of score settling and resentment often seeped into Mr. Di Maio’s speech though, and at several points he put the blame on his “worst enemies” inside the party, who undercut the movement, and him, from within. He argued that it was correct for dissenters to be sanctioned or expelled. He defensively enumerated a long list of what he considered political and legislative accomplishments, but in a moment of frankness, acknowledged that governing wasn’t so easy. “It’s a complicated moment for Five Star,” he said. He will apparently keep his post as foreign minister. But foreign affairs have not exactly been Mr. Di Maio’s strong suit. Before he led the foreign ministry, Mr. Di Maio’s most notable previous foray onto the world stage was a road trip to support the Yellow Vest protesters in France. That move prompted the recall of the French ambassador from Rome and plunged relations between Italy and France to their lowest point since World War II. In his previous role as minister for economic development, Mr. Di Maio made several trips to Beijing to court President Xi Jinping of China, whom he referred to, perhaps counterproductively, as Mr. Ping. Mr. Di Maio has been geopolitically balanced in his misnomers. In a public appearance with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he gestured to the American and called him “Secretary Ross,” apparently referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Speculation was rife on Wednesday about who would replace Mr. Di Maio as party leader. While he said that Vito Crimi, Italy’s deputy interior minister, would take over the party leadership in the short term, questions remain about whether Mr. Di Maio will try to stage a comeback or whether others who have been waiting in the wings will step forward. One is Alessandro Di Battista, a longtime party activist and firebrand who campaigned across Italy on his motorcycle and has called for the party to return to its anti-establishment roots. Mr. Di Battista, who was a motivational dancer in Sicilian resorts before turning to political activism, opposes the alliance with the Democratic Party, which he enjoys eviscerating, and is on hiatus from government as he travels the world. He recently posted a picture on Instagram of himself sitting on the Tehran subway, reading a policy book. “I will come back soon,” he wrote in the comments to the post. “I promise you.”']","He was once the fresh face of a new political force. Now, his exit could signal yet another government crisis."
Iran Admits Firing 2 Missiles at Jet and Says It’s Studying Effect,2020-01-21,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Iran acknowledged on Tuesday that its forces had fired two surface-to-air missiles at a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed this month near Tehran, confirming for the first time that more than one missile was launched at the jet. The Iranian authorities also asked officials in the United States and France to send the equipment needed to decode the jet’s flight data recorders, or “black boxes,” a request certain to frustrate countries that have called for greater international involvement in investigating the disaster, which killed all 176 onboard. The downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8 came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that included tit-for-tat military strikes, and after the killing of the top Iranian security commander, Maj. General Qassim Suleimani, in a United States drone strike at the Baghdad airport. The plane was shot down the same day Iran fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house United States troops, in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani. After days of denials, Iranian officials acknowledged that the downing was the result of “human error,” prompting angry protests across Iran. A preliminary report from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, released on Tuesday, corroborated a video verified by The New York Times last week that showed two missiles, fired from a military site, exploding near the plane. Iranian investigators had established that two Tor-M1 missiles had been fired at the plane, the statement said, adding that the investigation was looking into their effect on the crash. The crash’s victims included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, heightening calls for an international investigation. But many have accused Iran of dragging its feet, a complaint likely to be bolstered by the suggestion on Tuesday that the plane’s black boxes would be analyzed in Iran instead of being sent abroad. The Iranian aviation organzation said it had asked United States and French aviation authorities to provide the equipment needed to decode the data recorders on the Boeing 737 because it did not have the necessary technology. “If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time,” the agency said in its report. “Until now, these countries have not given a positive response to sending the equipment.” That appeared to contradict a statement by Hassan Rezaifar, a head investigator for the same organization, who on Saturday said the jet’s data recorders would be sent to Ukraine at the request of the country’s authorities. It also appeared odd that Tehran would request help from the United States, a longtime adversary whose president has embarked on a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran, including stepping up sanctions that have prevented Iran from importing sensitive technologies. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called for Iran to hand over the recorders and accused it of violating protocols for accident sites by bulldozing debris from the crash before the investigation was complete. Canada, too, has criticized Iran’s level of cooperation, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Iran should give the recorders to France for analysis. There was no immediate comment from officials in the United States, Canada or Ukraine about Iran’s equipment request.']",
Why These Australia Fires Are Like Nothing We’ve Seen Before,2020-01-21,By Jamie Tarabay,"['SYDNEY, Australia — In late October, lightning struck brittle earth on Gospers Mountain in New South Wales. The remains of trees bone dry from consecutive winters with little to no rain were ignited, and the fire quickly spread. Three months later, it is still burning. The Gospers Mountain fire, which became Australia’s largest “megablaze” as it grew to link several separate fires, offers a sense of the scale of the country’s most disastrous fire season ever. The blaze has burned two million acres, enveloping hinterland and wine country, and prompted a special mission to save prehistoric trees so rare that their exact location is kept secret. That fire is now largely contained. But dozens of others are still burning in the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, some out of control, despite heavy rain in some areas in recent days. And fire season is far from over — hot and windy conditions are expected to return this week, and a month of summer remains. Here is a look at the devastation. The modern world has never seen anything quite like these Australia fires. About 16 million acres have burned in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis is centered. That’s an area about the size of West Virginia. Millions more acres have burned in other parts of the country. What sets these blazes apart, in terms of their size, is that they are happening in populated areas. Until now, fires this large happened mostly in places like northern Canada or Siberia, where few people live and blazes burn largely uncontrolled. “What we’re seeing in Australia, in a completely different environment, are fires that are approaching or even exceeding the magnitude of things that we only saw in the most remote forested regions in the world,” said Ross Bradstock, the director of the Center for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales. “We’re looking at a globally significant fire season in Australia,” he added. The numbers from Australia dwarf those from some of the most high-profile fires in recent years. The bushfires in southeastern Australia this season have burned about eight times as much land as the 2018 fires in California, which covered nearly two million acres and were the worst in that state’s recorded history. They are also far larger than the estimates of 2.2 million acres burned by September last year in the Amazon basin, where farmers, some emboldened by the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, ignited tens of thousands of fires to clear land. “It’s quite phenomenal and far exceeds anything you would see in the western U.S.A., which is a very fire-prone area, the southwest of Canada, the Mediterranean and parts of South America,” Dr. Bradstock said. “It’s so much bigger than anything else.” Australia has had deadlier fire seasons: The Black Saturday bushfires, which began in February 2009 when downed power lines ignited blazes that were spread by 60-mile-per-hour winds, killed 173 people in Victoria. The 2018 California fires killed 103 people. But the losses Australia is experiencing in lives and property are still staggering, and not yet over. At least 29 people have been killed. Hundreds of millions of animals, by some estimates, have perished or are facing starvation or dehydration in devastated habitats. And more than 2,500 homes have been destroyed. Smoke generated by the fires has blanketed Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, at times giving them some of the worst air in the world. The prolonged exposure of bushfire smoke to millions of people has raised fears of health effects that could last for years. Early this month, NASA began tracking a plume of smoke from the fires that was the size of the continental United States. By Jan. 14, smoke had circumnavigated the globe, returning to eastern Australia. Along the way, it caused hazardous breathing conditions in New Zealand and discolored skies in South America. The fires have also produced huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon emissions. A top expert on greenhouse gas emissions at Australia’s national research agency told NPR that the fires in southeastern Australia had produced as much carbon as the entire country emits from man-made sources in more than eight months of the year. Why have these fires been so vast? While Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, climate change is bringing longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat. That makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. Last year was the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, and some regions have been gripped by drought for years. This season, the fires started earlier than usual — some as soon as July — and they are expected to last well into February and even March. High temperatures, strong winds and dry forests have combined to create the conditions for powerful fires. There have even been blazes in wetlands and rainforests that have not contended with this threat before. To combat the flames, tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers, have been called on to work long days over extended periods. Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have misleadingly pointed to arson in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian government’s inaction on the issue. Others have argued that the drought is unrelated to climate change, though there is evidence that warming temperatures have been a major contributor to it, in part by pushing rain out of areas where it once fell. “The wildfires decimating Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and coalescing into the country’s worst peacetime catastrophe precisely because of climate change,” said Paul Read, a co-director of the National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University in Melbourne. In Australia’s history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El Niño pattern. But that is not the case this time, showing how much this season stands out and the danger the country faces with more unpredictable weather patterns in the future. While scientists have long predicted that climate change would bring longer and more intense fire seasons, the blazes were not expected to be this bad this soon, Dr. Bradstock said. Under his projections, Australia would not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years, he said. “I guess I’m as shocked as anyone about what’s unfolding and, probably, like everyone else who’s involved and affected, we’ll very quickly recalibrate thinking about what we’re doing,” he said. Recalibrating means expecting these phenomenal fires to continue to occur, particularly as Australia’s drought shows few signs of ending and temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade on record. “We would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off phenomenon,” Dr. Bradstock said. “I think we have to get ready to deal with a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.”']","More than 16 million acres have gone up in flames. And it has happened in populated areas, unlike most of the world’s other blazes of this scale."
This 3-Year-Old May Be Smarter Than You,2020-01-22,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — He reads fluently (while wearing a Gruffalo costume), he does math with ease and he can explain scientific concepts such as how rain forms. He is also 3 years old. The toddler, Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, was invited last week to join Mensa, a British society whose membership rules require an I.Q. in the top 2 percent of the population. Haryz, as his family calls him, received an invitation to the society after meeting with a consultant psychologist who assigned him a score of 142 using the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. Scoring above 145 is considered “genius or near genius,” according to the test’s website. The 3-year-old is now Mensa’s youngest current member, the society said in an email on Wednesday. The youngest-ever member was age 2 years 4 months at the time of joining. Haryz’s mother, Nur Anira Asyikin, said on Instagram, “My mini brainbox just got invited at his little age to be part of Mensa,” and congratulated her “very very clever” son. Mensa was formed in Oxford, England, in 1946 by Roland Berrill, an Australian lawyer, and Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. It has more than 110,000 members across the world. Meeting the membership criteria usually means taking an I.Q. test supervised by the society. For children under age 10 and a half, Mensa says on its website, an assessment by an educational psychologist must be made. That report is then submitted as evidence to support membership, as happened in the case of Haryz. Ms. Asyikin could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, but she said in a CNN report that her son was “very much your typical 3-year-old,” adding that he particularly enjoyed playing with modeling clay and toy bricks. Ms. Asyikin is an engineer and the family lives in Durham, in northeastern England, according to CNN. An Instagram page dedicated to Haryz’s exploits includes a video of the youngster reading books, including “The Gruffalo,” by Julia Donaldson, singing nursery rhymes, and — just before his second birthday — recounting the story of the Gingerbread Man. In a video posted on his Instagram profile on Tuesday, Haryz does simple mathematics: “Two plus six equals eight,” he tells the camera, drawing numbers and symbols in the air. Ann Clarkson, a Mensa spokeswoman, said in an email on Wednesday that a high I.Q. was “like a toolbox — it gives children the equipment to learn, but they still have to put in the effort and practice to become expert at something.” Though all children are unique, she said, what makes Haryz different is “his ability to learn very quickly and process information fast.” Child prodigies have long caused admiration and interest. Alma Deutscher, from Austria, was composing piano melodies at age 4 and played Carnegie Hall in New York in December at age 14. In Belgium, Laurent Simons, a 9-year-old, was on course last year to become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university. But the pressure that comes with such gifts can take a toll in the long term. Saul Chandler, a former violin prodigy who played Carnegie Hall twice before age 13 and suffered a nervous breakdown by 16, told The New York Times in 2018, then age 70, that if he could forget music, he would. “They turned me into a trained monkey,” he said, adding that he would not want to be remembered for his childhood achievements. “Because I ended up doing a lot of other great things in my life, too.” Despite her obvious delight in Haryz’s talents, Ms. Asyikin hinted at the pressures in an Instagram post. Whatever her son went on to achieve, she wrote, “we will always be proud of you.”']",Muhammad Haryz Nadzim became the youngest current Mensa member after scoring 142 on an I.Q. test.

3 U.S. Firefighters Die in Plane Crash as Australia’s Blazes Intensify,2020-01-23,By Damien Cave and Isabella Kwai,"['PEAK VIEW, Australia — Three firefighters from the United States were killed on Thursday when a large plane carrying fire retardant went down in the mountains south of Canberra, the Australian capital. The fiery crash, on a hill near a wildlife sanctuary, ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires, grounded other water tankers for the day, and spread sadness and grief from Australia to North America. Firefighters working in the area, where forests and farms sit side by side, described hearing a sharp and sudden clap — like the familiar sound of an exploding car, but 10 times as loud. “We’re devastated because those Americans, they’re not going home,” said Alison Myers, a deputy captain with the Numeralla fire brigade, which covers the surrounding district. “It might as well have been one of our own.” It was a tragic reminder that this unpredecented Australian fire season is far from over, and that the scale of what the country is facing has the power to draw in even Americans with years of experience who seek to contribute from above.  The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was operated by Coulson Aviation, a family-owned Canadian company that helped battle last year’s California wildfires and has worked in Australia for more than a decade, leasing firefighting planes and helicopters, with crews included. The victims were identified by the company as Ian McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Mont.; Paul Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Ariz.; and Rick DeMorgan, 43, of Navarre, Fla. All three were military veterans: Mr. McBeth served in the Wyoming and Montana Air National Guards, Mr. Hudson in the Marine Corps, and Mr. DeMorgan in the Air Force. Fire officials said the cause of the disaster was not immediately known. The crash occurred in the early afternoon, just as fire conditions hit their worst, with 90-degree heat and wind gusts racing past 60 miles an hour in a landscape thick with smoke and hills. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the police were investigating the crash, a challenge made more difficult by active fires in the area. On Thursday afternoon, helicopters could be seen hovering overhead in hazy smoke that mingled with storm clouds. On the ground, firefighters hosed down flames around blackened trees and homes left empty except for barking dogs, blocking access to the hill where the plane exploded. Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, said those on board were experienced and well known to their Australian and American colleagues. “Our hearts are with all those that are suffering in what is the loss of three remarkable, well-respected crew that have invested so many decades of their life into firefighting,” he said at a news conference. Chuck Russell, the American liaison to Australia for firefighting, said a mood of mourning had descended on the Richmond air base, northwest of Sydney, where the aircraft and pilots were based. “We’re a family,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re contract, if you’re from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, America, and what we’re doing tonight is coming together. We’re talking about things. We’re trying to fire out the whys and the whats.” “It’s a hard moment that we’re all in,” he added. Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, said the crash was a “stark and horrible” reminder of the dangers and risks of firefighting. At least five firefighters — three in New South Wales and two in the state of Victoria — had already been killed this fire season. The overall death toll from the bush fires now exceeds 30. More than 2,500 homes have been destroyed, and millions of acres have burned. American firefighters have been heavily involved since at least early December. But as the blazes have intensified, dozens more have arrived to help, extending a history of firefighting collaboration between the two countries that goes back almost two decades. In 2018, as California was in the grip of its worst fire season ever, more than 130 Australian and New Zealand wildfire experts traveled there and to the Pacific Northwest to battle blazes, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Since December, about 200 American fire personnel have been deployed to Australia, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis has been centered. Some of the visiting firefighters have been part of elite ground crews, but far more have arrived with expertise in fire management, planning and aviation. Firefighting aircraft have become a major priority in Australia. Officials started with plans for only a handful of leased tankers, but as pressure on Australia’s volunteer firefighters has intensified, the government has increased the size of its rented fleet. More than 70 firefighting aircraft were being used in New South Wales on Thursday, Ms. Berejiklian said. The companies that provide the aircraft, like Coulson Aviation, tend to be boutique family-owned businesses that send the planes to several countries, with demand growing worldwide as fire seasons lengthen and intensify because of climate change. Foster Coulson, the president of Coulson Aviation, said by telephone that he needed to let the Rural Fire Service share initial details. He later released a statement that said a team from his company would soon arrive to assist emergency services. It was unclear whether the bodies of the crew members had been recovered as of Thursday night, nor was it clear if the crash would alter how Australia fights fires, or how tankers are used. The large planes that have the greatest capacity to drop water or fire retardant engage in complicated natural warfare. Small spotter planes or helicopters usually guide them into specific locations, but with wind shifts and smoke, they often fly with little or no visibility. Conditions often prevent them from flying at all, rendering them less of a savior than the public and politicians often believe. On Thursday, by all accounts, conditions were dangerous. “It was blowing a gale, mate,” said Ken Bowerman, a volunteer firefighter in Bredbo, a small town not far from where the plane crashed. “We’re in extraordinary times.” Rain in recent days — a torrent in some areas, a few drops in others — had offered a small reprieve. But on Thursday, with temperatures soaring over 100 degrees in previously fire-stricken states like New South Wales, including a high of 110 at Sydney’s airport, fire officials once again issued emergency warnings. Earlier in the day, fires approached the suburbs of Canberra, forcing the closing of its airport to flights. Residents in the affected areas around the capital were told that driving could be deadly and that they should seek immediate shelter. In other parts of the country, which has been gripped by drought and has just ended its hottest and driest year on record, dust storms covered towns. Brown rain fell in Melbourne, discoloring the Yarra River. But the worst impacts of the day were felt in the rural mountain towns south of Canberra, where the fires in Peak View were among more than 80 that were burning, half of them out of control. From the mountains to the coast, firefighters reported homes burning, even as the police and emergency service personnel clustered near the crash site. In Numeralla, where ash-faced firefighters gathered at the local fire station late on Thursday after a 12-hour shift, appreciation mixed with sadness and fatigue. Some of the volunteers, pointing to a map on a plastic table, said they believed the plane had been trying to protect a group of houses lining a gravel road through the area. A small circle of ink showed the location — between the flames and a dry riverbed named Good Creek.']",The disaster ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires.
"Northern Ireland Now Has a Government, but Schools and Hospitals Are in Crisis",2020-01-22,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — The dust covers came off Northern Ireland’s regional government this month after a three-year period of political paralysis and dysfunction, laying bare a state of deep crisis across the territory’s neglected public and political institutions. Residents of Northern Ireland expressed relief after the breakthrough, especially as it comes in time for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union on Jan. 31 and will mean that the region has representation to set out its priorities in the process. But many wonder whether and how the regional government will be able to overhaul public services like health and education that have declined to the point of near collapse. “Having three years without institutions in which parties really either didn’t speak to each other to restore the institutions or were not willing to reach any sort of compromise has had an impact on the trust in the institution,” said Elodie Fabre, a politics expert at Queen’s University Belfast. “Whereas right now there’s a bit of optimism,” she said, “there’s also a lot of cynicism over how this is all going to solved and how the parties are going to work together again.” Power sharing was restored at Stormont, the regional legislature that had collapsed in 2017 over sectarian divides on social and cultural policies, after the main political parties reached an agreement brokered by the governments of Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Its dual leadership structure consists of two parties: Sinn Fein, which supports unification with the Republic of Ireland; and the Democratic Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Both lost support in last month’s British general election because of their inability to solve their political differences and revive their regional government. As the region’s newly appointed ministers started to tackle some of the key issues last week, they faced major stumbling blocks over how to pay for the pledges made in the government’s new agreement. The British government said that it would inject 2 billion pounds, about $2.6 billion, into Stormont’s budget to support the new deal. But the region’s finance minister, Conor Murphey, described the offer as an “act of bad faith” that falls short of what is needed. “The bottom line is with this proposed package, our public services face a shortfall of at least £1 billion next year alone,” he said in a statement. Julian Smith, Britain’s secretary of state for Northern Ireland, defended the proposed financial package and urged the region’s ministers to “get on with it.” Stormont’s top priority is to save the health and social care service. Both the first minister and the deputy first minister made commitments during the assembly’s first sitting on Saturday to put the health service before party politics. The health minister, Robin Swann, pledged £109 million to settle a dispute with thousands of nurses who have been carrying out strikes for weeks over pay parity and staffing shortages. “Pay parity with England can be restored,” he told lawmakers. “Our nurses and other great health and social care workers can come off the picket line, can get back to the job that they love and do so well.” The nurses welcomed the announcement but said they would not end the strike until they had received a formal commitment from the minister on safe staffing levels. “From the period that we have worked without an assembly, our nurse vacancy in that period doubled,” said Pat Cullen, the director of the Royal College of Nursing, “simply because we had no decision makers in place, no one in charge, no political leadership and everything was just in a state of inertia.” Northern Ireland has the highest rate of nurse vacancies in the United Kingdom, at 14 percent — the equivalent of about 2,800 nurses absent from work each day. Ms. Cullen says the gap has placed huge pressure on nursing staff, who are presenting with mental health issues and sickness resulting from trying to fill the empty slots. “They are not able to switch off, because as soon as they get home the phone starts to ring, and a manager is begging and pleading with them to come in the next day and fill in for someone,” Ms. Cullen said. “They never get a break.” “Then, when they get to work,” she said, “they are having to care for the patients that are in the 24 beds within their ward, but finding that there’s another four or five beds lined up on the corridors.” Northern Ireland’s health service is also struggling to cope with hospital waiting lists that have expanded to record levels. About 300,000 people are waiting for treatment, according to figures published by Britain’s Department of Health. More than 100,000 people have been on a waiting list for over a year for surgeries like hip or knee replacements, Ms. Cullen said. Education is another critical issue. The government will have to settle a long-running dispute with teachers over pay and workload, as well as helping hundreds of financially stretched schools. More than 400 schools in Northern Ireland —\xa022 percent of the total —\xa0were unable to balance their books in 2019, according to the region’s Education Authority. “The value of the budget that’s been going to schools has been going down year by year while the total enrollment numbers in schools has been going up,” said Tony Gallagher, a professor of education at Queen’s University Belfast. “The practical problem is how schools can deliver the curriculum they’re supposed to deliver,” he said. “Sometimes they’re using part-time teachers. Sometimes they’re trying to use all sorts of cover.” Sara Long, the Education Authority’s director, says that another urgent matter is how to look after students with complex special educational needs, whose numbers have increased in recent years. Northern Ireland’s education minister, Peter Weir, said last week that he would put £45 million from a government education enhancement program toward improving 18 schools. “For any incoming minister, there are major challenges out there in terms of resources,” he told lawmakers, adding that “there is a very strong need to ensure that we get the best possible delivery for all our children.” The region is also grappling with the consequences of its bloody three-decade guerrilla war, which ended in 1998. Northern Ireland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and although there are numerous underlying factors, such as poverty and underfunded mental health services, experts point especially to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the conflict. “The trauma of the conflict does not just affect people who were involved in it,” Ms. Fabre said. “There’s a generational element that gets passed down to young people today.” The region, she added, “is paying for the reconstruction of Northern Irish society on top of everything else.”']","After three years with no regional government, newly appointed ministers are scrambling to save a range of institutions that are on the brink of collapse."
Glenn Greenwald Charged With Cybercrimes in Brazil,2020-01-21,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Tuesday charged the American journalist Glenn Greenwald with cybercrimes for his role in bringing to light cellphone messages that have embarrassed prosecutors and tarnished the image of an anticorruption task force. In a criminal complaint made public on Tuesday, prosecutors in the capital, Brasília, accused Mr. Greenwald of being part of a “criminal organization” that hacked into the cellphones of several prosecutors and other public officials last year. Mr. Greenwald, an ardent critic of Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a deeply polarizing figure in Brazil, where his work is lionized by leftists and condemned as partisan and heavy handed by officials in the Bolsonaro administration. The news organization Mr. Greenwald co-founded, The Intercept Brasil, published articles last year based on the leaked cellphone messages that raised questions about the integrity and the motives of key members of Brazil’s justice system. The articles cast doubt on the impartiality of a former judge, Sérgio Moro, and of some of the prosecutors who worked on a corruption investigation that landed several powerful political and business figures in prison. Among those charged in connection with the corruption investigation was a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular leftist whose conviction paved the way for the election of Mr. Bolsonaro. Mr. Moro was the judge who handled that case, and he is now Mr. Bolsonaro’s minister of justice. The charges against Mr. Greenwald raise concerns among journalists and advocates for a free press because journalists often rely on confidential or leaked information, sometimes obtained by whistle-blowers or hackers. Mr. Greenwald has been part of a team that won some of the most important prizes in journalism — the George Polk Award and the Pulitzer Prize for public service — for reporting on documents that described government surveillance. The documents were passed on to him by Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor with the National Security Agency of the United States who later faced espionage charges in connection with the leak. In a statement Mr. Greenwald called the charges “an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about Minister Moro and the Bolsonaro government.” Mr. Greenwald, who has not been detained, said he intended to continue publishing and cast the case against him as a test of Brazil’s democracy. “We will not be intimidated by these tyrannical attempts to silence journalists,” he said. In a 95-page criminal complaint, prosecutors say that The Intercept Brasil, the news organization Mr. Greenwald co-founded, did more than merely receive the hacked messages and oversee the publication of newsworthy information. Citing intercepted messages between Mr. Greenwald and the hackers, prosecutors say the journalist played a “clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime.” For instance, prosecutors contend that Mr. Greenwald encouraged the hackers to delete archives that had already been shared with The Intercept Brasil, in order to cover their tracks. Prosecutors also say that Mr. Greenwald was communicating with the hackers while they were actively monitoring private chats on Telegram, a messaging app. The complaint charged six other individuals, including four who were detained last year in connection with the cellphone hacking. Legal experts and leftist politicians criticized the decision to charge Mr. Greenwald, calling the evidence outlined against him thin. Thiago Bottino, a legal expert at Fundação Getúlio Vargas University in Rio de Janeiro, said prosecutors had not described evidence that suggests Mr. Greenwald broke the law. “There’s nothing in the complaint showing that he helped or guided” the hackers, he said. Mr. Bottino said Brazil’s case law gave journalists broad protections. “You can’t punish a journalist for divulging a document that was obtained through criminal means,” he said. Gleisi Hoffman, the president of the Workers’ Party, the largest opposition party, called the charge an abuse of power. “They want a police state, with more farces, illegalities and arbitrary acts,” she wrote in a message on Twitter. Mr. Greenwald moved to Brazil in 2005 after meeting David Miranda, a Brazilian man whom he later married and who became a federal congressman last year. Mr. Greenwald first became widely known for his role in the release of classified national security documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. He co-founded The Intercept Brasil in 2016. Mr. Greenwald expressed concern last year that the authorities might charge him criminally as a reprisal for The Intercept Brasil’s reporting based on the leaked messages. Mr. Bolsonaro left little doubt that he would relish seeing the journalist punished. In late July, the president used a derisive term to refer to Mr. Greenwald and said the journalist “might wind up in jail.” Mr. Greenwald’s concerns were partly based on reports that federal officials were investigating his finances. Those reports led a Supreme Court justice, Gilmar Mendes, to issue an extraordinary order barring the federal police from investigating Mr. Greenwald’s role in the dissemination of the hacked messages. Prosecutors on Tuesday said they had abided by that order until they found audio messages which, they argued, implicated Mr. Greenwald in criminal activity. The charges came as a “huge surprise,” Mr. Greenwald said in an interview on Tuesday, because the Federal Police issued a report in December that cleared him of having engaged in criminal conduct related to the phone hacks. Mr. Greenwald said he had been methodical in his dealings with the source who gave him the leaked chats, mindful of the lessons he had learned in the Snowden case. “The one thing I could not do is give direction,” Mr. Greenwald said. “That’s crossing a line. I was very careful.” The prosecutor who filed the case, Wellington Oliveira, last month charged the president of Brazil’s bar association with libel for making disparaging remarks about Mr. Moro. A federal judge recently dismissed the case, ruling that Mr. Oliveira’s argument lacked a solid legal base. The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed alarm over the case against Mr. Greenwald. “Charging journalists with criminal activity based on interactions with sources sends a chilling message to reporters working on sensitive stories at a time when the Brazilian media is increasingly under attack from officials in its own government,” said Natalie Southwick, the program coordinator at the committee who monitors press freedom in Latin America. Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Letícia Casado from Brasília.']",Mr. Greenwald is accused of being part of a “criminal investigation” that hacked into the cellphones of prosecutors and public officials.
"Trump, in Davos to Talk Trade, Lashes Out at Enemies Back Home",2020-01-22,By Annie Karni,"['DAVOS, Switzerland — President Trump said on Wednesday that he would prefer a long impeachment trial with witness testimony before the Senate, but that national security concerns made that impossible, and added that he would like to attend the trial. Mr. Trump unleashed on Democrats and the news media in a wide-ranging news conference before leaving Davos, where he met with business and government leaders from around the world, to return to Washington, where impeachment overshadows all else. A day earlier, Mr. Trump managed to stick to a script about a strong United States economy while addressing a global audience at the World Economic Forum, and he largely swatted away any questions about the impeachment proceedings. But before leaving Switzerland, he called a last-minute news conference, during which he vented at length about his political enemies in Washington as some of his top economic advisers stood silently behind him. Mr. Trump called Representative Jerry Nadler of New York a “sleaze bag” and referred to Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as a “con job” and a “corrupt politician.” The president referred to Mr. Schiff and the other House impeachment managers as “major sleaze bags” and said he would love to attend his own trial in order to “sit right in the front row and stare into their corrupt faces.” But he acknowledged that his lawyers would most likely advise him against doing so. Mr. Trump’s comments ran counter to the actions of Senate Republicans, who have turned back Democrats’ attempts to subpoena documents and compel White House officials to testify in the impeachment trial. Mr. Trump claimed that he favored a drawn-out process that would allow witnesses like John Bolton, the former national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but said that allowing them to testify would create “a national security problem.” But Mr. Trump also expressed reservations about the idea of Mr. Bolton, whom he forced out in September, appearing as a witness because “you don’t like people testifying when they didn’t leave on good terms.” He said his break with Mr. Bolton was “due to me, not due to him.” White House officials had hoped that the World Economic Forum would give the president an opportunity to highlight economic successes that they see as being supplanted at home by the impeachment investigations and, now, a trial. Mr. Trump began the news conference on Wednesday by pointing out economic gains and claiming that “Davos has treated us beautifully.” But after a day of ignoring reporters’ questions, he appeared eager to discuss the impeachment proceedings. He said that the White House would be right to assert executive privilege to block Mr. Bolton from testifying, even as he claimed he was open to hearing from his former adviser. “John would certainly fit into that,” he said. “When he knows my thoughts on certain people and other governments, war and peace and different things, that’s a national security problem.” He said a “national security problem” would also stand in the way of Mr. Pompeo appearing before the Senate. He cited an October appearance by Mr. Mulvaney on “Fox News Sunday” as the reason his testimony under oath was not necessary. “He’s really expressed himself very well when he did a Chris Wallace interview,” Mr. Trump said. “I think there’s not much to add.” Mr. Trump appeared eager to defy expectations that he would pick a fight with another high-profile guest at the conference, the 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom he has criticized in the past. “She beat me out on Time magazine,” Mr. Trump said, referring to her being named Time’s person of the year in December. “I would have loved to have seen her speak,” he said, but he recommended she “start working on those other countries,” because “our water numbers, our numbers on air, are tremendous.” Mr. Trump also launched a broadside against the news media, even as he congratulated an NBC News television correspondent, Kristen Welker, on a promotion and hinted that he might be willing to appear on her show. “If we could straighten out the press in our country, we would have a place that would be so incredible,” he said. Mr. Trump also insisted that his side of the story was the easy one to explain, and that he was simply a target because of his own success. “I’m honest,” he said. “I make great deals.”']","The White House hoped the president’s trip to the World Economic Forum would shift attention away from impeachment, but an impromptu news conference often turned to the drama in Washington."
"Guaidó, Promising Change for Venezuela, Fails to Conquer Davos",2020-01-23,By Mark Landler,"['DAVOS, Switzerland — This time last year, Juan Guaidó would have been the toast of Davos. Mr. Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, had just led a wave of popular unrest to win the presidency of Venezuela’s National Assembly and declared himself the true leader of his crisis-ridden country. But as Mr. Guaidó made the rounds at this year’s gathering of political and business figures — having come to Europe in defiance of a travel ban at home — he seemed like a man whose moment had passed. With Venezuela’s repressive president, Nicolás Maduro, still firmly entrenched in power, and with Mr. Guaidó’s most prominent backer, President Trump, distracted by his Senate trial and his re-election campaign, the embattled Venezuelan spent most of his time answering questions about why he had not succeeded in toppling Mr. Maduro. “We underestimated the ability of the regime to do bad,” Mr. Guaidó told a half-filled hall where, two days earlier, Mr. Trump had spoken to a standing-room-only crowd. “We are really climbing a mountain at the moment.” Mr. Guaidó insisted that he and his supporters would still uproot the Maduro government. He urged European leaders to crack down on Venezuela’s gold trade, which he said had helped consolidate Mr. Maduro’s control by providing a means of foreign exchange and helping to secure the loyalty of the military. But Mr. Guaidó struggled to offer fresh ideas for how governments could tighten the pressure on Mr. Maduro. Venezuela is already under heavy sanctions, which have so far failed to dislodge him. In an election year, the United States is less likely than ever to consider more aggressive options, like military intervention. In Washington, the most vocal proponent of Mr. Guaidó — the former national security adviser John R. Bolton — has left the administration. Mr. Trump did not mention Venezuela during his speech in Davos; he left the Alpine ski resort on Wednesday without seeing Mr. Guaidó. That left the Venezuelan with a lineup of meetings that included the leaders of Austria, Greece and the Netherlands, as well as a session with a Davos regular, Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. On Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó met in London with Britain’s current prime minister, Boris Johnson. “The idea behind all these meetings is the same,” Mr. Guaidó said to journalists, speaking through a translator. “People should stop seeing Venezuela as an insoluble problem.” But then he likened Venezuela to Syria, Yemen, and South Sudan — three war-torn states that are often viewed as insoluble problems. Although Venezuela is not in a state of war, Mr. Guaidó noted that millions of people had fled the country in search of food or medical care. Those who remain behind are in grinding poverty, living on wages of as little as $3.50 a month, even for nurses and other professionals. The government has turned up its repression, jailing and torturing members of the opposition. Mr. Guaidó himself took a big risk in leaving the country. He declined to describe how he evaded security forces, except to say that they were not particularly efficient, and his team managed to distract them. Still, Mr. Guaidó faces the possibility of harsh reprisals when he returns home. “Going back to Venezuela will not be easy,” he said. “I do hope I can get home safe and sound.” Just before flying to Europe, Mr. Guaidó met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bogotá, Colombia. The United States is one of more than 50 countries that recognizes Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Mr. Pompeo insisted the administration had not retreated in its determination to see Mr. Maduro ousted, and expressed hope that it could still happen. “I’ve heard this idea that we’ve underestimated Maduro,” Mr. Pompeo said to reporters. “What’s been underestimated is the desire for freedom that rests in the hearts of the Venezuelan people.” American officials said Mr. Guaidó’s visit to Davos was valuable because it would put a human face on the struggle in Venezuela. Despite making headlines over the past year, Mr. Guaidó, 36, remains something of an abstraction to people outside Latin America, according to a senior official. By telling his own story, this person said, Mr. Guaidó could still mobilize support among the Europeans, who would be critical in imposing effective sanctions and halting the gold trade. As Mr. Guaidó analyzed his problems over the last year, he pointed to an offer made by the opposition of amnesty to members of the military who would agree to turn against the Maduro government. The offer did not peel away senior officers, in part because Mr. Maduro gave them access to lucrative gold mines. They have remained a bulwark of support for him. “We tried to do this, but it sort of rebounded on us,” Mr. Guaidó said. “It is really the top brass of the military that are behind him.”']","A year after he declared himself president, the opposition leader cut an embattled figure at the World Economic Forum."
Powerful Winter Storm in Spain Kills at Least 10,2020-01-23,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A powerful winter storm in Spain has killed at least 10 people after battering the country for days, destroying bridges, cutting off roads and railway lines and flooding vast swaths of farmland. Even as the storm moved north, setting off weather alerts for parts of France, tens of thousands of people across Spain were still recovering on Thursday from driving rains and pounding waves that wreaked havoc in coastal towns and villages. Farther inland, residents began the process of digging themselves out after heavy snowfalls that left villages cut off from assistance. Since last weekend, the eastern coast of Spain has been regularly hit by winds that reached over 60 miles per hour, the strongest in the country since 1992, according to the Spanish weather service. Videos posted to social media showed giant waves crashing into the shoreline, streets buried under mountains of sea foam and whole beaches seemingly swallowed by the sea. In the Balearic Islands, which are in the Mediterranean off eastern Spain, waves cresting at more than 45 feet swept away some popular beaches and smashed into seafront houses. Dani Palacios, the head of beach services for Barcelona, told the local broadcaster Betevé that it was the worst storm the region had seen in decades. On Wednesday, another 600 people were evacuated from their homes in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain. The authorities advised other residents living near the Ter and Onyar rivers to either leave their houses or move to an upstairs floor, amid fears that further rainfall could cause both rivers to burst their banks. The death toll climbed to 10 on Wednesday after the authorities confirmed that a man was killed in the port of Palamós, a town in Catalonia, as he tried to check the state of his boat. Emergency services in Palamós were continuing to search for another person who is believed to have fallen into the sea, one of several people in the area still reported missing since the passage of the storm. Three other people are missing in the Balearic Islands, including a British man who was exploring the area’s canyons when the storm hit. One of the worst affected spots was the delta of the Ebro River, where rice paddies were flooded by the surge of the sea, which advanced nearly two miles inland. “We can’t remember anything similar ever happening,” Mayor Lluis Soler of Deltebre told the radio station Cadena SER. “It’s dramatic to see how the river has overflowed and the sea has traveled.” Deadly storms have hit Spain this winter. A few days before Christmas, six people were killed in different parts of the country by storms that also swept through Portugal and southern France, also forcing flight cancellations and the temporary closing of part rail and road networks. It could be some time before the full extent of the damage wrought by this storm comes into focus, particularly in the farming areas of eastern Spain.']","Coastal towns were lashed by 45-foot waves, and villages farther inland were buried under mountains of snow."
U.N. Court Orders Myanmar to Protect Rohingya Muslims,2020-01-23,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Rejecting arguments made by Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the International Court of Justice at The Hague ruled on Thursday that Myanmar must take action to protect Rohingya Muslims, who have been killed and driven from their homes in what the country’s accusers call a campaign of genocide. The court said Myanmar must “take all measures within its power” to prevent its military or others from carrying out genocidal acts against the Rohingya, who it said faced “real and imminent risk.” It also essentially put Myanmar under court oversight, telling it to submit regular reports to the tribunal explaining what steps it had taken. The decision is the first international court ruling against Myanmar over its military’s brutal treatment of the Rohingya. While the court has no enforcement power, any member of the United Nations can request action from the Security Council based on its rulings. “The chances of Aung San Suu Kyi implementing this ruling will be zero unless significant international pressure is applied,” said Anna Roberts, executive director of the rights group Burma Campaign UK. The nation of Gambia brought the case to the tribunal, the United Nations’ highest court, in November on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Gambia’s legal team asked the court to condemn Myanmar for violating the Genocide Convention. A ruling on that question could be years away. But Gambia also asked the court for more immediate action: a temporary injunction ordering Myanmar to halt all actions that could make the Rohingya’s situation worse, including further extrajudicial killings, rape, hate speech or the leveling of homes where Rohingya once lived. The tribunal held three days of hearings on that issue last month. Ruling in Gambia’s favor on Thursday, the court did not give Myanmar any specific instructions for ensuring the Rohingya’s safety. But it said the country must ensure that they are not subjected to acts of genocide, including killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm, or deliberately imposing conditions meant to bring about the destruction of the Rohingya population. The court, headed by Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf of Somalia, also ordered Myanmar to report back within four months on what steps it has taken, to preserve evidence relevant to the genocide case, and to submit further reports to the court every six months after that for as long as the case remains open. Attorneys representing Myanmar and Gambia in The Hague could not immediately be reached for comment. Spokesmen for the military and for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was not in court on Thursday, also could not be reached. In 2017, Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, waged a brutal assault against the Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, prompting more than 700,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they now live in squalid conditions in the world’s largest refugee camp. United Nations officials have said the campaign amounted to genocide. Investigators say thousands were killed. Surviving Rohingya have described such atrocities as the murder of children and the gang rape of women and girls by soldiers. About half a million Rohingya are still in Myanmar, also known as Burma, including about 100,000 people who were forced from their homes — some of them in waves of violence that preceded the 2017 campaign — and now live in camps. The Gambia legal team argued that they are in “grave danger” of further genocidal acts. Myanmar rejected the ruling in a statement from its Foreign Affairs Ministry. “The unsubstantiated condemnation of Myanmar by some human rights actors has presented a distorted picture of the situation in Rakhine,” it said. A spokesman for the military, Gen. Myat Kyaw, said before the ruling that if commanders are presented with evidence of war crimes, they will pursue them. “We will take action in accordance with the military judicial framework if there is a war crime,” he said. “What the Tatmadaw did was a just war. If individuals violated the law, we will take action by military court.” Earlier this week, a panel appointed by Myanmar’s government found that war crimes had indeed taken place during the 2017 campaign. But the so-called Independent Commission of Enquiry said it had found no evidence of “genocidal intent” in the military’s actions, which it said were in response to attacks by a rebel force, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. “War crimes, serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law took place during the security operations,” the commission said in a summary of its report released Tuesday. It said there was evidence that the security forces were involved in several mass killings of civilians, which may have claimed the lives of as many as 900 people. But it said it did not find credible statements to support the widely reported allegations of gang rape by the security forces. The panel called for further investigation and prosecution of human rights violations and war crimes. Human rights advocates said the report was an improvement over previous government investigations, but that it fell far short of the panel’s responsibility to uncover the truth and hold the military accountable. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon who received the Nobel Peace Prize, traveled to The Hague in December to speak on Myanmar’s behalf at the hearings — essentially, defending the same military that kept her under house arrest for 15 years. At the hearings, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi heard gruesome accounts of summary executions, babies thrown to their deaths, mass rapes and whole villages burned to the ground. When it was her turn to speak, she did not directly address those accusations, but told the court, “Genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis.” Throughout her argument, she avoided the term Rohingya, a word that Myanmar rejects because it implies the group’s legitimacy as an ethnic minority within Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist country. Most people in the country call them Bengalis, suggesting that they are interlopers from Bangladesh. On Thursday, hours before the court’s ruling, The Financial Times published an opinion article by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, in which she pointed to the commission’s report this week as evidence that Myanmar was pursuing justice. She also said Gambia’s case against Myanmar was “precariously dependent on statements by refugees in camps in Bangladesh,” who she said “may have provided inaccurate or exaggerated information.” Under Myanmar’s military-drafted Constitution, the power of civilian leaders is sharply limited, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has no control over the military and many other parts of the government. As she heads into elections at the end of this year, her dramatic court appearance at The Hague could help shore up support among voters and distract from her party’s poor economic performance. “The military who committed the crimes should thank her,” said Ko Win Hlaing, a taxi driver who helped organize a rally to support Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi last month in the city of Mandalay. “You might see the critics of Aung San Suu Kyi on Twitter because international communities are mostly on Twitter,” he added. “But on Facebook, most people support her and I’m sure her party will win again in coming elections. I feel that she is the real mother of our country.” Saw Nang contributed reporting from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Marlise Simons from Sydney, Australia.']","The injunction was issued by the International Court of Justice at The Hague, where accusations of genocide have been brought against the Southeast Asian country."
Mystery of the Royal Family of Oudh Unravels a Bit More,2020-01-23,By Ellen Barry and Suhasini Raj,"['For 40 years, a reclusive family in Delhi presented itself as the last surviving heirs to the princely state of Oudh, which once ruled a swath of northern India. The three of them — the mother, and her adult son and daughter — were an incredible story, living in a ruined palace in a forest, a living link to India’s ancient, traumatic past. In November, The Times published an investigation of the family’s true origins, revealing that their claims of royal lineage were in large part invention. They were an ordinary family displaced by Partition, the bloody separation of Pakistan and India in 1947. The Begum, or queen of Oudh, was actually Wilayat Butt, the widow of a Pakistani civil servant. Her son, Prince Cyrus, was actually Mickey Butt; her daughter, Princess Sakina, was Farhad Butt. After the article ran, The Times received hundreds of letters and emails, including a few valuable leads that helped unearth more information about the family. Special thanks to two sharp-eyed readers, Venkat Singh and Iftikhar Drabu, who contacted us with new information. Here is some of what we’ve been able to find out since then. 1) How was this Pakistani family able to return to India, 15 years after Partition? Wilayat Butt and her children were Pakistani citizens, but they used political connections to secure the right to resettle in Kashmir, where she and her husband had family roots, a dogged effort that was documented in a 58-page dossier by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. In petitions starting in 1962, Mrs. Butt argued that she faced persecution in Pakistan because of her political activism. She claimed that her husband, a top official at Pakistan Aviation, was fatally poisoned in 1951; that one of her sons was killed in an “Air Force plane crash”; and that she had suffered “inhuman tortures” at the hands of the authorities after she publicly confronted Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra over the status of Kashmir. “As long as we lived there, our lives, property, future and everything was constantly in danger due to the conspiracy and the policy of the ruling authorities to ruin us, just because of difference in political views,” she wrote. She makes no mention of any connection to the royal family of Oudh. She also omits any mention of her oldest son, who was a decorated officer in Pakistan’s Air Force — a fact that would have unsettled her Indian patrons — and says nothing about the existence of family and property in Pakistan. The dossier suggests Indian officials were split on what to do about the family. “We are of the view that there appear to be no reasonable grounds on which she could base her claim to resettle in the Jammu and Kashmir State,” an Intelligence Bureau official wrote. But she was viewed sympathetically by senior officials in Jammu and Kashmir, including an old friend who had become the state’s leader. In July 1963, the government concluded that Mrs. Butt and her children should be allowed to legally remain in India on a year-to-year basis, “subject to good behavior,” but that they would not receive Indian citizenship. So their legal status was tenuous. 2) Why was she so well-connected politically? Before Partition, Mrs. Butt and her husband had been active in Kashmiri politics, and had struck up a friendship with G.M. Sadiq, who later became the leader of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, said Iftikhar Sadiq, 52, the official’s grandson. She continued her activism in Pakistan, where she argued for Kashmiri independence, and served as president of the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, mentions her in a memoir as an activist who was particularly troublesome to Mr. Bogra, Pakistan’s third prime minister. Mr. Nehru describes her as “a Kashmiri woman by the name of Bhat who did a lot of mischief.” In 1954, she confronted Mr. Bogra at a public event in Karachi and argued with him about Kashmir. Family members said she was subsequently arrested and confined for six months to a mental hospital in Lahore. Some relatives said she received electroshock therapy there. After she left Pakistan for Kashmir, she lived under the patronage of Mr. Sadiq, her old friend. “They used to be very close to the ‘who’s who’ who mattered here in the valley at that time,” his grandson said. “In those days, people used to really care about these bonds. They used to develop them into personal relationships — they would never get rid of them.” 3) When did she first publicly claim she was the Begum of Oudh? The family stayed in Kashmir from 1962 until the early 1970s, living in housing provided by Mr. Sadiq. It was during that time that Mrs. Butt told neighbors she and her children were the heirs to Oudh. She would not allow her children to associate with the neighbors, saying they were royalty and the neighbors were “commoners,” said Sabia Rashid, 56, an ophthalmologist who lived a few doors away. She had even ordered workers to demolish the interior walls of her house so that the children could play cricket inside, Dr. Rashid said. “She looked like the witch from ‘Hansel and Gretel,’” Dr. Rashid said. “She would not talk to anybody. People were scared of her.” She lived with two sons and a daughter, who made no claim to royal lineage, Dr. Rashid said. Her daughter, Farhad, who was then known as Marzia, told neighbors they were a Jewish family who had moved to Kashmir from Iran. The youngest, a boy known as Raza, was the friendliest, and a talented cricketer. Mrs. Butt and the two younger children left Kashmir in the early 1970s. Her departure seemed to coincide with the death of G.M. Sadiq, her patron, in 1971. “I remember my grandaunt saying once, ‘She left, and she never came back, and they never knew where she was,’” Iftikhar Sadiq said. “Maybe she felt she didn’t have anyone to fall back on.” Her older son, known as Assad, remained in the government house in Kashmir in near-complete isolation. Years after the rest of the family left, his body was discovered in a state of decomposition. Dr. Rashid said it was widely believed that, left alone in the abandoned house, he had starved to death. 3) What happened then? Mrs. Butt and her two youngest children relocated to Lucknow, and demanded the restoration of the properties of Oudh. They now called themselves Begum Wilayat, Princess Sakina and Prince Ali Raza. They became objects of pity, said Satya Pal Malik, who was a member of the state parliament in Uttar Pradesh when he went to visit them at the Lucknow train station, “with the belief that they must belong to the royal family.” “Actually, she was the creation of the local press,” Mr. Malik said. “She never told me that she was from the royal family. But to look at and talk, they were good looking. Even the children were very beautiful looking. So it would seem, that yes, they are blue-blooded people.” Eventually, state officials offered the family a house, but Mrs. Butt was haughty and rude, Mr. Malik said, even to those who were trying to assist her. They eventually relocated to a train station in New Delhi. Officials from Uttar Pradesh continued to work on their behalf for permanent housing. Ammar Rizvi, a high-ranking state official who was then with the Congress Party, said he had briefed Indira Gandhi about the case, and that she also felt sorry for them. “She was a very kind, very generous person,” he said. “She said, ‘Ammar, see to it that she is not put to any inconvenience.’” Mr. Rizvi said he was never certain whether there was any basis to the claim, because the family said all their documents had burned in a fire. No one in the government had seen proof. “Maybe some of her relatives might have some relationship, contacts with him, only God knows,” he said “Unless I know for certain, I cannot blame her, and I cannot accuse her, and I cannot pass any verdict. That would be unfair.” He said he lost contact with the family when they were resettled in Malcha Mahal, the ruined 14th-century hunting lodge where they lived until their deaths. Mr. Rizvi said the fate of the family made him profoundly sad. “It’s sort of a psycho case,” he said. “Like Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Psycho.’ They thought themselves to the real successor or heir apparent to the throne of Oudh. That was the tragedy.”']",Times readers and government documents have provided new information about a family who for decades convinced journalists and Indian officials that they were royalty.
"U.S. Refuses Extradition in Fatal Crash, Prompting Anger in U.K.",2020-01-24,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The United States has formally turned down Britain’s extradition request for an American woman who was involved in a car accident that killed a teenager last year, a decision that the British government called “a denial of justice.” The police have said that the woman, Anne Sacoolas, was driving a car on the wrong side of the road in August when it collided with a motorcycle ridden by Harry Dunn, 19. She fled Britain shortly afterward. At the time of the accident, which occurred in Brackley, a town about 60 miles northwest of London, Ms. Sacoolas’s husband was working for the United States government at a British military base, and American officials assert that she had diplomatic immunity, shielding her from prosecution. But in December, British prosecutors charged her with causing death by dangerous driving. The State Department said in a statement on Thursday that it had denied extradition, which it said “would render the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would set an extraordinarily troubling precedent.” A spokesman for Mr. Dunn’s family, Radd Seiger, said on Friday that they had taken the news “in our stride” and would not give up, and he had harsh words for the Trump administration. “The reality is that this administration, which we say is behaving lawlessly and taking a wrecking ball to one of the greatest alliances in the world, they won’t be around forever whereas that extradition request will be,” Mr. Seiger told BBC Radio 4. “We are disappointed in this decision, which appears to be a denial of justice,” a spokeswoman for the Home Office, the British government department handling the matter, said on Friday. “We are urgently considering our options.” Mr. Dunn’s parents have gone all the way to the White House to seek justice for their son, meeting with President Trump in October and refusing to meet Ms. Sacoolas, who Mr. Trump said was waiting in a nearby room. Charlotte Charles, Mr. Dunn’s mother, said at the time that she and her husband would have loved to meet Ms. Sacoolas, but on their terms, and on British soil. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week that the chances that the United States would respond favorably to the request were very low. Andrea Leadsom, the British lawmaker in whose district Mr. Dunn’s parents live, is scheduled to meet with the United States ambassador, Woody Johnson, in London on Thursday, according to the BBC. Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said he had spoken with Mr. Johnson on Friday morning and told him that “the U.K. would have acted differently if this had been a U.K. diplomat serving in the U.S.” Britain and the United States have an extradition treaty, but legal experts in Britain said the relationship has been one-sided, with officials in London being more willing than their counterparts in Washington to hand people over. Edward Grange, a lawyer specializing in extradition law at the firm Corker Binning, said the case of Ms. Sacoolas confirmed the overall trend. “It should have been up to a court to determine whether diplomatic immunity applied,” Mr. Grange said. “It’s a political decision.” For now, said Mr. Seiger, the spokesman for Mr. Dunn’s family, “we will simply plot and plan for a reasonable administration to come in one day and to reverse this decision.”']",The British police accuse an American woman of driving on the wrong side of the road in an accident that killed a teenage motorcyclist. The State Department says she had diplomatic immunity.
"Guaidó, Promising Change for Venezuela, Fails to Conquer Davos",2020-01-23,By Mark Landler,"['DAVOS, Switzerland — This time last year, Juan Guaidó would have been the toast of Davos. Mr. Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, had just led a wave of popular unrest to win the presidency of Venezuela’s National Assembly and declared himself the true leader of his crisis-ridden country. But as Mr. Guaidó made the rounds at this year’s gathering of political and business figures — having come to Europe in defiance of a travel ban at home — he seemed like a man whose moment had passed. With Venezuela’s repressive president, Nicolás Maduro, still firmly entrenched in power, and with Mr. Guaidó’s most prominent backer, President Trump, distracted by his Senate trial and his re-election campaign, the embattled Venezuelan spent most of his time answering questions about why he had not succeeded in toppling Mr. Maduro. “We underestimated the ability of the regime to do bad,” Mr. Guaidó told a half-filled hall where, two days earlier, Mr. Trump had spoken to a standing-room-only crowd. “We are really climbing a mountain at the moment.” Mr. Guaidó insisted that he and his supporters would still uproot the Maduro government. He urged European leaders to crack down on Venezuela’s gold trade, which he said had helped consolidate Mr. Maduro’s control by providing a means of foreign exchange and helping to secure the loyalty of the military. But Mr. Guaidó struggled to offer fresh ideas for how governments could tighten the pressure on Mr. Maduro. Venezuela is already under heavy sanctions, which have so far failed to dislodge him. In an election year, the United States is less likely than ever to consider more aggressive options, like military intervention. In Washington, the most vocal proponent of Mr. Guaidó — the former national security adviser John R. Bolton — has left the administration. Mr. Trump did not mention Venezuela during his speech in Davos; he left the Alpine ski resort on Wednesday without seeing Mr. Guaidó. That left the Venezuelan with a lineup of meetings that included the leaders of Austria, Greece and the Netherlands, as well as a session with a Davos regular, Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. On Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó met in London with Britain’s current prime minister, Boris Johnson. “The idea behind all these meetings is the same,” Mr. Guaidó said to journalists, speaking through a translator. “People should stop seeing Venezuela as an insoluble problem.” But then he likened Venezuela to Syria, Yemen, and South Sudan — three war-torn states that are often viewed as insoluble problems. Although Venezuela is not in a state of war, Mr. Guaidó noted that millions of people had fled the country in search of food or medical care. Those who remain behind are in grinding poverty, living on wages of as little as $3.50 a month, even for nurses and other professionals. The government has turned up its repression, jailing and torturing members of the opposition. Mr. Guaidó himself took a big risk in leaving the country. He declined to describe how he evaded security forces, except to say that they were not particularly efficient, and his team managed to distract them. Still, Mr. Guaidó faces the possibility of harsh reprisals when he returns home. “Going back to Venezuela will not be easy,” he said. “I do hope I can get home safe and sound.” Just before flying to Europe, Mr. Guaidó met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bogotá, Colombia. The United States is one of more than 50 countries that recognizes Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Mr. Pompeo insisted the administration had not retreated in its determination to see Mr. Maduro ousted, and expressed hope that it could still happen. “I’ve heard this idea that we’ve underestimated Maduro,” Mr. Pompeo said to reporters. “What’s been underestimated is the desire for freedom that rests in the hearts of the Venezuelan people.” American officials said Mr. Guaidó’s visit to Davos was valuable because it would put a human face on the struggle in Venezuela. Despite making headlines over the past year, Mr. Guaidó, 36, remains something of an abstraction to people outside Latin America, according to a senior official. By telling his own story, this person said, Mr. Guaidó could still mobilize support among the Europeans, who would be critical in imposing effective sanctions and halting the gold trade. As Mr. Guaidó analyzed his problems over the last year, he pointed to an offer made by the opposition of amnesty to members of the military who would agree to turn against the Maduro government. The offer did not peel away senior officers, in part because Mr. Maduro gave them access to lucrative gold mines. They have remained a bulwark of support for him. “We tried to do this, but it sort of rebounded on us,” Mr. Guaidó said. “It is really the top brass of the military that are behind him.”']","A year after he declared himself president, the opposition leader cut an embattled figure at the World Economic Forum."
Coronavirus Spurs China to Suspend Tours Abroad and Xi to Warn of a ‘Grave Situation’,2020-01-25,,"['This briefing has ended. Read about developments in the coronavirus outbreak here. China said on Saturday that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for its citizens headed overseas, starting on Monday. The association for China’s travel agencies said tour groups that were in the middle of their trips could proceed with their itineraries but should closely monitor the health of their travelers. This measure may come as welcome news to countries that have been gearing up to screen travelers from China for fevers and other signs of infection. The Beijing city government also announced on Saturday that it would suspend all inter-province buses from Sunday, effectively limiting road travel into the capital. The measures, taken hundreds of miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak of a novel coronavirus began, were a sign that concerns over the spread of the outbreak have crept close to central government offices and the ruling Communist Party’s seat of power. Wuhan also tightened its restrictions further on Saturday with a ban on vehicle traffic in the city center, to begin at midnight. The local government said some vehicles would be exempted, including shuttle buses and trucks moving supplies. Residents responded with frustration on social media. One woman, who said she was pregnant and near her due date, asked if she was supposed to walk to her gynecologist’s office. All the reported deaths from the outbreak have been in mainland China, but travelers have spread the virus to numerous other places. Cases have been confirmed in Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, France and the United States. The authorities in Wuhan said they would also speed up the customs process for donated supplies, as hospitals in the city raise the alarm about a shortage of hospital gowns, surgical masks and other necessities. A notice posted Saturday on the website of the city’s customs agency said that new channels were being put in place to ensure that donations were put to immediate use. Overseas donations will be exempted from tax duties, the notice said. During past crises, the authorities in China have been criticized for their reluctance to accept overseas assistance, apparently preferring to project a sense of control. As China has grown more affluent, it has become a provider of aid rather than a recipient, particularly to regions like Africa. China has made exceptions during some past disasters, including a devastating earthquake centered on Sichuan Province in 2008. On Saturday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency in the semiautonomous Chinese city and said schools would be closed until mid-February. Two American universities with campuses in China also postponed their start dates. Duke Kunshan University, a partnership between Duke University in North Carolina and Wuhan University, said it would not resume classes until Feb. 17. Classes had originally been scheduled to resume Feb. 3, after the Lunar New Year vacation. (Duke Kunshan University is not in Wuhan, but in Jiangsu Province, more than 400 miles away.) New York University also announced that its Shanghai campus would start its spring semester one week later than planned, at the request of municipal authorities. Schools in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is and where the outbreak has hit the hardest, had already decided to delay the start dates at all schools, from kindergarten through college. China on Sunday morning announced 15 more deaths from the new coronavirus, including one in Shanghai, the first to be reported so far in the metropolis.  Thirteen more deaths were also announced in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and one was announced in Henan Province. The latest deaths brought the toll in China to 56. Across the country, 688 cases of the new virus were diagnosed on Saturday, the government said early Sunday.  That brings the total number of confirmed cases to 1,975. Deaths from the coronavirus had previously been reported outside of Hubei, the outbreak’s epicenter.  But the death in Shanghai, which is among China’s most populous cities and a major commercial hub, is likely to add to anxieties about the disease’s spread. Shanghai’s municipal health commission said on Sunday that the patient who died was an 88-year-old man. Travel restrictions in Wuhan and 12 other cities have essentially penned in 35 million people on the country’s biggest holiday, normally a time for traveling to visit family. Though the number of coronavirus cases and deaths is alarming, public health experts have so far warned against mass anxiety. After all, the common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone. It is too soon to know the mortality rate of the virus in the new outbreak. But there are signs that this outbreak could be far more serious than the common flu. For one, the virus has been identified as a coronavirus, named for the spikes that protrude from its membrane. Other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the common flu, and have also led to global outbreaks. Chinese citizens are also haunted by the memory of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus outbreak that also started in China and eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. During that epidemic, Beijing at first played down the crisis and withheld information, eventually drawing widespread criticism. And conclusive evidence about how the outbreak started is lacking. While officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some patients who have fallen ill never visited the market. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations for what animals may have transmitted the virus to humans. The Chinese government has promised far more transparency than in the SARS crisis, and the World Health Organization has praised its cooperation with the scientific community. Still, mistrust of the local and national authorities is evident on Chinese social media. And China’s health system has already struggled under the new virus’s strain, with hospitals in Wuhan issuing urgent requests for help and donations. In a sign of how the spread of the coronavirus has deeply shaken China, the nation’s top leader, Xi Jinping, convened a meeting of the Communist Party leadership on Saturday to begin an offensive to stanch the spread of the outbreak, improve treatment of victims and speed supplies to areas under lockdown. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle to beat the epidemic through prevention and control,” Mr. Xi said, according to an official summary delivered on Chinese television. Until now, Mr. Xi had said little publicly about the growing crisis, even as confirmed cases of infection with the new and little understood coronavirus multiplied over the past week and Wuhan — the city in central China where the virus first spread — and nearby areas came under a net of travel restrictions intended to contain the outbreak. Mr. Xi issued brief orders about the emerging epidemic five days ago. Now, though, he has ordered mobilization across the country and drastic measures to hold back the virus, which is linked to pneumonia symptoms that can be deadly. The China television report showed Mr. Xi speaking to the six other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s topmost decision-making body, and a circle of other grave-faced officials. The leadership meeting took place on the first full day of China’s weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, a time when the entire country, including party leaders, usually take time off for family get-togethers and relaxation. “Confronted with the grave situation of this accelerating spread of pneumonia from infections with the novel coronavirus, we must step up the centralized and united leadership under the party central” leadership, Mr. Xi said. The Communist Party will establish a top-level team, called a leadership small group, to grapple with the crisis, the meeting said, giving efforts to fight the outbreak greater urgency and centralized coordination. Here are some of the other measures and main points announced: Mr. Xi demanded strong efforts to provide medicine and other supplies, a point of anger among many doctors and medical workers in Wuhan who have complained about a shortage of protective masks, gowns and other safety equipment. Officials in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, received an implicit telling off. Residents and many other Chinese people have said that officials did not respond seriously enough. Hubei, the meeting said, “must make containment and control of the epidemic its topmost priority, adopting even stricter measures to prevent it expanding within and spreading outward.” The meeting called for concentrating resources, experts and treatment to cope with the surge of infections, including sending patients with serious symptoms to designated medical units. This suggests that there may be more hospitals built or modified to deal solely with the outbreak. Local and military medical resources are to be pooled for the response. Public spaces across China, including railway stations, airports, and ports, were told to step up measures to deter the spread of the virus, including ventilation, disinfection, and body temperature checks for people. “When suspected cases are found they must be held for observation locally,” the meeting ordered. In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Xi also seemed to address Chinese citizens’ growing dissatisfaction with the official response. On Chinese social media, users have asked whether the authorities have accurately reported the number of cases or taken enough steps to rein in their spread. Commenters have especially condemned the perceived absence of the local, provincial and even national authorities in the heart of the outbreak. Mr. Xi had made few public remarks about the disease before Saturday, when he called for officials to “stand at the front line to safeguard social stability.” “Where is that person? He is not on the front line,” one user wrote on Weibo, a Twitterlike platform, an apparent reference to Mr. Xi. The posts were quickly deleted. A professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong who helped identify SARS, Guan Yi, has accused Chinese authorities of delaying action and of obstructing his efforts to investigate the outbreak. Local officials in China have long had incentives to avoid revealing problems that might invite the wrath of party bosses. But Mr. Xi’s efforts to centralize power in Beijing have further weakened local authorities and increased their incentive to deny problems. It’s part of a longstanding pattern that can make both levels of government slow to acknowledge problems, then blame each other once a problem is revealed. State media has maintained a steady drumbeat of positive news as the outbreak has spread, praising the sacrifices of responders and everyday people. “This is a continuous theme in central-local relations in China. You do not want to be the one to bring bad news,” said Vivienne Shue, a prominent China scholar at Oxford University. The State Department has ordered all American employees at the United States Consulate in Wuhan to leave the city, as a lockdown imposed on central China expanded, the United States Embassy said on Saturday. It said the evacuation of its American staff members and their families was necessary because of the spreading outbreak of the coronavirus, the disruptions caused by the restrictions on transportation in Wuhan and the overwhelming of hospitals. The evacuation order, made on Thursday, according to a statement from the United States Embassy, was a sign that the measures imposed by the Chinese authorities to try to contain the outbreak of the mysterious coronavirus may be escalating alarm and confusion. Lines have formed at hospitals and residents have complained that the traffic restrictions have made it nearly impossible to seek timely medical help. The United States government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the plan. The plane would likely take evacuees to the West Coast of the United States, this person said. Medical staff would be aboard the plane to screen passengers, and evacuees who were not American diplomatic officers would be responsible for the cost of the flight, according to the person briefed on the plan. The French Consulate in Wuhan also told its citizens on Friday that it was considering setting up bus rides for those who wished to leave the city, in cooperation with the Chinese authorities, according to France’s Foreign Ministry. On Saturday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency in the semiautonomous Chinese city and said schools would be closed until mid-February. The city is treating five coronavirus patients connected to Wuhan, and more than 100 others are suspected of having the viral pneumonia. Hong Kong is also suspending flights and train services to Wuhan and will cancel all Lunar New Year celebrations. The Hong Kong Marathon, originally scheduled for early February, has also been called off. Masks and hand sanitizers have sold out in most pharmacies in the city as residents have stocked up on supplies in a panic since last week.  Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading expert in infectious diseases who discovered the agent causing the coronavirus, had called for schools and universities to remain closed beyond the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to contain the infection’s reach. Recent cases have shown that people who do not show symptoms could transmit the disease, according to a study published in The Lancet on Friday of which he was a co-author. “If there are local cases in Hong Kong that is not directly connected to Wuhan, this is a big issue,” Dr. Yuen said in a phone interview. “It would mean that this epidemic has reached another level of severity.” The medical journal The Lancet published a study on Friday suggesting that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flu symptoms. Researchers studied a family of seven in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, five of whom had traveled to Wuhan, the center of the outbreak. Two of them came into contact with an infected relative in a hospital there. Testing conducted days later, after they flew home, found that six members of the family had the coronavirus, including one who had not gone to Wuhan. One infected family member, a child, had no symptoms, suggesting that people with the virus might be spreading it without knowing that they have it, the study found. “It shows this new coronavirus is able to transfer between person to person, in a hospital setting, a family home setting, and also in an intercity setting,” Yuen Kwok-yung, an author of the study, said in an interview. “This is exactly what makes this new disease difficult to control.” Dr. Yuen characterized the disease as “asymptomatic walking pneumonia.” The researchers cautioned that the study was limited to early cases of the virus, and that it was difficult to assess risk factors at this stage. But they stressed the importance of quarantining patients as early as possible, given the early signs of asymptomatic transmission. Another study in The Lancet found that symptoms of early coronavirus cases showed similarities to SARS. Those symptoms included fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. The streets of Wuhan were largely empty on Saturday, the first full day of China’s Lunar New Year holiday. By contrast, the site for a new hospital to treat victims of the coronavirus was a mosh pit of activity. Earthmovers, trucks and hundreds of construction workers dug and scraped to build a new facility that, if completed within days as scheduled, could do more than treat the ailing. The government vowed on Friday that it would finish building the hospital in 10 days, a feat recalling the SARS epidemic of 2003, when Beijing built a hospital with similar speed. Besides treating infected people at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, the facility would also serve as a potent symbol of the government’s drive to do what needs to be done. If Beijing built a hospital in a few short days, in other words, Wuhan can do it too. On Saturday, officials announced that a second hospital was in the works to treat people infected by the virus. It would have a capacity for 1,300 beds. They plan to complete the facility, called Leishenshan Hospital, in 15 days. China is virtually unsurpassed in its capacity to finish in mere months the sort of factories, bridges and other projects that could take many years in other countries. The dozens of earthmovers gouging the soil on the outskirts of Wuhan attested to that strength. But some workers at the site of the first planned hospital, called Huoshenshan, said there was a severe need for skilled workers. Many are at home or elsewhere, to keep from catching the coronavirus. Yuan Banfu, a worker from neighboring Henan Province, said a call had gone out on Chinese social media for volunteers to help at the site. He had proudly signed up. “This is the new Tangshan Hospital,” he said, referring to the hospital that Beijing built in 2003. Mr. Yuan, a wiry 46-year-old, said he had not been able to go home for the Lunar New Year break because the authorities had closed the routes out of Wuhan. “I’m glad to be of help for the people of Wuhan,” he said. “My family is worried, but I told them I’m here anyway and we have to help.” Some workers at the site said they had volunteered, while others said they had received calls from their employers urging them to turn up. Nearly all the workers at the site, an expanse of brown mud in the drizzling rain, wore protective masks. “I’m not too scared,” Mr. Yuan said. “I work outdoors and my heart and lungs are strong Officials in a southern Chinese city said on Saturday that a 2-year-old girl suffering from the coronavirus had been admitted to a hospital and was in stable condition. That would make her the youngest person confirmed to have been infected, according to a social media account run by the People’s Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party. Health officials in the city of Hechi, in the southern region of Guangxi, said that the girl was surnamed Zhong and lived in Wuhan. She had flown from Wuhan to the city of Nanning, which is also in Guangxi, on Tuesday. From there, she was driven to Hechi. The next day, she developed a fever and began sneezing. She was admitted to Hechi People’s Hospital and put in isolation, officials said. Officials did not disclose who she was traveling with or what condition they might be in. Medical experts are watching closely to see who the coronavirus infects and who might be most vulnerable to it. Most of those killed by the coronavirus so far have been older men, many with chronic health issues. The youngest fatality disclosed so far was 36 years old. State news media reported on Saturday that a doctor had died of a heart failure while tending to patients with the coronavirus in fever wards at a hospital in eastern China. It was unclear whether he had showed signs of the virus. The doctor, Jiang Jianjun, who specialized in infectious diseases, suffered the heart attack on Thursday while making rounds at the fever wards in Jiangsu Taizhou People’s Hospital, according to an online tribute posted on the hospital’s social media account. “He collapsed at his beloved workplace,” the statement read. It has since been deleted, but it said that Dr. Jiang had also treated patients during the outbreaks of the avian flu and swine flu. News of his death, along with that of a retired physician in Wuhan who was suspected of having the virus, drew much sympathy online, even as frustration brewed over the crowds at hospitals and the shortage of supplies. Several internet users questioned whether Dr. Jiang had died of fatigue. As footage and photos appeared to show medical workers in white coats wailing from the stress of working several consecutive shifts, many social media users used forums to accuse the government of failing to provide adequate support to physicians working on the front lines of the outbreak. Many also blamed officials for failing to supply new protective gear and testing kits to hospitals facing shortages. For people in the United States with close ties to China, the outbreak has brought unexpected worry, disappointment and scrutiny. Some in the Chinese-American community have had their Lunar New Year holiday plans waylaid, as travel schedules for the coming week and beyond get interrupted. Some are gearing up for the outbreak to get worse. Hardware stores and pharmacies around the United States are selling out of masks that could help prevent the spread of the disease. In the New York City neighborhood of Flushing, masks have been sold out for much of the week. Chinese-Americans networking with their friends and family in China have scrambled to send aid. One woman in Los Angeles has amassed 20,000 masks to ship overseas. Sean Shi, of Issaquah, Wash., said he shipped several boxes of masks to China in a friend’s luggage, with hopes that the masks could reach friends in the Wuhan area as soon as possible. Later in the day, Mr. Shi was back at a local hardware store, buying another 46 masks for some of his former peers at Wuhan University. “We understand it’s a tough situation over there — the panic, the shortage of equipment,” Mr. Shi said. “We just realized the situation is very serious — more serious than we thought.” Reporting was contributed by Tiffany May, Steven Lee Myers, Vivian Wang, Chris Buckley, Raymond Zhong, Carlos Tejada, Rick Gladstone, Mike Baker, Jeffrey E.

Bulgaria Charges 3 Russian Agents in Poisoning Case,2020-01-23,By Michael Schwirtz,"['Prosecutors in Bulgaria announced criminal charges on Thursday against three Russian spies from a secretive assassination unit for the 2015 poisoning of a prominent Bulgarian arms manufacturer. The three men slipped into the country using fake passports and, according to prosecutors, used an organophosphate poison in an attempt “to deliberately kill” the arms manufacturer, Emilian Gebrev, along with his son and a top executive in his company. Though the victims survived, the poisoning in central Sofia, Bulgaria’s capital, endangered the lives of numerous people, the Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. Prosecutors released few details about the Russian spies on Thursday. But an investigation published in The New York Times last month identified them as operatives from Unit 29155, an elite group within Russia’s military intelligence agency that carries out assassinations and disruption operations in Europe. Members of the unit have also been involved in an attempted coup in Montenegro and an operation in Moldova, as well as the poisoning in 2018 of a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in the English town of Salisbury. The Skripal poisoning touched off a geopolitical showdown between Russia and the West that continues to reverberate. In response, more than 120 Russian diplomats were expelled from the European Union and the United States, and Britain filed criminal charges against two operatives later identified as officers with Unit 29155. Bulgaria had initially been reluctant to confront Russia, though experts and officials say Russian spies often use Bulgaria as a staging ground for operations throughout Europe. The Bulgarian government declined to expel any diplomats in the wake of the Skripal poisoning and had closed the inquiry into the Gebrev poisoning years earlier because of a lack of evidence. But after the British presented evidence of Unit 29155’s activities on Bulgarian soil, the authorities there reopened the case. The Times identified six operatives from Unit 29155 who appear to have been involved in the operation to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others. The three charged on Thursday arrived in Bulgaria shortly before Mr. Gebrev fell ill at a dinner with business partners in late April 2015. Though the men were not named by prosecutors, using travel information, The Times was able to identify them by their aliases: Sergei Fedotov, Sergei Pavlov and Georgi Gorshkov. (The operatives using the names Fedotov and Pavlov were also involved in overseeing and planning the Skripal poisoning, according to European security officials.) In Sofia, the operatives checked into a hotel near Mr. Gebrev’s offices and insisted on rooms with windows facing the entrance of an underground parking garage, investigators said. One of the men then slipped into the garage, and, according to grainy surveillance video, appears to smear a substance on the door handles of cars belonging to the victims. That was just the first poisoning. Investigators say that after failing to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others, Mr. Fedotov and another operative returned a month later and poisoned him and his son again while they were convalescing at their home on the Black Sea. Again, they failed to kill their victims, though Mr. Gebrev says his business continues to suffer. In the statement on Thursday, the Prosecutor General’s office said European arrest warrants and Interpol red notices — requests that other countries arrest suspects — had been filed for the three men involved in the first poisoning. It is not clear whether investigators plan to charge the other men involved in the operation. The Kremlin is unlikely to hand over its operatives to face prosecution.

"Coronavirus Exposes Core Flaws, and Few Strengths, in China’s Governance",2020-01-25,By Max Fisher,"['It was the initial news reports that first suggested China’s political system might be getting in the way of its ability to confront the coronavirus outbreak. The outbreak seemed to already be a full-blown crisis, infecting dozens in China and even some abroad, by the time it became widely reported. This seeming delay was of a familiar pattern in China, one suggesting that local officials may have played down early warning signs or simply did not coordinate enough to see the problem’s scope. While outsiders might suspect an attempted cover-up as the cause, experts see something much more worrying: weaknesses at the very heart of the Chinese system. Its rigidly hierarchical bureaucracy discourages local officials from raising bad news with central bosses whose help they might need. And it silos those officials off from one another, making it harder to see, much less manage, the full scope of spiraling crises.  “That’s why you never really hear about problems emerging on a local scale in China,” said John Yasuda, who studies China’s approach to health crises at Indiana University. “By the time that we hear about it, and that the problem reaches the central government, it’s because it’s become a huge problem.” While much remains unknown about the outbreak, a common theme is emerging. Any political system is better at solving some problems than others. But the coronavirus, like other health crises before it, is bringing out some of the deepest flaws and contradictions in a Chinese system that, for all its historic feats, remains a work in progress. Those flaws, which have long frustrated Chinese leaders, appear to have played a role in everything from the pace at which officials responded to the coronavirus outbreak, to China’s yearslong inability to address the health risks that experts have long warned could lead to an outbreak just like this one. While the country is now mobilizing a nationwide response — one of the system’s strengths — the incident is already a lesson in the political weak points that can bring grave consequences for China and, as infections spread, the world. “When you look at the coronavirus, it looks a lot like what happened with SARS. It involves a very similar template,” Mr. Yasuda said. The SARS epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in 2002 and 2003, initially spread unchecked when local Chinese officials minimized early reports. Their fear was not public unrest, it later emerged, but getting in trouble with the party bosses who controlled their careers. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases in Hong Kong who helped identify SARS, has accused Chinese authorities of once more delaying action, including by obstructing his own efforts to investigate the outbreak. “This is a continuous theme in central-local relations in China. You do not want to be the one to bring bad news,” said Vivienne Shue, a prominent China scholar at Oxford University. That gulf between central leaders in Beijing and local officials who run the country day-to-day, Ms. Shue said, is “the core conundrum in how that system works.” It leads officials on both sides of the center-local divide “to do many counterproductive, irrational things,” she said, in their efforts to manage and manipulate one another. That has included holding back reports of potential crises, in the hopes of solving things without the bosses finding out. At the same time, China’s quasi-imperial system leaves the top party bosses in Beijing with little direct power over what happens in the provinces — policy proclamations are sometimes ignored or defied — other than promoting or punishing subordinates. The two ends of the system are engaged in a constant push-pull dynamic, putting them occasionally at odds — particularly in moments of crisis, when each is looking to blame the other. This has been an issue throughout China’s modern history, Ms. Shue said, with power fluctuating between the center and the periphery. Xi Jinping, China’s current leader, has sought to centralize power, setting up Beijing-based working groups to exert more control outside the capital. But the system’s underlying contradiction remains. Mr. Xi’s tightening grip may make local leaders all the more wary of releasing information that could invite his wrath. As China modernizes, integrating its once-disparate provinces and cities, local mistakes can become national crises before Beijing is even aware that something has happened, as may have happened with the coronavirus outbreak. “As logistics and the distribution systems have expanded, you really see how the local and national have been linked together,” Mr. Yasuda said, referring to the hastening rate at which health, environmental and economic crises can now spread. That is not all downside. The central government has enormous capacity to mobilize in a crisis, as it is doing now, locking down several major cities to slow the disease’s spread. “Once a clear problem has emerged, it’s very good at diverting resources,” Mr. Yasuda said of China’s political system. “But it’s not good at dealing with emerging problems. So it’s built to be reactive instead of proactive.” In some ways, China’s system has been a source of strength. Party bosses set priorities, then reward the institutions and officials who best carry them out. And since the days of Mao Zedong, China has operated under a system known as fragmented authoritarianism, in which even the most local leaders have near-absolute authority over their remit. That has led to a culture of what Elizabeth J. Perry, a Harvard University scholar, has called “guerrilla governance,” in which results take precedence over procedure or accountability, and in which it is all leaders for themselves. This approach is seen as crucial in having enabled China to lift hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty and turn itself from global backwater into world power. But it can be disastrous when it comes to managing health and environmental issues. Disease and pollution don’t respect provincial or municipal borders. And because of the way they spread, it often takes a unified, nationwide policy to prevent or stop them — something for which guerrilla governance is ill-suited. “It’s very difficult to come together to create a clear actionable plan,” Mr. Yasuda said, adding that, for any health or environmental regulation to work, “you want it to be standardized, you want it to be transparent, you want it to be accountable.” But China’s system de-emphasizes those concerns, sometimes to disastrous effect. In the mid-2000s, Beijing demanded a drastic increase in milk production. When factory farms were unable to meet their targets, officials conscripted vast numbers of rural farmers. Some of the farmers, struggling to meet their quotas, watered down their milk, then added an industrial chemical known as melamine to fool quality sensors. The tainted milk poisoned thousands of infants. Experts fear a similar regulatory failure may have enabled the coronavirus outbreak: the longstanding inability to clean up so-called wet markets, which are stuffed with livestock living and dead, domesticated and wild. Though the outbreak’s cause is still being studied, Wuhan’s wet market is considered a prime suspect. The markets have long been considered a major threat to public health, particularly as a vector for transmitting diseases from animals to humans. And they are a lesson in the perils of patchwork, decentralized regulations like China’s: While some markets are more carefully policed than others, all it takes is one to cause an outbreak. In another echo of the tainted milk scandal, top-down political priorities provide an incentive to look the other way. Taking down the markets, which are popular, would risk a public outcry. Local officials had every reason to fear that their bosses, who have not made the markets a priority, would punish them for causing trouble. A foundational mission of any political system is to align its leaders’ incentives with the needs and desires of the wider public. Democracies seek to do this through “the competition of interests,” Ms. Shue said, on the belief that inviting everyone to participate will naturally pull the system toward the common good. This system, like any, has flaws, for example by handing more power to those with more money. Within China, Ms. Shue added, the common good “is seen as something that should be designed from above, like a watch being engineered to run perfectly.” But sometimes the watch can be designed in ways that harm the public good. In 2001, for instance, Beijing ordered provincial officials to reduce water pollution from factories. Many provinces simply moved the factories to their borders, ensuring pollutants would flow into the next district. Nationwide, water pollution worsened. So far, the coronavirus outbreak seems to highlight both the strengths and perils of China’s model. Beijing, apparently having learned from the SARS epidemic, has pushed for faster and more drastic action. But the same systemic problems, from gun-shy local officials to weak health regulations, appear to be recurring as well — a reminder that the system remains, Ms. Shue said, “a work in progress.”']","While China can mobilize a huge national response to the outbreak, its response to the crisis is also a lesson in how the country’s political weak points can carry grave consequences for world health."
"U.S. Refuses Extradition in Fatal Crash, Prompting Anger in U.K.",2020-01-24,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The United States has formally turned down Britain’s extradition request for an American woman who was involved in a car accident that killed a teenager last year, a decision that the British government called “a denial of justice.” The police have said that the woman, Anne Sacoolas, was driving a car on the wrong side of the road in August when it collided with a motorcycle ridden by Harry Dunn, 19. She fled Britain shortly afterward. At the time of the accident, which occurred in Brackley, a town about 60 miles northwest of London, Ms. Sacoolas’s husband was working for the United States government at a British military base, and American officials assert that she had diplomatic immunity, shielding her from prosecution. But in December, British prosecutors charged her with causing death by dangerous driving. The State Department said in a statement on Thursday that it had denied extradition, which it said “would render the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would set an extraordinarily troubling precedent.” A spokesman for Mr. Dunn’s family, Radd Seiger, said on Friday that they had taken the news “in our stride” and would not give up, and he had harsh words for the Trump administration. “The reality is that this administration, which we say is behaving lawlessly and taking a wrecking ball to one of the greatest alliances in the world, they won’t be around forever whereas that extradition request will be,” Mr. Seiger told BBC Radio 4. “We are disappointed in this decision, which appears to be a denial of justice,” a spokeswoman for the Home Office, the British government department handling the matter, said on Friday. “We are urgently considering our options.” Mr. Dunn’s parents have gone all the way to the White House to seek justice for their son, meeting with President Trump in October and refusing to meet Ms. Sacoolas, who Mr. Trump said was waiting in a nearby room. Charlotte Charles, Mr. Dunn’s mother, said at the time that she and her husband would have loved to meet Ms. Sacoolas, but on their terms, and on British soil. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week that the chances that the United States would respond favorably to the request were very low. Andrea Leadsom, the British lawmaker in whose district Mr. Dunn’s parents live, is scheduled to meet with the United States ambassador, Woody Johnson, in London on Thursday, according to the BBC. Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said he had spoken with Mr. Johnson on Friday morning and told him that “the U.K. would have acted differently if this had been a U.K. diplomat serving in the U.S.” Britain and the United States have an extradition treaty, but legal experts in Britain said the relationship has been one-sided, with officials in London being more willing than their counterparts in Washington to hand people over. Edward Grange, a lawyer specializing in extradition law at the firm Corker Binning, said the case of Ms. Sacoolas confirmed the overall trend. “It should have been up to a court to determine whether diplomatic immunity applied,” Mr. Grange said. “It’s a political decision.” For now, said Mr. Seiger, the spokesman for Mr. Dunn’s family, “we will simply plot and plan for a reasonable administration to come in one day and to reverse this decision.”']",The British police accuse an American woman of driving on the wrong side of the road in an accident that killed a teenage motorcyclist.

"Guaidó, Promising Change for Venezuela, Fails to Conquer Davos",2020-01-23,By Mark Landler,"['DAVOS, Switzerland — This time last year, Juan Guaidó would have been the toast of Davos. Mr. Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, had just led a wave of popular unrest to win the presidency of Venezuela’s National Assembly and declared himself the true leader of his crisis-ridden country. But as Mr. Guaidó made the rounds at this year’s gathering of political and business figures — having come to Europe in defiance of a travel ban at home — he seemed like a man whose moment had passed. With Venezuela’s repressive president, Nicolás Maduro, still firmly entrenched in power, and with Mr. Guaidó’s most prominent backer, President Trump, distracted by his Senate trial and his re-election campaign, the embattled Venezuelan spent most of his time answering questions about why he had not succeeded in toppling Mr. Maduro. “We underestimated the ability of the regime to do bad,” Mr. Guaidó told a half-filled hall where, two days earlier, Mr. Trump had spoken to a standing-room-only crowd. “We are really climbing a mountain at the moment.” Mr. Guaidó insisted that he and his supporters would still uproot the Maduro government. He urged European leaders to crack down on Venezuela’s gold trade, which he said had helped consolidate Mr. Maduro’s control by providing a means of foreign exchange and helping to secure the loyalty of the military. But Mr. Guaidó struggled to offer fresh ideas for how governments could tighten the pressure on Mr. Maduro. Venezuela is already under heavy sanctions, which have so far failed to dislodge him. In an election year, the United States is less likely than ever to consider more aggressive options, like military intervention. In Washington, the most vocal proponent of Mr. Guaidó — the former national security adviser John R. Bolton — has left the administration. Mr. Trump did not mention Venezuela during his speech in Davos; he left the Alpine ski resort on Wednesday without seeing Mr. Guaidó. That left the Venezuelan with a lineup of meetings that included the leaders of Austria, Greece and the Netherlands, as well as a session with a Davos regular, Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. On Tuesday, Mr. Guaidó met in London with Britain’s current prime minister, Boris Johnson. “The idea behind all these meetings is the same,” Mr. Guaidó said to journalists, speaking through a translator. “People should stop seeing Venezuela as an insoluble problem.” But then he likened Venezuela to Syria, Yemen, and South Sudan — three war-torn states that are often viewed as insoluble problems. Although Venezuela is not in a state of war, Mr. Guaidó noted that millions of people had fled the country in search of food or medical care. Those who remain behind are in grinding poverty, living on wages of as little as $3.50 a month, even for nurses and other professionals. The government has turned up its repression, jailing and torturing members of the opposition. Mr. Guaidó himself took a big risk in leaving the country. He declined to describe how he evaded security forces, except to say that they were not particularly efficient, and his team managed to distract them. Still, Mr. Guaidó faces the possibility of harsh reprisals when he returns home. “Going back to Venezuela will not be easy,” he said. “I do hope I can get home safe and sound.” Just before flying to Europe, Mr. Guaidó met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Bogotá, Colombia. The United States is one of more than 50 countries that recognizes Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Mr. Pompeo insisted the administration had not retreated in its determination to see Mr. Maduro ousted, and expressed hope that it could still happen. “I’ve heard this idea that we’ve underestimated Maduro,” Mr. Pompeo said to reporters. “What’s been underestimated is the desire for freedom that rests in the hearts of the Venezuelan people.” American officials said Mr. Guaidó’s visit to Davos was valuable because it would put a human face on the struggle in Venezuela. Despite making headlines over the past year, Mr. Guaidó, 36, remains something of an abstraction to people outside Latin America, according to a senior official. By telling his own story, this person said, Mr. Guaidó could still mobilize support among the Europeans, who would be critical in imposing effective sanctions and halting the gold trade. As Mr. Guaidó analyzed his problems over the last year, he pointed to an offer made by the opposition of amnesty to members of the military who would agree to turn against the Maduro government. The offer did not peel away senior officers, in part because Mr. Maduro gave them access to lucrative gold mines. They have remained a bulwark of support for him. “We tried to do this, but it sort of rebounded on us,” Mr. Guaidó said. “It is really the top brass of the military that are behind him.”']","A year after he declared himself president, the opposition leader cut an embattled figure at the World Economic Forum."

China’s Omnivorous Markets Are in the Eye of a Lethal Outbreak Once Again,2020-01-25,By Steven Lee Myers,"['LANGFANG, China — The typical market in China has fruits and vegetables, butchered beef, pork and lamb, whole plucked chickens — with heads and beaks attached — and live crabs and fish, spewing water out of churning tanks. Some sell more unusual fare, including live snakes, turtles and cicadas, guinea pigs, bamboo rats, badgers, hedgehogs, otters, palm civets, even wolf cubs. The markets are fixtures in scores of Chinese cities, and now, for at least the second time in two decades, they are the source of an epidemic that has spread fear, taxed the Communist Party bureaucracy and exposed the epidemiological risks that can spawn in places where humans and wildlife converge.  The novel coronavirus that has already killed at least 56 and sickened more than 1,370 in China and around the world is believed to have spread from exactly one of these places: a wholesale market in Wuhan, a city in central China, where vendors legally sold live animals from stalls in close quarters with hundreds of others. “This is where you get new and emerging diseases that the human population has never seen before,” said Kevin J. Olival, a biologist and vice president of research with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, who has tracked previous outbreaks. While the exact path of the pathogen has not yet been established, government officials and scientists said the new contagion had ominous similarities with the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in late 2002, which killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands more around the world. Now, as the government struggles to contain public anger over the outbreak, it is facing calls to do more to regulate or even ban the sale of wildlife — and growing questions about why so little has changed in the 17 years since SARS. That disease was ultimately traced to a coronavirus that jumped from bats to Asian palm civets, a catlike creature prized as a delicacy in southern China, and then to humans involved in the wildlife trade there. According to officials and scientists, the new virus also appears to have originated in bats and made the jump to another mammal, though which one is not yet clear. The latest outbreak — the scope of which is still unfolding — has led to calls inside and outside of China for better regulations or even an end to this kind of culinary adventurism. While turtle and boar meat are not uncommon in Chinese restaurants, game meats such as civet cats, snakes or pangolins tend to be considered specialties only in some regions. Their consumption is driven as much by the desire to flaunt wealth as by a mix of superstition and belief about the health benefits of wildlife. Once the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was identified as the most likely source of this outbreak in December, the authorities promptly closed it, though it was not clear what happened to the animals that had been for sale there. Officials announced only on Wednesday that they had banned the sale of wild animals throughout the province. Two other provinces, Henan and Inner Mongolia, also imposed suspensions on the trade this past week. On Friday, officials from three national agencies announced tighter controls, including a suspension nationally of the sale and transport of animals possibly linked to the new coronavirus. The statement specified only badgers and bamboo rats, a species of rodent found in southern China that lives in (and eats) bamboo thickets. Both had been advertised for sale in the market in Wuhan. The flurry of government action came after an unusual outpouring of public sentiment against the trade of live animals. A campaign on Weibo, the social media platform, drew 45 million views with the hashtag #rejectgamemeat. “Eating game does not cure impotence or have healing powers,” Jin Sichen, a television presenter in Nanjing, a city in southeastern China, wrote on his Weibo page on Wednesday. “Game not only doesn’t cure disease, it can also make you, your family, friends and even more people sick.” “One must be mentally sick to eat game in order to show off and flaunt,” Mr. Jin added. A group of 19 Chinese scholars also called on the government to do more to regulate the trade and the public to stop eating wild animals. The Wildlife Conservation Society, an advocacy organization based in New York, called for a global ban on the commercial sale of wildlife, especially in markets like those in China, saying that the latest outbreak proved the public health threat. Christian Walzer, the organization’s executive director of health, said that the astonishing diversity of wild animals in markets like these, packed in small cages in crowded market stalls, created a perfect laboratory for the unintentional incubation of new viruses that can enter human cells. Viruses can be spread through saliva, blood or feces. “Each animal is a package of pathogens,” he said in a telephone interview. But some Chinese consumers ascribe traditional medicinal benefits to the animals. Vendors and even officials in state news media have touted wildlife as alternative sources of protein and sources of revenue in impoverished regions. An article by the Xinhua news agency last fall, for example, said that farming bamboo rats was helping to lift people out of poverty in Guangxi, another southern province. Worries about meat supplies surged last year over the outbreak of African swine fever, which led to the killing of 40 percent of the country’s pigs. Production of domesticated livestock on the country’s farms is, compared to the sale of wildlife, subjected to far more regulation and inspection. Outbreaks still occur, but they are identified more quickly. Part of the problem with the wildlife trade is that there is far less regulation, despite the greater risk of live animals’ infecting each other and people, especially in markets that can be unsanitary. Mr. Walzer said that one problem with the legal production of some species is that it can blur the lines between those raised in captivity and those captured in the wild, where unknown viruses have existed for years without contact with humans. “It’s a public health hazard, not only in China but everywhere,” he said. At the peak of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the authorities banned the sale of civets and culled the existing stocks, but within months they ended the ban and trade had resumed as before. “It is driven by interests,” Qin Xiaona, president of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, an advocacy organization in Beijing, said of the current outbreak. “Many people profit from the wildlife trade today.” The trafficking of some wildlife is prohibited, including endangered pangolins, which are prized for their scales and meat, but China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration allows people to raise 54 different animals, birds, reptiles and insects, including muskrat, chipmunks, ostriches, emus and centipedes. On Taobao, a popular Chinese online shopping platform, all manner of live wildlife can be had. A baby badger costs 1,300 renminbi, or $187. A farmer from Hunan, the province directly south of Hubei, sells civets, the source of SARS, for the equivalent of $215 each — discounted to $200 if one buys 500 or more. At the sprawling, semi-enclosed market in Langfang, an electronics manufacturing hub south of Beijing, one vendor advertised a live crocodile ($550) and a porcupine ($115).  In Wuhan, the authorities have not given details about all the animals that were on sale in the market linked to the new coronavirus. People on social media circulated a photograph of a price list for a variety of animals purported to be sold by a vendor in the market, but its authenticity could not be confirmed.  According to a medical blog posted on WeChat, the health authorities in Wuhan visited the market in September and inspected eight vendors selling frogs, snakes and hedgehogs, among other animals. All were licensed to sell wildlife, and no violations were found. Despite the spread of the virus around the country, a Hong Kong television network, I-Cable News Channel, found scores of wild animals still for sale on Wednesday at a market in Qingyuan, a city in Guangdong, the province where SARS originated.  The epidemic has now put sellers on the defensive. “Are you sure it is eating wild animals that has caused the epidemic?” said Zheng Ming, the sales manager of a company selling  animals in Yichang, a city 180 miles west of Wuhan. Until the ban on sales announced this past week, he sold porcupines, civets, guinea pigs and bamboo rats among others. “We observe the law,” he said. “This is a completely legal business.” James Gorman contributed reporting from New York.

Some sell more unusual fare, including live snakes, turtles and cicadas, guinea pigs, bamboo rats, badgers, hedgehogs, otters, palm civets, even wolf cubs. The markets are fixtures in scores of Chinese cities, and now, for at least the second time in two decades, they are the source of an epidemic that has spread fear, taxed the Communist Party bureaucracy and exposed the epidemiological risks that can spawn in places where humans and wildlife converge.  The novel coronavirus that has already killed at least 56 and sickened more than 1,370 in China and around the world is believed to have spread from exactly one of these places: a wholesale market in Wuhan, a city in central China, where vendors legally sold live animals from stalls in close quarters with hundreds of others. “This is where you get new and emerging diseases that the human population has never seen before,” said Kevin J. Olival, a biologist and vice president of research with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, who has tracked previous outbreaks. While the exact path of the pathogen has not yet been established, government officials and scientists said the new contagion had ominous similarities with the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in late 2002, which killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands more around the world. Now, as the government struggles to contain public anger over the outbreak, it is facing calls to do more to regulate or even ban the sale of wildlife — and growing questions about why so little has changed in the 17 years since SARS. That disease was ultimately traced to a coronavirus that jumped from bats to Asian palm civets, a catlike creature prized as a delicacy in southern China, and then to humans involved in the wildlife trade there. According to officials and scientists, the new virus also appears to have originated in bats and made the jump to another mammal, though which one is not yet clear. The latest outbreak — the scope of which is still unfolding — has led to calls inside and outside of China for better regulations or even an end to this kind of culinary adventurism. While turtle and boar meat are not uncommon in Chinese restaurants, game meats such as civet cats, snakes or pangolins tend to be considered specialties only in some regions. Their consumption is driven as much by the desire to flaunt wealth as by a mix of superstition and belief about the health benefits of wildlife. Once the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was identified as the most likely source of this outbreak in December, the authorities promptly closed it, though it was not clear what happened to the animals that had been for sale there. Officials announced only on Wednesday that they had banned the sale of wild animals throughout the province. Two other provinces, Henan and Inner Mongolia, also imposed suspensions on the trade this past week. On Friday, officials from three national agencies announced tighter controls, including a suspension nationally of the sale and transport of animals possibly linked to the new coronavirus. The statement specified only badgers and bamboo rats, a species of rodent found in southern China that lives in (and eats) bamboo thickets. Both had been advertised for sale in the market in Wuhan. The flurry of government action came after an unusual outpouring of public sentiment against the trade of live animals. A campaign on Weibo, the social media platform, drew 45 million views with the hashtag #rejectgamemeat. “Eating game does not cure impotence or have healing powers,” Jin Sichen, a television presenter in Nanjing, a city in southeastern China, wrote on his Weibo page on Wednesday. “Game not only doesn’t cure disease, it can also make you, your family, friends and even more people sick.” “One must be mentally sick to eat game in order to show off and flaunt,” Mr. Jin added. A group of 19 Chinese scholars also called on the government to do more to regulate the trade and the public to stop eating wild animals. The Wildlife Conservation Society, an advocacy organization based in New York, called for a global ban on the commercial sale of wildlife, especially in markets like those in China, saying that the latest outbreak proved the public health threat. Christian Walzer, the organization’s executive director of health, said that the astonishing diversity of wild animals in markets like these, packed in small cages in crowded market stalls, created a perfect laboratory for the unintentional incubation of new viruses that can enter human cells. Viruses can be spread through saliva, blood or feces. “Each animal is a package of pathogens,” he said in a telephone interview. But some Chinese consumers ascribe traditional medicinal benefits to the animals. Vendors and even officials in state news media have touted wildlife as alternative sources of protein and sources of revenue in impoverished regions. An article by the Xinhua news agency last fall, for example, said that farming bamboo rats was helping to lift people out of poverty in Guangxi, another southern province. Worries about meat supplies surged last year over the outbreak of African swine fever, which led to the killing of 40 percent of the country’s pigs. Production of domesticated livestock on the country’s farms is, compared to the sale of wildlife, subjected to far more regulation and inspection. Outbreaks still occur, but they are identified more quickly. Part of the problem with the wildlife trade is that there is far less regulation, despite the greater risk of live animals’ infecting each other and people, especially in markets that can be unsanitary. Mr. Walzer said that one problem with the legal production of some species is that it can blur the lines between those raised in captivity and those captured in the wild, where unknown viruses have existed for years without contact with humans. “It’s a public health hazard, not only in China but everywhere,” he said. At the peak of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the authorities banned the sale of civets and culled the existing stocks, but within months they ended the ban and trade had resumed as before. “It is driven by interests,” Qin Xiaona, president of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, an advocacy organization in Beijing, said of the current outbreak. “Many people profit from the wildlife trade today.” The trafficking of some wildlife is prohibited, including endangered pangolins, which are prized for their scales and meat, but China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration allows people to raise 54 different animals, birds, reptiles and insects, including muskrat, chipmunks, ostriches, emus and centipedes. On Taobao, a popular Chinese online shopping platform, all manner of live wildlife can be had. A baby badger costs 1,300 renminbi, or $187. A farmer from Hunan, the province directly south of Hubei, sells civets, the source of SARS, for the equivalent of $215 each — discounted to $200 if one buys 500 or more. At the sprawling, semi-enclosed market in Langfang, an electronics manufacturing hub south of Beijing, one vendor advertised a live crocodile ($550) and a porcupine ($115).  In Wuhan, the authorities have not given details about all the animals that were on sale in the market linked to the new coronavirus. People on social media circulated a photograph of a price list for a variety of animals purported to be sold by a vendor in the market, but its authenticity could not be confirmed.  According to a medical blog posted on WeChat, the health authorities in Wuhan visited the market in September and inspected eight vendors selling frogs, snakes and hedgehogs, among other animals. All were licensed to sell wildlife, and no violations were found. Despite the spread of the virus around the country, a Hong Kong television network, I-Cable News Channel, found scores of wild animals still for sale on Wednesday at a market in Qingyuan, a city in Guangdong, the province where SARS originated.  The epidemic has now put sellers on the defensive. “Are you sure it is eating wild animals that has caused the epidemic?” said Zheng Ming, the sales manager of a company selling  animals in Yichang, a city 180 miles west of Wuhan. Until the ban on sales announced this past week, he sold porcupines, civets, guinea pigs and bamboo rats among others. “We observe the law,” he said. “This is a completely legal business.” James Gorman contributed reporting from New York.

"75 Years After Auschwitz Liberation, Worry That ‘Never Again’ Is Not Assured",2020-01-25,By Marc Santora,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Even before the gas chambers were destroyed and the savage toll of years of industrialized mass murder revealed to the world, prisoners at the largest Nazi concentration camp were already repeating two words: Never again. But as the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz approaches, an occasion being marked by events around the world and culminating in a solemn ceremony at the former death camp on Monday that will include dozens of aging Holocaust survivors, Piotr Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, is worried. “More and more we seem to be having trouble connecting our historical knowledge with our moral choices today,” he said. “I can imagine a society that understands history very well but does not draw any conclusion from this knowledge.” In this current political moment, he added, that can be dangerous. All one has to do is look at the backdrop against which this anniversary is taking place. Across Europe and in the United States, there is concern about a resurgence of anti-Semitism. Toxic political rhetoric and attacks directed at groups of peoples — using language to dehumanize them — that were once considered taboo have become common across the world’s democracies. And as the living memory of World War II and the Holocaust fades, the institutions created to guard against a repeat of such bloody conflicts, and such barbarism, are under increasing strain. With the very notion of the truth and facts under assault in increasingly polarized societies, control over the historical narrative is yet another battlefield. Even the memory of Auschwitz — where 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, were murdered — has been weaponized. As world leaders converged on Israel this past week for a ceremony at Yad Vashem, the hillside Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the event was clouded by a bitter dispute between Poland and Russia. After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was offered a speaking role, the president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, pulled out when he was not granted the same privilege. “Unfortunately, I am sorry to say this, but President Putin consciously, certainly, spreads historical lies and obviously does it with an agenda because he is trying in this way to erase the responsibility of Stalinist Russia for the start of World War II together with Nazi Germany,” Mr. Duda told Israeli state television. “I imagine he is ashamed of it today.” But far from expressing shame, Mr. Putin and his government have been increasingly aggressive in their efforts to whitewash the historical record concerning the Soviet-German nonaggression pact of 1939 and the subsequent invasion and subjugation of Poland. “It was them who, while pursuing their mercenary and exorbitantly overgrown ambitions, laid their people, the Polish people, open to attack from Germany’s military machine and, moreover, generally contributed to the beginning of the Second World War,” Mr. Putin has asserted. While Poland is a deeply divided country when it comes to politics and culture, the outrage over Mr. Putin’s remarks is nearly universal in the country, as is the support for Mr. Duda’s decision to boycott the event at Yad Vashem. “It’s surreal that a global event dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust victims becomes a political affair, a cover for history trading,” said Shevah Weiss, an Israeli political scientist and former president of Yad Vashem. Born in Poland in 1935, he is a Holocaust survivor and served as an Israeli ambassador to Poland. “The Polish president was right to refuse to attend it,” he added. But the current Polish government’s stance is complicated by its own efforts to shape history to promote its own brand of aggrieved nationalism. After the government passed a law that would have made it a crime to accuse Poland of complicity in the Holocaust, which critics said could stifle free speech, the international backlash was swift. Poland ended up backing down but not before undermining years of hard work to build better relations with Israel. It also brought a strong rebuke from American lawmakers, usually steadfast allies. Pawel Spiewak, the director of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, said it was all very sad. So many people were “touched by hell” during the war, he said, but instead of finding common ground, political leaders stoke division and risk repeating the mistakes of the past. “The language and system of values of the new Europe that emerged after the Second World War are being forgotten,” he said. “People don’t want to listen to it. I would say they are even tired of it.” That makes for a public more susceptible to false and distorted narratives. Which is why Auschwitz itself remains so important. Unlike many of the concentration camps, where a total of six million Jews were killed over the course of the war, Auschwitz largely escaped destruction. Last year, more than two million visitors crossed under the same wrought iron gateway as tens of thousands of prisoners once did, looking up at the cruelly ironic words “Arbeit Macht Frei,” or work sets you free. For most during the war, freedom would never come. While the two main gas chambers were blown up by the Nazis before they fled, the ruins still testify to their existence. Visitors can see the ovens used to incinerate the remains of those slaughtered. The train tracks leading into Birkenau, where cattle cars would arrive crammed with Jews who were swiftly herded into the gas chambers, are no longer used but remain a ghastly reminder of the scale, reach and industrialization of the murder apparatus. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire and philanthropist, has made it his mission to help preserve the site, helping to raise $110 million to that end. He said that while historians can speak to events, there was simply no substitute for hearing the stories of real people in a real place made of real brick and mortar. And this anniversary was special, he said, simply because with the passage of time, there are fewer witnesses left to tell their story. “Almost half the survivors have died in the last five years,” he said in an interview. “This will be the last time we get people together.” Zofia Posmysz, a 96-year-old Polish survivor of Auschwitz, will not be able to attend the ceremony but said that she had followed the recent political dispute. Listening to Mr. Putin’s attacks on Poland, she said, “takes me back immediately and keeps me awake at night.” “I fear that over time, it will become easier to distort history,” she said in her apartment in Warsaw. “I cannot say it will never happen again, because when you look at some leaders of today, those dangerous ambitions, pride and sense of being better than others are still at play. Who knows where they can lead.” Joanna Berendt contributed reporting from Warsaw, and Andrew Higgins from Moscow.']",
E.U. Farm Chief Pledges to Tackle Corruption in Subsidy Program,2020-01-23,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — The European Union’s new top agricultural official promised on Thursday to introduce anticorruption measures in response to a New York Times investigation that revealed how the bloc’s huge farm subsidy program underwrites a system of political patronage and land grabbing. The $65-billion-a-year fund is one of the world’s largest subsidy schemes. The money, which many farmers regard as a birthright and which dates to the founding of the European Union, has helped transform the continent into a dominant agricultural producer. But the Times investigation showed how populist far-right politicians have used the program to enrich themselves and their political allies at the expense of small farmers. It also showed how the program has contributed to devastating environmental problems — among them rising greenhouse gas emissions, polluted rivers and sharp reductions in bird populations. The bloc’s new agricultural commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, told members of the European Parliament on Thursday that he would work to tighten controls. “I would like to introduce a list of preventive anticorruption measures,” he said. He was responding to a question about the Times investigation from Francisco Guerreiro, a European lawmaker from Portugal. Mr. Wojciechowski’s response, if short on specifics, signaled that top officials in Brussels are considering direct steps to combat corruption in the subsidy program. European officials had previously said that it was up to national leaders — including those who have manipulated and benefited from the subsidies — to institute reforms or crack down on abuses. The Times tracked at least $49 million in subsidies to companies controlled by Prime Minister Andrej Babis of the Czech Republic, for example. And reporters mapped government farmland sales in Hungary that made the family and friends of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, eligible for millions of dollars in subsidies. Despite such problems, any significant changes proposed by Mr. Wojciechowski are likely to be hotly contested. Some of the European lawmakers who write the subsidy policy also benefit personally from the program, a situation that is allowed by Europe’s weak and murky conflict-of-interest rules. Cracking down will also be difficult because much of the abuse documented by The Times can be traced to the subsidy formula itself. The European Union pays farmers based on how much land they control, a system that encourages farmers to acquire more and more property. In Hungary, leaders have doled out huge swaths of government-owned farmland, making the new owners eligible for subsidies. In Bulgaria, a handful of grain barons receive most of the subsidies. Slovakian farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for farmland. These sorts of abuses are typically left to the national governments to police. Just this month, Italian officials arrested 94 people suspected of being involved in a Mafia scheme to make millions from European farm subsidies. Mr. Wojciechowski reiterated his office’s longstanding support for a subsidy cap, a measure intended to reduce the amount of subsidies that go to the biggest farmers. Currently, about 80 percent of subsidies go to the wealthiest 20 percent of recipients. But such a change would need approval from national leaders, many of whom are organizing against it. “I think large farms — at some level this is more of an enterprise than a farm, so financing such holdings should be limited,” Mr. Wojciechowski said. “Whether it happens or not, that’s up to member states.” The subsidies are at a crossroads this year as lawmakers in Brussels debate their renewal. European leaders have not said how the farm program fits into their ambitious new environmental agenda, known as the Green Deal. Agriculture is by far the biggest item in the European budget, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all spending.']","The vow follows a New York Times investigation showing how one of the world’s largest subsidy programs enriches far-right leaders, bankrolls oligarchs and underwrites Mafia tactics."
"Afghanistan Is Ready for Major U.S. Troop Reduction, Ghani Says",2020-01-23,By Rebecca Blumenstein and Mujib Mashal,"['DAVOS, Switzerland — Afghanistan is prepared for a major reduction in United States forces there, President Ashraf Ghani said on Thursday, adding that he had given that message to President Trump, a step toward winding down the costly American military presence as diplomats struggle to finalize a peace deal with the Taliban. About 12,000 American troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of about 100,000 eight years ago. The eventual withdrawal of those forces has been one of the strongest pieces of leverage American negotiators have in talks with the Taliban to end the 18-year war. A gradual reduction in United States troops in the country has taken place over the last year, despite the absence of a settlement emerging from peace negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar over the past year. Mr. Trump declared the talks “dead” in September, just as the two sides were on the verge of finalizing an agreement. They later resumed, but have since stalled. Mr. Ghani has been a vocal critic of the United States’ negotiations with the insurgents, because the talks have excluded his government. But speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, he said he had told Mr. Trump that the Afghan government was ready for a further reduction of 4,000 American troops, one-third of those remaining. An official close to Mr. Ghani said his stance was in keeping with the Afghan government’s longstanding efforts to offer cost savings to an American president who complains about the price of deployments overseas. In return, Mr. Ghani hopes the United States will reconsider what he sees as a rushed deal that legitimizes the Taliban and leaves the Washington-backed government to fend for itself. “We are totally ready for a withdrawal of 4,000 troops anytime the president decides,” Mr. Ghani told reporters at the economic gathering, a day after he met with Mr. Trump. American negotiators have been in Qatar for the past several weeks, trying to kickstart the stalled peace process. In exchange for returning to the pact that they were close to approving in September, they have demanded that the Taliban agree to significantly reduce violence before the deal is signed. The signing of the American-Taliban deal would open the way for negotiations between the insurgents and other Afghans, including Mr. Ghani’s government, over power-sharing. On a visit to Afghanistan in November, Mr. Trump caused confusion over United States policy toward the insurgents, repeating the Afghan government’s demand for an extensive cease-fire before talks could resume. American negotiators had long believed that holding out for a cease-fire before announcing a troop withdrawal was too ambitious and that the Taliban was unlikely to agree to it. In recent weeks, the Taliban came to the negotiating table with an offer of a brief period of “violence reduction,” a vague term that officials say could amount to holding back attacks on major cities and highways. As American diplomats evaluate that offer, Mr. Trump seems to have toned down his earlier demand, aligning it with his negotiators’ position. An official summary of his Wednesday meeting with Mr. Ghani made no mention of a cease-fire, instead citing “the need for a significant and lasting reduction in violence by the Taliban.” But Mr. Ghani’s government has insisted on pushing the Taliban for nothing short of a cease-fire to show that the insurgents are genuine about peace and negotiating a shared political future, saying that a “reduction of violence” is meaningless. “It’s like pregnancy,” Mr. Ghani said. “We really can’t be half pregnant.” In another sign that significant differences remain between the Afghan government and the White House over the peace process, a close adviser to Mr. Ghani lashed out at the Taliban on Thursday and said that “foreigners” would not be able to impose a deal on the Afghan people. Speaking at the Kabul-based Institute of War and Peace Studies on Thursday, Amrullah Saleh, Mr. Ghani’s running mate in a recent election whose result is being disputed, said that Taliban violence had predated the United States invasion in 2001, and expressed concern that a deal between Americans and the insurgents might not mean an end to the fighting. “It is possible that the U.S. and Taliban negotiations in Doha might end the war between the U.S. and the Taliban, but it is impossible for those negotiations to end the Taliban’s war with the Afghan nation,” Mr. Saleh said. In a response that signaled how fraught any direct talks between the Afghan government and insurgents would be, a former Taliban minister alluded to the barbarity that predated the Taliban government of the 1990s. He said the Taliban had arisen to end the anarchy and violence created when several armed factions fought to fill a power vacuum left by the Soviet withdrawal. Agha Jan Motasim, who was finance minister during the Taliban government, said all sides of the 40-year conflict, including the Taliban, had made mistakes. Reaching a peace agreement required looking beyond past grievances and thoughts of revenge, he said. “If we repeat the Taliban’s wrongdoings and not mention their good,” Mr. Motasim said, “we will just be fanning the flames.” Rebecca Blumenstein reported from Davos, Switzerland, and Mujib Mashal from Kabul, Afghanistan.']","The Afghan leader said he had told President Trump that the United States could withdraw a third of its troops, even as a peace deal with Taliban remains elusive."

The Case of the 5 Missing Dogs: What Happened to the ‘Tamworth 5’?,2020-01-23,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON —\xa0Becky Parsons was in a taxi from Birmingham Airport when her mother called to give her the bad news: The daughter’s two dogs had gone missing. Before traveling to Spain for a vacation, Ms. Parsons had left them in the care of a licensed dog sitter whom she had previously trusted with her pets. But this time around the sitter replied to text messages only “hours and hours later,” she said. And when Ms. Parsons’ mother went to pick up the dogs, the sitter said told her that the animals had disappeared during a walk in the woods. When her mother relayed the news, Ms. Parsons recalled, “Absolute panic washed over me.” On Thursday, Birmingham Magistrates’ Court disqualified the sitter, Louise Lawford, 49, from having custody of a dog for five years and fined her nearly 3,500 pounds (more than $4,500) over animal welfare offenses. Although those offenses did not cover the dogs’ disappearance, the sentencing brought partial closure in a case that has prompted anger and sadness in Britain, even in the absence of criminal charges against her. The case had been brought by Birmingham City Council, which accused her of nine animal welfare offenses, including having too many dogs in her care at one time. The BBC reported last week that her dog-sitting license was also revoked after the dogs went missing. “This is an unusual and upsetting case where license conditions for home dog boarding were flouted,” Vikki Allwood, a senior animal welfare officer with the Council, said after the sentencing. “Ms Lawford put the health and welfare of dogs in her care at risk,” she said of the offenses, which included breaching conditions attached to her license and failing to provide veterinary care for a dog that had a skin infection. “I trust this case has brought some comfort to the owners,” Ms. Allwood said. Several elements of the disappearances, which occurred last June, have piqued widespread interest in Britain. Of particular curiosity is that Ms. Parsons’ dogs — Maddie, a 6-year-old pug mix, and Pablo, a 7-year-old black pug — were not the only dogs to disappear under Ms. Lawford’s care that day. No trace of the animals has been found. Ms. Lawford told the court on Thursday that after separating from her husband in March, she had suffered a nervous breakdown and had made the “foolish decision” to continue looking after dogs, the BBC reported. Ms. Parsons’ mother realized that other dogs were missing when she went to look for Maddie and Pablo in the woods, near the town of Tamworth, about eight miles from Ms. Lawford’s home in central England. During that search, Ms. Parsons said in a telephone interview on Tuesday, the mother met other owners who were also trying to find their pets there. Several of the dogs under Ms. Lawford’s care at the time had health problems: One was blind, another was deaf and a third had a deformed leg. The other two were old or timid. All of which made it hard to believe that they had run away, Ms. Parsons said. She also said that the pet owners had discovered that the woods where Ms. Lawford had claimed to be out walking the dogs were closed for military exercises that day. And she said that Ms. Lawford changed her story about the dogs’ disappearance several times and had since avoided all contact. The owners were stumped, Ms. Parsons said. “We thought maybe she was being blackmailed or they’d been stolen.” That is where the case —\xa0which British news outlets have dubbed the “Tamworth Five” — took a sinister turn. Ms. Parsons said that she received a phone call on July 30 from someone who claimed to be close to Ms. Lawford and said that the dogs were dead. The person said the call was “to put us out of our torture and misery,” Ms. Parsons said. The owners notified the police, but the person who had made the phone call declined to speak to officers. In the absence of any bodies, the owners were told that there was not enough evidence for a criminal prosecution. That left the council in Birmingham, which had issued Ms. Lawford’s license, to pursue the matter. Such stories about pets in Britain tend to get outsize attention in the news media. Reports of the killing and mutilation of hundreds of cats over several years in London provoked intense interest until the mystery was solved in 2018: After a three-year investigation, the police concluded that foxes were to blame. But the case of the Tamworth Five appears far from resolution. April Lock, whose two pugs, Ralph and Charlie, were among the dogs that disappeared under Ms. Lawford’s care, wrote of her anguish on Facebook in August. “When does it get better? When does the pain go?” she posted. “I thought you would get the best care,” she wrote, “and here I am left with nothing but pain and sadness without you both.” Ms. Parsons said she had found the experience traumatic. “It’s been my worst nightmare,” she said.']","After five pets disappeared while in the care of a licensed sitter in central England, their owners went looking for answers."
Holocaust Gathering Lets Some Leaders Score Present-Day Political Points,2020-01-23,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called for vigilance “not to miss when the first sprouts of hatred, of chauvinism, of xenophobia and anti-Semitism start to rear their ugly head.” Prince Charles warned that hatred and intolerance “still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises and still seek new victims.” And Vice President Mike Pence urged world leaders to “stand strong” against Iran — “the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.” As dignitaries from scores of western nations met in Jerusalem to remember the liberation of Auschwitz 75 years ago and express their resolve to combat anti-Semitism, the invocations of the past were as often aimed at scoring present-day geopolitical points as at sounding the alarm about a resurgence of bigotry and anti-Jewish violence. The president of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said his country now resists “the poison that is nationalism.” Then he hauntingly cited the attack last fall on a synagogue in Halle, Germany. “I wish I could say that we Germans have learned from our history once and for all, but I cannot say that when hatred is spreading,” he said. “I cannot say that when Jewish children are spat on in the schoolyard. I cannot say that when crude anti-Semitism is cloaked in supposed criticism of Israeli policy. And I cannot say that when only a thick wooden door prevents a right-wing terrorist from causing a massacre, a blood bath, in a synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur.” Mr. Putin, as nationalist as they come, noted that “the Soviet nation was the one that put an end to the Nazis’ malicious plan,” and took credit for the Red Army having “liberated Europe.” Alluding to his war of dueling historical narratives with Poland’s president over their countries’ actions during the Holocaust and roles in the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Putin said that “the memory of the Holocaust will continue being a lesson and a warning only if the true story is told, without omitting the facts.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, like Mr. Pence, did not let the opportunity pass to urge world leaders to follow the United States’ example in confronting Iran. “The tyrants of Tehran that subjugate their own people and threaten the peace and security of the entire world, they threaten the peace and security of everyone in the Middle East and everyone beyond,” he said. In a proud, if slightly bellicose address, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel was “eternally grateful” to the Allied powers that defeated Hitler, but noted that during Hitler’s rise, “when the Jewish people faced annihilation, the world largely turned its back on us.” He called Auschwitz “the ultimate symbol of Jewish powerlessness,” adding, “Today, we have a voice, we have a land, and we have a shield,” the Israeli armed forces. “And what a shield it is.” The unusual gathering, with streams of royals and republican rulers all but shutting the Holy City down under high security, comes before Monday’s anniversary of the 1945 liberation of Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi death camp in Poland where some 1.1 million people perished, most of them Jews. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, angered that Mr. Putin was given a speaking slot but he was not, stayed home. But their dispute bled over into a memorial book printed in advance of the commemoration. Mr. Putin has sought to portray Poland as a perpetrator rather than a victim of the Holocaust, claiming the Polish ambassador to Berlin had lauded Hitler’s effort to rid Europe of Jews. In the memorial book, Mr. Duda promised to “always uphold the truth about the tragedy that struck our country.” And Mr. Putin criticized efforts “to distort the truth about the Second World War and rehabilitate the aggressors and their accomplices.” Mr. Putin had a busy schedule on his day trip. He unveiled a monument in Jerusalem’s central Sacher Park to the victims of the siege of Leningrad, a grisly 900-day national trauma that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Russian civilians. And he cheered Israelis by hinting broadly that Russia would soon release an Israeli-American woman who was given a long prison sentence last year after several grams of marijuana were found in her checked bags while she was changing planes in Moscow. The Palestinians were not invited to the Holocaust commemoration, but they were not merely watching from the sidelines. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, met with President Emmanuel Macron of France late Wednesday, and with Mr. Putin Thursday evening. Still, those meetings paled next to what some critics of Mr. Abbas said was the embarrassment of so many leaders visiting Israel, after President Trump in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as its capital. Amer Hamdan, 38, a lawyer and activist in Nablus, said the gathering amounted to “an implicit recognition that Jerusalem is the de facto capital of Israel” and “a catastrophic failure of Palestinian diplomacy.” Prince Charles was to meet with the Palestinian leader in Bethlehem on Friday after visiting the Church of Nativity, and before a stop in East Jerusalem at the Mount of Olives, where his grandmother, Princess Alice, is buried. In his remarks at Yad Vashem, the prince noted that in 1943 his grandmother had taken a Jewish family into her home in Athens, saving them from the Nazis, “a fact which gives me and my family immense pride.” It was left to Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, who at age 8 was liberated from Buchenwald, then rose to become Israel’s chief rabbi and chairman of the Yad Vashem Council, to bring the proceedings back to earth in the end. “Leaders of the world, the world is in your arms, in your hands,” he said, smiling. “With one sentence, one signature, you can decide upon millions of people. So decide on love, and friendship, and peace, forever.” Katie Rogers and Mohammed Najib contributed reporting.']",Dignitaries from across the globe gathered to remember the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
"75 Years After Auschwitz Liberation, Worry That ‘Never Again’ Is Not Assured",2020-01-25,By Marc Santora,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Even before the gas chambers were destroyed and the savage toll of years of industrialized mass murder revealed to the world, prisoners at the largest Nazi concentration camp were already repeating two words: Never again. But as the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz approaches, an occasion being marked by events around the world and culminating in a solemn ceremony at the former death camp on Monday that will include dozens of aging Holocaust survivors, Piotr Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, is worried. “More and more we seem to be having trouble connecting our historical knowledge with our moral choices today,” he said. “I can imagine a society that understands history very well but does not draw any conclusion from this knowledge.” In this current political moment, he added, that can be dangerous. All one has to do is look at the backdrop against which this anniversary is taking place. Across Europe and in the United States, there is concern about a resurgence of anti-Semitism. Toxic political rhetoric and attacks directed at groups of peoples — using language to dehumanize them — that were once considered taboo have become common across the world’s democracies. And as the living memory of World War II and the Holocaust fades, the institutions created to guard against a repeat of such bloody conflicts, and such barbarism, are under increasing strain. With the very notion of the truth and facts under assault in increasingly polarized societies, control over the historical narrative is yet another battlefield. Even the memory of Auschwitz — where 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, were murdered — has been weaponized. As world leaders converged on Israel this past week for a ceremony at Yad Vashem, the hillside Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the event was clouded by a bitter dispute between Poland and Russia. After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was offered a speaking role, the president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, pulled out when he was not granted the same privilege. “Unfortunately, I am sorry to say this, but President Putin consciously, certainly, spreads historical lies and obviously does it with an agenda because he is trying in this way to erase the responsibility of Stalinist Russia for the start of World War II together with Nazi Germany,” Mr. Duda told Israeli state television. “I imagine he is ashamed of it today.” But far from expressing shame, Mr. Putin and his government have been increasingly aggressive in their efforts to whitewash the historical record concerning the Soviet-German nonaggression pact of 1939 and the subsequent invasion and subjugation of Poland. “It was them who, while pursuing their mercenary and exorbitantly overgrown ambitions, laid their people, the Polish people, open to attack from Germany’s military machine and, moreover, generally contributed to the beginning of the Second World War,” Mr. Putin has asserted. While Poland is a deeply divided country when it comes to politics and culture, the outrage over Mr. Putin’s remarks is nearly universal in the country, as is the support for Mr. Duda’s decision to boycott the event at Yad Vashem. “It’s surreal that a global event dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust victims becomes a political affair, a cover for history trading,” said Shevah Weiss, an Israeli political scientist and former president of Yad Vashem. Born in Poland in 1935, he is a Holocaust survivor and served as an Israeli ambassador to Poland. “The Polish president was right to refuse to attend it,” he added. But the current Polish government’s stance is complicated by its own efforts to shape history to promote its own brand of aggrieved nationalism. After the government passed a law that would have made it a crime to accuse Poland of complicity in the Holocaust, which critics said could stifle free speech, the international backlash was swift. Poland ended up backing down but not before undermining years of hard work to build better relations with Israel. It also brought a strong rebuke from American lawmakers, usually steadfast allies. Pawel Spiewak, the director of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, said it was all very sad. So many people were “touched by hell” during the war, he said, but instead of finding common ground, political leaders stoke division and risk repeating the mistakes of the past. “The language and system of values of the new Europe that emerged after the Second World War are being forgotten,” he said. “People don’t want to listen to it. I would say they are even tired of it.” That makes for a public more susceptible to false and distorted narratives. Which is why Auschwitz itself remains so important. Unlike many of the concentration camps, where a total of six million Jews were killed over the course of the war, Auschwitz largely escaped destruction. Last year, more than two million visitors crossed under the same wrought iron gateway as tens of thousands of prisoners once did, looking up at the cruelly ironic words “Arbeit Macht Frei,” or work sets you free. For most during the war, freedom would never come. While the two main gas chambers were blown up by the Nazis before they fled, the ruins still testify to their existence. Visitors can see the ovens used to incinerate the remains of those slaughtered. The train tracks leading into Birkenau, where cattle cars would arrive crammed with Jews who were swiftly herded into the gas chambers, are no longer used but remain a ghastly reminder of the scale, reach and industrialization of the murder apparatus. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire and philanthropist, has made it his mission to help preserve the site, helping to raise $110 million to that end. He said that while historians can speak to events, there was simply no substitute for hearing the stories of real people in a real place made of real brick and mortar. And this anniversary was special, he said, simply because with the passage of time, there are fewer witnesses left to tell their story. “Almost half the survivors have died in the last five years,” he said in an interview. “This will be the last time we get people together.” Zofia Posmysz, a 96-year-old Polish survivor of Auschwitz, will not be able to attend the ceremony but said that she had followed the recent political dispute. Listening to Mr. Putin’s attacks on Poland, she said, “takes me back immediately and keeps me awake at night.” “I fear that over time, it will become easier to distort history,” she said in her apartment in Warsaw. “I cannot say it will never happen again, because when you look at some leaders of today, those dangerous ambitions, pride and sense of being better than others are still at play. Who knows where they can lead.” Joanna Berendt contributed reporting from Warsaw, and Andrew Higgins from Moscow.']",
Africa’s Richest Woman Set to Face Charges in Angola Over Embezzlement,2020-01-23,"By Michael Forsythe, Gilberto Neto and Megan Specia","['Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman and the daughter of Angola’s former president, is set to be charged with committing crimes to enrich herself, after an investigation into embezzlement of millions of dollars from a state oil company she once headed, Angolan officials said. Angola’s attorney general, Hélder Pitta Grós, said on late Wednesday that Ms. dos Santos would be charged with “money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management” and “forgery of documents, among other economic crimes” committed when she ran the oil company. “I can say that from the investigation we conducted, we will now move to criminal charges,” Mr. Pitta Grós said, speaking at a news conference in Luanda, the country’s capital. The announcement came days after a trove of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The New York Times revealed Ms. dos Santos’s efforts to profit on business dealings tied to the Angolan government. Those connections helped her build a fortune worth over $2 billion, according to Forbes. The heart of the Angolan investigation involves her tenure at Sonangol, the state oil monopoly, particularly during November 2017, the month she was fired as its chairwoman. More than $57 million was withdrawn at the time from Sonangol’s account at EuroBic — a Portuguese bank where Ms. dos Santos is the biggest shareholder — to pay for a flurry of invoices issued by a Dubai company owned by her friend.  On Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that a EuroBic banker who managed the Sonangol account, Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, had been found dead on Wednesday night at his house in Lisbon. Lusa cited a police source saying it was probably a suicide. Mr. da Cunha’s name appears extensively in the leaked documents as a banker facilitating business for Ms. dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo. The couple increasingly relied on EuroBic, the Portuguese arm of an Angolan lender, as bigger, global banks declined to do business with her. Lenders in the European Union and the United States are bound by rules constraining their ability to work with politically exposed persons and are required to report suspicious transactions to regulators.  The banker’s name is on an email confirming a payment to a Dubai shell company on Nov. 15, 2017. Ms. dos Santos was fired from Sonangol that day, and some of the funds were paid out after the new Angolan president, who had replaced her father, announced her dismissal, the documents show. Ms. dos Santos, 46, speaking to the BBC earlier this month, said the payments were earmarked for firms including the Boston Consulting Group, PwC and McKinsey & Company, with the shell company acting as an intermediary overseeing their work with Sonangol. None of the firms, when asked, would provide billing information to verify her claim.  EuroBic announced on Monday that it was ending its “commercial relationship” with Ms. dos Santos, and would be investigating transfers worth tens of millions of dollars. Ms. dos Santos said in a statement on Thursday that the leaking of the documents, and their subsequent publication, stemmed from “a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.” ""It is an attempt to neutralize me and to discredit the legacy of President dos Santos and his family,” she said. Her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, was president for 38 years until he stepped down in 2017. As scrutiny of Ms. dos Santos increased in recent months, she turned to lawyers and public relations professionals to defend her record. In December, she hired a Washington lobbying firm, Sonoran Policy Group, to set up “meetings and interactions” in the United States and Britain, according to a disclosure the firm filed. That contract, as well as another one signed with the firm on Jan. 2 to work with the media on her behalf, total more than $2 million. Sonoran, founded by the lobbyist Robert Stryk, leapt to prominence in the early days of the Trump presidency when it landed big contracts with foreign governments and leaders — including a Saudi ministry — eager for help navigating the administration, The Times reported in 2017. Ms. dos Santos and several business associates, all Portuguese nationals, would face charges, Mr. Pitta Grós said, adding, “We have enough reasons to prosecute these people.” “At this moment our concern is that they be notified of the charges brought against them, and that they present themselves voluntarily to the court in order for them to be able to defend themselves,” he said.  When asked if his office knew of Ms. dos Santos’s whereabouts, he seemed unsure. “We only know from the social media that she has been living in London and Russia,” he said. Ms. dos Santos owns homes around the world, including in Dubai, Lisbon, London and Monte Carlo.  Álvaro João, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, clarified in a Thursday interview that formal charges had not yet been filed, but were likely, and that they were part of an investigation that began in 2018. “These are not yet formal charges, as investigations continue and if needed we will then charge her and the others,” he said.   Angola has sought help in the corruption investigation from Portugal, where Ms. dos Santos has links to several companies. Mr. Pitta Grós traveled to Lisbon on Thursday to meet with the Portuguese attorney general, according to Portugal’s public service broadcaster, Rádio e Televisão de Portugal. Angola has immense oil and mineral wealth, but many of its people live in deep poverty, without access to basic services, and the country is rife with corruption. The recently leaked documents provide a detailed account of how Ms. dos Santos exploited her country’s resources, acquiring stakes in Angola’s lucrative diamond industry, banks, its leading cement manufacturer and its largest mobile phone company — often through orders signed by her father. She has denied any wrongdoing and has long maintained that she is a self-made woman. Daphné Anglès contributed reporting.']",
"Protesters Mass in Baghdad, Demanding U.S. Leave Iraq",2020-01-24,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Throngs of Iraqis gathered on the streets of the capital, Baghdad, on Friday to protest the United States military presence at the behest of a leading populist cleric and armed forces with ties to Iran. The demonstration came three weeks after the United States launched a drone strike in capital that killed the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and a prominent member of the Iraqi government, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, with close ties to the Popular Mobilization Forces, some of whom are close to Iran.  Days later, at the urging of the Iraqi prime minister, the Parliament endorsed a measure demanding the expulsion of foreign forces from Iraq, which in the minds of most Iraqis meant American troops. The protest on Friday was the first designed specifically to denounce the American presence in Iraq since the parliamentary measure.   Organizers had hoped for a  larger turnout than anything in recent years, but estimates by the Iraqi Security forces as the march wound down suggested they might be disappointed. Counts of aerial views of the marchers put the numbers at around 200,000 to 250,000. “Participating in this demonstration is like voting in a referendum on the decision of the Iraqi Parliament” to expel American forces, said Sheikh Satar al-Shimmari, from Diyala Province, who was organizing busloads of people to attend. Many marchers carried the same signs, most of them written in English and aimed at an American audience. One read: “To the families of American soldiers. Insist on the withdrawal of your sons from our country or prepare their coffins.”   Another read: “America, the Devil; You have no mercy.” Others were simpler: “No America.” Some people waved flags and a number who were followers of Moqtada al-Sadr, the populist and anti-American Shiite cleric, wore a large white scarf or cape to signal their willingness to die for their cause. The white cape is a nod to the white shroud in which all Muslims are buried.  Wandering through the crowds was Ali Mohammed, 70, in long worn robes, selling small cups of traditional Arabic coffee poured from a battered brass beaker.  Asked what he thought about the demonstration, he shook his head.  “What benefit will Iraq get if the American troops leave?” he asked. “Look at my condition, at my age, I am still doing this, will it change if the Americans leave?”   He shook his head.  The protest was concentrated in Baghdad, and people were  brought in from other cities to participate rather than holding smaller simultaneous demonstrations across the country. Although the event was carefully organized and scripted by Mr. al-Sadr, a populist anti-American Shiite cleric, and given heft by Iraqi armed groups close to Iran, it also reflected a genuine desire shared by Iraqis to have a government and economy that serves the Iraqi people and not outside interests, many participants said. Delivering on that may prove to be virtually impossible. But the United States’ recent actions in Iraq drew the wrath of many and distaste even among some Iraqis who support the United States presence.  It is particularly galling to many that the United States still has troops in Iraq and many people point out that while Iran also has influence, it does so without imposing its troops on the country.  The armed groups that are part of the Popular Mobilization, even though they are backed by Iran, are not perceived in the same way.  “We don’t need any foreign troops to be in Iraq, we need Iraq for Iraqis,” said Hoda Hashimi, an employee in the Ministry of Trade in Baghdad. “We don’t want Americans to leave, we want the troops to leave — we want America to support our country but with contracts, not troops.” This demonstration — unlike those in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad, which have gone on for months and involve a ragtag group of antigovernment protesters with homemade signs and a range of backgrounds — is heavily orchestrated rather than a spontaneous outpouring of feeling. Participants were recruited, transported by buses provided by the organizers and given signs, flags and sometimes food. The vast majority of the participants are Shiite Muslims, who are the main constituency of the cleric Mr. al-Sadr and the armed groups close to Iran. “The organizers of the demonstration in the southern city of Najaf called the Sadr followers, including me, and told us that there are buses and cars to transport the demonstrators from Najaf to Baghdad on Thursday at 1 p.m. and 9 p.m. and 11 p.m.,” said Mohammed Ali, 33, a taxi driver. He said most of his colleagues had also agreed to participate, for many reasons, among them their admiration of Mr. al-Sadr and for personal interests and opportunities. The buses bringing participants to Baghdad, especially from the south, belong to organizations aligned with the political wings of armed groups close to Iran. Tourism companies headed by people with links either to Mr. al-Sadr or to the militias were also involved, according to several people who were coming from Basra, Najaf and Diyala provinces, among others. But not everyone, even those in the strongholds of Shiite faith and political power, felt comfortable participating. “I reject this kind of protest — it is an abuse of the American and foreign presence,” said Mahdi al-Zubaydi of Dujail, a city north of Baghdad. “It sets a dangerous precedent that could allow Iran and its militias to control the wealth of Iraq and its people,” he said.']","A national march against the presence of United States forces, organized by a populist Shiite cleric and armed groups with ties to Iran, drew a crowd estimated at 200,000 to 250,000."
"U.N. Court’s Order on Rohingya Is Cheered, but Will Myanmar Comply?",2020-01-24,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — The surprisingly strong ruling against Myanmar by the United Nations’ top court this week is sure to increase international pressure on the country to protect its Muslim Rohingya minority, who critics say have been the victims of a government-sanctioned genocide. But on Friday — a day after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya and report back regularly on the steps it has taken to do so — it was still unclear what the country’s response would be. The government has said almost nothing about the ruling, except to deny that the widely documented killing and persecution of the Rohingya by Myanmar’s military amounted to genocide. Rights lawyers and an attorney for the African nation of Gambia, which brought the case, said the unanimous decision by the 15-judge panel had gone beyond even what Gambia had asked for. Myanmar and Gambia were each allowed to appoint a member of the panel, and even Myanmar’s choice — Claus Kress, a German law professor — sided with Gambia. “This is an important ruling for a number of reasons,” said Carla Ferstman, a senior lecturer at the Human Rights Center at the University of Essex in England. She said the decision “means it won’t be enough for Myanmar to just avoid doing bad things. It must take active steps, and then prove it has done so, with a clear timetable for reporting.” Myanmar has been condemned around for the world for its military’s assault on the Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine, which since 2017 has driven more than 700,000 people across the border into Bangladesh. Rights groups documented mass killings, rape and the burning of entire villages. More than 100,000 Rohingya have been forced into camps within Myanmar, many of them in waves of violence that predated the 2017 campaign. But for all of the denunciations by the United Nations, rights groups and various governments, the case brought by Gambia led to the first international court ruling against Myanmar since the atrocities began. “The court confirmed that no matter where genocide occurs, it’s a matter for the entire international community, and that a state does not have to be connected or affected by the genocide in order for them to take action to prevent, end and punish it,” said Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the New York-based Global Justice Center. Gambia, which brought the case on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, has asked the court to declare that Myanmar has violated the Genocide Convention. That decision could be years away. But in its ruling on Thursday, the court ordered Myanmar to take steps to prevent acts of genocide against the 600,000 Rohingya estimated to remain in the country, and to prevent the destruction of any evidence of genocide. Going further than Gambia had asked, the court also ordered Myanmar to file a report every six months until the case is resolved, spelling out what it has done to protect the Rohingya. (Gambia had asked only for a single report.) The first report is due in four months. The court has no enforcement powers, but the United Nations Security Council can act on its findings. The world body’s secretary-general, António Guterres, welcomed the ruling and said he would transmit it to the Security Council. Ms. Radhakrishnan said that if Myanmar disobeyed the order, it could mean an end to the “shocking level of leniency” she said the country had enjoyed on rights issues since its transition to partial democracy began in 2011. “Now, the failure to comply with such a clear legally binding order would have the potential to change this dynamic and have Myanmar face real consequences,” she said. The question now is whether Myanmar will comply. The government’s chief spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not respond to phone calls or written questions about the court order. He has previously said that he would only answer reporters’ questions at news conferences in the secluded capital, Naypyidaw. His last news conference there was more than two months ago. Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for Myanmar’s military, which operates autonomously from the civilian side of the government, said in a brief interview that it would “cooperate with the government and we will work under the guidance of the government” in response to the ruling. He did not elaborate. Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry issued a short statement after the ruling on Thursday that did not address the court’s order, but repeated the government’s denial that the Rohingya had been subjected to genocide. The statement echoed what appears to be Myanmar’s new public relations approach: admitting that war crimes were committed in Rakhine, but denying that they amounted to genocide. On Tuesday, a government-appointed commission released a summary of a report concluding that the security forces had engaged in mass killings of civilians in several locations in Rakhine, leaving as many as 900 dead. But it said it found no evidence of “genocidal intent.” The full report has not been released. “The commission found that war crimes had occurred, and those are now being investigated and prosecuted by Myanmar’s national criminal justice system,” the Foreign Ministry said in its statement. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader — a Nobel Peace laureate who has defended the military against the genocide accusations — made much the same point in an article published on Thursday in The Financial Times. The genocide case has pit predominantly Muslim Gambia, which only recently tossed out its longtime dictator, against predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, which has yet to fully emerge from decades of military control. “It is a very strong decision and it has given hope to Rohingya around the world,” said Arsalan Suleman, who was a diplomat in President Barack Obama’s State Department and is now an attorney on Gambia’s legal team. He praised Gambia’s “moral leadership” at a time when, he said, it often seems lacking on the global stage. “You have a country in Africa, not an extremely well-developed country, but a country that really cares about human rights and dignity, and it has made it a national concern to fight for the Rohingya,” Mr. Suleman said. In telephone interviews, Rohingya living in the Thae Chaung camp for internally displaced people, one of 14 such camps in Rakhine State, praised the court ruling and expressed hope that Myanmar would abide by the order. “We are living in terrible conditions,” said Ko Kyaw Aung, 32, who moved to the camp in 2012, after an anti-Rohingya mob destroyed his home and small grocery shop. “There is still no hope of closing down the camp and returning to our land.” He said the court’s order was “the only hope to bring justice and dignity” to Rohingya in the Rakhine camps, who he said numbered about 130,000. Dr. Ferstman, of the University of Essex, said the ruling amounted to “a good day for smaller nations, for less powerful groups, who doubt they can also achieve justice.” “Today, we have seen that the system can work for all and Gambia — a country with no direct link to Myanmar — should be applauded for bringing this case,” she said.

"At Holocaust Memorial, a Survivor and Towering Moral Voice Says He ‘Cannot Forgive’",2020-01-23,"By David M. Halbfinger, Isabel Kershner and Katie Rogers","['This briefing has ended. Read about how some of the world leaders gathered in Jerusalem invoked the past to score present-day political points.  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Vice President Mike Pence and the Prince of Wales joined dozens of Western leaders in Jerusalem on Thursday morning at Yad Vashem, the hillside memorial to the Holocaust, for an extraordinary demonstration of resolve to fight anti-Semitism. “We certainly all bear responsibility to make sure that the terrible tragedies of the past should never repeat themselves,” Mr. Putin said. “We have to make sure that future generations remember the horrors of the Holocaust.” “We have to be vigilant not to miss when the first sprouts of hatred, of chauvinism, of xenophobia and anti-Semitism start to rear their ugly head,” he added. The afternoon ceremony recalled the Jan. 27, 1945, liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in occupied Poland where 1.1 million people perished, by Red Army troops. But it drew pointed connections to the resurgence of anti-Semitism across much of Europe and North America. In a proud if slightly bellicose address, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “eternally grateful” to the Allied powers that defeated Hitler, but noted that during Hitler’s rise, “when the Jewish people faced annihilation, the world largely turned its back on us.” He called Auschwitz “the ultimate symbol of Jewish powerlessness,” adding, “Today, we have a voice, we have a land, and we have a shield,” the Israeli armed forces. Mr. Netanyahu did not let the opportunity pass to urge world leaders to follow the example of President Trump in confronting Iran. “The tyrants of Tehran that subjugate their own people and threaten the peace and security of the entire world, they threaten the peace and security of everyone in the Middle East and everyone beyond,” he said. It is the biggest political gathering in Israel’s history, and the Holy City was teeming with police officers, with some schools canceling classes and the main highway from the airport closed as motorcades streamed through with arriving heads of state. For Mr. Netanyahu, the presence of so many global chieftains — and the opportunity to meet with them in bilateral talks — was an important boon at an opportune time. Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader, is battling for his political life, awaiting trial on serious corruption charges even as he campaigns for re-election in the third ballot in a year, set to take place on March 2. The previous two elections were inconclusive. His centrist opponent, Benny Gantz, a former army chief, was holding his own meetings, including a morning session with a bipartisan delegation from the United States Congress that included the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Speaking on behalf of the Holocaust survivors at the Yad Vashem ceremony was Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, 82, who was sent with his brother to the Buchenwald concentration camp as a child, was liberated at the age of 8 by American forces and rose to become the chief rabbi of Israel and a towering moral voice of his generation. At the age of 7, he said, he had no name, only a number. “I came especially to tell you I cannot forgive,” he said, “because I am not authorized.” He said his parents, before they were taken away, “did not ask me to forgive. They asked me to continue the chain, so the Jewish chain will be unbroken, unbroken forever.” The scion of an old rabbinical dynasty and now the chairman of the Yad Vashem Council, Rabbi Lau added, “I can never forget.” In a powerful address taking full responsibility for the crimes of Nazi Germany and for the continuing fight against anti-Semitism, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany cautioned that “the spirits of evil are emerging in a new guise.” He opened and concluded his remarks at Yad Vashem with a Hebrew blessing and said he wished he could say Germans had learned from history, “but I cannot say that when hatred is spreading.” “I cannot say that when Jewish children are spat on in the schoolyard; I cannot say that when crude anti-Semitism is cloaked in supposed criticism of Israeli policy,” he added. “I cannot say that when only a thick wooden door prevents a right-wing terrorist from causing a blood bath in a synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur.” He was referring to an averted massacre in October when a gunman failed to break through the door of a small synagogue in Halle, Germany, but killed two people nearby. “Our age is a different age,” he said, “the words are not the same, the perpetrators are not the same perpetrators but it is the same evil, and there remains only one answer: Never again.” “This Germany will only live up to itself if it lives up to its historical responsibility,” he added. “We fight anti-Semitism. We resist the poison that is nationalism. We protect Jewish life. We stand with Israel. Here at Yad Vashem, I renew this promise before the eyes of the world.” President Emmanuel Macron of France appealed for unity and for states to put aside controversy over history. “This is not just history that one can read this way or another,” he said, speaking in French. “No. There was justice and there is history with proof and evidence, and there is the life of our nations, of our states. Let us not confuse between these things so we won’t be engulfed once again in those horrific and dismal, dire times.” Calling for “friendship, not hatred,” he said, “What better or greater symbol is there than to see us all convened her today, united.” he added, “It is incumbent on Europe to remain united.” Prince Charles called the Holocaust’s lessons “searingly relevant to this day.” “Hatred and intolerance still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises and still seek new victims,” he said, adding that the language used too often “turns disagreement into dehumanization.” “Real violence ensues, and acts of unspeakable cruelty are still perpetrated around the world against people for reasons of their religion, their race or their beliefs,” Charles said. He recalled his own grandmother Princess Alice of Battenberg, who sheltered and saved a Jewish family in occupied Athens in the 1930s and is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. She has a tree planted in her name as one of Yad Vashem’s honored “Righteous among the Nations.” This, Prince Charles said, brings “me and my family immense pride.” After months of hope and suspense in Israel, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia hinted soon after his arrival that the painful saga of a young Israeli woman imprisoned in Russia might be coming to an end, telling her mother, “Everything will be fine.” The Israeli-American citizen, Naama Issachar, 26, was sentenced last year to a long prison term in Russia after the authorities found a few grams of marijuana in her luggage as she waited at a Moscow airport to board a connecting flight home. Ms. Issachar’s mother, Yaffa Issachar, joined Mr. Putin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for part of a breakfast meeting in Jerusalem. She had spent months in Russia dealing with lawyers and the authorities and leading an emotional public campaign for her daughter’s release, winning the hearts of many Israelis. Ms. Issachar and the two leaders, along with Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister’s wife, emerged from the meeting on Thursday smiling. “I have just met with Naama’s mother,” Mr. Putin said, speaking in Russian. “It’s clear to me that Naama comes from a very good and decent family.” “The mother is very worried, and I see this,” he added. “I told her, and I would like to repeat it, that everything will be fine.” In a choreographed move later on Thursday, Ms. Issachar met in prison with the person responsible for maintaining human rights in Russia. Russian news outlets broadcast images of Ms. Issachar smiling after seeing the images of her mother with Mr. Putin in Jerusalem. During his visit, Vice President Mike Pence invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his chief political rival, Benny Gantz, to the White House to discuss the administration’s plan for Middle East peace — a proposal that had appeared to stall in recent months. “President Trump asked me to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House next week to discuss regional issues as well as the prospect of peace here in the Holy Land,” Mr. Pence said to reporters in Jerusalem. “At the prime minister’s suggestion, I also extended an invitation to Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party, and he has accepted the invitation to join the prime minister with the president at the White House next week.” Mr. Netanyahu said he had “gladly” accepted the invitation. Mr. Pence told reporters that Mr. Gantz had accepted as well. The invitation to discuss the plan provides a dose of counterprogramming — for President Trump, to help distract from his impeachment trial, and for Mr. Netanyahu, who has been indicted on corruption charges and has struggled to win re-election. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz, his chief political rival, have been locked in a stalemate with neither able to form a government after two elections. Palestinian officials have refused to participate in discussions about the peace plan with Washington, which it sees as biased in Israel’s favor. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine arrived in Israel before dawn on Thursday and quickly stirred up dust, announcing that he would not attend the Yad Vashem commemoration. He asked that his delegation’s few seats be given instead to Holocaust survivors, following the lead of several Israeli government ministers who had done so after learning that only a few dozen survivors would be among the nearly 800 guests at the ceremony. “These people deserve these honors most of all,” Mr. Zelensky, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, said on Twitter. He headed instead to the Western Wall for a private visit. But officials at Yad Vashem said that it was far too late to arrange to bring frail survivors to the ceremony, and called Mr. Zelensky’s decision regrettable. “It is a shame he decided to take such a step at an event under the banner of the memory of the Holocaust and fighting anti-Semitism,” the officials said in a statement. The pomp and circumstance surrounding the Jerusalem gathering at a time when 45,000 survivors of the Holocaust live below the poverty line in Israel has drawn growing anger. Some protesters picketed outside Yad Vashem with signs calling it unseemly that such a somber event had been turned into a “celebration.” Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, arrived in Israel on Air Force Two on Thursday morning. It was not his first official visit to commemorate the camp’s liberation: Last winter, he visited the concentration camp, alongside President Andrzej Duda of Poland. “We just felt waves of emotion,” Mr. Pence said about his time there. Later Thursday, Mr. Pence was scheduled to visit the Western Wall and meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the new, and hotly contested, location of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Not even an event as solemn as one centered on Holocaust remembrance could escape its share of high-level schmoozing. At Yad Vashem, the memorial to the Holocaust, world leaders delayed the beginning of the program by engaging in a lengthy round of hellos, good-jobs and handshakes before they took their seats. For his part, Mr. Netanyahu flitted from leader to leader, offering praise and smiles. “That was a great speech last night,” he told King Felipe VI of Spain before moving on. As he greeted other dignitaries with laughs and half-hugs, Mr. Netanyahu huddled with President Emmanuel Macron of France before the two turned away from a wall of cameras, apparently to speak privately. Vice President Mike Pence was less discreet about their interaction as he appeared to broach political matters back home. “We’re contending,” Mr. Pence told Mr. Netanyahu. “He’s unstoppable. Like somebody else I know,” the vice president added, an unmistakable nod to the impeachment battle that President Trump was waging at home. The surge in hotel reservations by visiting dignitaries had led to at least one unexpected lodging scenario: Mr. Pence was staying in the same hotel as Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker who led the impeachment effort against President Trump. Later, Mr. Pence spoke of his trip to the concentration camp, remarking on the scale of human suffering. “One cannot walk the grounds of Auschwitz without being moved beyond words,” he said. “One cannot see the piles of shoes, the lone boxcar on the rail, the gate to the camp, and the grainy photographs of men, women, and children being sent to their deaths without asking: ‘How could they?’” As he called for a global effort to combat the “rising tide of vile anti-Semitism fueling hate,” Mr. Pence tucked in a pointed reference to the United States’ recent conflicts with Iran, which he called “the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy.” When Piotr Cywinski took over as the director of Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland more than a decade ago, every day he would meet a survivor. Their stories were invariably wrenching, often surprising and always stirring. But as the years have passed, he said, those encounters have grown scarce. “We barely meet with survivors now in our daily educational work,” he said. So the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp seemed like a chance — perhaps the last one — to bring together as many as they could to mark the occasion. On Monday, when the liberation will be observed by a solemn ceremony, some 200 survivors will make their way back to the camp. While the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, will speak — given that the German death camp was in occupied Poland — Mr. Cywinski said, they had sought to keep the event as free from politics as possible. Instead, the focus will be on survivors and their stories. The philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder, who is also to speak at the event, said that was as it should be. “Almost half the survivors have died in the last five years,” Mr. Lauder noted in an interview. He has been involved in conservation efforts at Auschwitz for more than three decades. In view of the rise in anti-Semitism across Europe, he said, their voices needed to be heard both as a reminder and a warning. Mr. Lauder and Mr. Cywinski said those conservation efforts were essential in battling those who would distort or deny what had taken place here. But the burden of telling that story, he said, should no longer fall on the shoulders of the survivors. “They have done their job,” he said. “It is our responsibility now.” A prominent Muslim cleric from Saudi Arabia was to visit Auschwitz on Thursday as part of a joint delegation between the Mecca-based Muslim World League and the American Jewish Committee. The cleric, Mohammad al-Issa, served as the Saudi justice minister before being named to lead the league by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. He has since become the most public face of Prince Mohammed’s efforts to rebrand Saudi Arabia as an Islamic society open to other religions through his meetings with Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders around the world. In a statement, the American Jewish Committee hailed Dr. al-Issa’s visit at the head of a delegation including Muslims from 28 countries as “the most senior Islamic leadership delegation to ever visit Auschwitz or any Nazi German death camp.” “I believe that by paying my respects to the victims of Auschwitz, I will encourage Muslims and non-Muslims to embrace mutual respect, understanding and diversity,” Dr. al-Issa was quoted as saying by the committee statement during the signing last April of an agreement between it and his organization. After visiting Auschwitz on Thursday, the joint delegation will see a Jewish history museum and a synagogue in Warsaw on Friday before an interfaith dinner to observe the start of the Jewish Sabbath. President Andrzej Duda of Poland stayed away from the Jerusalem event after he was refused a speaking slot at the ceremony at Yad Vashem, though President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was given one as the leader of one of the Allied powers that liberated Europe and the world from Nazi tyranny. The backdrop to the dispute: A monthslong bitter conflict between Poland and Russia over apportioning blame for the outbreak of World War II and the Holocaust. Mr. Putin has sought to portray Russia as having saved the world from Nazism and Poland as a perpetrator rather than a victim, claiming the Polish ambassador to Berlin had lauded Hitler’s effort to rid Europe of Jews. Still, Mr. Duda got to have at least part of his say in an entry printed in a commemorative album of statements from world leaders invited to the World Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem. Mr. Duda argues that the Soviet Union’s 1939 pact with Germany paved the way to war. “It began on Sept. 1, 1939, with the assault of Nazi Germany on independent Poland, which was preceded by the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact,” Mr. Duda wrote in the album. “The Polish state was destroyed, my people were deprived of their freedom and sovereignty. Both these dates come as a shocking memento for us, the contemporaries.” He concluded: “We will always uphold the truth about the tragedy that struck our country and its people those days. Hail to all Holocaust victims, may their memory live forever!” In his entry, Mr. Putin paid tribute “to the courage of the heroic Soviet soldiers and officers, our allies and Resistance fighters who risked their lives to save the world from the ‘brown plague’. Unfortunately, nowadays, several states openly promote hateful ideas of racism and anti-Semitism and hold neo-Nazi rallies.” Alluding to the present-day battle over narratives, he continued, “Attempts are made to distort the truth about the Second World War and rehabilitate the aggressors and their accomplices. Monuments to the warriors-liberators are desecrated and destroyed.” The Palestinians were not invited to the Holocaust commemoration, but they were not merely watching from the sidelines. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, arranged several bilateral meetings with world leaders and prominent figures who have come to Jerusalem. Mr. Abbas met with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Ramallah, on the West Bank, last Wednesday, is expected to talk on Thursday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Bethlehem. Prince Charles is also scheduled to meet with the Palestinian leader at Mr. Abbas’s palace in Bethlehem on Friday. Still, those meetings paled next to what some critics of Mr. Abbas said was the embarrassment of so many leaders visiting Israel. Amer Hamdan, 38, a lawyer and activist in Nablus, said the spectacle amounted to “an implicit recognition that Jerusalem is the de facto capital of Israel” and “a catastrophic failure of Palestinian diplomacy.” From Gaza, Hamas issued a statement calling on world leaders to “remember that millions of Palestinians” were living in “Israeli apartheid ghettos,” just hundreds of yards from where the Holocaust-related events were taking place.

"Coronavirus Deaths Are So Far Mostly Older Men, Many With Previous Health Issues",2020-01-23,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — When the man finally went to a hospital, he had been sick for a week. It was Dec. 26, and Mr. Zeng, 61, was weak with a cough. He got worse. A day later he was transferred to intensive care, and on Dec. 30 he was put on a ventilator to try to keep him alive. He was moved to another hospital and attached to another machine that oxygenated his blood. Still, he got worse, and on Jan. 9 his heart stopped. Mr. Zeng, whom the authorities have identified only by his surname, became the first confirmed death from the new coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan and has since spread around the country and beyond. China’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, on Thursday released details about the first 17 confirmed deaths from the disease. (Several more deaths were announced early Friday, bringing the death toll to 25.)  The detailed information was released as the authorities canceled transportation within Wuhan and several nearby cities and largely blocked residents from leaving. Medical experts have questioned whether the measures in Wuhan have come too late to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has been found in infected travelers in Washington State, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan. Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who visited Wuhan this week, warned that there was a potential for the virus to spread rapidly despite the controls put in place on Thursday morning. “We have a chance to have a pandemic outbreak,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of the team that identified the coronavirus that caused the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. Dr. Guan also told Caixin, an influential Chinese magazine known for investigative reports, that he had traveled to Wuhan hoping to help track the virus’s animal source and control the epidemic. But he left, he said, feeling “powerless, very angry.” Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised the Chinese government and the World Health Organization during the SARS outbreak, said that infected people outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease. “The horse is already out of the barn,” he said. An examination of the information provided by the government about the initial deaths show a disease that has thus far largely killed older men, many of who had underlying health problems. Most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three did not have fevers when they were admitted, according to the health commission’s statement. Among the first 17 victims were 13 men and four women. All were identified only by their last names. The youngest was a 48-year-old woman, Yin, who died on Monday, more than a month after her symptoms were first recorded. The oldest cases were two 89-year-old men who died on Saturday and Sunday. The median age was 75. Many had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Most spent more than a week in hospitals, with some undergoing treatment for a month or longer. But two died just four days after they were admitted. While much about the virus remains unknown, medical experts found some positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people. It was a somewhat reassuring sign, Dr. Lipkin wrote, that “the majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases.” The Chinese health commission said more than 570 cases had been confirmed in the country by the end of Wednesday, with 95 in grave condition. The outbreak has happened as China was preparing for the Lunar New Year holiday, the biggest travel period of the year, increasing the likelihood of the coronavirus circulating further beyond Wuhan. Dr. Guan, in his interview with Caixin, was critical of the local government, saying it had not done enough earlier this week to stop the coronavirus in Wuhan. “Even though the central authorities have said in the past two days they were attaching a high degree of importance, local health protections had not been upgraded at all,” he said. “At the time I thought this was going to be a ‘state of war.’ Why hadn’t the alarm been sounded?” Dr. Guan said he was disturbed by the lack of safety measures being put in place. At the airport he saw no disinfection being carried out and only a few random places like a Starbucks had put out liquid hand sanitizer dispensers. The situation was so surprising, “my jaw dropped,” he said. He said he continually ran into obstacles when trying to find researchers to work with on tracing the source of the virus. The seafood and poultry market believed to the source had been thoroughly cleaned, he complained, preventing any effective investigation. “There’s no crime scene,” he said. The path of the coronavirus could prove harder to trace and control than SARS, when a small number of highly infectious superspreaders helped transmit the disease to a large number of people, Dr. Guan said. “I’ve experienced a lot, and I’ve never felt scared, most of these are controllable,” he said, citing previous battles with SARS, avian influenza and other outbreaks. “But this time I’m scared.” Javier Hernández contributed reporting from Beijing, and Amber Wang contributed research.']","As China released details about the first 17 people who have died in the outbreak, a well-known SARS expert raised an alarm about the virus’s spread, saying he felt “powerless.”"
Macron Fires Ambassador Who Attacked His Pension Plan,2020-01-24,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — A former presidential candidate and longtime star of the French center left was fired as her country’s ambassador to the North and South Poles on Friday after mounting repeated attacks on one of President Emmanuel Macron’s flagship policies. Ségolène Royal, who was the Socialist Party’s unsuccessful candidate in the 2007 French presidential election and later a senior official under the presidency of her former partner, François Hollande, was appointed to the diplomatic post by Mr. Macron in 2017. In recent weeks, however, she has engaged in an increasingly messy public confrontation with Mr. Macron’s administration — including over the process of her own impending dismissal — and faced the news that public prosecutors were investigating whether she had used Foreign Ministry funds for unrelated work, an accusation she denies. “The Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs proposed that Ségolène Royal no longer hold the position of Poles ambassador,” Sibeth Ndiaye, the French government’s spokeswoman, said on Friday. Ms. Royal’s response has been to announce a new centrist movement of her own, perhaps to challenge Mr. Macron in the 2022 elections. The diplomatic post Ms. Royal held was an unconventional one, which made her responsible for France’s interests in two regions where it has little to no influence, even as superpowers are increasingly jockeying for Arctic energy resources. France has no Arctic territory. Its closest point to the North Pole stands just a few kilometers from Dunkirk, in northern France. Within the Arctic Council, which comprises Arctic states such as the United States, Canada and Russia, France is limited to an observer status that leaves little room for maneuver. To many, Ms. Royal’s appointment was a scanty consolation prize for a former environment minister who once took a leading role in United Nations climate negotiations. “They did not give me much,” Ms. Royal said in a telephone interview. Ms. Royal said it had been Mr. Macron’s pension reform, which prompted hundreds of thousands of protesters to hit the streets, that had convinced her to speak her mind about the government she was expected to serve with discretion. “Macron is unable to listen to social anger,” she said. In December, she declared in a radio interview that women had “no reason to trust this government” over its pension proposals. When Mr. Macron promised to renounce his presidential pension, she asked on Twitter if, as a former investment banker, he would instead return to “the globalized business world with its enormous golden handshakes.” After weeks of criticism, the French government grew annoyed. “Ségolène Royal will have to make a choice. Either she wants to remain ambassador and obviously there is a duty of discretion, or she wants to keep her freedom of speech,” the environment minister, Élisabeth Borne, told the news channel BFM on Jan. 12. “In that case, she must no longer be an ambassador.” Two days later, Ms. Royal posted on Facebook a photo of a letter she had received from the foreign and environment ministries, warning her that the cabinet would shortly discuss terminating her position “in view of your recent public statements challenging the government’s policy.” The next day, French prosecutors announced the investigation into Ms. Royal over her use of ambassadorial funds. But these back-to-back announcements, instead of putting an end to Ms. Royal’s political career, proved an unexpected springboard to revive it — at least temporarily. Brought back under the limelight, Ms. Royal announced her own political movement which she described as a “third way,” echoing Macron’s words during the last presidential election. “I’m afraid there is no space for her at all,” said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist at Sciences Po, who noted that her program resembled that of the Socialist Party, which she left in 2017. “It’s a last-ditch attempt to bounce back, but I think her time is over.” Asked about the coincidence between her starting the movement and her dismissal, Ms. Royal said that she “had the intuition that it was time to fight back.” “It’s called political talent!”']","Ségolène Royal, the defeated Socialist candidate in France’s 2007 election, was President Emmanuel Macron’s emissary to the North and South Poles and a public critic of his pensions overhaul."
Shooting in Germany Leaves 6 Dead,2020-01-24,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — A man shot and killed his parents and four other members of his family then telephoned the police to turn himself in, the authorities said Friday, after the multiple killings at an inn that traumatized a small town in southwestern Germany.  The police said they had no motive for why the 26-year-old German citizen had turned his 9 mm handgun on his family at the inn in the town of Rat am See in Baden-Württemberg, where the shooter and at least some of victims were believed to have lived.   The victims included three women aged, 36, 56 and 62 and three men, aged 36, 65 and 69. Their names were not immediately released, in keeping with German privacy laws. “We are currently working on the assumption of a domestic dispute, since all of the victims seem to be related,” said Reiner Möller, the head of the police force in nearby Aalen, at a hastily called news conference hours after the shooting. The shooter, whose identity also was not released, had a license for the handgun used in the killings, which he had acquired for target practice, Mr. Möller said.  Shooting deaths are relatively rare in Germany, but have increased in recent years amid a climate of fear about personal security. Some of that fear has been fanned by populist forces after the arrival of more than 1 million people seeking asylum in 2015. The police dispatched around 100 local and state officers to the scene, after a call came in from a person who identified himself as the shooter at 12:48, Mr. Möller said. He remained on the phone to give more details and was quickly apprehended when the first police units arrived at the scene He remains in custody.

Glenn Greenwald in Bolsonaro’s Brazil: ‘I Trigger a Lot of Their Primal Rage’,2020-01-25,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Reading through the hacked cellphone messages of Brazilian prosecutors and judges, Glenn Greenwald knew he had a blockbuster story. Mr. Greenwald, an American journalist, figured he was well equipped to weather the blowback. After all, he played a central role in exposing the secret intelligence programs leaked by Edward Snowden, the national security contractor, five years ago. “I assumed it was going to be very similar to the Snowden story,” Mr. Greenwald said. “I’m going to know how to do this.” He greatly underestimated. The cellphone messages sent shock waves through Brazil when the news organization Mr. Greenwald co-founded, The Intercept Brasil, wrote about them last year, raising doubts about the fairness of the vast corruption investigation that upended the country and ultimately helped pave the way for the election of Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. This week, Brazilian prosecutors charged Mr. Greenwald with cybercrimes for his role in unearthing the messages, accusing him not just of publicizing the information, but of taking part in a “criminal organization” that hacked into the cellphones of several prosecutors and other public officials. The criminal case against Mr. Greenwald, 52, quickly set off alarms over press freedoms in Latin America’s largest nation during the Bolsonaro era. The combative Brazilian leader often dismisses critical coverage as “fake news,” and at his direction, government ministries last year canceled their subscriptions to the nation’s largest newspaper, Folha de São Paulo. The president recently told a newspaper reporter to “shut your mouth” and taunted another by saying he had a “terribly homosexual face.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s office declined to say whether the president or his aides were consulted about the decision to charge Mr. Greenwald. But politicians, lawyers and human rights groups call the case a worrisome development at a time when the Bolsonaro administration has raised alarm by targeting other Constitutional protections, including the land rights of indigenous people and the enforcement of environmental regulations. “Prohibiting the duty to inform is a cultural setback,” Supreme Court Justice Marco Aurelio Mello said in an interview. “I can’t conceive of a journalist being punished by the judiciary.” Prosecutors say Mr. Greenwald played a “clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime” by encouraging the hackers to delete archives to cover their tracks. They also accused him of communicating with the hackers while they were actively monitoring private chats on Telegram, a messaging app. Six other individuals were also charged, including four who were detained last year. Mr. Greenwald counters that he was meticulous in dealing with sources to avoid breaking the law. Despite the charges against him, Mr. Greenwald seems to relish finding himself at the center of a bitter political debate once more — this time in the country he moved to in 2005 after falling in love with a man he met at the beach. During his early years in Brazil, Mr. Greenwald wrote little about his adopted country, focusing more on American politics and technology issues. But in 2016, around the time Mr. Bolsonaro was starting to signal his interest in running for president, Mr. Greenwald co-founded The Intercept Brasil, an online news site created to inject an adversarial voice into the country’s media landscape. In the years that followed, the site paid singular attention to Mr. Bolsonaro, with whom Mr. Greenwald has been trading insults for years. In Sept. 2017, Mr. Greenwald called Mr. Bolsonaro, who was then a Congressman, a “cretin fascist” on Twitter. Mr. Bolsonaro replied to the journalist with a crude reference to anal sex: “Do you burn the donut?” Soon after Mr. Greenwald and his colleagues at The Intercept Brasil began publishing articles about the hacked phone messages in June, Mr. Bolsonaro made his displeasure clear by suggesting that Mr. Greenwald could wind up in jail. The articles tarnished the image of Mr. Bolsonaro’s most popular cabinet member, Justice Minister Sergio Moro. Leaked messages showed that Mr. Moro, a former federal judge, provided strategic guidance to prosecutors as they tried former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for corruption and money laundering. Under Brazilian law, judges must be impartial arbiters. That revelation called into question the legitimacy of Mr. Bolsonaro’s victory, because Mr. da Silva’s conviction disqualified him from running for president in 2018 at a time when he was leading in the polls. The Intercept Brasil has been ardently critical of Mr. Bolsonaro’s presidency from the start, which has turned the journalist into a hero for many on the left and an enemy to many on the right. Supporters of the president find the crusading tone of Mr. Greenwald’s work especially grating. That exasperation was on stark display last November when Augusto Nunes, a conservative magazine columnist, who was sparring with Mr. Greenwald on a live radio show, took a swing at the American journalist. As a video of the confrontation went viral on social media, many supporters of the president lamented that Mr. Nunes had failed to land a solid punch. Mr. Greenwald and his husband, David Miranda, a Socialist congressman, have become among the loudest opposition voices in the Bolsonaro era. “I think I trigger a lot of their primal rage,” Mr. Greenwald said, referring to Brazilians who support the president. “They view me as someone who deserves to be punished.” Soon after the first articles based on the cellphone messages were published, Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Miranda began receiving death threats, including some that mentioned their 8- and 10-year-old sons. Mr. Greenwald said he considered Mr. Bolsonaro a dire threat to democracy. “I think this movement believes in repression and governing through intimidation and fear, as opposed to persuasion and debate,” Mr. Greenwald said, referring to the president and his supporters. “One of the things you have to do, if that’s your vision, is to frighten your political opponents, credibly frighten them.” The decision to charge Mr. Greenwald has been widely criticized by legal scholars, press freedom groups and even some conservative politicians in Brazil. Rodrigo Maia, the center-right Speaker of the House issued a strong rebuke, calling the case a “threat against freedom of the press.” “Without a free press there is no democracy,” Mr. Maia added. Experts on criminal law say they believe the case against Mr. Greenwald is likely to get dismissed soon, arguing there is no credible evidence in the 95-page complaint implicating Mr. Greenwald in criminal conduct. The prosecutor who filed the case, Wellington Divino de Oliveira, startled the legal community last month by charging Felipe Santa Cruz, the head of Brazil’s bar association, with libel. That criminal complaint was based on critical remarks Mr. Santa Cruz had made about Mr. Moro, the justice minister. A federal judge dismissed the case earlier this month, calling it groundless. Under Brazil’s legal system, the charges against Mr. Greenwald must be accepted by a federal judge for him to become a criminal defendant formally. Mr. Greenwald’s lawyers on Wednesday submitted a brief to the judge that will handle that case, urging him to dismiss it. Luiz Gustavo Grandinetti Carvalho, a former prosecutor who teaches criminal law at the State University in Rio de Janeiro, said he expected the charges to be tossed out. “The case against Glenn is a case of a death foretold, meaning the death of the complaint is foretold,” he said. “Protecting sources is a Constitutional right we have in Brazil.” Mr. Greenwald said the recent turmoil has taken a toll on his mental health. He and Mr. Miranda leave home now only in armored cars, protected by armed bodyguards. The couple has struggled with how much to tell their sons, whom they adopted from an orphanage. “We’ve told them that the nature of our work means that there are a lot of people who don’t like us,” Mr. Greenwald said. “Talking to them about these dangers is difficult.” Still, Mr. Greenwald said he felt “well positioned to take on a battle like this.” “It’s very gratifying to wake up and feel like you’re doing something very purposeful for a country you love,” he said.']","The American journalist has found himself at the center of another political firestorm, this time over press freedom in Brazil."
"Gantz to Meet Trump on Peace Plan, but Alone, Not With Netanyahu",2020-01-25,By David M. Halbfinger,"['RAMAT GAN, Israel — Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military chief making a third attempt to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Saturday that he would visit President Trump on his own in Washington on Monday to discuss a White House proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Calling himself “the president’s full and committed partner,” Mr. Gantz pointedly said, in English, that he would be meeting with Mr. Trump “as the leader of the largest party in Israel,” the centrist Blue and White faction. Mr. Gantz also gave measured praise to Mr. Trump’s proposal, about which he said he had already been told a good deal by administration officials.  The surprise announcement means Mr. Gantz will avoid an awkward three-way meeting with Mr. Trump that Mr. Netanyahu had sought to orchestrate at the White House on Tuesday, five weeks before Israel’s March 2 election, the third ballot in a year. The first two ended in deadlock. Crucially, it also means Mr. Gantz will be able to fly back to Israel in time to oversee a key proceeding Tuesday regarding Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to obtain parliamentary immunity from prosecution on serious corruption charges. Lawmakers are expected to reject the request, with Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, vowing to boycott Tuesday’s debate in protest, but if Mr. Gantz were in Washington, that likely would have been delayed. In effect, Mr. Gantz, who had seemingly been cornered by the White House invitation, found an unseen exit, allowing him to avoid aiding Mr. Netanyahu without offending Israel’s closest and most powerful ally. “Following this important meeting, I will return to Israel in order to lead the debates regarding Netanyahu’s immunity from up close,” Mr. Gantz said in Hebrew, in an announcement that was carried live by Israeli television. “These are not regular days for the state of Israel,” he added. A meeting of the American president and Israeli prime minister with Mr. Gantz, who is merely a member of Parliament, could have embarrassed him in the eyes of Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu could have put him on the spot before the cameras by cajoling Mr. Gantz to join a unity government after the March 2 election. It would have meant communicating in English, in which Mr. Netanyahu is peerless among Israeli politicians and Mr. Gantz is much less comfortable. Mr. Gantz, who is tacking to the right in his campaign this time, was full of praise for Mr. Trump, calling him “a true friend of the state of Israel, the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the United States,” and saying his leadership “has made the alliance between us deeper, stronger and more powerful than ever.” While couched in laudatory terms, Mr. Gantz’s remarks about the Trump administration’s proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about which he said he had been amply briefed, was full of subtle caveats, and referred to its potential rather than to the probability or certainty of its success. He said the proposal could be “a basis for progress” toward “an agreed-to arrangement” with the Palestinians, “in tandem with continued and deeper strategic partnership with Jordan, Egypt and other countries in the region.” He said the plan would go down in history “as a significant milestone that defines the path down which the various parties to the conflict in the Middle East can walk to a regional and historic agreement.” But he did not indicate how much farther that path might lead. The Israeli news media has been full of leaks of supposed details of the plan, saying it would pave the way for annexation of significant portions of the West Bank including all but a small number of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The Palestinians insist it will be dead on arrival. Many analysts and supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict have called the promised rollout of the plan this week a distraction from Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial and an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to shift the election campaign from a referendum on him to a discussion of what he calls a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to expand Israeli territory.  Regardless, the White House invitation, delivered by Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem on Thursday, had put Mr. Gantz in a bind. Aides said it would be difficult and politically costly to turn down a presidential summons. Weighing against that, they said, was a belief that the invitation was a trap, laid by Mr. Netanyahu with the cooperation of his allies in the Trump administration. Before Mr. Gantz’s announcement, a few activists outside shouted pleas for him to spurn the president’s call to Washington. “Bibi laid a honey trap for him,” said Shai Erel, 61, a contractor. “He mustn’t fly as Netanyahu’s plus-one and be the escort of a not-yet-elected prime minister.” But a separate meeting on Monday is not risk-free for Mr. Gantz. A career military man, he only entered politics a year ago and has yet to face an English-language press corps or a stage anything like that of the White House.  And aides to Mr. Netanyahu signaled they would seek to magnify the contrast, with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reporting after Mr. Gantz’s remarks that Mr. Netanyahu now planned to hold an additional meeting of his own with Mr. Trump on Monday, denying Mr. Gantz a news cycle to himself.']","Seemingly cornered into an awkward meeting with his political rival and the U.S. president, Benny Gantz finds a way to avoid aiding Benjamin Netanyahu — without offending the White House."
3 U.S. Firefighters Die in Plane Crash as Australia’s Blazes Intensify,2020-01-23,By Damien Cave and Isabella Kwai,"['PEAK VIEW, Australia — Three firefighters from the United States were killed on Thursday when a large plane carrying fire retardant went down in the mountains south of Canberra, the Australian capital. The fiery crash, on a hill near a wildlife sanctuary, ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires, grounded other water tankers for the day, and spread sadness and grief from Australia to North America. Firefighters working in the area, where forests and farms sit side by side, described hearing a sharp and sudden clap — like the familiar sound of an exploding car, but 10 times as loud. “We’re devastated because those Americans, they’re not going home,” said Alison Myers, a deputy captain with the Numeralla fire brigade, which covers the surrounding district. “It might as well have been one of our own.” It was a tragic reminder that this unpredecented Australian fire season is far from over, and that the scale of what the country is facing has the power to draw in even Americans with years of experience who seek to contribute from above.  The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was operated by Coulson Aviation, a family-owned Canadian company that helped battle last year’s California wildfires and has worked in Australia for more than a decade, leasing firefighting planes and helicopters, with crews included. The victims were identified by the company as Ian McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Mont.; Paul Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Ariz.; and Rick DeMorgan, 43, of Navarre, Fla. All three were military veterans: Mr. McBeth served in the Wyoming and Montana Air National Guards, Mr. Hudson in the Marine Corps, and Mr. DeMorgan in the Air Force. Fire officials said the cause of the disaster was not immediately known. The crash occurred in the early afternoon, just as fire conditions hit their worst, with 90-degree heat and wind gusts racing past 60 miles an hour in a landscape thick with smoke and hills. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the police were investigating the crash, a challenge made more difficult by active fires in the area. On Thursday afternoon, helicopters could be seen hovering overhead in hazy smoke that mingled with storm clouds. On the ground, firefighters hosed down flames around blackened trees and homes left empty except for barking dogs, blocking access to the hill where the plane exploded. Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, said those on board were experienced and well known to their Australian and American colleagues. “Our hearts are with all those that are suffering in what is the loss of three remarkable, well-respected crew that have invested so many decades of their life into firefighting,” he said at a news conference. Chuck Russell, the American liaison to Australia for firefighting, said a mood of mourning had descended on the Richmond air base, northwest of Sydney, where the aircraft and pilots were based. “We’re a family,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re contract, if you’re from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, America, and what we’re doing tonight is coming together. We’re talking about things. We’re trying to fire out the whys and the whats.” “It’s a hard moment that we’re all in,” he added. Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, said the crash was a “stark and horrible” reminder of the dangers and risks of firefighting. At least five firefighters — three in New South Wales and two in the state of Victoria — had already been killed this fire season. The overall death toll from the bush fires now exceeds 30. More than 2,500 homes have been destroyed, and millions of acres have burned. American firefighters have been heavily involved since at least early December. But as the blazes have intensified, dozens more have arrived to help, extending a history of firefighting collaboration between the two countries that goes back almost two decades. In 2018, as California was in the grip of its worst fire season ever, more than 130 Australian and New Zealand wildfire experts traveled there and to the Pacific Northwest to battle blazes, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Since December, about 200 American fire personnel have been deployed to Australia, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis has been centered. Some of the visiting firefighters have been part of elite ground crews, but far more have arrived with expertise in fire management, planning and aviation. Firefighting aircraft have become a major priority in Australia. Officials started with plans for only a handful of leased tankers, but as pressure on Australia’s volunteer firefighters has intensified, the government has increased the size of its rented fleet. More than 70 firefighting aircraft were being used in New South Wales on Thursday, Ms. Berejiklian said. The companies that provide the aircraft, like Coulson Aviation, tend to be boutique family-owned businesses that send the planes to several countries, with demand growing worldwide as fire seasons lengthen and intensify because of climate change. Foster Coulson, the president of Coulson Aviation, said by telephone that he needed to let the Rural Fire Service share initial details. He later released a statement that said a team from his company would soon arrive to assist emergency services. It was unclear whether the bodies of the crew members had been recovered as of Thursday night, nor was it clear if the crash would alter how Australia fights fires, or how tankers are used. The large planes that have the greatest capacity to drop water or fire retardant engage in complicated natural warfare. Small spotter planes or helicopters usually guide them into specific locations, but with wind shifts and smoke, they often fly with little or no visibility. Conditions often prevent them from flying at all, rendering them less of a savior than the public and politicians often believe. On Thursday, by all accounts, conditions were dangerous. “It was blowing a gale, mate,” said Ken Bowerman, a volunteer firefighter in Bredbo, a small town not far from where the plane crashed. “We’re in extraordinary times.” Rain in recent days — a torrent in some areas, a few drops in others — had offered a small reprieve. But on Thursday, with temperatures soaring over 100 degrees in previously fire-stricken states like New South Wales, including a high of 110 at Sydney’s airport, fire officials once again issued emergency warnings. Earlier in the day, fires approached the suburbs of Canberra, forcing the closing of its airport to flights. Residents in the affected areas around the capital were told that driving could be deadly and that they should seek immediate shelter. In other parts of the country, which has been gripped by drought and has just ended its hottest and driest year on record, dust storms covered towns. Brown rain fell in Melbourne, discoloring the Yarra River. But the worst impacts of the day were felt in the rural mountain towns south of Canberra, where the fires in Peak View were among more than 80 that were burning, half of them out of control. From the mountains to the coast, firefighters reported homes burning, even as the police and emergency service personnel clustered near the crash site. In Numeralla, where ash-faced firefighters gathered at the local fire station late on Thursday after a 12-hour shift, appreciation mixed with sadness and fatigue. Some of the volunteers, pointing to a map on a plastic table, said they believed the plane had been trying to protect a group of houses lining a gravel road through the area. A small circle of ink showed the location — between the flames and a dry riverbed named Good Creek.']",The disaster ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires.
Coronavirus Outbreak Sours Japan on Chinese Tourist Boom,2020-01-24,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — Just as Japan and China have been taking tentative steps toward moving past old animosities, a fast-spreading virus threatens to push them apart. A deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, which has spawned fears of a pandemic across Asia, is raising concern in Japan that public sentiment could be damaged as Chinese citizens have become an increasingly visible part of daily life. The alarm over the virus is unlikely to hurt formal government relations. After years of mounting tensions over history and territory, the two largest Asian economies have been drawing closer, with Japan planning a state visit for the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, this spring. But with the start of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday ushering in one of the busiest travel seasons for Chinese tourists, some Japanese say they cannot help but regard Chinese visitors warily. It is a view shared in many Asian countries that have experienced an influx of Chinese tourists — and their money — in recent years. “I’m worried about the epidemic spreading here,” said Naho Imajima, 34, who works at a tobacco shop in the Kabukicho entertainment district in Tokyo, which is popular with Chinese visitors. “Even people who cough, most of them aren’t wearing masks. It could just be a cold, but I never know. I get nervous when a foreign tourist passes by and they’re coughing.” Chinese travelers have fueled a tourism boom in Japan, increasing fourfold in the last five years to more than 9.5 million annually, and now representing about a third of all foreign visitors. In addition, more Chinese students are enrolling in Japanese universities, and in some cases they make up a majority in graduate programs. Many shops and restaurants around Japan now cater to Chinese travelers, posting signs in Chinese and accepting payment systems from China like Alipay or WeChat Pay. But after two visitors from Wuhan, the epicenter of the new outbreak, were hospitalized in Japan for coronavirus infections over the past week, nerves have been on edge. This month, a shop owner in Hakone, a popular hot-springs resort town, posted a sign reading, “Chinese are not allowed to enter the store.” A photo of it was widely shared on social media in both Japan and China, and some began to wonder if the new coronavirus would amplify an anti-Chinese undercurrent that persists in Japan. Others applauded the shop owner’s move, saying that Chinese tourists often exhibited “bad manners,” a common theme in online complaints and news reports. Masanari Iida, a former candidate for public office in Kanagawa Prefecture, argued on Twitter that the owner was acting in “self-defense.” “I don’t understand why this is a problem,” Mr. Iida wrote. “The store has a right to choose its customers.” Fears have spiraled across Asia as China reported that the virus has caused at least 41 deaths and sickened nearly 1,300 people. The Chinese government has put a dozen cities in the central part of the country on a travel lockdown, effectively corralling 35 million residents. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Friday that Japan would increase efforts to quarantine visitors who showed symptoms of the coronavirus. The government also recommended that Japanese citizens refrain from visiting Wuhan for “unnecessary or nonurgent trips.” All Nippon Airways canceled all flights to and from Wuhan until Feb. 1. JalPak, a package tour operator owned by Japan Airlines, said that 50 customers had canceled trips to China in the past week because of news of the virus. At a cabinet meeting, Mr. Abe said he hoped that the public would not “worry excessively” and would act calmly, and he called for people to take the same precautions that they would for the common cold, including washing their hands and wearing surgical masks. With tourism from China such an important segment of the Japanese economy, some business owners said they did not want the coronavirus to affect views of customers from China. “Seeing the news, we worry about the disease a little, but I cannot say ‘please don’t come,’” said Setsuko Yoshizawa, 70, the owner of a shop in the Tokyo district of Asakusa, the site of a temple that is often mobbed with Chinese tourists. “We cannot survive without customers visiting us. I welcome Chinese visitors.” Japanese public sentiment about China has improved since the lows seen when the two countries were locked in an intense territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea, but it is still not terribly high. According to an annual survey by Japan’s central cabinet office, just over 5 percent of those polled in 2014 said they felt “an affinity with China.” Last year, the figure was about 23 percent. Komaki Lee, a Chinese-born naturalized Japanese citizen who has twice run unsuccessfully for public office, said he had often experienced discrimination because of his Chinese heritage. When he was a candidate four years ago and again last year, he said, people defaced his campaign posters with the words “Go home!” or trolled him with similar sentiments online or in person. “Now it’s the season for a lot of Chinese tourists to visit Japan, and there is this pandemic happening,” Mr. Lee said. “So I think that Japanese people will try to avoid Chinese people more, and I think that’s when discrimination might worsen.” Still, the more hostile strains of anti-Chinese expression in Japan are met with pushback. When Tsuyoshi Iida tried to run for office in Kanagawa last year, his party declined to endorse him because its leaders said he had repeatedly posted hate speech online directed at Chinese and Koreans. This month, the University of Tokyo fired an associate professor of artificial intelligence, Shohei Ohsawa, who made anti-Chinese comments on Twitter, including saying that he would never hire Chinese students at a company for which he was doing research. Japanese attitudes about China may be shaped more by criticism of the Chinese government than its people, said Atsushi Kondo, a professor of immigration policy studies at Meijo University in Nagoya. “More people question human rights and democracy over the Chinese government’s policy against the Uighurs or Hong Kong,” said Mr. Kondo, referring to the Chinese government’s detention of Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps and its repression of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. “There might be some cases where some people experience trouble over the manners of tourists and have bad feelings,” Mr. Kondo added. “But I don’t think anti-Chinese sentiment is growing in general.” Eimi Yamamitsu, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting. ']","Asia’s two largest economies have been drawing closer. But as the Lunar New Year holiday starts, some Japanese say they cannot help but regard Chinese visitors warily."
Iraq Police Crack Down on Protests as Influential Cleric Withdraws Support,2020-01-25,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — Iraqi government security forces on Saturday took back ground from protesters in Baghdad and Basra, in an apparent bid to quell the demonstrations that have lasted for nearly four months amid calls for new elections and an end to government corruption. In Baghdad, security forces moved on two of the smaller protest sites and approached the central one, Tahrir Square, before falling back, but fired tear gas and bullets, wounding at least four. Across the country, at least four were killed and 13 injured on Saturday. The government’s move to clear protesters came after the prominent Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, announced in a tweet on Friday that he was withdrawing support for the demonstrators and would no longer intervene on their behalf. He said his move was a result of what he called the antagonistic behavior of some of the protesters toward his followers. His withdrawal of support, and the resulting departure of many  of his followers from the demonstrations, deprived the protests of a critical base of participants, leaving those remaining more vulnerable to a government crackdown. There was a significant exodus of Mr. Sadr’s followers from Basra, a key city in Iraq’s majority-Shiite south. There, the police moved into the main protest square after Mr. Sadr’s followers left, setting fire to tents and leaving behind piles of ashes, burned blankets and bare metal tent frames. “We can say Basra is over,” said Juma al-Hamdani, a civil society activist who runs a nongovernmental organization there and had been protesting since the beginning of October. “I am heartbroken.” Mr. al-Hamdani blamed the loss of Mr. Sadr’s support for the retreat of protesters. “I thought he had changed his behavior but what is a pity is that he disappointed us.” In cities across the south, where protesters had a smaller presence, some of his followers removed tents.  However, the situation was fluid and in some locations just hours after Mr. Sadr’s supporters disappeared, students and workers supportive of the protesters turned up to try to fill the gap. The result was clearly visible. Even in Basra, against the odds, some of the protesters — minus Mr. Sadr’s followers — had returned by Saturday evening.  In Baghdad, the security forces had succeeded in considerably constricting the spaces where protests had been occurring — a long standing plan of the security forces and factions in the government who wanted to see the protests end. But there were still thousands of protesters on the streets in the capital, even though Mr. Sadr’s supporters had removed most of their tents which had provided shelter and medical care to protesters. Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, the Iraqi spokesman for the Joint Command in Baghdad, insisted that the removal of protesters in the capital, along with their tents and installations at a few of the popular protest gathering sites, was being done “cooperatively.” But tear gas fogged the air and protesters brandishing Molotov cocktails periodically ran through Baghdad’s streets as the security forces shot into the air to move the protesters back. At least 500 protesters have been killed and thousands have been wounded since the demonstrations began in the fall. Mr. Sadr’s followers and the students and civil society activists who are protesting represent two influential strands in Iraq — with the latter representing an outward looking, generally more urban and educated community; and the Sadrists a poorer urban tranche with roots in rural areas. The two together gave the protests staying power, and the collective protection of their numbers, but their cultural differences made them deeply wary of each other. The protesters who held their ground on Saturday expressed at once regret that the Sadrists had left and scorn that they had obeyed a cleric’s orders, but most of all they criticized Mr. Sadr for what they deemed inconsistent support. Mr. Sadr never called on his followers to join the demonstrations, but he strongly supported most of the protesters’ demands, especially the removal of corrupt politicians and the provision of more services and jobs. “He doesn’t know what he wants, he puts one leg here and another leg there,” said Ali Hussein, 22, a student at Mustansiriya University, who is from Sadr City, but not in favor of Mr. Sadr. “In Sadr City, his followers will keep following him blindly,” Mr. Hussein said. “But those who have awareness, most of whom are students, he lost them.” In the 17 years of Mr. Sadr’s participation in the Iraqi political scene, he has demonstrated repeatedly that he is influential and has the power to shake up the status quo. His followers had presented themselves as protectors of the protesters — whether nor not that was consistently the case — so their withdrawal implicitly opened the way for those antagonistic to the demonstrators, including the Iraqi government forces, to move in. Mr. Sadr is also well known in Iraq for his sizable militia, known as Soraya Salaam, or the Peace Brigades, who although they did not come to the protest squares armed, represented a veiled threat to the government and others who wanted to see the protesters removed. Some Sadrists who were traveling to Baghdad from the south of Iraq to participate in Friday’s demonstration against the American military presence in Iraq said they were insulted or even blocked by non-Sadrists as they tried to join in. The civil society protesters have tended to be less anti-American. In explaining his reason for withdrawal, his spokesman, Sheikh Saleh al-Obaidi, said it was meant to be more of an “admonishment” to the protesters from civil society and implicitly, to other secular and less anti-American protesters, to treat Mr. Sadr’s followers better. “If there is a kind of apology from the demonstrators or a request made for him to come back, maybe things can start again,” said Mr. al-Obaidi. Falih Hassan contributed from Baghdad.']","Security forces took back bridges and squares in Baghdad and Basra after the prominent Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, said he would no longer intervene on protesters’ behalf."
Fear of Virus Ruins the ‘Happiest Day’ for Millions of Chinese,2020-01-24,By Chris Buckley,"['WUHAN, China — The Lunar New Year festivities were just hours away, but instead of helping to prepare a joyous family banquet, Chen Yanming stood anxiously outside a hospital where her father was being tested for a dangerous new virus. “Today should be the Chinese people’s happiest day,” Ms. Chen, 47, said here in Wuhan, the riverside city of 11 million in central China where the outbreak began. “But this sickness has destroyed that feeling. It came suddenly and unexpectedly. We should have been better prepared.” The emergence of the mysterious coronavirus could hardly come at a worse time for China, turning its biggest holiday into a time of deepening fear, restrictions and frustration. The pneumonia-like illness linked to the virus has, by official count, stricken nearly 1,300 people in mainland China. At least 41 people have been killed, including 15 new deaths in Wuhan reported by officials on Saturday morning alone. More than 20 other cases have been confirmed elsewhere, including five in Hong Kong, two in the United States, three in France and, on Saturday, one in Australia. Hundreds of millions of people in China travel during the holiday, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. For many migrant workers from the countryside, the Lunar New Year break is the only opportunity to spend extended time with their children. For growing numbers of Chinese people, it is a time for tourism to Beijing and other cities, or to foreign destinations. But this year, desperate to contain the disease, the Chinese authorities have shut down transportation or imposed travel restrictions in 13 cities in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, hemming in 35 million people. The streets across Wuhan were eerily empty on Friday, except near hospitals. The city has been largely shut down: Departures are mostly barred, and subways, buses and ferries within Wuhan are suspended. Many residents lined up at hospitals to check for the illness or stayed indoors, rather than reuniting with family. At the entrance to the hospital where Ms. Chen waited, cars and bicycles arrived with frail older people to be checked. Residents said it had become nearly impossible to find taxis following the ban on public transportation. Doctors and medical workers struggled to cope with the surge of people worried that they had symptoms of the virus. At another hospital taking in possible cases of infection, an old man sat in a wheelchair outside the building. It was too crowded and unhealthy inside, he said. Another patient shuffled across the street, holding a drip in his arm and its stand, so he could stay away from the crowd inside the hospital. “We won’t have a New Year celebration tonight. There’s no mood for it,” said Wu Qiang, a middle-aged Wuhan resident waiting outside a hospital for word about his son, who had a fever. “I think he’s O.K., but now even an ordinary sneeze makes you worry. You start to think every cough or sneeze might be the virus.” For many families in Wuhan, the Lunar New Year holiday now promises to be a week of anxious waiting — for medical resources and clarity about when they will be free of the virus and able to travel. “The government announced there were thousands of beds, but everywhere is crammed with people,” said Xiao Hongxia, a Wuhan resident who said that her father, Xiao Shibing, was not getting full care for what might be illness from the virus. At one hospital, she said, “the doctors were crying that they were helpless to do anything.” Thirty of China’s 31 provinces and regions have confirmed cases, and two deaths have occurred far from the outbreak’s epicenter, one of them nearly 1,500 miles away. Cases have also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Nepal and Taiwan. Officials at Shanghai Disneyland, one of the biggest tourist attractions in China, and at the Badaling section of the Great Wall of China, a popular tourist destination north of Beijing, said they would temporarily close beginning Saturday. Beijing canceled public events, including two popular temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital’s most famous tourist attraction, until further notice. Many cities shuttered movie theaters, bars and cafes in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Dr. Gauden Galea, the representative of the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in an interview on Friday that thousands of people would likely be infected, and that the outbreak could be long. “My own office is gearing up for a number of months,” Dr. Galea said. “We do not expect it to disappear in a number of days.” Here in Wuhan, supermarkets seemed well stocked, but some residents said that prices had gone up or that fresh vegetables and fruit had become harder to buy because so many local markets had closed. More pressing are shortages of protective gowns, masks, gloves and other equipment to keep medical workers as safe as possible. Supplies have grown scarce in Wuhan under the weight of the epidemic, hospital employees in Wuhan said. Outside the No. 4 Hospital in Wuhan, two medical workers taking boxes of protective gowns from a truck said the gowns did not give maximum protection from the virus, but would have to do because better supplies were lacking. Some doctors and medical workers have bought their own maximum protection masks because hospitals were running short, one of them said. “Shortage of medical supplies, request help!!!” the Wuhan Children’s Hospital said Thursday in a post on Weibo, a Chinese social network. The Wuhan government on Friday ordered that a new hospital be constructed in a matter of days to treat the victims. The hospital, modeled on one constructed in Beijing for the SARS epidemic in 2003, will have room for 1,000 beds and is expected to be finished by Feb. 3, according to a local media report posted to the Wuhan government’s website. Dr. Galea, who visited Wuhan this week before the lockdown, defended how Chinese officials had handled the outbreak, saying they had been transparent in sharing data. “With the number of cases,” he said, “one would expect health systems to be stretched.” But online and in interviews, people around China have been unusually critical of their government, arguing that officials are reluctant to disclose bad news that might sully the Communist Party’s image of triumphant progress. In posts on Chinese social media platforms, some users called for Wuhan leaders to be dismissed. Others mocked the failure of the Communist Party’s flagship media to treat the epidemic with front-page urgency. Most of those posts were quickly removed. In a sign of how far the outbreak has scrambled the Communist Party’s messages, the annual Lunar New Year variety show on the main national broadcaster — which usually gives a cheerful face to the party’s themes — made nods to the crisis. The show broadcast images of doctors and nurses treating patients, of trucks of supplies festooned with banners that said, roughly translated, “Go Wuhan!” The presenters declared that the fight against the coronavirus was open, transparent and a testament to the abilities of the Chinese government. “For Wuhan people, tonight the table should be filled with dishes of fish and meat,” said Ms. Chen. “But with my father sick, we’ll have a few simple dishes.” Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong; Ray Zhong from Shanghai; and Javier C. Hernández from Beijing.

Iran Says Its Enriched Uranium Stockpile Is Far Beyond Allowed Amount,2020-01-25,By The Associated Press,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile has far exceeded the level allowed by its international nuclear deal, an aide to Iran’s nuclear chief said on Saturday. Ali Asghar Zarean said that Iran has stockpiled 1,200 kilograms, or about 2,600 pounds, which is well beyond what the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allowed. “Iran is increasing its stockpile of the enriched uranium with full speed,” he said. The claim has not been verified by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog. In November, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown to 372.3 kilograms (821 pounds) as of Nov. 3. The nuclear deal limited the stockpile to 202.8 kilograms (447 pounds). Iran has routinely vowed to begin enriching its stockpile of uranium to higher levels closer to weapons grade if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for the nuclear accord following the U.S. decision to withdraw from the agreement and restore crippling sanctions. European countries opposed the U.S. withdrawal and have repeatedly urged Iran to abide by the deal. Meanwhile, Iran is not ruling out negotiations with the United States even after an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the country’s foreign minister said in an interview released Saturday. Mohammed Javad Zarif told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that he would “never rule out the possibility that people will change their approach and recognize the realities,” in an interview conducted Friday in Tehran.']","Iran has stockpiled 1,200 kilograms, or about 2,600 pounds, which is well beyond what the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allowed, an official said."
Girl and Her Father Are Killed by Afghan Forces,2020-01-25,By Fahim Abed and Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Afghan government said on Saturday that it was investigating the fatal shootings by Afghan soldiers of a girl and her father in Kandahar Province, amid complaints by residents that the security forces have for years been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The most basic details about the girl, named Naza, were conflicting. She was either 10, 13 or 17 years of age, according to different versions by at least three officials. One official said she had been out shepherding a herd of sheep near their home in Shah Wali Kot District in Kandahar when she was shot.  Khalil Ahmad Mujahid, a member of Parliament from Kandahar, said she had been in the fields near her home collecting vegetables when the soldiers had opened fire. “The family searched for the girl the whole night, and found her body in their lands the next day,” Mr. Mujahid said. When her father carried her body to the gates of the army base in the village in southern Afghanistan the next day, he, too, ended up dead, officials said. Her relatives went to the base to protest and to seek an explanation, but soldiers inexplicably opened fire on them, and also wounded her uncle, Mr. Mujahid said. It was not clear why the girl was shot. Officials have remained tight-lipped about even the most basic details, once again raising concerns about a pattern of lack of accountability after Afghan forces have been accused of abuses against civilians during the yearslong war. A spokesman for Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said it was looking into the episode and could not provide details. Bahir Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, said a delegation led by the chief of the Afghan Army, Gen. Bismillah Waziri, had arrived in Kandahar Province on Friday to investigate the shootings. Local officials as well as rights campaigners struggled to pin down the exact details of the tragedy. It occurred in Kondelan, close to the front lines of fighting between the Taliban and the government forces. Phones rarely work there. “There is only one military base of army; no other government presence in the area,” said Fazel Mohammad Gharib Shah, the district governor of Shah Wali Kot District. With much of the attention focused on the Taliban’s atrocities, with large numbers of civilians being killed in the militants’ bombings, rights activists have repeatedly expressed concern about a simultaneous culture of impunity among Afghan forces. The most frequent accusations have been against elite units of the country’s intelligence agency that are closely mentored by the Central Intelligence Agency. Their raids have frequently resulted in civilian deaths, causing protests and outrage. But relatives of the victims say they rarely get justice. Mehrabuddin Suleymankhel, a relative of a family that lost four members, including a toddler, during a raid by the C.I.A.-backed units in eastern Khost Province in 2018, said that not only has there been no accountability for that raid, but another family member has remained in the custody of the same forces for months now without an explanation. Razo Khan, one of the brothers of the detained who has been in Kabul knocking on government doors for answers, has threatened to burn himself in protest if justice is not served. Afghanistan’s new human rights chief, Shaharzad Akbar, has called for a renewed focus on justice for the victims of abuses from all sides of the war. “The issue of justice doesn’t just relate to the Taliban,” Ms. Akbar, who was appointed as the chairwoman of Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission last July, told a local newspaper. “All sides, including the Taliban, need to be held accountable. For the Human Rights Commission, it makes no difference whether the civilians were victims of explosions and suicide bombings of the Taliban, or victims of American airstrikes and the special forces of the Afghan government. They are all victims, and their voices need to be heard.” ']","The girl was shot dead in southern Afghanistan, and when her father took her body to a military base to ask for justice, he was killed."
Europe’s Migration Crisis Has Ebbed. Croatia Wants to Keep It That Way.,2020-01-24,By Patrick Kingsley,"['GLINICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina — The hills on the Bosnian-Croatian border have not been a battleground since the end of the Bosnian war, a quarter-century ago. But to some farmers in remote parts of the Bosnian side, it sometimes still resembles a conflict zone. By night, they hear the screams. By day, they can see the Croatian police beating undocumented migrants back into Bosnia. Sometimes, they can even hear shooting. And then, a few minutes later, a knock at the door, as the migrants, nursing bruised or broken limbs, beg for food and clothes. “It reminds me of the war,” said a farmer living yards from the border, Merima Cuturic, once a refugee herself. “Especially at night, when the shouting starts.” This unlikely gantlet in the western Balkans is what remains of the great migration of 2015, when more than a million undocumented migrants landed in Europe. At the time, most crossed the sea between Turkey and Greece, and then made their way through Hungary to wealthier destinations like Germany. But Turkey, Greece and Hungary have since made it far more difficult to make such a journey, reducing undocumented migration by more than 90 percent. Those still risking the trip tend to take a new route through Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country virtually untouched by the crisis in 2015. These days its border is less tightly controlled than others, making illegal entry less challenging. Two years ago, just 750 migrants were recorded passing through Bosnia. In 2019, that figure rose to about 29,000 — most of them fleeing conflict or poverty in Afghanistan, Iraq, Morocco and Pakistan. “It’s the only route currently open if you want to get from Greece to the other parts of the European Union,” said Peter Van Der Auweraert, head of mission for the International Organization for Migration, a department of the United Nations. But that depends on one’s definition of open. To leave Bosnia, migrants must cross the icy hills and mountains that line the northern border with Croatia. Former battlefields, the slopes still contain land mines from the Balkan wars. Migrants who make it safely through the snow are usually met with a brutal response by the Croatian authorities. In Northern Europe, the 2015 crisis is over — and the Croatians are determined to keep it that way. For more than a year, the Croatian police have systematically seized migrants spotted entering the country from Bosnia and forced them back across the border without letting them apply for asylum. In interviews in Bosnia last month, dozens of migrants, residents, doctors and aid workers provided a consistent account of migrants being deported without due process — and often beaten and robbed before being dumped in remote areas, like Glinica. “When they catch you, they take everything,” said Sajid Khan, who fled Kunduz, Afghanistan, in 2015, when the Taliban captured the city. “They take your jacket, shoes, socks,” said Mr. Khan, 24. “They just leave your trousers and T-shirt.” The detritus in the woods near Glinica gives credibility to these assertions. A stream runs through the woods, under a small footbridge that connects Bosnia to Croatia. The Bosnian bank is covered with jackets, trousers, sweatshirts and shoes. Here and there are smashed phones and ripped-out SIM cards. Also sardine tins, a toothbrush and an olive jar. According to villagers and shepherds, this is one of the places where the Croatian police briefly enter Bosnia, dumping migrants rounded up along the border and stripping them of their belongings. It is also where police officers fired bullets to scare migrants in October 2018, nearly hitting Ms. Cuturic’s son, she said. “We have a significant amount of patients who’ve experienced violence,” said François Giddey, who leads local operations for Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity that treats wounded migrants. That violence includes being burned with lighters and being submerged in the icy river, Mr. Giddey said. But “the most common” thing, he added, is being beaten with sticks. “It could be all over the body,” he said, “especially legs and feet, to prevent them from walking.” A Times journalist interviewed two Afghan men with recently broken wrists. Both said the fractures were caused by beatings from the Croatian police. The Croatian police are so eager to deport undocumented migrants that they have even expelled at least three Nigerians who entered Croatia legally. Two of them were in the country to compete in a table-tennis tournament in November, while the third had a visa that was valid until next March. None had previously visited Bosnia, and all were arrested in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, far from the Bosnian border. In an emailed statement, the Croatian Interior Ministry dismissed claims of violence as “fabrications,” denied playing any role in the Nigerians’ expulsions, and said that Croatian officials had never illegally entered Bosnian territory to deport migrants. Migrants “most frequently falsely accuse police officers of violence, thinking that it might aid them in a new attempt to enter the Republic of Croatia and continue on their path toward their destination countries,” the ministry added. One reason the migrants attempt to enter Croatia is because the situation in Bosnia is often not much better than what they left behind. Until early December, hundreds of migrants were housed in a remote camp erected on the site of an old dump, halfway up a snow-capped mountain. The camp was surrounded by a minefield that was never properly cleared after the war. At night, wild boars snuffled outside the tents, searching for food scraps. Inside the tents, the floors were often soaked with rainwater. Drinking water was supplied only in the morning. With no working toilets, most migrants relieved themselves in the mud on the edge of the camp. The ground there was strewn with feces. “This place is not for the human,” Mr. Khan, the Afghan from Kunduz, said the day before the camp closed. Starving, thirsty and desperate, migrants would scour a nearby village for food and water, sometimes breaking into houses and scaring the few villagers still living there. In a historical irony, the villagers had fled their homes 25 years ago, when the mountainside was contested by Bosniak, Serb and Croat troops. Some never returned, and many of the houses stand empty to this day. Those who remain often find common cause with the migrants, giving them fruit and bread. But several residents have also grown fearful and now lock their doors for the first time in their lives. “We identify with them, and that’s why we feed them,” said Kata Majstorovic, 79. “But at the same time, there are so many!” The Balkan wars also displaced 250,000 Croatians in the 1990s, leaving many to flee to other parts of the country. In addition, Croatia gave shelter to about 750,000 people from other parts of the Balkans. These days, the limited assistance for migrants in Bosnia is partly a result of the fallout from the war. To keep the peace in a country still divided along ethnic lines, decision-making is often delegated to the regional authorities, making it harder to coordinate a national response to migration. The absence of a national government for the past year, as political parties struggled to form a governing coalition, has also contributed to the lethargy. About 7,500 migrants are currently seeking to stay in Bosnia, but hundreds are forced to sleep in squats or on the streets because not enough official camps have been built. “The frustrating part is that it’s not a matter of financial resources,” said Mr. Van Der Auweraert, of the International Organization for Migration, which runs the camps on behalf of the government. The European Union has allocated roughly $40 million to help Bosnia provide for migrants — more than enough to house a few thousand people. But the Bosnian government has been too slow to allocate sites for new camps, meaning that not all the money has been spent, Mr. Van Der Auweraert said. “If the political decision-making had been different, we would have had enough sites,” he added. But as bad as life can be in Bosnia, Mr. Khan is still glad he left Afghanistan. “Because here,” he said, “I am alive.” Namik Sepic contributed reporting.']","The Bosnian-Croatian border is one of the last gateways to northern Europe.

3 U.S. Firefighters Die in Plane Crash as Australia’s Blazes Intensify,2020-01-23,By Damien Cave and Isabella Kwai,"['PEAK VIEW, Australia — Three firefighters from the United States were killed on Thursday when a large plane carrying fire retardant went down in the mountains south of Canberra, the Australian capital. The fiery crash, on a hill near a wildlife sanctuary, ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires, grounded other water tankers for the day, and spread sadness and grief from Australia to North America. Firefighters working in the area, where forests and farms sit side by side, described hearing a sharp and sudden clap — like the familiar sound of an exploding car, but 10 times as loud. “We’re devastated because those Americans, they’re not going home,” said Alison Myers, a deputy captain with the Numeralla fire brigade, which covers the surrounding district. “It might as well have been one of our own.” It was a tragic reminder that this unpredecented Australian fire season is far from over, and that the scale of what the country is facing has the power to draw in even Americans with years of experience who seek to contribute from above.  The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was operated by Coulson Aviation, a family-owned Canadian company that helped battle last year’s California wildfires and has worked in Australia for more than a decade, leasing firefighting planes and helicopters, with crews included. The victims were identified by the company as Ian McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Mont.; Paul Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Ariz.; and Rick DeMorgan, 43, of Navarre, Fla. All three were military veterans: Mr. McBeth served in the Wyoming and Montana Air National Guards, Mr. Hudson in the Marine Corps, and Mr. DeMorgan in the Air Force. Fire officials said the cause of the disaster was not immediately known. The crash occurred in the early afternoon, just as fire conditions hit their worst, with 90-degree heat and wind gusts racing past 60 miles an hour in a landscape thick with smoke and hills. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the police were investigating the crash, a challenge made more difficult by active fires in the area. On Thursday afternoon, helicopters could be seen hovering overhead in hazy smoke that mingled with storm clouds. On the ground, firefighters hosed down flames around blackened trees and homes left empty except for barking dogs, blocking access to the hill where the plane exploded. Shane Fitzsimmons, the commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, said those on board were experienced and well known to their Australian and American colleagues. “Our hearts are with all those that are suffering in what is the loss of three remarkable, well-respected crew that have invested so many decades of their life into firefighting,” he said at a news conference. Chuck Russell, the American liaison to Australia for firefighting, said a mood of mourning had descended on the Richmond air base, northwest of Sydney, where the aircraft and pilots were based. “We’re a family,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re contract, if you’re from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, America, and what we’re doing tonight is coming together. We’re talking about things. We’re trying to fire out the whys and the whats.” “It’s a hard moment that we’re all in,” he added. Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, said the crash was a “stark and horrible” reminder of the dangers and risks of firefighting. At least five firefighters — three in New South Wales and two in the state of Victoria — had already been killed this fire season. The overall death toll from the bush fires now exceeds 30. More than 2,500 homes have been destroyed, and millions of acres have burned. American firefighters have been heavily involved since at least early December. But as the blazes have intensified, dozens more have arrived to help, extending a history of firefighting collaboration between the two countries that goes back almost two decades. In 2018, as California was in the grip of its worst fire season ever, more than 130 Australian and New Zealand wildfire experts traveled there and to the Pacific Northwest to battle blazes, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Since December, about 200 American fire personnel have been deployed to Australia, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria, where the crisis has been centered. Some of the visiting firefighters have been part of elite ground crews, but far more have arrived with expertise in fire management, planning and aviation. Firefighting aircraft have become a major priority in Australia. Officials started with plans for only a handful of leased tankers, but as pressure on Australia’s volunteer firefighters has intensified, the government has increased the size of its rented fleet. More than 70 firefighting aircraft were being used in New South Wales on Thursday, Ms. Berejiklian said. The companies that provide the aircraft, like Coulson Aviation, tend to be boutique family-owned businesses that send the planes to several countries, with demand growing worldwide as fire seasons lengthen and intensify because of climate change. Foster Coulson, the president of Coulson Aviation, said by telephone that he needed to let the Rural Fire Service share initial details. He later released a statement that said a team from his company would soon arrive to assist emergency services. It was unclear whether the bodies of the crew members had been recovered as of Thursday night, nor was it clear if the crash would alter how Australia fights fires, or how tankers are used. The large planes that have the greatest capacity to drop water or fire retardant engage in complicated natural warfare. Small spotter planes or helicopters usually guide them into specific locations, but with wind shifts and smoke, they often fly with little or no visibility. Conditions often prevent them from flying at all, rendering them less of a savior than the public and politicians often believe. On Thursday, by all accounts, conditions were dangerous. “It was blowing a gale, mate,” said Ken Bowerman, a volunteer firefighter in Bredbo, a small town not far from where the plane crashed. “We’re in extraordinary times.” Rain in recent days — a torrent in some areas, a few drops in others — had offered a small reprieve. But on Thursday, with temperatures soaring over 100 degrees in previously fire-stricken states like New South Wales, including a high of 110 at Sydney’s airport, fire officials once again issued emergency warnings. Earlier in the day, fires approached the suburbs of Canberra, forcing the closing of its airport to flights. Residents in the affected areas around the capital were told that driving could be deadly and that they should seek immediate shelter. In other parts of the country, which has been gripped by drought and has just ended its hottest and driest year on record, dust storms covered towns. Brown rain fell in Melbourne, discoloring the Yarra River. But the worst impacts of the day were felt in the rural mountain towns south of Canberra, where the fires in Peak View were among more than 80 that were burning, half of them out of control. From the mountains to the coast, firefighters reported homes burning, even as the police and emergency service personnel clustered near the crash site. In Numeralla, where ash-faced firefighters gathered at the local fire station late on Thursday after a 12-hour shift, appreciation mixed with sadness and fatigue. Some of the volunteers, pointing to a map on a plastic table, said they believed the plane had been trying to protect a group of houses lining a gravel road through the area. A small circle of ink showed the location — between the flames and a dry riverbed named Good Creek.']",The disaster ended a brief lull in the country’s summer of deadly wildfires.
Effects of Coronavirus Begin Echoing Far From Wuhan Epicenter,2020-01-25,By Chris Buckley and Tiffany May,"['WUHAN, China — The repercussions from a mysterious virus that has sickened hundreds of people began reverberating far from its epicenter in central China on Saturday, as Hong Kong closed its schools for several weeks, Beijing began restricting buses in and out of the capital, and the country’s travel association suspended Chinese tour groups heading overseas. The new measures, coming on top of previous travel restrictions that had effectively penned in tens of millions of people in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, are certain to further dampen celebrations of the Lunar New Year, which began on Saturday. They came, too, as China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, who had said little publicly about the crisis despite growing criticism of the response, pledged Saturday that officials would “stand at the front line to safeguard social stability.” The illness linked to the virus has killed at least 56 people and sickened more than 1,300 in China, according to official reports. Cases have been confirmed in all but one of China’s provinces and autonomous regions, as well as in at least 11 other countries as the virus has spread to Europe, the United States Australia and, most recently, Canada. Among the newest victims in China was a 62-year-old ear, nose and throat specialist, who died on Saturday, according to state news media. It was unclear whether the doctor, who had retired last year, had treated patients with the disease. And officials in the southern city of Hechi said on Saturday that a 2-year-old girl suffering from the coronavirus had been admitted to a hospital, becoming the youngest person known to be infected. In a sign of how the coronavirus has shaken China, Mr. Xi convened a meeting of Communist Party leaders on Saturday to try to stem the outbreak. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle to beat the epidemic,” said Mr. Xi, according to a summary of his remarks by state media, offering some of his most extensive remarks to date on the crisis. Mr. Xi called for stronger efforts to provide medicine and other supplies to affected areas. Shortages have angered doctors and medical workers, particularly in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital where the outbreak began. Hospitals have issued pleas for donated supplies. Party leaders also directed railway stations, airports and ports to step up measures to deter the spread of the virus, through ventilation, disinfection and body temperature checks.  Chinese officials announced later Saturday that more than 1,200 medical personnel would be sent to Wuhan and over 10,000 beds in 24 local hospitals would be requisitioned for treating confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. But the official response so far has drawn stinging rebukes on social media, where people are questioning whether the authorities are accurately reporting the number of cases or doing enough to rein in the outbreak. In particular, people have denounced the perceived indifference of local, provincial and even national authorities. “Where is that person? He is not on the front line,” one user wrote on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, in an apparent reference to Mr. Xi.  State media has maintained a steady drumbeat of positive news about the outbreak, praising the sacrifices of responders and everyday people. But there was little doubt  the disease had derailed celebrations of the Lunar New Year, the country’s biggest holiday and busiest travel period. Travel constraints imposed earlier in Wuhan and 12 nearby cities have effectively penned in 35 million people. Wuhan tightened its restrictions further on Saturday, with a ban on most vehicle traffic in the city center. The restrictions began spreading far beyond Wuhan, too: In Beijing, the city government said it would halt all inter-province buses beginning on Sunday, effectively limiting road travel into the capital. The association of China’s travel agencies said that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for citizens headed overseas, starting on Monday. Groups already on their trips were allowed to continue, with the directive that travelers’ health be closely monitored. The move to cut off group tours could have a ripple effect across countries that depend on Chinese tourists. While China is now home to an increasingly sophisticated population ready to hit the tourist routes by themselves, a large number of Chinese do not feel comfortable traveling abroad unless they are with a group. New measures were also imposed in Hong Kong, where its leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency. Five coronavirus patients connected to Wuhan are being treated in Hong Kong, and more than 100 others are suspected of having the viral pneumonia. Lunar New Year celebrations are being canceled in Hong Kong, schools will be closed until mid-February and the Hong Kong Marathon has been called off. The city is also suspending flights and train services to Wuhan. A study by the medical journal The Lancet, published on Friday, raised new concerns that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flu-like symptoms. Researchers studied a family in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, five of whom had traveled to Wuhan and two of whom had come in contact with an infected relative in a hospital there. Testing conducted after the family flew home found that six members had the coronavirus, including one who had not gone to Wuhan. One infected family member, a child, had no symptoms, suggesting that people with the virus might be spreading it without knowing that they have it, the study found. “It shows this new coronavirus is able to transfer between person to person, in a hospital setting, a family home setting, and also in an intercity setting,” Yuen Kwok-yung, an author of the study, said in an interview. “This is exactly what makes this new disease difficult to control.” The United States Embassy said on Saturday that all American employees at its consulate in Wuhan have been ordered to leave. The United States government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the plan. For people in the United States with close ties to China, the outbreak has brought worry, disappointment and scrutiny. Some Chinese-Americans  have had their Lunar New Year plans waylaid, as travel schedules for the coming week and beyond are interrupted. Chinese-Americans have scrambled, though, to send aid to their friends and family in China. Sean Shi, of Issaquah, Wash., said he shipped several boxes of masks to China in a friend’s luggage, hoping that they could reach friends in the Wuhan area. Later in the day, Mr. Shi was back at a hardware store, buying another 46 masks for some of his former peers at Wuhan University. “We understand it’s a tough situation over there — the panic, the shortage of equipment,” Mr. Shi said. “We just realized the situation is very serious — more serious than we thought.” Christopher Buckley reported from Wuhan, and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.

"U.S. Military Plane Crashed in Afghanistan, Officials Confirm",2020-01-27,By Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — An American military aircraft crashed in a Taliban-controlled area outside Kabul on Monday, the United States military command in Afghanistan said, following hours of confusion after officials had initially identified the plane as a passenger airliner. The plane crashed in the district of Deh Yak in Ghazni Province during a day of harsh weather, Afghan officials said. Senior officials, including the country’s vice president, initially said it was a passenger plane operated by the country’s national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines. Nearly 10 hours after the crash, the United States military, in a statement that provided little detail, confirmed that the plane was one of its aircraft and said it saw no evidence that it had been downed by enemy fire. The statement described the plane as a United States Bombardier E-11, a rare advanced communication aircraft deployed to Afghanistan and used to help ground troops talk to American aircraft overhead. “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” said Col. Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the military in Afghanistan. Colonel Leggett would not comment about how many were on board, and their status. Officials in Ghazni, based on information from local residents as well as Taliban messages, said the aircraft probably had a crew of half a dozen people. United States military experts, however, said the plane is frequently flown by a team of just two. Reports were conflicting on whether those onboard survived and were taken by the Taliban, or whether all had been killed. Taliban social media accounts posted pictures and videos of what they said was an aircraft that they had shot down, but the group is known to exaggerate its claims. The plane appeared wrecked and in flames amid snow. Officials said the harsh weather and the inaccessibility of land controlled by the Taliban had made gathering information difficult. The aircraft went down around 1 p.m. local time, and confusion about even the most basic details continued for hours. The country’s vice president, Sarwar Danish, who said it had been a passenger plane, had even expressed “condolences about their martyrdom to the people of Afghanistan.” But hours later, Alem Shah Ibrahimi, the president of Ariana, said the company’s initial information showed that “all our fleet are located.” Qasim Wafayezadathe, the head of Afghanistan’s civil aviation agency, said it had confirmed that no civilian plane had crashed. By early evening, officials in Ghazni revised their accounts. Adam Khan Sirat, a spokesman for Ghazni police, said the plane belonged to “foreign forces,” referring to the American-led military coalition in Afghanistan. About 12,000 American troops and thousands of NATO forces remain in Afghanistan, spread around the country. Officers from the headquarters in Kabul frequently shuttle to bases in aircraft, and surveillance planes are often deployed over battle areas. Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Julian Barnes contributed reporting from Washington, and Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs.']","After hours of confusion, the United States military said there was no indication that enemy fire had caused the aircraft to crash in Taliban territory."
‘What if We All Get Sick?’: Coronavirus Strains China’s Health System,2020-01-27,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['After suffering from a fever and breathing problems for more than 15 days, Xiao Shibing, a 51-year-old resident of Wuhan, China, finally sought help at a hospital. Despite the symptoms, he was not tested for the new coronavirus —\xa0a lapse suggesting that there may be far more cases of the virus than are being officially reported. Instead, Mr. Xiao was told that he had a viral chest infection, so he went back home. As he grew sicker, he went to three other hospitals. But they told him they did not have enough beds. Like many of the thousands of Chinese patients who are concerned about the new coronavirus, Mr. Xiao is scrambling to get help from a health care system straining to serve even the basic needs of patients. “It is like kicking a ball from here to there,” said his wife, Feng Xiu. Mr. Xiao, who was eventually hospitalized on Sunday — about a week after his initial attempt — still hasn’t been tested for the pneumonialike virus. As it struggles to combat a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened more than 4,500 people and killed 106, the Chinese government is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times. While other parts of everyday life in China have significantly improved in the past decade, the quality of health care has stagnated. In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, many people have to stand in line in the wee hours of the morning to secure appointments with doctors. When they do get an appointment, patients get only a couple of minutes with a doctor. During flu season, residents set up camp overnight with blankets in hospital corridors. China does not have a functioning primary care system, so most people flock to hospitals. On an ordinary day, doctors are frustrated and exhausted as they see as many as 200 patients. Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China —\xa0like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead. Despite having dealt with the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago, many Chinese hospitals in smaller cities are not fully prepared to deal with a major outbreak like the current virus. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in poorer, rural areas nearby. Last week, eight hospitals in Hubei Province — where Wuhan is situated and where most of the cases have appeared — put out a call for N95 masks, goggles, surgical masks and surgical gowns. In the absence of proper equipment, some medical workers have resorted to cutting plastic folders to jury-rig goggles. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China had invested a lot in building a robust public health infrastructure in the wake of SARS and that many of them were mostly well equipped to deal with infectious diseases. “But they apparently didn’t anticipate something so sudden, so acute and so tremendous,” he said. The government’s response to the crisis could exacerbate the problems. Across China, the authorities are sealing off cities, closing down schools and checking on residents. But the lockdown — affecting 56 million people — could make it difficult to get medical supplies to hospitals that desperately need them. Chinese officials have acknowledged that they are struggling to deal with the outbreak. At a news conference last week, the Wuhan health commission said there were long lines and a shortage of beds. In response, it said it had designated hospitals as “fever clinics” for people to go to for treatment. With medical facilities in short supply, the local government has also pledged to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days, and vowed that another new 1,300-bed hospital would be ready by the middle of next month. It is taking a page out of the government’s playbook during SARS, when it built a new hospital in Beijing in just a week. Yet it is still not clear that there will be sufficient beds to deal with the virus, which remains highly contagious. Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it was more important to have a working system of family doctors who can act as gatekeepers for the hospitals. “Without an efficient screening process,” he said, “these two hospitals would not be very effective.” The central government is under increasing pressure to show that it is adequately coping with the crisis. On Monday, Premier Li Keqiang, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, visited Wuhan to inspect efforts to contain the disease. He pledged to provide local health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles. As the government scrambles to contain the outbreak, the sick are just trying to get medical attention. Cai Pei, 41, of Wuhan, said his wife had begun coughing and developed a fever three days ago. He wrote on Weibo, a popular social media platform, that hospitals would not admit her, and that he had difficulty finding masks and cold medicine in pharmacies. Making matters worse, three Chinese medical companies have said that they do not have the capacity to make enough test kits for the new coronavirus, according to local news media reports. Mr. Cai and his wife still do not know whether she is infected with the coronavirus or another more common ailment. “Sometimes I can only hide and cry, but I couldn’t tell her and had to reassure her that it is not the virus,” Mr. Cai said by telephone. “It is very scary. If it’s real, we have a child and elderly parents at home. What if we all get sick?” With no proven drugs to treat the new virus, the health authorities have told doctors to prescribe a combination of treatments — anti-viral H.I.V. drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicine — to patients. Some of the medicines being prescribed are a mixture of ingredients like buffalo horn, jasmine and honeysuckle as well as anti-viral H.I.V. drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir. As happened with SARS, traditional Chinese medicine — an industry that the government has pledged to develop — is prominently being touted as a way to treat this new coronavirus. But there is no clinical evidence that the gallstones of cattle, the roots of plants and licorice could work in combating it. Journals have published studies by Chinese scientists saying that traditional Chinese medicine helped alleviate symptoms of SARS. China’s ministry of science and technology said in 2003 that it had found banlangen, the root of the woad plant, as well as a liquid made up of ingredients like cholic acid, jasmine, buffalo horn and honeysuckle to be effective in curing an acute inflammation of the lungs. “There has never been a good antiviral agent, so that means that people would try things that have some effect,” said Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at the University of Sydney. “But there’s no evidence of significant benefits with any antiviral drugs or traditional Chinese medicine.” The problem with finding a drug that can effectively fight an infectious disease like this coronavirus, SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is that it needs to be tested in sufficient numbers in a randomized way in proper clinical trials. Patients must also give informed consent. “That is very difficult in an outbreak situation,” said Kanta Subbarao, a senior researcher on respiratory illnesses at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. In Wuhan, Mr. Xiao’s daughter, Xiao Hongxia, said her father had been diagnosed with severe pneumonia and was now labeled a “highly suspicious case.” He is relying on ordinary fever medicines and anti-inflammatory drugs, she said. “There is no special medicine for the coronavirus so far,” Ms. Xiao said, “so we can only rely on the patient’s own immunity.” Amber Wang, Yiwei Wang and Elsie Chen contributed research.']","To fight the expanding outbreak, the country is relying on a medical system that is overburdened even in normal times."
France to Stop Using TNT-Loaded Tear Gas Grenades,2020-01-27,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — France has announced that its security forces will no longer use explosive tear gas grenades that have maimed protesters, a sign of the government’s increasing willingness to address complaints about police use of force that have mushroomed since the Yellow Vest protests. But critics said that the announcement was too little, too late, and argued that similar grenades, which the French police will continue to use, could be just as dangerous. The French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said on Sunday that the tear gas grenades — known by their technical designation, GLI-F4 — were used only “in the most serious cases,” but that they had the “flaw of containing explosives” and would be withdrawn immediately from police use. Speaking to the television broadcaster France 3, he said that grenades, which contain a TNT charge, did not have a specific color or insignia to indicate dangerousness. Fired from launchers or thrown by hand, the grenades detonate on impact or soon after, creating an explosion that is supposed to be disorienting but not wounding. But people who come into direct contact with them have been badly hurt. When police officers were “forced to use them to disengage from a threat,” Mr. Castaner said, protesters sometimes picked them up and were “seriously wounded.” “Because they are the only ones who can legitimately use force, they must do so in a proportionate, regulated way,” he said of the police. The government has come under increasing pressure in the past few weeks to address accusations of excessive force by the police after a string of events, including the death of Cédric Chouviat, a deliveryman who died this month after police officers held him on the ground during a traffic stop. Investigations were also opened this month into events during Yellow Vest protests or demonstrations against Mr. Macron’s proposed pension overhauls: One officer in Paris shot a protester at point-blank range with a rubber projectile, another punched a detained protester in the head, and an officer in the city of Toulouse intentionally tripped a demonstrator. “I expect the greatest ethics from our police officers and gendarmes,” Mr. Macron said recently, adding that he did not want to generalize or “harm the credibility and dignity” of French security forces, but that the attitude of officers in a small number of cases was “not acceptable.” But longtime critics of the grenades were unconvinced that Mr. Castaner’s announcement marked a turning point in the government’s approach to law enforcement. One group of lawyers representing protesters who have been wounded by the grenades expressed satisfaction that police violence was now “at the heart of public concerns.” But they said in a statement on Sunday that the interior minister’s announcement was a public relations move “in the context of increasing media coverage of police violence.” “It has been 14 months since we publicly warned Mr. Castaner about the dangerousness of these firearms,” the lawyers said, referring to a letter they had written to the interior minister in the fall of 2018. That was at the height of the Yellow Vest protests, when violent clashes between demonstrators and the police around the country led to a spike in the use of force by officers, who used rubber projectiles, “dispersal grenades” that spray smaller rubber pellets upon exploding, and tear gas grenades. Several protesters have lost hands to the GLI-F4 grenades, which were also used in 2014 against environmental activists in western France who had set up camp on the site of a shelved airport project. Other protesters were injured in the feet and legs by shards of the grenades. The GLI-F4s, which are roughly seven inches long and contain about an ounce of TNT, release tear gas and a strong blast of air upon loudly detonating. They are meant to be used by police officers to disperse aggressive crowds. The French authorities argue that the police need such tools to respond to increasingly violent protesters. Mr. Castaner said on Sunday, for instance, that someone whose hand was mutilated after seizing a grenade “to throw it back at security forces” was different from a bystander being injured. The Council of State, France’s highest administrative court, has rejected attempts by advocacy groups like the Human Rights League to outlaw the grenades, arguing that police forces were adequately trained to use them in specific circumstances. Critics also called Mr. Castaner’s announcement a symbolic but empty gesture, because the Interior Ministry announced several years ago that it was phasing out the GLI-F4s — which are no longer produced — and replacing them with similar tear gas grenades, known as GM2Ls. The newer grenades do not contain TNT and are designed to prevent shards from harming protesters, but they function similarly to the GLI-F4s, and critics argue it is unclear that they are much safer. “This decision is salutary but quite belated, and the replacement by the GM2L model is not without risk if there is not a radical change in law enforcement strategy,” the Human Rights League said in a statement on Monday, calling Mr. Castaner’s announcement a “fake gesture.” Another type of stun grenade was banned in 2017, three years after the death of Rémi Fraisse, an environmental activist who was killed by a grenade fired by the police during a protest over a dam construction project in southwestern France.']",The government has started to acknowledge concerns about the force that the police use against protesters. But critics say doing away with the grenades is little more than a gesture.
"U.S. Military Plane Crashed in Afghanistan, Officials Confirm",2020-01-27,By Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — An American military aircraft crashed in a Taliban-controlled area outside Kabul on Monday, the United States military command in Afghanistan said, following hours of confusion after officials had initially identified the plane as a passenger airliner. The plane crashed in the district of Deh Yak in Ghazni Province during a day of harsh weather, Afghan officials said. Senior officials, including the country’s vice president, initially said it was a passenger plane operated by the country’s national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines. Nearly 10 hours after the crash, the United States military, in a statement that provided little detail, confirmed that the plane was one of its aircraft and said it saw no evidence that it had been downed by enemy fire. The statement described the plane as a United States Bombardier E-11, a rare advanced communication aircraft deployed to Afghanistan and used to help ground troops talk to American aircraft overhead. “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” said Col. Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the military in Afghanistan. Colonel Leggett would not comment about how many were on board, and their status. Officials in Ghazni, based on information from local residents as well as Taliban messages, said the aircraft probably had a crew of half a dozen people. United States military experts, however, said the plane is frequently flown by a team of just two. Reports were conflicting on whether those onboard survived and were taken by the Taliban, or whether all had been killed. Taliban social media accounts posted pictures and videos of what they said was an aircraft that they had shot down, but the group is known to exaggerate its claims. The plane appeared wrecked and in flames amid snow. Officials said the harsh weather and the inaccessibility of land controlled by the Taliban had made gathering information difficult. The aircraft went down around 1 p.m. local time, and confusion about even the most basic details continued for hours. The country’s vice president, Sarwar Danish, who said it had been a passenger plane, had even expressed “condolences about their martyrdom to the people of Afghanistan.” But hours later, Alem Shah Ibrahimi, the president of Ariana, said the company’s initial information showed that “all our fleet are located.” Qasim Wafayezadathe, the head of Afghanistan’s civil aviation agency, said it had confirmed that no civilian plane had crashed. By early evening, officials in Ghazni revised their accounts. Adam Khan Sirat, a spokesman for Ghazni police, said the plane belonged to “foreign forces,” referring to the American-led military coalition in Afghanistan. About 12,000 American troops and thousands of NATO forces remain in Afghanistan, spread around the country. Officers from the headquarters in Kabul frequently shuttle to bases in aircraft, and surveillance planes are often deployed over battle areas. Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Julian Barnes contributed reporting from Washington, and Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs.']","After hours of confusion, the United States military said there was no indication that enemy fire had caused the aircraft to crash in Taliban territory."
Italy Election Deals Blow to Nationalist Leader Salvini,2020-01-27,By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The nationalist leader Matteo Salvini suffered a setback in his campaign to trigger the collapse of Italy’s government and set the stage for a return to power when his party’s candidate came up significantly short in a regional election on Sunday that he had framed as a bellwether of his national appeal. Mr. Salvini, the leader of the anti-migrant League party, had seized on the contest in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, which has a deep tradition of voting for communist and leftist parties. It was for him an opportunity to show his national dominance and to make the case that the wobbly coalition government of the Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement no longer represented the people and that he did. Instead, the left’s stronghold held, and Mr. Salvini was effectively repulsed. “Today Matteo Salvini has lost the election,” Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the Democratic Party, said after early results made clear the victory of his party’s candidate, the region’s incumbent. Until the very end, Mr. Zingaretti said, Mr. Salvini campaigned “to topple the government,” but the government has “come out stronger.” The usually confident Mr. Salvini sounded remarkably low key in a late-night news conference, calling himself proud of his party’s performance and insisting he would work “twice as hard” going forward. It wasn’t all bad news for him. The candidate backed by Mr. Salvini won in the southern region of Calabria despite the fact that, for decades, Mr. Salvini’s party, formerly known as the Northern League, vilified the southern regions as lazy leeches on the wealthy and hard-working north. However, since adopting a nationalist message and national strategy, Mr. Salvini has campaigned vigorously in the south. The center-right candidate Jole Santelli, whom he supported, was poised to take more than half of the vote there. But it was Emilia-Romagna that over recent weeks became the clear focus of Mr. Salvini’s, and Italy’s, attention. Mr. Salvini campaigned feverishly there, hoping a victory would effectively ratify Italy’s rightward tilt and give him more ammunition in his calls for early elections, which polls suggested he would win. This was a prospect that thrilled Europe’s populists and menaced its establishment, but which also stirred a new liberal force in Italy. Mr. Salvini’s campaign in the region gave birth to an explicitly anti-Salvini protest movement, which many discouraged liberals looked to with hope. Called the Sardines because they packed public squares with tens of thousands of people, the movement spread around the country. For weeks its leaders said that they were infusing the Democratic candidate with enthusiasm. After it became clear early Monday morning that the left-leaning incumbent, Stefano Bonaccini, had beaten his center-right opponent, Lucia Borgonzoni, a Salvini loyalist, by a margin of around five percentage points, Mr. Zingaretti attributed part of the success to the Sardines. He called them a “positive democratic shock” against the “aggressiveness of the right” and credited them with increasing turnout. The apparent center-left victory in the north brought some measure of relief to Italy’s governing majority, formed last summer with the main goal of keeping Mr. Salvini out of power. But if the Democratic Party hailed the results as a gift of breathing room, its coalition partners seemed to be running out of oxygen. Five Star collapsed in Emilia-Romagna, dropping from the nearly 28 percent it scored there during national elections in 2018, when it became the country’s leading political force, to low single digits on Sunday. The humiliating defeat raised more questions about the party’s viability only days after its leader, Luigi Di Maio, quit amid plunging poll numbers, infighting and defections to Mr. Salvini’s party. Five Star also performed terribly in Calabria, a region that once constituted part of its southern base. Mr. Salvini, deprived of a victory he called potentially “historic” on the campaign trail, was left hoping that Five Star’s thrashing and near disappearance in the regions would be enough to destabilize the government and open the door to new elections. “Tomorrow something will change in Rome,” he said. Since dramatically losing his position as Italy’s interior minister in an unsuccessful power grab last summer, Mr. Salvini has waged a war on his old allies in Five Star and his traditional enemies in the Democratic Party. He attacked on the campaign trail, on social media, in newspapers and on television programs that seemed to hang on his every word. On its own, Mr. Salvini’s League appeared to have taken more than 30 percent in Emilia-Romagna, a strong showing in a region where the League took 19.2 percent in national elections in 2018. It also won in some of the region’s municipal elections last year. Mr. Salvini said that while his candidate had not won in the northern region, the League’s improved standing was a sign that the left was losing its footing. “For the first time there was a contest,” Mr. Salvini said after the vote. “Having an open contest in Emilia-Romagna was an emotion for me, after 70 years, for the first time, there was a contest.” But Mr. Salvini’s failure to win this contest meant it was less likely that he would soon get the one he desperately wants: early national elections. And while it perhaps gave the government more time, its leaders acknowledged they must now prove it can be effective. “This government and this majority have to show that problems can be resolved,” Mr. Zingaretti said. Emma Bubola contributed reporting.']",Regional voting thwarted an effort by Matteo Salvini to set off the government’s collapse and return to power as head of the anti-migrant League party.
A Knight in Gucci Armor Helps Charge a Geothermal Dragon,2020-01-27,By Jason Horowitz,"['CASTEL GIORGIO, ITALY — Fausto Carotenuto, the owner of a spiritual wellness and yoga center in Umbria, the ancient Etruscan heartland of Italy, senses bad energy underfoot. A geothermal company wants to build a plant on a fallow field near his land. He envisions apocalyptic consequences if he and his allies fail to stop it. There would be artificially triggered earthquakes, poisoned wellsprings, barren gardens, ruined lakes. “A disaster,” he said. For nearly a decade, Mr. Carotenuto, has battled the plant with the help of the mayor of Castel Giorgio, on the rim of Lake Bolsena. But in July — after myriad lawsuits, accusations of conflicts of interest and political maneuvers — the office of Italy’s prime minister decided the experimental project could go ahead and dig deep into the volcanic land. In September, Mr. Carotenuto sprung into emergency mode, drawing together an array of illustrious allies. They include the lead designer of Gucci, a Cannes Grand Prix-winning director and luminaries of festival-circuit filmmaking and organic gardening who have adopted this part of Italy as their Holy Land. Far from the crowds of Rome and Milan, and from the Tuscany beloved by hedge fund tycoons, this area had become for them synonymous with the essence of a certain Italian ideal — a rustic, unsullied paradise. They didn’t want a geothermal plant spoiling it. So against the backdrop of a country scarred by environmental abuses, industrial eyesores, special interests and political corruption — but also a place where “dietrologia,” or the belief that a conspiracy always lurks behind the surface, is widespread — they hatched a plan. Mr. Carotenuto — who expounds on “Who’s Behind It?” web videos about the “authentically satanic elements of free masonry” and other conspiracies — convened these local knights of his round table in a room decorated with a painting of warring medieval cavaliers, Etruscan-style amphorae and a white piano. Key to have on their side was Alice Rohrwacher, the Cannes Grand Prix-winning director who grew up on a honey farm in the area, along with her sister Alba Rohrwacher, who has been recognized as one of the finest European actors of her generation. The director has deep ties to the land, and alliances with local activists. To protect the area’s biodiversity, she had waged an earlier battle against the invasion of lucrative hazelnut trees planted to feed Italy’s insatiable hunger for Nutella. (“We’re surrounded by hazelnuts,” she warned.) Now she would support their fight against a new foe. Then there was Jonathan Nossiter, a film director who has become the Errol Morris of the ecology set for his documentaries against Big Wine and for natural agriculture. “We are drawn here for a reason, culturally and environmentally,” he said. “There is something sublime here. An Italian ideal.” Mr. Nossiter (whose brother, Adam, is a correspondent for The Times in France) hustled to the emergency meeting from his nearby heirloom seed nursery and organic vegetable farm, which also was a location for his latest movie, starring, among others, Alba Rohrwacher, Charlotte Rampling and Nick Nolte. (“He’s an avid organic farmer,” Mr. Nossiter said.) To help activate the locals, Mr. Carotenuto, who said he spent 15 years in Italy’s spy services, also tapped Mr. Nossiter’s partner on the farm, Massimiliano Petrini, a local who once treated a viper’s bite with electric shocks. And then there was their Lancelot of the Lake, Alessandro Michele, the lead designer of Gucci and owner of a nearby castle. He agreed to contribute financially for an expensive environmental lawyer to sue and stall the plant’s construction, and perhaps buy surrounding land as a strategic buffer against the hazelnut hordes. Most important, the designer, who had come here to put an “embankment” between him and the world, said he would “put my face” to the issue and show there was what he called an “authentic resistance” to combat “a monster, a medieval dragon.” On a recent Sunday morning, Mr. Michele, with cascading black hair and beard, stood outside his property like a knight in Gucci armor, wearing a cardinal red sombrero, sunglasses and a luxurious plaid overcoat. Inside Mr. Michele’s living room, two languid Boston terrier dogs, the inspiration for a Gucci special collection, snored loudly as he and his boyfriend, the urban planning professor Giovanni Attili, sat next to a Christmas tree and made clear their activism was no radical chic hobby. “We have a great sensitivity to the things that cry for help,” Mr. Michele said. “This place cries for help.” Mr. Michele said he first learned about the geothermal plant while he was in France from a member of the family that had sold him his property. “Yeah, we learned about it afterwards,” he said. His first instinct was to sell. But upon reconsideration, he thought, “maybe we would have bought it anyway,” because he had become so enchanted by the ancient oak trees. “Think what these trees have seen.” He also pointed to the rugged, authentic beauty of an area that possessed a “strange energy” that attracted people like himself and the others. They all needed to defend the land as if it were a sick child, Mr. Michele said. “I’m not a geologist, I have another job,” he said shortly before pricking one of his fingers, garlanded in Renaissance rings, on an exposed nail on the back of the chair. “My job is to preserve beauty. And hasn’t beauty a value?” The opponents of the plant have tried to prove it will be an environmental menace. They also say the approval process was rigged. They have seized on the fact that Franco Barberi, a volcanologist and former government minister who is a member of a state commission that approved the project, is married to a woman who is also a volcanologist and was one of the experts who helped determine the area was seismically safe for digging. Mr. Barberi denied any wrongdoing. He said that he recused himself from the decision, that the process was legitimate, and that his wife did only preliminary examinations before the project even began. “My wife and I have a clear conscience,” he said. The company building the plant says it uses an environmentally friendly system with zero carbon emissions to produce electricity. It would help, not harm, the environment and never trigger an earthquake, it says. “The well-off want everything to remain the way it is so they can remain the ones who are well off,” Diego Righini, the company’s general manager, said in his offices near the Spanish Steps in Rome. He portrayed the resistance as “Not in my backyard” elites. He argued that the more than 10 million euros, or $11.1 million, invested to build the plant would draw workers, creating families and nursery schools. “The battle that these directors are waging is to have a future without children bothering them,” he said, adding that construction would begin in February, despite the lawsuit. He accused Mr. Carotenuto of being a “guru and hypnotist” leading an “emotional opposition” exploited by larger interests that they failed to comprehend. In Mr. Righini’s deeper dietrologia assessment, it was the Italian energy giant Enel, which had dug unsuccessfully for geothermal energy in the area decades ago, that had stuck “secret deals.” He suggested that Enel had manufactured, and potentially bought off, the opposition of local advocates and mayors to crush independent competitors like him. He warned that digging below the story’s surface could be dangerous. “Do we want to wake the dragon?” Mr. Righini asked, referring to Enel. Luigi Parisi, the head of geothermal operations for Enel’s green power company, “categorically” excluded any involvement with the opponents to geothermal energy, calling accusations of plotting against the Castel Giorgio project “groundless.” And Andrea Garbini, the town’s mayor, said the only thing he had ever received from Enel was information belying Mr. Righini’s claim of his plant having zero emissions. All this business and politics disgusted Mr. Michele. “Italy is going through a dark moment, worse than the collapse of the Roman Empire,” said Mr. Michele, who is sometimes seen getting away from Italy’s current malaise by wandering through the surrounding blackberry bushes with his friend, the actor Jared Leto, both of them dressed like pashas. Mr. Michele spoke with wonder about his new home — the deer he encountered in the wood, the “good karma” of the land, the cheese farm where a young Sicilian plays classical music for his goats. “I ask myself,” he said, “in 2020, do we really need to still destroy everything?” Anna Momigliano contributed reporting from Rome.']",A company wants to build a geothermal plant in Umbria.

Commemorating the Victims of Canada’s ‘Gay Purge’,2020-01-25,By Ian Austen,"['One of the most extraordinary things about the “gay purge” of Canada’s public servants, members of the military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is that it continued until 1992. That was a quarter-century after Pierre Elliott Trudeau, then the justice minister, declared that “there’s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation” as he introduced the legislation that repealed the nation’s laws banning homosexuality. This week the National Capital Commission, the federal agency responsible for parks, monuments and public spaces in the Ottawa area, agreed to turn over a large plot of land west of Parliament Hill for the National LGBTQ2+ Monument. It follows an apology made just over two years ago by Justin Trudeau, the current prime minister and a son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, to an estimated 9,000 people who lost their jobs and who, in some cases, were imprisoned because of their sexual orientation. Several of them are believed to have committed suicide. The memorial is being financed with money from a fund of up to 25 million Canadian dollars that the government established in 2018 as it settled class-action lawsuits brought by members of the military and the Mounties as well as other public servants who were harassed, discriminated against or fired because of their sexual orientation. The program was almost as bizarre as it was hurtful. It emerged in the 1950s out of general Cold War paranoia. The Mounties set up a special unit on the theory that gay men and lesbians might be blackmailed by the Soviet Union into turning over government secrets. Officers conducted surveillance of gay bars across Canada and used threats and intimidation to get the names of gay men and lesbians in government. The police force even worked with a psychologist in a failed, almost farcical attempt to build a homosexuality detector known as “the fruit machine.” There is no recorded case of any government employees, Mounties or military members having turned over anything to the Soviets out of fear that their sexual orientation would be exposed. I went to the future site of the memorial with Michelle Douglas. She is now the executive director of the LGBT Purge Fund, but she is perhaps better known as the woman who fought back and ended the purge. After studying law at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ms. Douglas decided to go into law enforcement. The military police service was the first organization to accept her application, and she was soon in officer training. Eventually Ms. Douglas was assigned to the special investigations unit of the military police and based in Toronto. Its duties included running the gay purge for the armed forces. One day her boss bundled her into an unmarked police car and took her to a motel near Toronto Pearson International Airport. For two days she was interrogated and given polygraph tests. “Many of the military police that interrogated me were just cruel. Some expressed a bizarre, prurient interest in the sex lives of homosexuals as well,” she told me on Friday. “The people I encountered were absolutely zealous about it. They seemed to not only embrace the policy, but they wanted to demonize, mock and humiliate anyone who they suspected of being homosexual.” In 1989 she was fired for “being not advantageously employable due to homosexuality” and swiftly filed a lawsuit. Her court victory three years later brought the purge to a close. Many steps remain before the international design competition for the monument begins as well as the public consultations that will follow any proposal. But Ms. Douglas said that the 8 million Canadian dollar project will be completed in 2024. Whatever its form, Ms. Douglas’s vision is that the monument will be as much a place for gatherings — whether celebratory or in protest — as a commemoration site. Despite her treatment by the military, Ms. Douglas went on to have a successful 30-year career in the public service and recently retired as the director of international relations at the Department of Justice. But she said that the purge ruined many people’s lives and that men were disproportionately among the victims. “There’s far fewer men than we had hoped to see as part of this class action,” she said. “Many committed suicide. Some were lost to H.I.V. or AIDS, and some just went back into the closet in shame. And so it’s a disproportionate number of women who are survivors today of the purge.” My colleague Dan Bilefsky has left his home in Montreal for Vancouver and the extradition hearing for Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer. He slipped this interesting coincidence into his informative overview of the case and its implications for Canada: “Given that Ms. Meng is wanted by the United States on fraud charges, the irony has not gone unnoticed among local residents in her neighborhood that her 8,047-square-foot house is just a few doors down from the residence of the United States consul general, where an American flag flaps in the wind.” Along with Tracy Sherlock, Dan has also created a guide to the somewhat complex affair.

France Judges Dead Jihadists but Refuses to Repatriate the Living,2020-01-26,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — The trial this month was exceptional for a country that has resisted repatriating or extraditing terrorism suspects from battlegrounds in Iraq and Syria. A Paris judge heard cases against 24 men and women charged with links to the Islamic State. Witnesses were called. Prosecutors and defense lawyers made their statements. Verdicts were rendered. But 19 of the defendants were presumed dead, and all were tried in absentia. It was, as the French news media have called it, a “ghost trial.” Antoine Ory, one of the defense lawyers, acknowledged as much. “In France, in 2020, we refuse to repatriate the living but we try the dead,” he told the court. The trial, which concluded last week with convictions for everyone, brought to light one of France’s paradoxes when it comes to handling such cases. The government wants to prosecute terrorism suspects, hoping to prevent them from falling through legal cracks and trying to piece together how the networks operated for evidence in future trials against the living. But it does not want the trials conducted on its territory. Since 2018, France has instead been at the forefront of the European negotiations with the Iraqi government to have European jihadists tried there, with only modest success. With public opinion firmly against bringing home those who left to fight with the Islamic State, France has agreed to take back only some of its jihadists. The country was a significant provider of foreign Islamic State fighters, with around 1,000 people estimated to have left to join the militant group from 2012 to 2015. Jean-Charles Brisard, director of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, a Paris-based research organization, said about 80 French Islamic State fighters were still detained in Iraq and Syria. “The French position is a political position, based on the refusal of the public opinion to see repatriation happening,” Mr. Brisard said. “But as far as our justice system is concerned, everything is ready to take them back, including the prisons.” And the courts. For the last two years, French courts have been trying dozens of jihadists who are presumed dead. The courts have had little choice because intelligence services have not been able to get into the combat zones of Syria and Iraq to verify the deaths. This month’s trial offered a glimpse into what has become a convoluted approach to counterterrorism, even as France braces itself for the much-awaited trials of those accused of the assault on the newspaper Charlie Hebdo, and of the suspects in the November 2015 attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris. France has invested a great deal in adapting its criminal justice system to the jihadist threat and now has some of the most expansive counterterrorism legislation in Europe. “It is a judiciary that leaves room for interpretation,” said Antoine Mégie, an expert on counterterrorism laws at the University of Rouen, in northern France. “In order to be prosecuted, it is enough to be linked to jihadist activities.” But this month’s trial showed that the process could also prove Kafkaesque. The defendant Mr. Ory represented — Quentin Roy, a man from the Paris suburbs who left to fight with the Islamic State in Syria in 2014 — was a case in point. The court files noted that Mr. Roy presumably blew himself up in Iraq in January 2016, saying he was linked to “military activities that led him to become a suicide bomber.” “You are trying a man who committed suicide,” Mr. Ory told the court. “Has anyone ever seen such a contradiction?” Mr. Roy was part of the so-called Sevran network, a jihadist recruitment web based in the small town of Sevran, on the outskirts of Paris, that operated from an informal prayer hall, later known as the “Daesh Mosque,” using an alternative name for the Islamic State. Among the 24 defendants at the trial, 13 had frequented the mosque. Standing before the judges, Mr. Roy’s parents, Véronique and Thierry, recounted how their son had converted to jihadist ideology in just a few months. “It’s the trial of sectarian radicalization,” Ms. Roy said, as she described how her son, after his conversion to Islam in 2012, gave up his studies and his job and broke up with his girlfriend. In September 2014, Mr. Roy told his parents he had to go to Frankfurt for his work as an Uber driver. A few days later, he was crossing the border from Turkey to Syria. As they did with the Roy family, judges at the trial turned to relatives to reconstruct the journey of the 19 defendants who are presumed dead. Among those defendants were the brothers Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine, who have been linked to the kosher supermarket attack by Amedy Coulibaly in January 2015. Mohamed Belhoucine is considered to be the mentor of Mr. Coulibaly. Mehdi Belhoucine was accused of arranging the departure of Mr. Coulibaly’s wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, for Syria. The Belhoucine brothers left France for Syria at the start of January 2015. The Belhoucine brothers are believed to have died on the battlegrounds in Syria and Iraq in 2016. Their parents have received messages from Islamic State fighters notifying them of their sons’ deaths. But the truth of those reports, in territories beyond the reach of French investigators, cannot be verified. Intelligence services also fear that acknowledging the death of jihadists could help some who are still alive cover their tracks. In August 2015, a leading French jihadist recruiter, Omar Omsen, faked his own death before resurfacing 10 months later in a TV interview. “As long as we don’t have exact proof of their deaths, we have to try them,” Stéphane Duchemin, the president of the court, told the mother of the Belhoucine brothers. Even as the so-called ghost trials continue, the French government may be forced to moderate its stance and allow for the repatriation of former fighters. In part, that is because of the breakdown of the negotiations to continue conducting trials in Iraq, but also because of the worsening security situation in Syria, where hundreds of European Islamic State fighters are detained. “If it is not possible to try them on site anymore, I don’t see any other solution than to repatriate those people to France,” the French justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, told the newspaper Libération on Jan. 10. “We cannot risk that they escape into the wild.” Still, this week, Ms. Belloubet acknowledged in an interview on French radio that “there is no change in our opinion,” about bringing suspects home for trial. That is not good enough for some, like Mr. Roy’s parents, who belong to an organization that campaigns for the repatriation. “Now is time to stop talking and start taking action,” Thierry Roy said. At the end of this month’s trial, Mohamed Belhoucine was sentenced to life imprisonment. Sentences for other defendants ranged from two to 30 years. Mr. Roy’s son, who was sentenced to 30 years, will probably never serve that time. But his mother said the trial at least had the merit of putting an end to years of anxiety. “Now we need peace,” Ms. Roy said. “Because we’ve awakened the dead.”']","With public opinion firmly against allowing the return of those who left to fight in Syria and Iraq, the French justice system finds itself facing the strange concept of the “ghost trial.”"
India Restores Some Internet Access in Kashmir After Long Shutdown,2020-01-26,By Kai Schultz and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — Months after imposing a sweeping communications blackout in Kashmir, the Indian government on Saturday unblocked several hundred websites in the disputed Himalayan region, bringing a tentative end to the world’s longest internet shutdown in a democracy. The announcement comes nearly half a year after India’s government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status. Bracing for subsequent unrest, the authorities suspended landline and cellular connections, cut internet services and dispatched tens of thousands of troops to the area. Since then, the Kashmir Valley, home to as many as eight million people, has endured a punishing information blackout. Foreign journalists and diplomats were blocked from visiting the predominantly Muslim territory, which is contested between India and Pakistan. The government arrested scores of Kashmiris, including former heads of state, without disclosing charges. Ordinary Kashmiris struggled to procure medicines and contact loved ones. The lifting of restrictions on Saturday applied only to 301 “whitelisted” websites. Among them were entertainment platforms like Netflix and Amazon and some international news outlets, including The New York Times. Many Indian publications remained blocked, along with all social media. Mobile data access was also restored, though it was limited to 2G connections. “It is very slow — and a good joke,” said Sajeel Majid, 35, a restaurant owner in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir. “India wants to deceive the world by saying we have restored internet, but we can’t even access email with 2G speed.” Though some Kashmiris said the partial restoration of internet services could bring some semblance of normalcy to the region, they pointed out that shops remained largely shut and troops were still posted everywhere. Over the last week, around half a dozen Kashmiri militants were killed in gun battles with Indian forces, who have been accused of torturing civilians and using excessive force against protesters. In a statement, the government of Jammu and Kashmir said continued internet restrictions were necessary to prevent the “propagation of terror activities” and the “circulation of inflammatory material.” Officials said they would approve more websites in the coming days. India has increasingly come under scrutiny, both domestically and abroad, for cutting off the internet, a tactic more commonly associated with dictatorships than democracies. The country tops the world in the number of internet shutdowns, with 134 last year, according to SFLC.in, a legal advocacy group in New Delhi that tracks such restrictions. This month, the Supreme Court ruled that internet access was integral to an individual’s right to freedom of speech and expression. Judges said the government’s methods in Kashmir were an “arbitrary exercise of power,” though they stopped short of declaring them illegal. Hours after the government lifted some restrictions, Kashmiris said web pages — including approved ones — were again blocked for Republic Day festivities on Sunday, which commemorate the day when India’s Constitution went into effect. “It is just a game to tell people we have restored internet services, but on the ground it doesn’t work and is of no use,” said Adnan Bhat, 19, a student in Srinagar.']","The announcement applied only to 301 websites, and many Kashmiris said they were still in an information black hole."
"Before the Liberation of Auschwitz, a March of Misery",2020-01-27,By Marc Santora and Maciek Nabrdalik,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Along a desolate stretch of road in southeastern Poland, a dozen miles from Auschwitz, there is a graveyard. Candles and fresh flowers cover nearly all the marble tombs. But in the corner stands a large black marble slab separated from the rest. “Forty-two victims, women, men and children, prisoners from the Auschwitz concentration camp, who were murdered by the Nazis during the death march, and died on Jan. 18, 1945, in the village area of Miedzna were buried in a mass grave in this cemetery,” an inscription explains. But there are only four names. Another 21 people are identified by their inmate numbers. And 17 have never been identified. Seventy-five years ago on Jan. 27, Soviet forces swept across Poland from the east and liberated Auschwitz, the camp complex where 1.3 million were enslaved — and 1.1 million among them systematically murdered — during the war. But before they could arrive, the Nazis force marched some 56,000 weakened prisoners out of the camp ahead of their advance, in the dead of winter, with an estimated 15,000 shot or dying of cold, hunger and illness along the way. Similar marches were taking place all across the eastern front after the SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered that all able-bodied prisoners be taken to the Reich. Despite years of study and troves of testimony from witnesses, the chaos of that evacuation is one of the least understood periods of the Holocaust. Himmler’s orders served several purposes, according to research by the United States Holocaust Museum. First, he wanted to eliminate evidence of German crimes and witnesses who could testify to those crimes. He also hoped to use inmates as slave labor to keep the German war going. And rather irrationally, he believed that the prisoners could be used as bargaining chips in any peace negotiations. While death might not have been the goal of the marches, that was indeed the fate of many, as the scattered gravestones that remain along these roads today attest. Zofia Posmysz still remembers her inmate number: 7566. Sitting in her neatly kept apartment in Warsaw, the 96-year-old survivor remembered the biting cold on the night the guards gathered thousands of women outside the gates of Birkenau, a death camp that was part of the Auschwitz complex. “We didn’t know what it meant that we would leave the camp,” she said. “We didn’t know if we would have to undergo some sort of selection. “We heard that those who could not walk would get to stay in the hospital, but we weren’t sure if they would be kept alive. We knew nothing and worried.” But how could it be worse than the hell she had endured for three years? One memory came rushing back to her. “One night, I woke up and heard someone singing outside. It was a man’s voice. I thought to myself that our guard wouldn’t probably notice if I sneaked out to have a look. I went outside and saw a man dressed in a black coat. He was singing and raising his arms in the air. Suddenly I felt someone grabbing my arm. It was a Jewish friend from the ward. She asked me: ‘Do you know what he’s singing?’” “‘No,’ I replied. But it was hauntingly beautiful.” “It’s a Hebrew song, a prayer for a good death,” her friend told her. “When we woke up in the morning, there was no more singing; the square was completely empty. All we saw was the smoke coming from the crematory chimney.” Ms. Posmysz was among those made to march. In her memory, after the first bitterly cold night, the days blend together, something Holocaust scholars say is common among those who survived. Her next memory is arriving at the station in Wodzislaw Slaski for a train that would take her to another camp in Germany. She would be moved one more time before the end of the war. Once free, she walked for weeks until she finally made it back to her home in Krakow. Until recently, it would have been possible to find people who lived in the towns and villages along the route who could recall seeing the columns of starving and abused prisoners flanked by Nazi soldiers walking past their homes. Their numbers, like the survivors, grow fewer every year. Maria Kopiasz, 93, still lives in the same house in the town of Brzeszcze that she did during the war, and the grim scene of the march has stayed with her. “They marched in the middle of this road,” she said. “SS men on both sides. Every third of them or so with a German shepherd. I remember mainly women. We knew we couldn’t even show any sympathy as we would be taken with them. I could only watch quietly through the window.” Jan Stolarz, a retired miner, has led a small group of people on a trek to retrace the path of one of the marches for nine years. “I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau with my wife 10 years ago,” he explained. “I saw a handwritten note left by someone in one of the barracks. It read: We live as long as the memory of us is alive. This message resonated with me strongly.” He hopes that in some small way, his walk will help do that. For Poles who were not Jewish, their fate during the war could turn on the smallest things. The Germans who occupied the country had given all the Poles in Silesia a ranking based on ethnic purity, with different categories often determining whether your family lived or died. Eryk Langer, 91, from a town called Studzionka, said that because his father was a friend of the local German mayor they felt protected and got the second highest category. His home was along the death march route and German officers moved in during the evacuation. He said his father asked the officers if they could give the prisoners some spare food, and it was allowed. But all they had was some buckets of water for very few people. “They walked all day long. They were hungry,” he said trailing off. It’s an image he does not want to think about. “In the morning we saw one prisoner shot in front of our gate,” he said. Later, he saw a horse-drawn cart going through the village collecting the dead. At least 18 bodies were collected, and they are buried in the village cemetery. Bernard Halat, 91, also from Studzionka, said that in 1940, he and his family had to report to have their facial features measured to determined if they were Jewish. They were not, but assigned to Category IV, for people who resisted Germanization, they were still deemed undesirable and put on a list of people to be interned at a later date. They managed to avoid the camps but Mr. Halat recalls watching the death marchers pass by his home and thinking how easily his family could have been among them. “So many people. They walked all day long,” he said. “We were afraid.” But he also recalled how two Jewish women escaped and hid in the village. A few years after the war ended, they returned to thank a farmer who had helped them. It was a rare hopeful story on a road full of despair. For the millions who died during the Holocaust, including the thousands who did not die in the camps but along lonely stretches of frozen roads and snow-covered fields, their stories were buried with them long ago.']",
"75 Years After Auschwitz Liberation, Worry That ‘Never Again’ Is Not Assured",2020-01-25,By Marc Santora,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Even before the gas chambers were destroyed and the savage toll of years of industrialized mass murder revealed to the world, prisoners at the largest Nazi concentration camp were already repeating two words: Never again. But as the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz approaches, an occasion being marked by events around the world and culminating in a solemn ceremony at the former death camp on Monday that will include dozens of aging Holocaust survivors, Piotr Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, is worried. “More and more we seem to be having trouble connecting our historical knowledge with our moral choices today,” he said. “I can imagine a society that understands history very well but does not draw any conclusion from this knowledge.” In this current political moment, he added, that can be dangerous. All one has to do is look at the backdrop against which this anniversary is taking place. Across Europe and in the United States, there is concern about a resurgence of anti-Semitism. Toxic political rhetoric and attacks directed at groups of peoples — using language to dehumanize them — that were once considered taboo have become common across the world’s democracies. And as the living memory of World War II and the Holocaust fades, the institutions created to guard against a repeat of such bloody conflicts, and such barbarism, are under increasing strain. With the very notion of the truth and facts under assault in increasingly polarized societies, control over the historical narrative is yet another battlefield. Even the memory of Auschwitz — where 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, were murdered — has been weaponized. As world leaders converged on Israel this past week for a ceremony at Yad Vashem, the hillside Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the event was clouded by a bitter dispute between Poland and Russia. After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was offered a speaking role, the president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, pulled out when he was not granted the same privilege. “Unfortunately, I am sorry to say this, but President Putin consciously, certainly, spreads historical lies and obviously does it with an agenda because he is trying in this way to erase the responsibility of Stalinist Russia for the start of World War II together with Nazi Germany,” Mr. Duda told Israeli state television. “I imagine he is ashamed of it today.” But far from expressing shame, Mr. Putin and his government have been increasingly aggressive in their efforts to whitewash the historical record concerning the Soviet-German nonaggression pact of 1939 and the subsequent invasion and subjugation of Poland. “It was them who, while pursuing their mercenary and exorbitantly overgrown ambitions, laid their people, the Polish people, open to attack from Germany’s military machine and, moreover, generally contributed to the beginning of the Second World War,” Mr. Putin has asserted. While Poland is a deeply divided country when it comes to politics and culture, the outrage over Mr. Putin’s remarks is nearly universal in the country, as is the support for Mr. Duda’s decision to boycott the event at Yad Vashem. “It’s surreal that a global event dedicated to the memory of the Holocaust victims becomes a political affair, a cover for history trading,” said Shevah Weiss, an Israeli political scientist and former president of Yad Vashem. Born in Poland in 1935, he is a Holocaust survivor and served as an Israeli ambassador to Poland. “The Polish president was right to refuse to attend it,” he added. But the current Polish government’s stance is complicated by its own efforts to shape history to promote its own brand of aggrieved nationalism. After the government passed a law that would have made it a crime to accuse Poland of complicity in the Holocaust, which critics said could stifle free speech, the international backlash was swift. Poland ended up backing down but not before undermining years of hard work to build better relations with Israel. It also brought a strong rebuke from American lawmakers, usually steadfast allies. Pawel Spiewak, the director of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, said it was all very sad. So many people were “touched by hell” during the war, he said, but instead of finding common ground, political leaders stoke division and risk repeating the mistakes of the past. “The language and system of values of the new Europe that emerged after the Second World War are being forgotten,” he said. “People don’t want to listen to it. I would say they are even tired of it.” That makes for a public more susceptible to false and distorted narratives. Which is why Auschwitz itself remains so important. Unlike many of the concentration camps, where a total of six million Jews were killed over the course of the war, Auschwitz largely escaped destruction. Last year, more than two million visitors crossed under the same wrought iron gateway as tens of thousands of prisoners once did, looking up at the cruelly ironic words “Arbeit Macht Frei,” or work sets you free. For most during the war, freedom would never come. While the two main gas chambers were blown up by the Nazis before they fled, the ruins still testify to their existence. Visitors can see the ovens used to incinerate the remains of those slaughtered. The train tracks leading into Birkenau, where cattle cars would arrive crammed with Jews who were swiftly herded into the gas chambers, are no longer used but remain a ghastly reminder of the scale, reach and industrialization of the murder apparatus. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire and philanthropist, has made it his mission to help preserve the site, helping to raise $110 million to that end. He said that while historians can speak to events, there was simply no substitute for hearing the stories of real people in a real place made of real brick and mortar. And this anniversary was special, he said, simply because with the passage of time, there are fewer witnesses left to tell their story. “Almost half the survivors have died in the last five years,” he said in an interview. “This will be the last time we get people together.” Zofia Posmysz, a 96-year-old Polish survivor of Auschwitz, will not be able to attend the ceremony but said that she had followed the recent political dispute. Listening to Mr. Putin’s attacks on Poland, she said, “takes me back immediately and keeps me awake at night.” “I fear that over time, it will become easier to distort history,” she said in her apartment in Warsaw. “I cannot say it will never happen again, because when you look at some leaders of today, those dangerous ambitions, pride and sense of being better than others are still at play. Who knows where they can lead.” Joanna Berendt contributed reporting from Warsaw, and Andrew Higgins from Moscow.']",

"In Coronavirus, a ‘Battle’ That Could Humble China’s Strongman",2020-01-26,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — It took thousands of infections and scores of deaths from a mysterious virus for China’s authoritarian leader to publicly say what had become glaringly obvious to many in recent weeks: The country is facing a grave public health crisis. After his declaration, the leader, Xi Jinping, put China on a virtual war footing to cope with the unfolding epidemic of the coronavirus. He convened an extraordinary session of the Communist Party’s top political body, issuing orders for handling the crisis with the crisp, somber stoicism of a field marshal. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle,” he proclaimed on Saturday before his six grim-faced colleagues on the party’s Politburo Standing Committee. Compared to the very low bar set by the Chinese leadership’s secrecy and inaction during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, Mr. Xi has responded with speed and alacrity to the latest health emergency, a pneumonialike virus that at last official count has killed at least 80, sickened thousands in China and spread around the world. But there are also signs that the government, especially at the regional level in Hubei Province, the source of the outbreak, was slow to recognize the danger and is continuing to mishandle the crisis. Some public health experts have asked whether the sweeping travel restrictions that have been imposed are leaving people without access to medical care, while many Chinese remain unconvinced the government is being completely forthcoming about the toll of the disease. “Substantively, the response this time is more or less the same,” said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “Local officials downplayed the outbreak at the initial, but crucial, stage of the outbreak. The media was muzzled. The public was kept in the dark. As a result, valuable time was lost.” The turnaround from complacency to nationwide mobilization typifies how China can respond to unexpected crisis like a lumbering giant, reluctant to stir, but then capable of shattering urgency. It represents both sides of the authoritarian political bargain under Mr. Xi. A fear of upsetting the party’s protocols and leaders’ desire for unruffled stability can deter even officials who want to do well by the public. Conversely, the government can operate with brutal efficiency when it wants. It was only after a brief written statement under Mr. Xi’s name on Jan. 20, when he was touring a military base and shopping exposition in Yunnan Province, that the vast Chinese state bureaucracy began to shudder into action. Officials then quickly acknowledged the dangers of the coronavirus and ordered drastic measures to stop the spread — perhaps, experts said, belatedly — including the lockdown of much of the province where the epidemic emerged, penning in 56 million people. The government also ordered the construction of two hospitals in Wuhan to deal exclusively with patients afflicted with the coronavirus, which are expected to open within days, not months or years. “The thing about China is that they can mobilize agencies and resources faster than anybody else can,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of “Xi Jinping: The Backlash.” “The other side is that they can conceal things.” “In China there is no independent entity that can get on the front foot and disseminate information,” he added. From a localized medical mystery a few weeks ago, the coronavirus has erupted as one of the most complex and unpredictable tests for Mr. Xi since he came to power more than seven years ago. Over that time, he has by some measures established himself as the most formidable Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. The epidemic and the effectiveness of the government’s response remain subject to many unknowns, but the outbreak comes at a time when Mr. Xi has already been facing quiet whispers about his political acumen. In the past year, he has experienced repeated setbacks on some of the most vital issues on his agenda. Protests against China’s tightening grip continue to convulse Hong Kong. Rancor with Washington was only partly eased by a trade deal that some said required China to promise too many concessions. Two weeks ago, voters in Taiwan, the island democracy that Mr. Xi has made clear should join a greater China, resoundingly re-elected a president despised by Beijing. Mr. Xi’s sheer dominance, according to several experts and political insiders, may be contributing to his problems by hampering internal debate that could help avoid misjudgments. Beijing, for example, has underestimated the staying power of the protesters in Hong Kong and the public support behind them. “It’s a paradox,” said Rong Jian, an independent scholar of Chinese politics in Beijing. “It’s precisely because Xi is so powerful that policy problems often arise — nobody dares disagree, and problems are spotted too late.” While state and local officials have been criticized, the public health system has been credited with responding effectively, particularly compared to the response to the SARS crisis. In that case, officials covered up the extent of the viral outbreak for months, almost certainly abetting its spread and exacerbating the death toll, which reached nearly 800. This time, even as officials in Wuhan said nothing publicly, government scientists shared information with the World Health Organization on the last day of 2019, isolated the virus, and posted details about it on an international database 10 days later. That allowed experts from around the world to quickly conclude that the new coronavirus, like the one from SARS, had very likely originated in bats and made the leap to humans through infection of another mammal in a market in Wuhan. The Lancet, one of the leading medical journals, praised China’s handling of the outbreak so far in an editorial. “The lessons from the SARS epidemic — where China was insufficiently prepared to implement infection control practices — have been successfully learned,” it wrote. “By most accounts, Chinese authorities are meeting international standards and isolating suspected cases and contacts, developing diagnostic and treatment procedures, and implementing public education campaigns.” The journal went on to emphasize that the ultimate success of the response would “depend on maintaining trust between the authorities and the local population.” Mr. Xi’s government, despite its call to arms, may have already undercut that trust. On the local level in Wuhan, people have vented anger and frustration, which is percolating on social media despite censorship. In widely circulated, and then censored, comments, a senior journalist with The Hubei Daily, the province’s main party newspaper, called for a change of leadership in Wuhan. “With this extraordinarily grim situation worsening and expanding by the day, those currently in office lack that commanding leadership,” the journalist, Zhang Ouya, wrote on Sina.com Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service. There is evidence, too, that the local authorities kept a lid on the crisis in the first days of January so as not to upset the cheerful tone for a provincial legislative session that is a highlight of the local political cycle. “This year will be a major landmark year,” Wang Xiaodong, the provincial governor, told the legislative members. “Let us unite even more closely around the party central leadership with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core.” Mr. Wang is now widely accused of underplaying the virus threat. “China is a much more decentralized place than it appears,” said David Cowhig, a former American diplomat who served 10 years in China and monitored health and science issues. “Local officials have great discretion; China is a coalition of ‘little’ Big Brothers,” he said. “Xi realizes this and is trying to re-centralize China.” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China, said that the centralization of power since the SARS crisis did not appear to have strengthened expertise at the local level or the willingness of underequipped regional hospitals to report. “I think the central health authorities are trying to be more transparent,” he said, “but the local government remains loath to share disease related information in a timely and accurate manner.” Not all the blame can fall on the officials in Wuhan. The central authorities still control the political and propaganda apparatus, which has sought to minimize the severity of the crisis. Before the standing committee’s meeting on Saturday, Mr. Xi and other senior officials went about their business as if there were no crisis, appearing at a banquet on Thursday in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the Lunar New Year. When he did speak, Mr. Xi emphasized the need for preserving public stability. The phrase alludes to the fear of popular unrest boiling over, which is, as ever, the party state’s highest priority. It could become a reality if the epidemic, as predicted, inflicts sustained hardship on the economy and people’s livelihood. “The truth is in a public-health emergency, it’s not just the medical professionals who matter,” Mr. McGregor said. “It’s the management of it in the government and in the public that matters, too. It’s hard to argue that they’ve done that well.” Steven Lee Myers reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Wuhan, China. Claire Fu contributed research.']","With Xi Jinping firmly in control, the Chinese government has stepped up its response to the Wuhan crisis, but the effort has been plagued by bureaucracy and a lack of transparency."
"At Auschwitz, Holocaust Survivors Plead ‘Never Forget’",2020-01-27,By Joanna Berendt,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — They wore scarves emblazoned with their prisoner numbers, the same ones tattooed on their arms. Many were frail, walking only with the support of friends or relatives. And as they slowly made their way, one by one, to what had been the wall of death, where thousands of prisoners were lined up for summary execution, it was a vivid reminder that before long the last eyewitnesses to the crimes that took place in Auschwitz will be gone. “What can I say? All I have are these tears to pour over the past,” Batsheva Dagan, 95, told the crowd that gathered Monday for a solemn ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp. “I feel uplifted when I see so many of you here who will carry the memory of innocent people from all nations of the world who met their death here,” she said, her voice often cracking with emotion. “You will make sure that those horrors are never repeated. I’m sorry, I apologize for the emotions.” The ceremony at Auschwitz culminated a week of events around the world, including a commemoration in Jerusalem attended by dozens of world leaders, who urged collective vigilance against a resurgence of anti-Semitism worldwide. Fifteen years ago, some 1,500 survivors attended the anniversary event. This year, there were about 200, and, for many, it is likely to be their last visit. As those who can testify to the monstrous crimes of the Holocaust dwindle in number, there is growing concern about the efforts by political leaders to bend the historical narrative of World War II to suit their own ends. In the weeks leading up to the anniversary, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had repeatedly whitewashed the Soviet treaty with Nazi Germany before World War II and the subsequent subjugation of Poland by both countries at the outbreak of the war. At the same time, he accused Poles of collaborating with Germans and participating in the Holocaust. As a result, Russia was not invited to the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, even though the Soviet Army liberated the camp. The president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, refused to attend the Jerusalem event because he was not asked to speak, though Mr. Putin was. But the Polish government has tried to weaponize history for its own ends as well, passing a broadly written law that would have made it a crime to accuse Poland of collaboration in the Holocaust. After an international uproar, with critics charging that the bill would stifle free speech and academic freedom, the government reversed course. Organizers of Monday’s ceremony stressed the modern-day lessons of the history of Auschwitz. “We see those old ghosts rear their heads everywhere today,” said Piotr Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. “Anti-Semitism, racism, demagogy, contempt and hatred,” he continued. “We are becoming more and more indifferent, introverted, apathetic and passive. Most were silent as the Syrians were drowning, we silently turned our backs on the Congolese people and the Rohingya people, and now the Uighurs. Our silence is our severe defeat.” As he spoke — on the same ground where 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, were murdered — delegations from more than 50 countries looked on. The ceremony was designed to be as free from politics as possible, with the focus on fighting anti-Semitism and giving survivors one more chance to tell their stories. Although the Holocaust remains a critical area of research for many historians and is a staple of school curriculums in many countries, there is fear that the memory of what happened at the camps is fading among younger generations. Prominent Jewish organizations, including the European Jewish Association, urged parliamentarians from across the Continent to toughen anti-Semitism laws in their countries as well as promote Holocaust education. That sentiment was echoed throughout the ceremony. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire and president of the World Jewish Congress, said, “The attacks on Jews, the killings, the vicious slanders have only grown worse, and they have even spread to my country.” “Words are not enough,” he said. “Political speeches are not enough. Laws must be passed. Severe, tough, real laws that will put these hatemongers away in prison for a long, long time. Children must be educated and know where the hatred of Jews leads.” The former prisoners of Auschwitz, in a series of emotional speeches, drove that point home. Most are over 90, with a few pushing 100. In the days before the ceremony, several were forced to cancel because of frail health. A team of at least 80 medical professionals, psychologists and volunteers was organized to assist the survivors, both physically and emotionally. Their stories, even all these years later, remain shocking. The day before the ceremony, Ben Lesser, 92, offered to share his experience. A Polish-born Jew, he was just 15 when he, along with his parents and four siblings, were greeted at the Auschwitz concentration camp in May 1944 by Josef Mengele. The infamous doctor surveyed newcomers to determine who was fit for labor and who was to be immediately executed. Two of his brothers and sisters were told to “go left,” referring to a line for the gas chambers. Mr. Lesser lied to Dr. Mengele, saying he was 18, healthy and fit to work. “He asked me if I can run five kilometers,” he said. “I answered yes and was told to go right.” Mr. Lesser may have been saved from death, but not from witnessing the horrors of a place that became known as the factory of death. He said he still remembered “screams of children thrown into fiery pits” and considered it his moral duty to speak of what he experienced for as long as he can. “People would love to forget the hard truths and that’s why we need to keep coming back here to refresh our memories and keep the world from acquiring amnesia,” said Mr. Lesser, founder of Zachor, a foundation dedicated to ensuring the remembrance of the Holocaust. “Unfortunately, we can’t live forever. What happens after we are gone, I don’t know.” Marian Turski, 93, a historian and Auschwitz survivor, said he attended the event as much for his daughter and grandchildren as for himself. Speaking during the ceremony, he urged people to pay attention to what was happening in the world and to speak out. “Don’t be indifferent,” he said. “That’s what I want to say today to my daughter, my grandchildren and their peers, wherever they are.” “Don’t be indifferent when you witness historical lies,” he said. “Don’t be indifferent when the past is manipulated for the sake of current political interests. Don’t be indifferent when any minority is discriminated against.”']","Organizers sought to put a spotlight on the stories of survivors, as this may be the last time that such a large number will be able to gather in one place."
Anatomy of a Lie: How Iran Covered Up the Downing of an Airliner,2020-01-26,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['When the Revolutionary Guards officer spotted what he thought was an unidentified aircraft near Tehran’s international airport, he had seconds to decide whether to pull the trigger. Iran had just fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at American forces, the country was on high alert for an American counterattack, and the Iranian military was warning of incoming cruise missiles. The officer tried to reach the command center for authorization to shoot but couldn’t get through. So he fired an antiaircraft missile. Then another. The plane, which turned out to be a Ukrainian jetliner with 176 people on board, crashed and exploded in a ball of fire. Within minutes, the top commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards realized what they had done. And at that moment, they began to cover it up. For days, they refused to tell even President Hassan Rouhani, whose government was publicly denying that the plane had been shot down. When they finally told him, he gave them an ultimatum: come clean or he would resign. Only then, 72 hours after the plane crashed, did Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, step in and order the government to acknowledge its fatal mistake. The New York Times pieced together a chronology of those three days by interviewing Iranian diplomats, current and former government officials, ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards and people close to the supreme leader’s inner circle and by examining official public statements and state media reports. The reporting exposes the government’s behind-the-scenes debate over covering up Iran’s responsibility for the crash while shocked Iranians, grieving relatives and countries with citizens aboard the plane waited for the truth. The new details also demonstrate the outsize power of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which effectively sidelined the elected government in a moment of national crisis, and could deepen what many Iranians already see as a crisis of legitimacy for the Guards and the government. The bitter divisions in Iran’s government persist and are bound to affect the investigation into the crash, negotiations over compensation and the unresolved debate over accountability. Around midnight on Jan. 7, as Iran was preparing to launch a ballistic-missile attack on American military posts in Iraq, senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps deployed mobile antiaircraft defense units around a sensitive military area near Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport. Iran was about to retaliate for the American drone strike that had killed Iran’s top military commander, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad five days earlier, and the military was bracing for an American counterstrike. The armed forces were on “at war” status, the highest alert level. But in a tragic miscalculation, the government continued to allow civilian commercial flights to land and take off from the Tehran airport. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Guards’ Aerospace Force, said later that his units had asked officials in Tehran to close Iran’s airspace and ground all flights, to no avail. Iranian officials feared that shutting down the airport would create mass panic that war with the United States was imminent, members of the Guards and other officials told The Times. They also hoped that the presence of passenger jets could act as a deterrent against an American attack on the airport or the nearby military base, effectively turning planeloads of unsuspecting travelers into human shields. After Iran’s missile attack began, the central air defense command issued an alert that American warplanes had taken off from the United Arab Emirates and that cruise missiles were headed toward Iran. The officer on the missile launcher near the airport heard the warnings but did not hear a later message that the cruise missile alert was a false alarm. The warning about American warplanes may have also been wrong. United States military officials have said that no American planes were in or near Iranian airspace that night. When the officer spotted the Ukrainian jet, he sought permission to fire. But he was unable to communicate with his commanders because the network had been disrupted or jammed, General Hajizadeh said later. The officer, who has not been publicly identified, fired two missiles, less than 30 seconds apart. General Hajizadeh, who was in western Iran supervising the attack on the Americans, received a phone call with the news. “I called the officials and told them this has happened and it’s highly possible we hit our own plane,” he said later in a televised statement. By the time General Hajizadeh arrived in Tehran, he had informed Iran’s top three military commanders: Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the army’s commander in chief, who is also the chief of the central air defense command; Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Armed Forces; and Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards. The Revolutionary Guards, an elite force charged with defending Iran’s clerical rule at home and abroad, is separate from the regular army and answers only to the supreme leader. At this point, the leaders of both militaries knew the truth. General Hajizadeh advised the generals not to tell the rank-and-file air defense units for fear that it could hamper their ability to react quickly if the United States did attack. “It was for the benefit of our national security because then our air defense system would be compromised,” Mr. Hajizadeh said in an interview with Iranian news media this week. “The ranks would be suspicious of everything.” The military leaders created a secret investigative committee drawn from the Guards’ aerospace forces, from the army’s air defense, and from intelligence and cyberexperts. The committee and the officers involved in the shooting were sequestered and ordered not to speak to anyone. The committee examined data from the airport, the flight path, radar networks, and alerts and messages from the missile operator and central command. Witnesses — the officer who had pulled the trigger, his supervisors and everyone involved — were interrogated for hours. The group also investigated the possibility that the United States or Israel may have hacked Iran’s defense system or jammed the airwaves. By Wednesday night, the committee had concluded that the plane was shot down because of human error. “We were not confident about what happened until Wednesday around sunset,” General Salami, the commander in chief of the Guards, said later in a televised address to the Parliament. “Our investigative team concluded then that the plane crashed because of human errors.” Ayatollah Khamenei was informed. But they still did not inform the president, other elected officials or the public. Senior commanders discussed keeping the shooting secret until the plane’s black boxes — the flight data and cockpit voice recorders — were examined and formal aviation investigations completed, according to members of the Guards, diplomats and officials with knowledge of the deliberations. That process could take months, they argued, and it would buy time to manage the domestic and international fallout that would ensue when the truth came out. The government had violently crushed an anti-government uprising in November. But the American killing of General Suleimani, followed by the strikes against the United States, had turned public opinion around. Iranians were galvanized in a moment of national unity. The authorities feared that admitting to shooting down the passenger plane would undercut that momentum and prompt a new wave of anti-government protests. “They advocated covering it up because they thought the country couldn’t handle more crisis,” said a ranking member of the Guards who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “At the end, safeguarding the Islamic Republic is our ultimate goal, at any cost.” That evening, the spokesman for the Joint Armed Forces, Brig. Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, told Iranian news media that suggestions that missiles struck the plane were “an absolute lie.” On Thursday, as Ukrainian investigators began to arrive in Tehran, Western officials were saying publicly that they had evidence that Iran had accidentally shot down the plane. A chorus of senior Iranian officials — from the director of civil aviation to the chief government spokesman — issued statement after statement rejecting the allegations, their claims amplified on state media. The suggestion that Iran would shoot down a passenger plane was a “Western plot,” they said, “psychological warfare” aimed at weakening Iran just as it had exercised its military muscle against the United States. But in private, government officials were alarmed and questioning whether there was any truth to the Western claims. Mr. Rouhani, a seasoned military strategist himself, and his foreign minister, Javad Zarif, deflected phone calls from world leaders and foreign ministers seeking answers. Ignorant of what their own military had done, they had none to give. Domestically, public pressure was building for the government to address the allegations. Among the plane’s passengers were some of Iran’s best and brightest. They included prominent scientists and physicians, dozens of Iran’s top young scholars and graduates of elite universities, and six gold and silver medal winners of international physics and math Olympiads. There were two newlywed couples who had traveled from Canada to Tehran for their weddings just days earlier. There were families and young children. Their relatives demanded answers. Iranian social media began to explode with emotional commentary, some accusing Iran of murdering its own citizens and others calling such allegations treason. Persian-language satellite channels operating from abroad, the main source of news for most Iranians, broadcast blanket coverage of the crash, including reports from Western governments that Iran had shot down the plane. Mr. Rouhani tried several times to call military commanders, officials said, but they did not return his calls. Members of his government called their contacts in the military and were told the allegations were false. Iran’s civil aviation agency called military officials with similar results. “Thursday was frantic,” Ali Rabiei, the government spokesman, said later in a news conference. “The government made back-to-back phone calls and contacted the armed forces asking what happened, and the answer to all the questions was that no missile had been fired.” On Friday morning, Mr. Rabiei issued a statement saying the allegation that Iran had shot down the plane was “a big lie.” Several hours later, the nation’s top military commanders called a private meeting and told Mr. Rouhani the truth. Mr. Rouhani was livid, according to officials close to him. He demanded that Iran immediately announce that it had made a tragic mistake and accept the consequences. The military officials pushed back, arguing that the fallout could destabilize the country. Mr. Rouhani threatened to resign. Canada, which had the most foreign citizens on board the plane, and the United States, which as Boeing’s home country was invited to investigate the crash, would eventually reveal their evidence, Mr. Rouhani said. The damage to Iran’s reputation and the public trust in the government would create an enormous crisis at a time when Iran could not bear more pressure. As the standoff escalated, a member of Ayatollah Khamenei’s inner circle who was in the meeting informed the supreme leader. The ayatollah sent a message back to the group, ordering the government to prepare a public statement acknowledging what had happened. Mr. Rouhani briefed a few senior members of his government. They were rattled. Mr. Rabiei, the government spokesman who had issued a denial just that morning, broke down. Abbas Abdi, a prominent critic of Iran’s clerical establishment, said that when he spoke to Mr. Rabiei that evening, Mr. Rabiei was distraught and crying. “Everything is a lie,” Mr. Rabiei said, according to Mr. Abdi. “The whole thing is a lie. What should I do? My honor is gone.” Mr. Abdi said the government’s actions had gone “far beyond” just a lie. “There was a systematic cover-up at the highest levels that makes it impossible to get out of this crisis,” he said. Iran’s National Security Council held an emergency meeting and drafted two statements, the first to be issued by the Joint Armed Forces followed by a second one from Mr. Rouhani. As they debated the wording, some suggested claiming that the United States or Israel may have contributed to the accident by jamming Iran’s radars or hacking its communications networks. But the military commanders opposed it. General Hajizadeh said the shame of human error paled compared with admitting his air defense system was vulnerable to hacking by the enemy. Iran’s Civil Aviation Agency later said that it had found no evidence of jamming or hacking. At 7 a.m., the military released a statement admitting that Iran had shot down the plane because of “human error.” The bombshell revelation has not ended the division within the government. The Revolutionary Guards want to pin the blame on those involved in firing the missiles and be done with it, officials said. The missile operator and up to 10 others have been arrested but officials have not identified them or said whether they had been charged. Mr. Rouhani has demanded a broader accounting, including an investigation of the entire chain of command. The Guards’ accepting responsibility, he said, is “the first step and needs to be completed with other steps.” His spokesman and lawmakers have demanded to know why Mr. Rouhani was not immediately informed. Mr. Rouhani touched on that concern when he put out his statement an hour and 15 minutes later. The first line said that he had found out about the investigative committee’s conclusion about cause of the crash “a few hours ago.” It was a stunning admission, an acknowledgment that even the nation’s highest elected official had been shut out from the truth, and that as Iranians, and the world, turned to the government for answers, it had peddled lies. “What we thought was news was a lie. What we thought was a lie was news,” said Hesamedin Ashna, Mr. Rouhani’s top adviser, on Twitter. “Why? Why? Beware of cover-ups and military rule.”']","For three days, Iranian military officials knew they had shot down a Ukrainian jetliner while the government issued false statements, denying any responsibility."
Harry and Meghan’s Big Funding Source Is Private. Sort of.,2020-01-26,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Every six months or so, Alan Davis sets out from his seaside bungalow on a far-flung island off the southwestern coast of England carrying a rent check of 12.5 pounds (about $16) for his landlord. But this is no ordinary landlord, and no ordinary rent check. Mr. Davis lives on a tiny corner of the Duchy of Cornwall, the property empire controlled by Prince Charles, the heir to Britain’s throne, who has quietly turned an inheritance of rundown farmland into a billion-pound real estate conglomerate. By a quirk of British law, Mr. Davis has to pay the prince for the privilege of living on his land, piddling as the checks may be.  “It’s a feudal way of carrying on,” Mr. Davis said. “They put their finger in and demand money. They’re a law unto themselves.” Prince Charles’s fortune, long shielded from scrutiny by parliamentary indifference and obscure accounting, spilled into public view this month when his younger son, Prince Harry, announced that he and his wife, Meghan, were quitting their royal duties. In trying to prove that they would renounce taxpayer money, Harry and Meghan gave Britons a peek at the shadowy world of ostensibly private finance that bankrolls the family and its mansions, gardens and considerable staff. But what the royals call private contains, by any other measure, a generous mix of public giveaways: medieval landholdings passed from one male heir to the next, sweeping tax relief, indemnity from some laws and exemptions from others, ownership of long stretches of coastline and all the treasure buried in Cornwall. Those perks have delivered Prince Charles substantial wealth. Income from the duchy has nearly tripled in two decades, to £21.6 million, about $28.3 million, last year. But the uproar over Harry and Meghan’s funding has raised uncomfortable questions for the prince and the royals about whether any of their income can truly be considered private.  The family has already been buffeted this winter by the fallout from Prince Charles’s brother Andrew being forced to retreat from royal duties over his ties to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. On Monday, Prince Andrew was accused by prosecutors in New York of dodging an F.B.I. interview about Mr. Epstein. Scrutiny over the royals’ finances threatens to further dent their mystique. “Harry has chucked a grenade into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace,” said David McClure, the author of a book about the royal family’s wealth. “It’s weakened the foundations of the royal family and their money, and it’s raised issues that don’t just apply to Harry but have been bubbling under the surface for at least a decade.” [Update: Prince Harry and Meghan exit Britain with final official engagement.] Among the biggest of those is the special treatment afforded Prince Charles’s property empire, an estate that, among other things, pays for the upkeep of his country mansion and furnished £5 million last year for the families of Harry and his older brother, Prince William. Formed in 1337 to provide the royal heir with an income, the duchy came with fringe benefits: the right to unclaimed shipwrecks on Cornish shores, washed-up whale and sturgeon carcasses, and at least 250 gallons of wine from boats docking at Cornish ports. Nearly 700 years later, Prince Charles has held onto some anachronistic perks. Into his 20s, the prince is said to have received feudal dues of 100 silver shillings and a pound of peppercorns from the mayor of Launceston in Cornwall. But with the help of British real estate heavyweights, he has transformed his sleepy holdings into a thriving business covering 200 square miles, turning the focus from rural land to profit-rich urban holdings. The duchy has a vast footprint, stretching from the rocky shores of Cornwall to south London, and from medieval castles to a granite-walled men’s prison. It recently bought a 400,000-square-foot supermarket warehouse north of London. A spokeswoman for the duchy said in a statement that Parliament had “confirmed its status as a private estate” and that the Treasury had agreed that its tax status did not confer an unfair advantage. “The prince has always ensured it is run with the interests of its communities as an equal priority,” the statement said. The duchy’s holdings reflect how the royal family’s wealth has become concentrated in the hands of Prince Charles and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, whose own estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, paid her £21.7 million last year. Together, the two duchies bankroll more than a dozen members of the family, supplementing a taxpayer grant of £82 million last year reserved for official duties and the upkeep of several palaces. Despite lawmakers once deeming its current income “an accident of history,” the Duchy of Cornwall has mostly avoided harsh questions, in part by playing up its interest in traditional architecture and sustainable practices across its humbler holdings: scores of farms, much of Dartmoor National Park in Devon and rivers throughout Cornwall. But analysts say that obscures fierce commercial instincts. “If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, you sort of assume it is a duck,” a Labour lawmaker told duchy officials during a 2013 hearing. “The Duchy of Cornwall looks and behaves like a corporation.” But the duchy does not pay taxes like a corporation. Instead it sits in a sort of legal limbo, using its royal status to skirt corporation and capital gains taxes even as it argues that, as a private estate, it has no obligation to open its books. The duchy said that its capital gains were all reinvested in the business, obviating the need to tax them, and that only companies paid corporation tax. Prince Charles pays tax on his duchy income only voluntarily, and after deducting what analysts believe to be about £10 million that he deems official and charitable spending. He has also written off tens of thousands of pounds that he pays for gardening at Highgrove, his country house, on the basis that members of the public were occasionally invited in. “The Duchy of Cornwall can be whatever it’s convenient for it to be,” said John Kirkhope, who wrote a doctoral thesis about the duchy in 2013. “If you want to inquire into its privileges, you can’t, because it’s supposedly a private estate, in the same way I have a private bank account. But when it’s convenient, it’s also a crown property, so that for example it doesn’t pay the same rate of tax as any similar entity would pay.” The duchy’s powers go even further. Prince Charles inherits the possessions of anyone who dies in Cornwall without a will or next of kin, a power that in some years has yielded hundreds of thousands of pounds. He funnels the money into charities after deducting his costs. The duchy owns the right to mine in Cornwall, even under private homes — a right that it registered to extend as recently as eight years ago. Most extraordinarily in critics’ eyes, the duchy has the right to be consulted on any legislation that affects its interests. Over the years, governments have interpreted that to include bills about hunting, road safety, children’s rights, marine access and wreck removal. A 2008 planning law exempts the duchy from ever committing a planning offense. A similar carve-out gives Prince Charles unusual power over some homeowners on the Isles of Scilly, a picturesque archipelago off the southwestern coast of England, and in Newton St. Loe, a village near Bath. People like Mr. Davis own their homes there, but the duchy owns the ground on which they are built. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in England, but homeowners would usually have the option to buy the land. Not on some duchy land. That enables the duchy to charge small ground rents to homeowners grandfathered into long leases, like Mr. Davis. Once those leases lapse, it can also raise rents to thousands of pounds per year, making it difficult for people to sell or mortgage their homes. In one case, a couple built a house on the Isles of Scilly, only to have the duchy force them to sign a lease bequeathing the property to Prince Charles’s estate upon their death, said Lord Berkeley, a Labour peer in the House of Lords. “They set up an arrangement where tenants are too frightened to do anything, for fear of losing their property,” said Lord Berkeley, who tried unsuccessfully to push through a bill in 2017 ending the duchy’s special landlord status and removing its tax exemptions. “In what we like to think of as a democratic country, that doesn’t seem fair to me.” Nor have lawmakers approved of how Prince Charles handles the duchy’s accounting. He pays rent to the duchy for Highgrove, his country house. But because the money goes into the duchy’s revenues, it empties back into Prince Charles’s pocket as income. The duchy said the prince paid rent, at market value, to avoid the duchy taking on costs it shouldn’t. Still, he is effectively paying it to himself — and allowing himself to take a tax deduction. “He pays money out from one pocket and receives it back in the other pocket,” Mr. Kirkhope said. Polls show that the public is dubious of government funding for anyone outside the core line of succession. And Harry and Meghan’s departure has intensified the focus on how and why the public pays for the royals’ lifestyle. Palace aides have indicated that Prince Charles may dip into his personal investments, rather than the Duchy of Cornwall, to fund Harry and Meghan’s lives in Canada. But that and much else remains unresolved, including how long British taxpayers will pay for the couple’s security. “It’s the third rail of public discussions about the royal family: royal finances,” said Patrick Jephson, a former private secretary to Harry’s mother, Diana. “It is royal people and royal advisers’ least favorite topic of conversation.” Mr. Davis says that among people on the Isles of Scilly around where he lives and pays his rent to the duchy, the mood has hardened against Prince Charles. “They hate him basically,” Mr. Davis said. “Most people can’t abide him. All the money he gets goes out of the island. And that’s how he can afford to give Harry £2.3 million to live his lifestyle.”']","Prince Charles’s pledge to help support the couple as they forgo public funding has put a spotlight on his own sources of wealth, including a billion-pound real estate conglomerate."
Indonesia Releases U.S. Journalist Detained Over Visa Issue,2020-01-25,By Richard C. Paddock,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — An American environmental journalist accused of violating the terms of his visa has been freed after three days in jail and is likely to be deported soon, a top Indonesian government minister said. The journalist, Philip Jacobson, 30, who works for the nonprofit news site Mongabay and is known for exposing environmental damage and corporate misconduct, was arrested on the island of Borneo after attending a public meeting between officials and indigenous leaders. Immigration officials said he had been conducting journalistic activities while on a business visa, which was not permitted, and that he faced up to five years in prison. The minister for political, legal, and security affairs, Mohammad Mahfud MD, met on Friday with the United States ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan, and told reporters afterward that the case would be handled as an administrative matter punishable by deportation, not as a crime. The minister set no timetable for deporting Mr. Jacobson and indicated that the authorities were still investigating whether he had broken any laws. Since his release on Friday, Mr. Jacobson has been free to move around the city of Palangkaraya, where he was arrested, but not to travel outside the city. “We will try to just deport him soon if he didn’t commit any other crime,” Mr. Mahfud said. A State Department spokesman said the United States Embassy in Jakarta had been in frequent communication with Mr. Jacobson since he was first contacted by Indonesian immigration authorities and that it was following his case closely. A story posted on Mongabay’s website said that Mr. Jacobson had been moved from the jail, where he had shared a cell with five other prisoners, to “city detention.” “We are grateful that authorities have made this accommodation and remain hopeful that Phil’s case can be treated as an administrative matter rather than a criminal one,” said Mongabay’s founder and chief executive, Rhett A. Butler. Indonesia requires visiting foreign journalists to obtain a journalist visa, a cumbersome and lengthy process that allows the authorities to question an applicant’s reporting plan, deny a visa without explanation or take no action at all. Mr. Jacobson was initially detained on Dec. 17 and ordered to remain in Palangkaraya. On Tuesday, the immigration authorities arrested him and put him in jail, signaling that he could face criminal charges. Mr. Jacobson’s reports for Mongabay include an article about a paper company that he said had illicitly set up a shell company to secretly clear forest in Borneo, and another that analyzed the environmental record of Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. Arvin Gumilang, a spokesman for Indonesia’s immigration department, said Mr. Jacobson had visited Indonesia several times on a business visa, and that he had been arrested after being reported to the authorities by an interviewee. He was not arrested because of any articles published by Mongabay, Mr. Gumilang added. Rights activists said Mr. Jacobson’s case was disturbing and highlighted the need for Indonesia to loosen restrictions on journalists. “This arbitrary arrest is an unacceptable attack on freedom of the press in the country,” said Amnesty International Indonesia’s executive director, Usman Hamid. “Respect for the right to freedom of expression is a pillar of any rights-respecting society, whether it is holding institutions to account or highlighting environmental concerns.” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","The authorities had threatened a yearslong prison sentence for Philip Jacobson, who was jailed for three days. He is likely to be deported soon, but his movements remain restricted."
"At Border of 2 Nuclear-Armed Nations: Machine Guns, Anxiety and Dancing",2020-01-25,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"[""ALONG THE INDIA-PAKISTAN BORDER — Long before the action starts, the crowd starts building, thousands of people, from all walks of life, inexorably pulled toward each other from two different directions — children riding their fathers’ shoulders, young mothers walking briskly beside them, older folks struggling to keep up. Up ahead the loudspeakers roar. “Are … You … Ready?’’ Legs move faster. People stream past the machine gun pits and the men selling fresh, fragrant popcorn. But business isn’t so good. No one wants to stop, no one wants to miss a second of what’s about to unfold. Every evening at the Wagah-Attari border crossing, along the extremely militarized India-Pakistan frontier, a raw and remarkable scene comes to life, a homage to one of the most powerful forces on the planet today: nationalism. Thousands of people from two existentially opposed countries pour into stadiums built on the border, just a few feet from each other, and hold enormous pep rallies, side by side. The crowds are mirror images — drawn to each other, fed by each other — gathering every day not to cross the border, but to stare each other down. “Long Live Pakistan!” they yell out on one side.“Long Live India!” they shout on the other. The slogans aren’t terribly original but the atmosphere is electric and at least a little ominous. Nationalism needs an enemy, an other, and the two governments have built these concrete sanctuaries to stoke it. As India-Pakistan relations sink once again, these evening ceremonies, which have been going on for decades, are taking on an extra edge. The tension peaks as the Indian border guards march toward the set of gates that separate the countries, and the Pakistani soldiers do the same. The crowds jump up. It’s time for the stomp-off. At the exact same moment, the Indian and Pakistani forces throw open their gates. Their tallest, most imposing soldiers strut forward. They stomp closer and closer to each other. But just when they are about to touch, they suddenly stop. Separated by just a few feet, the soldiers face off, kick their legs high in the air and pound them violently down, mimicking each other’s movements. The soldiers are even wearing the same kind of fan-shaped hats. It’s all obviously choreographed, which is almost hard to fathom given that these two nations don’t like each other, don’t trust each other and can’t cooperate on much else. Even last year, as India and Pakistan nearly went to war, the show went on. India and Pakistan have been in a state of near war, or real war, for more than 70 straight years, their enmity a product of a very bloody exercise in division. In 1947, the British rulers chopped the Indian subcontinent into two — a predominantly Muslim Pakistan and a predominantly Hindu India, setting off enormous waves of displacement, bloodshed and lingering bitterness. Last February, as part of their chronic feud over the disputed region of Kashmir, their warplanes bombed each other’s territory, the first time two nuclear-armed powers had ever done that. Since then, trade ties have been shelved and the governments routinely insult each other. Even the Friendship Express, a train that used to run between the two countries, has stopped. The roots of the border ceremony go back to the late 1940s, when the border was first demarcated by Indian and Pakistani officers who had served in the same regiment in the colonial army. The two sides decided that each evening they would lower their flags at the same time. Apparently, those military manners aren’t totally dead; officers today said that as they perform the drill, the soldiers speak to each other through the gates “down to the second” to get the performance just right. “The idea behind this is,’’ explained N.K. Singh, a retired Indian border officer, “is that I understand you and you understand me. It’s not a confrontation. It’s a display of the best from both sides.”“And,” he conceded, “this border is becoming a tourist spot.’'As the crowds grow, they get rowdier. They often scream vulgarities and signal certain things with certain fingers. On the Indian side, people shout and dance wildly. The guards patrolling the crowds have to physically hold back the hundreds of young women so fired up by the pulsing patriotic songs that they push their bodies against the barricades. On the Pakistan side, people clap along dutifully to a one-legged man, possibly a war veteran, hopping around with a flag. Men wear white skullcaps. Some women wear black veils. None dance. “It looks like they’re having more fun,’’ admitted Zeeshan Rajput, a software engineer from Lahore, as he gazed at the Indian women 50 feet away but distant as a mirage. The Pakistani stands are smaller — picture a high school stadium stuck in the towering shadow of an N.F.L. arena — and the spirit seems more canned, a sign, perhaps, of how the two countries feel about themselves at this moment. India is in the throes of a nationalist and populist surge, carefully primed by its Hindu nationalist government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Modi travels the world promoting India as a rising superpower. Back home, his government pushes policies that favor India’s Hindu majority. It revoked the statehood of Kashmir, which had been India’s only Muslim majority state, and recently passed a new citizenship law that helps non-Muslim immigrants. Pakistan has complained as loud as it can. But Pakistan is in trouble. The economy is teetering on life support. The disasters are stacking up. Dozens of Pakistanis recently burned to death on a moving train and a thousand children were infected with H.I.V. from a doctor using dirty needles. “Look at those people,’’ snickered Saroj Kumar Sethi, an Indian machine operator, pointing toward the Pakistanis. “It’s like they are ashamed of themselves.’’ India has historically done a better job at creating a sense of national unity, even across a much bigger and more diverse space. One reason is Gandhi, who united the poorest of the poor to repel the British and liberate India. But lately, many people fear, India’s national unity is not as solid as it used to be. Mr. Modi’s policies have alienated minorities, especially Muslims, provoking deadly protests. The ritual showdowns along this border end peacefully. On recent visits, the guards shook hands. Then the flags were lowered and gates closed. The show was over, but the tensions are not. In February, after Indian and Pakistani warplanes clashed in the skies, the public of the two countries reacted very differently. In India, the country’s flag popped up everywhere and many people seemed more than ready to support a war. But in Pakistan, people were scared. They stocked up on canned goods and iodine, which helps combat the effects of radiation. Their minds were seized by nuclear war. “During February, I was really struck by Indians calling for war and I didn’t know any Pakistanis at all calling for war,’’ said Mohsin Hamid, a Pakistani novelist and author of the acclaimed “Exit West.” He said that many Pakistanis, having seen so much bloodshed in their own country, have grown more suspicious of nationalism. Last winter, Mr. Hamid took his family and some friends to the border ceremony, thinking it would be an interesting spectacle, some harmless fun.But he was unnerved by the intolerance, the hatred and the vilification of the other that was so flamboyantly displayed. “My kids were wondering, ‘What the hell is this?’’’ he said. “I felt really creeped out by the whole thing.” Jeffrey Gettleman is the South Asia bureau chief, based in New Delhi.

North Korean Leader’s Aunt Re-emerges After Husband’s Execution,2020-01-26,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The aunt of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has re-emerged in Pyongyang, the capital, the country’s media said on Sunday, dispelling rumors that she was purged after her powerful husband was executed on charges of plotting a coup to topple Mr. Kim in 2013. North Korea’s state-run media said Kim Kyong-hui, the only sister of Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, accompanied Kim Jong-un to an orchestra performance on Saturday for Lunar New Year’s Day. Photos released in state media showed Ms. Kim dressed in black and sitting with Mr. Kim, his wife, his sister and other top leaders in the front row at a theater in Pyongyang. The fate of Kim Kyong-hui has been a subject of intense speculation since her husband, Jang Song-thaek, once considered the second most powerful man in Pyongyang, was executed in 2013. North Korean media last mentioned her name a few days after her husband’s execution when she was appointed to a committee for the state funeral of another top party official. She then disappeared from public view completely, setting off rumors that she may have been executed, too. South Korean intelligence officials have dismissed such rumors, saying that she had been hospitalized for poor health but not purged. Ms. Kim remains the closest blood link that Mr. Kim has to his father and paternal grandfather, both of whom ruled North Korea before him. Mr. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, is still revered like a god among North Koreans. Mr. Kim, the current leader, often stresses his bloodline when he needs to legitimize his rule or wants to consolidate his people around him in the face of an external crisis. The public appearance of Ms. Kim, a daughter of Kim Il-sung, reminds North Koreans of that blood link. Mr. Kim now needs his people’s loyalty more than ever. After a year and a half of largely fruitless diplomacy with President Trump, Mr. Kim said late last month that his country would no longer hope for a diplomatic breakthrough with Washington. Instead, he said his country should prepare to endure international sanctions by tightening its belt and building a “self-reliant” economy. Until her husband, Mr. Jang, was executed, Ms. Kim had been the pre-eminent female face of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea since its founding seven decades ago. Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, allowed his sister to hold key jobs in his government. But the diminutive, frail and reportedly sick sister seldom appeared in public during her brother’s rule. But that changed after Kim Jong-il fell ill with a stroke in 2008. She and her husband raised their public profile, assuming more titles, and acted as parent-like figures while Kim Jong-un was groomed as heir apparent. After Kim Jong-il died, the couple further strengthened their power as they helped Kim Jong-un engineer purges of top officials to establish himself as supreme leader and continue the family dynasty. Mr. Jang’s power became so expansive through the military and other key branches of the government that Mr. Kim felt threatened. Mr. Kim had him executed on charges of corruption, sedition and numerous other criminal charges in late 2013. He also ferreted out those close to Mr. Jang, who was accused of building a network of followers in the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, the government and the Korean People’s Army. The executions of Mr. Jang and his followers were watershed moments for Mr. Kim’s efforts to establish himself as a monolithic leader. In 2017, North Korean agents plotted the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, in Malaysia. Mr. Kim may have regarded Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of his father, as a potential threat to his throne at the family-run regime, analysts say. After Kim Kyong-hui disappeared from public view, Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, replaced her as the main female face of the family. It remained unclear whether, Kim Kyong-hui, 73, will resume an active public life. In North Korea, invitations to leadership gatherings — and how close people are placed to Mr. Kim — are often barometers of whether an official is favored in the government. Before rumors emerged that she had been purged, her presence had been a powerful reminder to top generals of where the root of the regime lay, and she was even seen as a regent helping guide her nephew through the North’s treacherous internal politics to ensure a smooth generational change in her family’s dynasty. The offspring of those who fought to help Kim Il-sung establish himself as top leader form the loyalist core of the elite in Pyongyang today. But Ms. Kim’s relationship with her husband had always been a subject of speculation. Even before Mr. Jang’s downfall, analysts in South Korea had speculated that the couple had a troubled marriage, especially after their only child, a daughter, committed suicide in France in 2006. In a party meeting in 2013 that condemned Mr. Jang as a traitor, he was called a depraved and corrupt womanizer.']",Kim Kyong-hui resurfaces as Kim Jong-un emphasizes his bloodline to consolidate his people’s loyalty.
"Gantz to Meet Trump on Peace Plan, but Alone, Not With Netanyahu",2020-01-25,By David M. Halbfinger,"['RAMAT GAN, Israel — Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military chief making a third attempt to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Saturday that he would visit President Trump on his own in Washington on Monday to discuss a White House proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Calling himself “the president’s full and committed partner,” Mr. Gantz pointedly said, in English, that he would be meeting with Mr. Trump “as the leader of the largest party in Israel,” the centrist Blue and White faction. Mr. Gantz also gave measured praise to Mr. Trump’s proposal, about which he said he had already been told a good deal by administration officials.  The surprise announcement means Mr. Gantz will avoid an awkward three-way meeting with Mr. Trump that Mr. Netanyahu had sought to orchestrate at the White House on Tuesday, five weeks before Israel’s March 2 election, the third ballot in a year. The first two ended in deadlock. Crucially, it also means Mr. Gantz will be able to fly back to Israel in time to oversee a key proceeding Tuesday regarding Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to obtain parliamentary immunity from prosecution on serious corruption charges. Lawmakers are expected to reject the request, with Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, vowing to boycott Tuesday’s debate in protest, but if Mr. Gantz were in Washington, that likely would have been delayed. In effect, Mr. Gantz, who had seemingly been cornered by the White House invitation, found an unseen exit, allowing him to avoid aiding Mr. Netanyahu without offending Israel’s closest and most powerful ally. “Following this important meeting, I will return to Israel in order to lead the debates regarding Netanyahu’s immunity from up close,” Mr. Gantz said in Hebrew, in an announcement that was carried live by Israeli television. “These are not regular days for the state of Israel,” he added. A meeting of the American president and Israeli prime minister with Mr. Gantz, who is merely a member of Parliament, could have embarrassed him in the eyes of Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu could have put him on the spot before the cameras by cajoling Mr. Gantz to join a unity government after the March 2 election. It would have meant communicating in English, in which Mr. Netanyahu is peerless among Israeli politicians and Mr. Gantz is much less comfortable. Mr. Gantz, who is tacking to the right in his campaign this time, was full of praise for Mr. Trump, calling him “a true friend of the state of Israel, the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the United States,” and saying his leadership “has made the alliance between us deeper, stronger and more powerful than ever.” While couched in laudatory terms, Mr. Gantz’s remarks about the Trump administration’s proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about which he said he had been amply briefed, was full of subtle caveats, and referred to its potential rather than to the probability or certainty of its success. He said the proposal could be “a basis for progress” toward “an agreed-to arrangement” with the Palestinians, “in tandem with continued and deeper strategic partnership with Jordan, Egypt and other countries in the region.” He said the plan would go down in history “as a significant milestone that defines the path down which the various parties to the conflict in the Middle East can walk to a regional and historic agreement.” But he did not indicate how much farther that path might lead. The Israeli news media has been full of leaks of supposed details of the plan, saying it would pave the way for annexation of significant portions of the West Bank including all but a small number of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The Palestinians insist it will be dead on arrival. Many analysts and supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict have called the promised rollout of the plan this week a distraction from Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial and an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to shift the election campaign from a referendum on him to a discussion of what he calls a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to expand Israeli territory.  Regardless, the White House invitation, delivered by Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem on Thursday, had put Mr. Gantz in a bind. Aides said it would be difficult and politically costly to turn down a presidential summons. Weighing against that, they said, was a belief that the invitation was a trap, laid by Mr. Netanyahu with the cooperation of his allies in the Trump administration. Before Mr. Gantz’s announcement, a few activists outside shouted pleas for him to spurn the president’s call to Washington. “Bibi laid a honey trap for him,” said Shai Erel, 61, a contractor. “He mustn’t fly as Netanyahu’s plus-one and be the escort of a not-yet-elected prime minister.” But a separate meeting on Monday is not risk-free for Mr. Gantz. A career military man, he only entered politics a year ago and has yet to face an English-language press corps or a stage anything like that of the White House.  And aides to Mr. Netanyahu signaled they would seek to magnify the contrast, with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reporting after Mr. Gantz’s remarks that Mr. Netanyahu now planned to hold an additional meeting of his own with Mr. Trump on Monday, denying Mr. Gantz a news cycle to himself.']","Seemingly cornered into an awkward meeting with his political rival and the U.S. president, Benny Gantz finds a way to avoid aiding Benjamin Netanyahu — without offending the White House."
Cease-Fire in Libya Collapses Despite International Efforts,2020-01-27,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['A cease-fire in the Libyan civil war has collapsed and foreign shipments to the combatants have resumed, shredding the work of a conference of world leaders who convened in Berlin just eight days ago. “Battles are raging on all front lines,” Ahmed Mismari, a spokesman for the military forces based in eastern Libya, told reporters over the weekend, according to Reuters. The United Nations had already warned on Friday of “continued blatant violations of the arms embargo” by unnamed foreign powers who had pledged just days earlier to stop supplying weapons to Libyan clients. In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya said, “Over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters.” “The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting,” it added. The end of the cease-fire and the resumption of weapons shipments are grave blows to the United Nations’ attempts to resolve the conflict. But they are also setbacks for rival peace efforts by the leaders of Russia and Turkey, important backers of the two warring sides in the Libya fight. The two leaders had attempted to upstage the United Nations by privately negotiating a truce, but they have failed to impose it on their Libyan clients. Libya has struggled for nearly nine years to shake off the chaos that followed the four-decade rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, toppled in 2011 by an Arab Spring revolt supported by NATO airstrikes. The fighting has shaken world energy markets by threatening access to Libya’s large supplies of oil and gas. The mayhem has also turned the country’s long Mediterranean coastline into a departure point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants and made its vast deserts a haven for bands of extremists. The current round of conflict began last April when forces based in eastern Libya and backing the military leader Khalifa Hifter began an assault on the capital, Tripoli. The city is the headquarters of a United Nations-sponsored provisional government, and a coalition of militias based in western Libya has rushed to defend it against Mr. Hifter. The United Arab Emirates, which sees Mr. Hifter as a strongman who might restore order, has been a major supplier of weaponry to his forces and has sent fighter jets to back him. Analysts following the Libyan war have detected a surge in flights from the United Arab Emirates to Mr. Hifter’s territory in recent days, raising questions about whether the Emiratis were supplying him for a new round of fighting. Russia has also become a major backer of Mr. Hifter. The Kremlin has sent as many as 1,400 mercenaries with the private security company Wagner Group to aid his assault on Tripoli. On the other side, Turkey has been the main military backer of the forces defending Tripoli. In recent weeks, Ankara has also begun sending hundreds of fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian militias to join the defense of Tripoli, transporting them from one quagmire to another. Officials of the Tripoli government have said that the fighters are Arabic-speaking Turkish nationals from the area near the Syrian border, but recent news reports suggest that the fighters are Syrian-born and may have received Turkish citizenship. In its statement on Friday, the United Nations mission to Libya said that it “deeply regrets the continued blatant violations of the arms embargo in Libya, even after the commitments made in this regard by concerned countries during the International Conference on Libya in Berlin.” The leaders of both sides of the Libyan fight have said that they continue to uphold the cease-fire. But both have also said that they were retaliating against rivals’ attacks. In reality, sporadic fighting around the outskirts of Tripoli had continued throughout the cease-fire. By the end of the weekend, however, the clashes had escalated. The United Nations mission said in a statement on Sunday that two missiles had hit the Mitiga International Airport, which serves Tripoli, wounding at least two civilians and damaging buildings. Repeated attacks have often “deprived two million residents in the capital of their only functioning airport,” the mission said. By Monday, fighting had also resumed on another front between the coastal city of Surt, captured in recent weeks by Mr. Hifter’s forces, and the city of Misurata, home of the most potent militias defending Tripoli. A spokesman for Mr. Hifter said his forces near Surt had been forced to respond “after noticeable movements by terrorists in the area.” Mr. Hifter customarily uses the term “terrorists” to describe the forces defending Tripoli.']","Fighting has started anew and foreign shipments of arms have resumed, blasting apart attempts by world leaders to broker a truce."
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Is Hit by Mortars,2020-01-27,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The United States Embassy in Baghdad was struck by mortar fire late Sunday, with at least one shell hitting a dining facility, slightly injuring one person and causing minor building damage, American officials said. It was unclear how many of the other four shells launched in the attack landed inside the embassy compound, but the assault alarmed Washington and prompted debate over how to calibrate the response. For security reasons, neither Iraqi nor American military officials, nor the embassy staff in Baghdad, would discuss locations or other specifics of the attack. The Iraqi government moved quickly to condemn the assault and promised a vigorous investigation. “We denounce the continuation of these outlawed actions that have the goal of weakening the Iraqi state and violating its sovereignty and the sanctity of diplomatic missions on its soil,” Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said in a statement. He said Iraqi forces had been ordered to “search and investigate to prevent such attacks” and to arrest those who launched them. However, in a call with the Iraqi prime minister on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was “outraged” that groups that he described as armed by Iran were continuing to attack American bases and diplomatic posts in Iraq, according to the State Department’s spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said Mr. Abdul Mahdi committed to better protect United States facilities in Iraq, but Mr. Pompeo said the attacks displayed a failure to curb the armed groups. “We view last night’s attack on the embassy as an attempt to distract Iraqi and international attention away from the brutal suppression of peaceful Iraqi protesters by Iran and its proxies,” Ms. Ortagus said in a statement describing the call. The State Department was referring to recent moves by the Iraqi security forces to crack down on protesters who are demanding an end to corruption and the election of a new government. The security forces burned protesters’ tents and used tear gas and live fire to try to force them to flee in Baghdad, Basra and Nasiriya. A preliminary investigation found that the 120-millimeter mortar shells were launched on Sunday from the Buaytha area, in the south of Baghdad. During the 2007-8 surge of American troops, the area was a redoubt for Al Qaeda in Iraq, a predecessor to the Islamic State.  A senior Iraqi officer investigating the attack said that using coordinates for the flight path, he and his team had located the launchers. The use of mortars and the area from which they were fired, he said, led him to think that the attack could have been carried out by the Islamic State. Still, the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to journalists, said the weapons were common enough that he could not rule out a Shiite militia faction close to Iran as being responsible.  During the height of Iraq’s civil strife, between roughly 2005 and 2009, both Al Qaeda in Iraq and anti-American Shiite armed groups lobbed mortars at the Green Zone in an effort to hit the American Embassy. The prime minister’s statement, released within hours of the mortars landing in the embassy compound, appeared aimed at reassuring the Americans that the Iraqis were taking the attack seriously and would mount a vigorous response. The comments stand in stark contrast to the response both to the attack on a military base in Kirkuk, Iraq, at the end of December, which resulted in the death of an American contractor, and to the siege of the United States Embassy on Jan. 1. In those cases the government said relatively little, especially after the Kirkuk attack. By contrast, Mr. Abdul Mahdi used his statement on the mortar attack as a way to remind the public, which is divided about whether to have United States troops stay in the country, that using force now against the Americans would risk “dangerous consequences” that could damage Iraqi interests and “drag Iraq into a war.” The strikes come less than a month after the attack in Kirkuk, which set off a series of retaliatory responses that pushed the United States and Iran to the brink of war. The Americans accused Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia with close links to Iran, of responsibility in the Kirkuk attack. There has been no claim of responsibility for Sunday’s rocket attack. Notably, all of the armed groups known to have close ties to Iran went out of their way to deny responsibility and to condemn the attack as damaging to the Iraqi government at a time when it is trying to negotiate the withdrawal of American troops. The military commander for Asaib al-Haq, one of the groups with links to Iran, denied responsibility both on Asaib’s behalf and that of other similar armed factions, which call themselves the “Resistance Group.” “We stress that the recent rocket bombing against the evil embassy in Baghdad is not the action of the Iraqi resistance factions, because we have stressed earlier that the resistance factions will not target the embassies and the diplomatic missions in Iraq,” said Jawad Al-Tilaybawi, the commander of Asaib al-Haq. Similar comments were made by Kataib Hezbollah and the Badr Organization. While rocket fire in the Green Zone in Baghdad has been a regular occurrence in recent months, the rockets fired on Sunday and last week were more accurate, landing closer to the embassy, according to witnesses. Often in the past, the rockets have fallen in the Tigris River, or in the Green Zone but far from the embassy compound. Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","For the second time in a week, shelling targeted the American Embassy in Baghdad. The Iraqi government promised a strong response."
Iran Says Its Enriched Uranium Stockpile Is Far Beyond Allowed Amount,2020-01-25,By The Associated Press,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile has far exceeded the level allowed by its international nuclear deal, an aide to Iran’s nuclear chief said on Saturday. Ali Asghar Zarean said that Iran has stockpiled 1,200 kilograms, or about 2,600 pounds, which is well beyond what the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allowed. “Iran is increasing its stockpile of the enriched uranium with full speed,” he said. The claim has not been verified by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog. In November, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown to 372.3 kilograms (821 pounds) as of Nov. 3.

"After Losing His Legs to a Bomb, Afghan Veteran Is on a New Journey",2020-01-26,By David Zucchino and Fatima Faizi,"['BAMIAN, Afghanistan — When Mirza Hussain Haidari swung his white Toyota taxi into a police checkpoint, a startled officer immediately fixed on Mr. Haidari’s gear shift, wrapped in blue tape and attached to a metal contraption sprouting wires and cables. “What is this?” the officer demanded, clearly suspecting a jury-rigged bomb. “I was wounded in war,” Mr. Haidari explained. “This is the way I manage to drive.” Mr. Haidari, 25, lost both legs to a land mine five years ago, when he was in the Afghan Army. Now he earns his living in a taxi, which he has fitted with a homemade mechanism that allows him to drive with his hands — or what’s left of them. The mine also blew off four of the fingers on Mr. Haidari’s left hand, leaving only his thumb. His right hand is intact but damaged. Thousands of wounded combat veterans like Mr. Haidari have become fixtures in Afghan society. Some are objects of admiration, others of pity. On the streets, they limp on prosthetic legs or crutches. In hospitals or rehabilitation centers, they learn to walk or dress themselves again. Some are cared for by families. Others survive on military pensions. A few beg in the streets, or sell trinkets or phone cards. Mr. Haidari, 25, a calm man with a solemn demeanor, has chosen to resume his life in a very public way. He is a fixture in Bamian Province in central Afghanistan, hauling fares in his retrofitted Toyota, driving between his taxi rounds and his squat brick home in the hills. Sometimes people mock Mr. Haidari or recoil at the way he looks, he said. Some fares have abruptly climbed out of his taxi after realizing they were about to ride with a driver who had no legs. “Sometimes when people make fun of me, I wish I had been killed by the bomb, because it’s a lifetime torture,” he said, perched on a cushion in his home as he prepared for a day of driving. Mr. Haidari said he had been deeply hurt when no one from the army called to check on him after he was wounded. Since then, he said, he has received a small government stipend, which helped cover the costs of building his wheelchair-accessible home a year ago, but he still feels abandoned. “I served the Afghan Army and my country, but now I’m no one to them because I can’t do anything for them,” he said. “They don’t care that I lost my legs because of the war.” Even so, he is determined to persevere. When he saw a legless army veteran in Kabul using his hands to drive a retrofitted car, it inspired him to design a similar device. He said he took his hand-drawn plans to a mechanic in his hometown, Bamian, but the man refused to help, saying the task was impossible. But Mr. Haidari hectored him, and he relented. The two men rigged a contraption that lets Mr. Haidari guide the steering wheel with his intact right hand and the accelerator with his left thumb, which controls a lever. He also uses the thumb to apply the brakes, by pushing a blue-taped knob. The retrofit cost him 5,500 afghanis, or about $70. Mr. Haidari spent three years fighting the government before it supplied him with the motorized wheelchair. He also receives a portion of his soldier’s salary. He now ekes out a living, he said, but regrets that his 11-year-old brother has to work in a bakery rather than attend school because the family needs the income. Mr. Haidari lives with his brother, sister and mother. “When I was disabled, my family paid the price,” he said. “A single bomb ruined my life — and my family’s life.” But with the support of his family and friends, he said, he has found a measure of fulfillment in his post-military life. He finds solace behind the wheel of his taxi. He plays in a wheelchair basketball league and works out at a bodybuilding club to keep himself in shape. “Physically, I’m disabled, but mentally I’m O.K.,” he said. “I’ve lost my legs, but not my mind.” So Mr. Haidari plies the bumpy roads of Bamian in the snow, trolling for fares, watching the expressions on the faces of people who flag him down. Will they accept a ride or turn away? At the end of each day, he steers the taxi back up a paved road, then a dirt track, to his home atop a barren hillside. There, he opens the car door and pivots. In one fluid motion, he is out of the car and seated in his waiting wheelchair. Then he guides the chair up a concrete ramp to his front door, back to home and family. But even after five years, Mr. Haidari remained haunted by the memories of the morning when he led his squad on a patrol in Helmand Province, in southern Afghanistan, where the land mine awaited. “I’ve lost everything,” he said. “But still, I don’t regret joining the army. I served Afghanistan and fought for my motherland.” He paused, letting the memories wash over him. “I would never regret it,” he said finally. “But I sometimes wish the bomb had killed me.”']","Mirza Hussain Haidari now drives a taxi, modified with a device he designed himself. “I’ve lost my legs, but not my mind,” he said."
Iran Says Its Enriched Uranium Stockpile Is Far Beyond Allowed Amount,2020-01-25,By The Associated Press,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile has far exceeded the level allowed by its international nuclear deal, an aide to Iran’s nuclear chief said on Saturday. Ali Asghar Zarean said that Iran has stockpiled 1,200 kilograms, or about 2,600 pounds, which is well beyond what the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers allowed. “Iran is increasing its stockpile of the enriched uranium with full speed,” he said. The claim has not been verified by the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog. In November, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown to 372.3 kilograms (821 pounds) as of Nov. 3. The nuclear deal limited the stockpile to 202.8 kilograms (447 pounds).

"As Coronavirus Fears Intensify, Effectiveness of Quarantines Is Questioned",2020-01-26,"By Chris Buckley, Raymond Zhong, Denise Grady and Roni Caryn Rabin","['WUHAN, China — A top Chinese health official warned on Sunday that the spread of the dangerous new coronavirus, already extraordinarily rapid, is accelerating further, deepening global fears about an illness that has sickened more than 2,700 people worldwide and killed at least 80 people in China. The grim diagnosis came amid concerns that China’s efforts to contain the spread of the disease, despite a lockdown of unprecedented scope affecting 56 million people, may not only have come too late but could even make the situation worse, including by exacerbating shortages of medical supplies. Adding to the growing global alarm, people who are carrying the virus but not showing symptoms may still be able to infect others, according to the Chinese official, Ma Xiaowei, the director of China’s National Health Commission. Such asymptomatic transmissions would make the disease much more difficult to control, as seemingly healthy people travel and interact with others. “The epidemic is now entering a more serious and complex period,” Mr. Ma said during a Sunday news conference in Beijing. “It looks like it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.” China’s attempts to curb the disease’s spread — essentially cordoning off the major cities in the province of Hubei, including its capital, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people — are a “public health experiment, the scale of which has not been done before,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “Logistically, it’s stunning, and it was done so quickly.” Whether the lockdowns will succeed in stemming the spread of the virus is a matter of debate by experts in public health and epidemiology. Some said the lockdowns would help, at least in theory. “Anything that is done that increases social distancing can help decrease the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If you do it right, it’s not impossible it will have positive impact.” But doing it right at this scale has never been tried before anywhere in the world. “To put a ring around cities of this size and population is unprecedented,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan and author of the book “Quarantine.” Maintaining the lockdown will pose tremendous challenges, starting with the provision of food, fuel and medical care to millions of people. “It’s enormously difficult to do effectively, and also difficult to assess the effectiveness,” said Dr. Schaffner. Other experts were skeptical that the travel restrictions would prove at all effective because they had probably come too late and the barriers would prove too permeable. Five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, said the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang. It was a stunning disclosure that intensified questions about the government’s delayed response. “You can’t board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “It will get out; it always does.” In China, it was a weekend of grim new warnings about the little-understood virus and a rising tally of infections and deaths. The official number of confirmed infections across China jumped significantly within a span of 24 hours, building to 2,744 by Monday from around 1,975 the day before. Among the most recent announced fatalities from the coronavirus was an 88-year-old man in Shanghai — the first death to be reported in the commercial hub, and one likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s spread. New cases cropped up in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Orange County, Calif., bringing to five the number of confirmed cases in the United States. The virus had already been found in Thailand, France, Japan, South Korea, Australia and beyond. Epidemiologists at Imperial College London estimated that each case infected an average of between 1.5 and 3.5 other people in the early stages of the crisis. For seasonal flu, it’s about 1.3. That number could drop as the authorities take more stringent measures to halt the spread. But if it holds up, the number of infected could rise sharply. In Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, the streets were eerily quiet as the authorities had ordered people not to drive, forcing some to walk to hospitals. Mr. Zhou, the mayor, said that health officials were likely to confirm an additional 1,000 cases of the illness in the city. He said that the estimate was based on the assumption that around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases of the coronavirus would eventually test positive. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has promised drastic measures to contain the virus. In a signal of the gravity of the crisis, and its likely disruption to China’s short-term growth, the government announced on Monday that the annual weeklong Lunar New Year Holiday would be extended. For now, at least, many workers will get another three days off, and go back to work on Feb. 3. Even before that notice, Suzhou, a big manufacturing hub in eastern China, declared that factories there should not start back at work any earlier than Feb. 8. The national government on Sunday also banned the wildlife trade until the epidemic passes. The outbreak had drawn fresh attention to China’s animal markets, where the sale of exotic creatures has been linked to epidemiological risks. In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with nearly 300 deaths, more than any city in the world — worries about the spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong until further notice. Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city, already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests. Health officials in the United States, in what could turn out to be a positive development in stemming the disease, said there was no “clear evidence” that asymptomatic transmissions of the disease were happening. “We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively investigating that possibility.” Some global health experts said China’s focus, and resources, going forward should not be devoted to closing off cities. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, thought China’s approach to the crisis could easily “backfire,” comparing it to the so-called cordons sanitaires that were imposed to seal off swaths of West Africa during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic. Those cordons left people starving and spurred violent uprisings. Others routinely found ways to sneak around or through the boundaries. “It was a disaster,” Dr. Osterholm said. Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also expressed concern. “If you continue to quarantine more and more places in China, you’re going to start to really break normal societal interaction, normal movement of goods and people and medical supplies and food and medicine,” Dr. Inglesby said. “At a macro level, it seems to me that it’s more likely to be harmful than helpful in controlling the epidemic.” Instead, Dr. Inglesby, Dr. Osterholm and other health experts suggested China should concentrate on traditional public health measures that have stopped other outbreaks, like identifying and monitoring contacts and making sure medical care is available to everyone. Even as the highest echelons of China’s government mobilize to fight the illness, much of the task of preventing contagion still falls on local officials, who can be unsure of how to respond to crises and uneven about following through on policies. On Sunday in Wuhan, for example, police officers were flummoxed by new restrictions on driving within the city limits. First, the city authorities said that most cars should stay off the roads, and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis would be on call to deliver food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be notified by text message if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive the text messages on Sunday. “My understanding,” one police officer said, “is that you can drive in your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.” In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on, more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it. For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan officials, who many believe have mishandled the epidemic. Health experts said the government’s ability to keep the trust of the public was a key element in any successful quarantine, and never easy to do. Dr. Inglesby said that previous, much smaller scale lockdown efforts — including closing off the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak 17 years ago — show that residents may become fearful and lose confidence in the government. “You need people to willingly present themselves for diagnosis,” he said. “If they don’t understand what the government’s doing or they feel in some way their bond with the government has been broken, that’s another key process that’s being interrupted by the quarantine.” For now, in Wuhan, the restrictions seem to be mostly accepted with the same stoic fortitude that many residents showed over the past several days as the city imposed bans on outbound travel for all but a select few. That mood could shift, however, if, for example, food prices rise.  “Now is not the time for recriminations,” said Li Xiandu, a retired business manager. “The local government wasn’t forthcoming with information and didn’t take vigorous enough measures. But we need to get through this first, and then we can assign blame.” While the government has pledged to build at least two new hospitals with thousands of beds in Wuhan — and to do so in just a few days — the city’s existing hospitals remain intensely crowded, a condition that does not bode well for stopping the disease. “If you wanted to create the perfect mixing vessel for a coronavirus,” Dr. Osterholm said, “you’d create the emergency rooms in Wuhan right now.” Chris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, Raymond Zhong from Shanghai, and Denise Grady and Roni Caryn Rabin from New York.

Brazil Under Bolsonaro Has Message for Teenagers: Save Sex for Marriage,2020-01-26,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s far-right government has a message for adolescents as the nation grapples with a stubbornly high teenage pregnancy rate and rising H.I.V. infections: Save sex for marriage. “Our young people, by and large, are having sex as a result of social pressure,” Damares Alves, the minister of human rights, family and women, said recently as she encouraged abstinence. “You can go to a party and have lots of fun without having sex.” To formulate her policy, Ms. Alves has made clear she consulted closely with the team behind a campaign called “I Chose to Wait,” started by evangelical pastors with a large social media following. In doing so, she has incited a heated debate about reproductive rights and sex education in Latin America’s largest nation. Critics say the government’s new emphasis on abstinence blurs the line between church and state and could lead young people to make poorly informed decisions about sex that may be detrimental to their health. “We have 20 years of public health studies all around the world that show not only that abstinence policies are ineffective but that they have nefarious consequences when it comes to teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,” said Debora Diniz, a Brazilian law professor and reproductive rights activist. “We’re making public policy based on religious beliefs.” The government’s emphasis on abstinence follows a presidential campaign in 2018 during which sex and sexuality was a dominant theme. President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies accused their leftist rivals of encouraging teenagers to have sex at a young age. He also condemned a school campaign against homophobia that was designed, but never implemented, by his leftist predecessors. He called it a “gay kit” intended to “pervert” students. His message was powerfully effective at mobilizing evangelical voters, a growing and politically powerful constituency in Brazil. The government’s abstinence campaign is being led by Ms. Alves, an evangelical pastor who calls herself “extremely Christian” and is among Mr. Bolsonaro’s most popular and visible cabinet members. Experts say the campaign could undermine the progress Brazil has made in curbing teen pregnancy. The country’s teenage pregnancy rate, which peaked in the 1990s at about 80 per 1,000 births, followed the global downward trend in recent decades, but remains stubbornly high, at about 62 per 1,000 births, well above the global average of 44 per 1,000, according to a United Nations report issued last year. The rate in the United States was 18 per 1,000 in 2017. Another pressing health care challenge that could be adversely affected by the campaign is curbing H.I.V.’s spread. Brazil earned global accolades for its maverick efforts to fight the disease at the beginning of this century, including ignoring global patents to make generic versions of lifesaving medicine. But in recent years, the virus has been spreading at a rate experts call alarming. In 2018, there were 43,941 new cases reported, according to Brazil’s health ministry, a 41 percent increase compared to the number of cases recorded in 2014. Ms. Alves, who did not respond to a request for an interview, defended her ministry’s abstinence campaign in a recent essay published in the newspaper Folha de São Paulo, stressing that it would complement, rather than replace, existing initiatives, which include providing access to contraceptives and condoms. “We’re working across ministries to offer additional material as people make decisions,” she wrote, adding that the government did not wish “to impose, but rather to inform, which strengthens autonomy.” Laryssa Pereira de Souza, 15, who had a baby last year, said the abstinence message could conceivably resonate with evangelical teens, but she predicted it would be dismissed by most adolescents. Laryssa, raised in a conservative evangelical family in Rio de Janeiro, struggled to tally all her classmates who had children. “Almost all my friends at school got pregnant,” she said while bouncing her 7-month-old son, Arthur Bernardo, on her lap. Like many girls her age, Laryssa took advantage of home schooling programs that allow teenage mothers to stay enrolled in classes. “Here, things are very liberal,” she said. “What we need is better access to pills and those things,” she added, referring to birth control. Ms. Alves has provided few details about the budget and scope of the abstinence campaign, which is to be rolled out next month. In defending the approach, Ms. Alves said abstinence campaigns in the United States have been effective. Leslie Kantor, a professor at the School of Public Health at Rutgers University, and a leading expert on teen pregnancy, said the minister’s claim is demonstrably untrue based on the findings of dozens of studies on the issue, which has been the subject of a fierce political fight in the United States since the 1980s. Sex education programs that emphasized abstinence, Dr. Kantor said, have tended to exclude information pertinent to gay and bisexual people and provided misleading information about the efficacy of condoms and contraceptives. She said the idea of limiting, or delaying, sex education might seem politically expedient, but is ultimately a bad idea. “The risk is people are not going to get sex education later on,” she said. “If you don’t get it in school, you’re not going to get it at the altar either.” The abstinence campaign is being rolled out at a time when information about sex education and reproductive rights is being restricted in Brazil. Last year, Mr. Bolsonaro asked the Health Ministry to recall a reproductive health pamphlet that included details of human anatomy, which the president deemed improper for children. And also last year, the country’s main internet providers began blocking access to the website of Women on Waves, an abortion rights organization that provides information about reproductive health and in some cases makes abortion pills available to women in countries where their use is illegal. Internet providers said they blocked the website in response to a judicial order. They refused to say who sought the order and to identify the judge who issued it. Rebecca Gomperts, an Amsterdam-based physician who founded Women on Waves, said the group’s website still receives more visits from users in Brazil than any other country. During a recent week, she said, 78,000 people in the country managed to access the site despite the block. Dr. Gomperts said that is a sign that women in Brazil — where abortion is illegal with a few exceptions, including cases of rape — are in dire need of reliable reproductive health information. The only other countries where internet providers have blocked access to Women on Waves are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and South Korea, Dr. Gomperts said. Dr. Gomperts said she was baffled by the censorship in Brazil, which has strong protections for freedom of information. “Brazil is a huge country and there is a huge need,” she said. “If you are censoring scientifically accurate information about best medical practices, which is what we’re providing, it means you are leaving information that may not be correct and that may be harmful.”']","Brazil’s minister for women and families, an evangelical pastor, formulated a new abstinence campaign in consultation with a religious group.

"More U.S. Coronavirus Cases Emerge, as China’s Death Toll Rises",2020-01-26,By The New York Times,"[' This briefing has ended. Read about developments our live coronavirus outbreak coverage here.   The mayor of Wuhan, which is at the center of the viral outbreak, said on Sunday that there could be about 1,000 more confirmed cases of the mysterious illness in the city — a sign that China’s monumental efforts to halt the disease may only just be starting. In a news conference, the mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said that the estimate was based on the assumption that around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases of the coronavirus would eventually test positive for the disease. The youngest confirmed case involved a 9-month-old girl in Beijing, according to The People’s Daily, a state newspaper. Mr. Zhou also said that five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, leaving nine million people still living there.  As of Monday morning, the official count of confirmed cases across China stood at 2,744. The authorities in Hubei Province put the death toll at 76 there, bumping the overall deaths to at least 80. On Sunday China announced 15 more deaths from the new coronavirus, including one in Shanghai, the first reported there. Thirteen deaths were announced in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and one in Henan Province. Across the country, 688 new cases were diagnosed on Saturday, the government said early Sunday. Deaths from the coronavirus had previously been reported outside of Hubei. But the death in Shanghai, which is among China’s most populous cities and a major commercial hub, is likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s spread. Shanghai’s municipal health commission said on Sunday that the patient who died was an 88-year-old man. Three more cases of the coronavirus were reported on Sunday in the United States, two in California and one in Arizona, bringing the country’s total to five, according to the C.D.C. All three had recently been in Wuhan, health officials said. The three patients were all being kept in isolation. [Read: U.K. businessman linked to coronavirus cluster comes forward.] A patient in Los Angeles County passed through Los Angeles International Airport from Wuhan on the way to a vacation elsewhere, Barbara Ferrer, the director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said at a news conference. The traveler returned to LAX on Jan. 22, wearing a mask, and approached airport staff about possibly having the virus. The other California patient, in neighboring Orange County, was identified by the county health agency as a traveler from Wuhan. The patient in Maricopa County in Arizona is an adult member of the Arizona State University community, health officials said. Other cases have been found in Washington State and Chicago. The C.D.C. has sent teams to each of the states to help trace and follow up on contacts of the infected patients. The C.D.C. said that just over 100 “patients under investigation” from 26 states were being monitored because they had traveled to Wuhan, or had contact with patients, and had symptoms like fever, cough or shortness of breath that could be caused by the virus. So far, 25 of those under investigation have tested negative for the virus. The risk to the general public is considered low, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Sunday at a news briefing. “But the threat is serious,” she said. The C.D.C. is urging the public to get flu shots, to help reduce the number of people seeking treatment for symptoms that might be mistaken for the new coronavirus. The agency is also preparing test kits to be sent to state health departments so that they can test for the virus instead of having to send samples to the C.D.C. for testing, but it will be a few more weeks before the kits are ready, Dr. Messonnier said. The head of China’s National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, warned on Sunday that people who carried the disease but did not show flu symptoms could still infect others. That would be a major difference between the new virus and SARS, a coronavirus that spread in China and around the world nearly two decades ago, killing 800 people. “The epidemic has entered a more serious and complex period,” said Dr. Ma, the director of China’s National Health Commission. He also said on Sunday that the new coronavirus’s incubation period was about 10 to 14 days, and that the period is contagious. “There have been mild cases where observation has shown that the patients were contagious during the incubation period. The incubation period is around 10 days,” he said. “The shortest time before the disease’s onset was one day. The longest was 14 days. This is very different from SARS.” The rate of the current epidemic is accelerating, he added, and is “likely to continue for some time.” A study by the medical journal The Lancet, published on Friday, had raised concerns that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flulike symptoms. Health officials in the United States expressed some caution on Sunday. “We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr. Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively investigating that possibility.” Spread of the virus by people with no symptoms would make the disease harder to control — if that really is occurring, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director who is now president of Resolve to Save Lives, a public health organization. “We don’t know,” he said. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he had seen no data to indicate that people with no symptoms were contagious. “We surely haven’t seen that with any of the other coronaviruses, MERS or SARS,” Dr. Osterholm said. “When we could document transmission, patients were ill.” He added, “Mother Nature is throwing us a curveball with this outbreak, but we shouldn’t accept every claim like this until we see the data.” Dr. Julie Gerberding, another former C.D.C. director and now chief patient officer at Merck, said the spread by asymptomatic people was not impossible. Seemingly asymptomatic people could have the sniffles, she said, which might go unnoticed but spread the virus. “The U.S. has faced multiple pandemics before,” Dr. Messonnier said. “We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I hope it’s not.” If people with no signs or symptoms of illness can spread the infection, that “offers many more opportunities for spread, and increases the difficulty of curtailing the spread greatly, because you can’t just focus on sick individuals,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “If an exposed person becomes contagious before they become sick, you can almost think of them as a secret spreader,” he said. “They’re healthy. Nobody suspects they’re sick. Nobody’s avoiding them, and they’re not staying home with their illness.” He added: “SARS was largely transmitted from people who were already sick. Ebola was the same. If you were exposed, you were of no risk to anyone until you became sick, and even in the early day or two or three of illness you were not of risk to anyone.” In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with nearly 300 deaths — worries about the spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong until further notice. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents, according to a government statement. Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city, already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests. Its efforts to contain the virus have been met with resistance. A plan to convert an unused public housing block into a quarantine site incited protests on Sunday, with demonstrators setting fires in the lobbies of two of the buildings. The government condemned the fires set at the public housing complex, in Hong Kong’s New Territories. But it also backed away from its plan to use the buildings for quarantine, saying that it would use government-owned sites first. The unrest came a day after Carrie Lam, the leader of the semiautonomous territory, declared a health emergency and said Hong Kong schools would be closed until February. She also said trains and flights between Wuhan and Hong Kong would be halted. Calls had circulated in the past week for new arrivals from the mainland to be barred. Mrs. Lam initially said that would be “inappropriate and impractical” but on Sunday the government changed course on residents of Hubei Province. The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Saturday, is usually a peak travel period in China. CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, reported that the State Council would extend the holiday three days, until Feb. 2. That would keep people away from workplaces, schools and other public buildings for a longer period. Fears about the virus are affecting tourism in the city, whose economy depends significantly on money spent by visitors at malls, hotels and restaurants, and which is now in a recession. Two of Hong Kong’s biggest attractions, Disneyland and Ocean Park, said on Sunday that they were closing until further notice. A notice on Hong Kong Disneyland’s website called it a “precautionary measure.” Shanghai’s Disneyland park had earlier been shut indefinitely. China said on Saturday that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for its citizens headed overseas starting on Monday. China has banned the wildlife trade nationwide until the epidemic passes, three government departments said on Sunday. The outbreak has drawn fresh attention to China’s animal markets, where the sale of exotic wildlife has been linked to epidemiological risks. The Wuhan virus is believed to have spread from one such market in the city. The SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago was also traced back to the wildlife trade. A statement issued by China’s markets regulator, agriculture ministry and forestry bureau said that all transactions of wildlife would be forbidden immediately in wholesale markets, supermarkets, restaurants and e-commerce platforms. It also encouraged consumers to understand the health risks of eating wild animals. The consumption of exotic creatures has been driven partly by beliefs about their supposed health benefits, although such ideas are starting to lose their grip, particularly on younger people. A popular travel blogger, Wang Mengyun, apologized recently for eating bat soup in a video from a few years ago. Ms. Wang, who has more than two million followers on the social platform Weibo, said that she had been unaware of the health risks of eating bats when she made the video in the Pacific island nation of Palau. She said she had been trying to highlight the local cuisine. In her post, Ms. Wang emphasized that the bat had been locally raised and was not wild. “Many countries around the world eat these,” she wrote. Her post has since been deleted. The United States government offered details on a plan to evacuate American diplomats and other citizens from Wuhan, saying on Sunday that it was arranging a flight to leave Tuesday bound for San Francisco. The State Department has ordered all American employees at the United States Consulate in Wuhan to leave the city. In an email sent on Sunday to Americans living in China, the department asked all other citizens who wanted a spot on the plane to contact the embassy. Capacity will be “extremely limited,” the message said, and priority will be given to people at greater risk from the virus. It is unclear who will fall into that category. Jonny Dangerfield, 30, an American who went to Wuhan to celebrate the Lunar New Year with his wife and children, said he hoped his family might be given priority because his three children are all under 5. “If it weren’t for them, we maybe would not have much worry at all,” Mr. Dangerfield, who works in finance in Phoenix and whose in-laws live in Wuhan, said in a telephone interview.  “Just to keep ourselves sane,” he said, “we have low expectations about getting on that plane.” Around the world, health officials worked to minimize the risks for their citizens. France’s health minister, Agnes Buzyn, said Sunday that several hundred natives of France in the Wuhan area would be flown home in the middle of the week but would have to undergo 14 days in quarantine. The Russian Embassy was also working with the Chinese authorities to evacuate Russian citizens from the area, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan told reporters on Sunday that his government would help repatriate all citizens wishing to leave Wuhan, “by charter planes and all other means.” Public health officials in Toronto on Saturday night announced test results showing that Canada had its first “presumptive” case of the coronavirus. Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario’s associate chief medical officer of health, said the patient was a man in his 50s who returned to Toronto on Jan. 22 after visiting Wuhan. The next day, he was admitted to a hospital with a respiratory infection. Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, said that additional tests were expected to confirm that the man, who was in stable condition, had been infected with the virus. Taiwan, which on Sunday confirmed its fourth case, said it would bar all visitors from Hubei Province. Taiwan’s government also said it would suspend applications from Chinese citizens for travel permits except in special cases, such as disease control or humanitarian medical assistance. Macau announced that starting from Monday, it would restrict travelers from Wuhan. Despite the rising number of coronavirus cases and the dozens of deaths, public health experts say there is no cause for panic. The common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone. Yet the unknowns around the current outbreak are causing widespread worry. And there are signs that this outbreak could be more serious than the common flu. Other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the flu, and have led to global outbreaks. In addition, conclusive evidence about how this outbreak started is lacking. Although officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some who have fallen ill never visited it. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations about which animals may have transmitted the virus to humans. China’s record doesn’t help. During the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, officials covered up the extent of the crisis, delaying the response. The Chinese government has promised far more transparency this time, and the World Health Organization has praised its cooperation with scientists. But mistrust of the local and national authorities, compounded by missteps and mistakes in handling the illness, runs deep. Though China’s initial delay in reporting cases of the new virus may suggest a cover-up, experts see something more worrying: weaknesses at the heart of the Chinese political system. In a sign that the central government is bolstering its effort to contain the outbreak, China’s National Health Commission said it would send 1,230 medical experts to Wuhan to assist in treatment. The army has sent 450 other people from three military medical universities, according to a state media article that the health commission shared on its website. And the air force sent military transport aircraft to the cities of Shanghai, Xi’an and Chongqing to pick up emergency airlifts of medical teams and supplies for Wuhan. In Wuhan, health officials said that they would assign 24 hospitals to treat potential coronavirus patients only, according to People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main newspaper. National officials had called for patients to be concentrated in specialized hospitals, and new hospitals were being built specifically to treat patients. A top Chinese official warned on Sunday that the nation needs many more masks and protective suits than it can currently produce. His remarks, in a news conference, came as more local governments around the country mandated that citizens wear masks in public as the coronavirus outbreak grows. On Sunday, the government in Guangdong, China’s most populous province, became the latest to require people to wear masks in public. Wang Jiangping, China’s vice minister of industry and information technology, said that Hubei Province alone needed 100,000 protective suits a day to fight the illness, but that Chinese manufacturers could supply only 30,000 suits each day. The Lunar New Year holiday is also making it hard for factories to produce at full capacity, Mr. Wang said. Roads were quiet. Where cars, trucks and motorbikes once roared and honked, there was the sound of birds tweeting and dogs barking. Shoppers mostly hauled their baskets home by foot or on bicycle. Wuhan, the city at the center of China’s viral outbreak, has been subdued since the government put it under a smothering net of travel restrictions on Thursday. It was even quieter on Sunday, after the city announced heavy restrictions on the use of cars, even within the urban limits. But along with general silence, there was confusion. The announcements about which vehicles were allowed on the roads were murky, leaving even police officers befuddled. First, the Wuhan authorities said that most cars should stay off the roads and that a fleet of 6,000 taxis would be on call to transport people in need and deliver food and medicine. Then, the authorities said drivers would be notified by text message if they had to stay off the roads. Nobody seemed to receive text messages on Sunday. “My understanding,” a police officer said, “is that you can drive in your district if you don’t get a text message telling you that you can’t. But you should check that with the transport authorities.” In the end, most drivers stayed off the streets. But as the day went on, more ventured out, and the police did not seem to do much about it. For some residents, it was another exasperating fumble by Wuhan officials who many believe have mishandled the epidemic. But most seemed to accept the restrictions with the same stoicism that many have shown since the city imposed bans on leaving for all but a select few. On Sunday morning, many groceries in Wuhan were crowded with residents stocking up, especially on fresh vegetables, fruit and meat, in case even tighter rules might be announced that impeded food supplies or that deterred them from leaving home. “Because it’s the New Year, a lot of stores close anyway, and now we have the disease and now this,” said Ai Wenjun, who had lined up to pay for a basket of turnips, cabbage and beans. “Each extra thing makes me worry more.” So far, shops still have supplies, though some residents said prices had risen despite government warnings to keep them steady. “If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips’ price. “Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,” Mr. Zuo said. “Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won’t be easy — all those road checks.” For now, the Wuhan city authorities have the benefit of a population willing to endure restrictions to slow the epidemic. But that mood could shift if the measures hamper food supplies and worsen medical shortages. “Now is not the time for recriminations,” said Li Xiandu, a retired business manager. “The local government wasn’t forthcoming with information and didn’t take vigorous enough measures. But we need to get through this first, and then we can assign blame.” Reporting was contributed by Raymond Zhong, Chris Buckley, Motoko Rich, Austin Ramzy, Denise Grady, Roni Rabin, Ezra Cheung, Max Fisher, Vivian Wang, Ian Austen, Josh Keller, Yonette Joseph, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Aurelien Breeden.

"More U.S. Coronavirus Cases Emerge, as China’s Death Toll Rises",2020-01-26,By The New York Times,"[' This briefing has ended. Read about developments our live coronavirus outbreak coverage here.   The mayor of Wuhan, which is at the center of the viral outbreak, said on Sunday that there could be about 1,000 more confirmed cases of the mysterious illness in the city — a sign that China’s monumental efforts to halt the disease may only just be starting. In a news conference, the mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said that the estimate was based on the assumption that around half of the city’s nearly 3,000 suspected cases of the coronavirus would eventually test positive for the disease. The youngest confirmed case involved a 9-month-old girl in Beijing, according to The People’s Daily, a state newspaper. Mr. Zhou also said that five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, leaving nine million people still living there.  As of Monday morning, the official count of confirmed cases across China stood at 2,744. The authorities in Hubei Province put the death toll at 76 there, bumping the overall deaths to at least 80. On Sunday China announced 15 more deaths from the new coronavirus, including one in Shanghai, the first reported there. Thirteen deaths were announced in Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, and one in Henan Province. Across the country, 688 new cases were diagnosed on Saturday, the government said early Sunday. Deaths from the coronavirus had previously been reported outside of Hubei. But the death in Shanghai, which is among China’s most populous cities and a major commercial hub, is likely to fuel anxieties about the disease’s spread. Shanghai’s municipal health commission said on Sunday that the patient who died was an 88-year-old man. Three more cases of the coronavirus were reported on Sunday in the United States, two in California and one in Arizona, bringing the country’s total to five, according to the C.D.C. All three had recently been in Wuhan, health officials said. The three patients were all being kept in isolation. [Read: U.K. businessman linked to coronavirus cluster comes forward.] A patient in Los Angeles County passed through Los Angeles International Airport from Wuhan on the way to a vacation elsewhere, Barbara Ferrer, the director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said at a news conference. The traveler returned to LAX on Jan. 22, wearing a mask, and approached airport staff about possibly having the virus. The other California patient, in neighboring Orange County, was identified by the county health agency as a traveler from Wuhan. The patient in Maricopa County in Arizona is an adult member of the Arizona State University community, health officials said. Other cases have been found in Washington State and Chicago. The C.D.C. has sent teams to each of the states to help trace and follow up on contacts of the infected patients. The C.D.C. said that just over 100 “patients under investigation” from 26 states were being monitored because they had traveled to Wuhan, or had contact with patients, and had symptoms like fever, cough or shortness of breath that could be caused by the virus. So far, 25 of those under investigation have tested negative for the virus. The risk to the general public is considered low, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Sunday at a news briefing. “But the threat is serious,” she said. The C.D.C. is urging the public to get flu shots, to help reduce the number of people seeking treatment for symptoms that might be mistaken for the new coronavirus. The agency is also preparing test kits to be sent to state health departments so that they can test for the virus instead of having to send samples to the C.D.C. for testing, but it will be a few more weeks before the kits are ready, Dr. Messonnier said. The head of China’s National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, warned on Sunday that people who carried the disease but did not show flu symptoms could still infect others. That would be a major difference between the new virus and SARS, a coronavirus that spread in China and around the world nearly two decades ago, killing 800 people. “The epidemic has entered a more serious and complex period,” said Dr. Ma, the director of China’s National Health Commission. He also said on Sunday that the new coronavirus’s incubation period was about 10 to 14 days, and that the period is contagious. “There have been mild cases where observation has shown that the patients were contagious during the incubation period. The incubation period is around 10 days,” he said. “The shortest time before the disease’s onset was one day. The longest was 14 days. This is very different from SARS.” The rate of the current epidemic is accelerating, he added, and is “likely to continue for some time.” A study by the medical journal The Lancet, published on Friday, had raised concerns that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flulike symptoms. Health officials in the United States expressed some caution on Sunday. “We at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t have any clear evidence of patients’ being infectious before symptom onset,” Dr. Messonnier of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said at a news briefing on Sunday. “We are actively investigating that possibility.” Spread of the virus by people with no symptoms would make the disease harder to control — if that really is occurring, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director who is now president of Resolve to Save Lives, a public health organization. “We don’t know,” he said. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he had seen no data to indicate that people with no symptoms were contagious. “We surely haven’t seen that with any of the other coronaviruses, MERS or SARS,” Dr. Osterholm said. “When we could document transmission, patients were ill.” He added, “Mother Nature is throwing us a curveball with this outbreak, but we shouldn’t accept every claim like this until we see the data.” Dr. Julie Gerberding, another former C.D.C. director and now chief patient officer at Merck, said the spread by asymptomatic people was not impossible. Seemingly asymptomatic people could have the sniffles, she said, which might go unnoticed but spread the virus. “The U.S. has faced multiple pandemics before,” Dr. Messonnier said. “We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I hope it’s not.” If people with no signs or symptoms of illness can spread the infection, that “offers many more opportunities for spread, and increases the difficulty of curtailing the spread greatly, because you can’t just focus on sick individuals,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “If an exposed person becomes contagious before they become sick, you can almost think of them as a secret spreader,” he said. “They’re healthy. Nobody suspects they’re sick. Nobody’s avoiding them, and they’re not staying home with their illness.” He added: “SARS was largely transmitted from people who were already sick. Ebola was the same. If you were exposed, you were of no risk to anyone until you became sick, and even in the early day or two or three of illness you were not of risk to anyone.” In Hong Kong — which was badly hit by the SARS coronavirus in 2003, with nearly 300 deaths — worries about the spread of infectious diseases run deep. On Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, and people who had been to the province in the past 14 days from entering Hong Kong until further notice. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents, according to a government statement. Six cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in the city, already hobbled by months of antigovernment protests. Its efforts to contain the virus have been met with resistance. A plan to convert an unused public housing block into a quarantine site incited protests on Sunday, with demonstrators setting fires in the lobbies of two of the buildings. The government condemned the fires set at the public housing complex, in Hong Kong’s New Territories. But it also backed away from its plan to use the buildings for quarantine, saying that it would use government-owned sites first. The unrest came a day after Carrie Lam, the leader of the semiautonomous territory, declared a health emergency and said Hong Kong schools would be closed until February. She also said trains and flights between Wuhan and Hong Kong would be halted. Calls had circulated in the past week for new arrivals from the mainland to be barred. Mrs. Lam initially said that would be “inappropriate and impractical” but on Sunday the government changed course on residents of Hubei Province. The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Saturday, is usually a peak travel period in China. CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, reported that the State Council would extend the holiday three days, until Feb. 2. That would keep people away from workplaces, schools and other public buildings for a longer period. Fears about the virus are affecting tourism in the city, whose economy depends significantly on money spent by visitors at malls, hotels and restaurants, and which is now in a recession. Two of Hong Kong’s biggest attractions, Disneyland and Ocean Park, said on Sunday that they were closing until further notice. A notice on Hong Kong Disneyland’s website called it a “precautionary measure.” Shanghai’s Disneyland park had earlier been shut indefinitely. China said on Saturday that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for its citizens headed overseas starting on Monday. China has banned the wildlife trade nationwide until the epidemic passes, three government departments said on Sunday. The outbreak has drawn fresh attention to China’s animal markets, where the sale of exotic wildlife has been linked to epidemiological risks. The Wuhan virus is believed to have spread from one such market in the city. The SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago was also traced back to the wildlife trade. A statement issued by China’s markets regulator, agriculture ministry and forestry bureau said that all transactions of wildlife would be forbidden immediately in wholesale markets, supermarkets, restaurants and e-commerce platforms. It also encouraged consumers to understand the health risks of eating wild animals.

A popular travel blogger, Wang Mengyun, apologized recently for eating bat soup in a video from a few years ago. Ms. Wang, who has more than two million followers on the social platform Weibo, said that she had been unaware of the health risks of eating bats when she made the video in the Pacific island nation of Palau.

Alarm Grows as Markets Tumble and Death Toll Rises,2020-01-27,By The New York Times,"['This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in our live coronavirus outbreak coverage here. An outbreak of a new coronavirus that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan has already killed at least 106 people in China, according to data released early Tuesday. Infections have been confirmed in many other countries. But of the 4,500 people who have so far contracted the virus, the vast majority live in China. ◆ All but a small handful of those deaths were in the central province of Hubei, the center of the outbreak. ◆ Officials in the capital, Beijing, which has a population of about 21 million, announced the first death in the city from coronavirus on Monday. The patient, a 50-year-old man, had traveled to Wuhan on Jan. 8 and developed a fever after returning to Beijing a week later. He was diagnosed on Jan. 22 and died of respiratory failure, the Beijing Municipal Health Commission announced. ◆ Across China there have been more than 4,500 confirmed cases. The youngest confirmed case is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. ◆ Thailand and Hong Kong have each reported eight cases of infection; the United States, Taiwan, Australia and Macau have five each; Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; France has three; Canada and Vietnam have two; and Nepal, Cambodia and Germany each have one. ◆ There have been no deaths from the virus reported outside China. Stocks tumbled and oil prices fell on Monday as the virus’s spread worried investors around the globe. The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit. It was the sharpest decline since Oct. 2, when the trade war was fanning fears of a slowdown. American Airlines dropped more than 4 percent in early trading, and Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in Macau, a special administrative region of China and a gambling haven for Chinese high rollers, dropped more than 7 percent. Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for the holiday, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index also sank 2 percent. The price of oil dropped, on fears that demand could slip. China’s currency also fell, while investors moved into safe havens like gold. China’s economy, which is experiencing its worst slowdown in nearly three decades, is already hurting from the impact of the outbreak, and there are fears that consumer spending will go down as more residents stay home over the Lunar New Year. American health officials in Washington issued new guidance for travelers late Monday afternoon, recommending that they avoid all nonessential trips to China. The warning, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, notes that transportation in and out of Hubei Province may be restricted and that there is “limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.” Health officials also counseled travelers in China to avoid contact with sick people, animal markets and uncooked meats, and to talk to their health care provider and wash hands frequently. Some 110 patients in 26 states are being evaluated for infection with the Wuhan coronavirus, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday. Five of the 110 have tested positive so far, and 32 have tested negative. “That is a cumulative number and will only increase,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. At the moment, the risk of infection in the United States is low. But Dr. Messonnier cautioned that information about the outbreak is changing rapidly, and the C.D.C.’s response and guidance are constantly revised. The C.D.C. continues to screen passengers arriving in the United States whose travel originated in Wuhan. Officials are considering broadening the effort and revising official guidance on travel to the region, Dr. Messonnier said. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, has arrived in Beijing to “understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak,” he said in a tweet. The city’s top health official, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said that it was only a matter of time before someone in the city tests positive for the virus. Hospitals have been on the lookout for patients with recent travel involving Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus is believed to have originated. And they have urged anyone who recently traveled there — or who have been in contact with someone who has — to quickly seek medical care if they have any respiratory or flulike symptoms. So far, of nine patients for whom New York State officials have sought testing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, four were found not to have the virus, and the tests involving the other five are pending, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday in a statement. When the first case in New York does arrive, health officials said, that patient may end up in a biocontainment unit in Bellevue Hospital or sent home to ride out the illness in their bedroom. That will depend largely on how sick they are, public health officials say. Health officials identified a “presumptive” second case of the new virus: the wife of the first identified case, a man who was hospitalized on Jan. 23. The couple had returned to Toronto after visiting Wuhan a day earlier. The woman’s symptoms were not severe enough to require hospitalization, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, the province’s associate chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference. She was in isolation at home. The man is in his 50s and is now in stable condition. Laboratory tests confirmed that he was infected with the new coronavirus, and tests are pending for his wife, officials said. Health officials are now tracking down people who sat near the couple on a flight to Toronto from Guangzhou, and questioning the travel history of people seeking medical help for respiratory problems around Ontario, Dr. Yaffe said. The Chinese government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But criticism on social media over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been difficult to contain. Some critics of the government have found clever ways to dodge censors, such as referring to Xi Jinping as “Trump” or comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe. The vitriol has been most intense in Hubei, the home province of Wuhan. After the provincial governor, Wang Xiaodong, gave a news briefing on Sunday, online commenters mocked Mr. Wang for misstating the number of face masks that the province could produce. They also circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask. Another wore his mask upside down, and Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all. The Chinese health care system strains to serve patients even under normal circumstances. Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China — like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in nearby rural areas. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said China had invested a lot in building infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases. “But they apparently didn’t anticipate something so sudden, so acute, and so tremendous,” he said. China’s efforts to contain the spread of the disease by keeping tens of millions of people corralled in the major cities in Hubei Province have drawn skepticism from some experts in public health and epidemiology. The lockdown will pose tremendous challenges, starting with getting food, fuel and medical care to those affected. “At this stage of the outbreak, the things that make the most difference are finding people, diagnosing people, and getting them isolated,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, an infectious diseases specialist and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “If you isolate the city, then my question and my concern is that you’re making it harder in a number of ways to do those things you need to do,” including getting sick people to the hospital and getting supplies into medical facilities, he said. Other experts said that the travel restrictions had probably come too late and that the barriers would prove too permeable. Five million people had left Wuhan before travel out of the city was restricted, said the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang. “You can’t board up a germ,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. “A novel infection will spread.” Some experts, however, said the lockdowns could help, at least in theory. “Anything that is done that increases social distancing can help decrease the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If you do it right, it’s not impossible it will have positive impact.” Hospital workers in Hong Kong are trying to prepare for an outbreak of coronavirus cases — with memories of the SARS epidemic of the early 2000s still fresh. In the past week, doctors and nurses have drawn straws to determine when they would work in coronavirus isolation wards for six-week shifts. A hospital rearranged its cafeteria so that all tables faced the walls, a precaution from the SARS era to prevent employees from infecting each other during their meals. The SARS outbreak killed eight medical workers in the city. Some still suffer from lung damage 17 years later. Many hospital workers are calling for stricter border checks as Lunar New Year holidays come to a close this week, and a wave of visitors and residents are expected to return from the mainland. A new union, HA Employees Alliance, threatened to go on strike if the government did not close its borders to the mainland. Arisina Ma, the president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, called for stricter border checks, and for possibly requiring visitors and residents to stay home for 14 days, the incubation period for the disease, after returning from the mainland. “We are waiting for the worst to come,” she added. “Of course we will try to stop it but I am not sure if our government is efficient and determined enough to stop the worst to come.” At the same time, the city’s hospitals are still reeling from the anti-government protests that flooded their wards with patients over the past seven months. Early Monday morning, hours after protesters set fire to unused public housing units designated to be medical quarantine areas, a handmade bomb exploded inside a hospital toilet cubicle, a police official said. The two small explosions filled the emergency ward with smoke but caused no injuries. Wuhan’s top government and Communist Party officials offered to step down on Monday amid growing criticism in the city that the local authorities’ response to the outbreak was too slow. Mayor Zhou Xianwang said in an interview with the state broadcaster CCTV that he and Ma Guoqiang, the city’s party secretary, would take responsibility for the crisis and resign to “appease public indignation.” “Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is conducive to the control of the disease and to the people’s lives and safety, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will bear any responsibility,” Mr. Zhou said in the interview. Medical workers in the city have accused the local government of reacting too slowly to the crisis, and residents have used social media to complain about a ban on travel that has made it difficult to get access to food and health care. The mayor defended the travel ban, which was enacted last week and effectively cut off the city of 11 million people. He called the restriction “unprecedented in human history.” China’s second-highest ranking official, Premier Li Keqiang, on Monday visited Wuhan to inspect local efforts to contain the disease, the government said. In pictures released by the state-run news media, Mr. Li is seen wearing a face mask and a blue protective gown while posing for photos with health workers. He was also seen speaking with a patient in an isolation ward via video conference. The premier’s visit comes as the central government is under increasing pressure to prove it is adequately coping with the crisis. On Saturday, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, convened a meeting of the Politburo’s standing committee, the senior-most executive body of the Chinese Communist Party, as a demonstration of the government’s hands-on approach to the outbreak. Hospitals in Wuhan have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. Mr. Li, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, pledged to provide Wuhan’s health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles. Trying to temporarily limit travel, the Chinese government extended the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday by three days, meaning it will go through next Sunday rather than ending on Thursday. Workers will return to work on Feb. 3. The holiday, China’s biggest annual celebration, began on Friday, the eve of the Lunar New Year. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel during the holiday, either for tourism or to visit family. The week, known in China as Spring Festival, typically includes large public events, but many festivities have been canceled this year. Many tourist attractions have been shuttered including the Disney theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, along with the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall in Beijing. Residents of Wuhan have largely hunkered down to quietly wait out the crisis, mostly staying inside their homes, and venturing out only for supplies and food, medical visits and occasional bursts of exercise away from other people. Cities, towns and even villages have erected checkpoints and roadblocks intended to ward off any outsiders who might carry the coronavirus. On Monday, most shops remained closed, but supermarkets, fresh produce stores and pharmacies remained open — although many pharmacies have run out of protective masks, hand disinfectant and other supplies intended to protect against the virus. Residents with fevers and coughs who worried that they may have contracted the coronavirus continued to line up at clinics and hospitals, but in fewer numbers than on previous days. The streets were mostly free of cars, and many residents walked or rode bicycles to do their shopping. “It’s possible to live, but it’s not a real New Year,” said Qiu Dongjun, 38, a construction worker from rural Hubei Province who was carrying a bagful of shopping, mostly instant noodles and tins of precooked porridge. As health officials race to contain the dangerous virus, social media users in China are responding to the outbreak with dashes of gallows humor. On the messaging platform WeChat, people circulated images of improvised face masks made of plastic water jugs. One video on WeChat and the social platform Weibo showed a group of people playing mah-jongg, the popular tile-based game, while wearing what appeared to be plastic bags over their heads. Another video on WeChat appeared to show a person emerging from an airport baggage claim clad in a full-body space alien costume, complete with green skin and bulging eyes. Masks are a common motif in virus-related memes. They have been added to traditional greetings exchanged for the Lunar New Year, and photoshopped into classic paintings like Vermeer’s “Girl With a Pearl Earring.” They appear in propaganda posters done in the style of the Mao era and updated to reflect the times. A video on Twitter appeared to show a taxi driver wearing goggles and a hazmat suit while taking a woman to the airport. The woman asks the driver whether his outfit might scare off potential fares. He replies serenely: “Safety first, right?” Foreign governments with nationals stranded in Wuhan scrambled to evacuate their citizens from the epicenter of the outbreak, even as China imposed official travel bans. The State Department said it had chartered a flight to take consular staff members and other American citizens to San Francisco from Wuhan on Tuesday. The department said priority would be given to those at greater risk from contracting the virus because of the flight’s “extremely limited” capacity. At least one American, a father of three young children, declined the offer after the United States government said his wife, a Chinese national, would not be offered a seat. France, Japan, Spain and Sri Lanka also said they would bring home nationals. Once in France, evacuated nationals would be required to spend 14 days in quarantine. Russia was in talks with China about evacuating its citizens, local news media reported. Russian tour operators have stopped selling trips to China following recommendations from the country’s tourism watchdog and would work only to evacuate travelers, Reuters reported.   Though the number of coronavirus cases and deaths is alarming, public health experts have so far warned against mass anxiety. After all, the common flu kills roughly 35,000 people a year and hospitalizes about 200,000 in the United States alone. It is too soon to know the mortality rate of the virus in the new outbreak. But there are signs that this outbreak could be far more serious than the common flu. For one, other coronaviruses have far higher mortality rates than the common flu, and have also led to global outbreaks. Chinese citizens are also haunted by the memory of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, a coronavirus outbreak that also started in China and eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. During that epidemic, Beijing at first played down the crisis and withheld information, eventually drawing widespread criticism. And conclusive evidence about how the outbreak started is lacking. While officials in Wuhan first traced it to a seafood market, some patients who have fallen ill never visited the market. Researchers have also offered disparate explanations for what animals may have transmitted the virus to humans. The coronavirus outbreak seemed to be a full-blown crisis by the time the first news reports emerged: Dozens of people had been infected, even some abroad. Though China’s initial delay in reporting cases of the new virus may suggest a cover-up, experts see something more worrying: weaknesses at the heart of the Chinese political system. China’s rigid bureaucracy discourages local officials from raising bad news with central bosses, and it silos officials off from one another, making it harder to manage, or even see, a crisis in the making. “That’s why you never really hear about problems emerging on a local scale in China,” said John Yasuda, who studies China’s approach to health crises at Indiana University. “By the time that we hear about it, and that the problem reaches the central government, it’s because it’s become a huge problem.” Those systemic flaws appear to have played a role in the pace at which officials responded to the outbreak, and the country’s inability to address the health risks from its so-called wet markets, which are stuffed with livestock living and dead, domesticated and wild. China is now mobilizing a nationwide response involving hundreds of personnel, one of the system’s strengths. But the country’s political weaknesses can have serious consequences for the world. Disease and pollution don’t respect borders, so a unified national policy is typically needed to prevent or stop them. For any health or environmental regulation to work, Mr. Yasuda said, “you want it to be standardized, you want it to be transparent, you want it to be accountable.” Reporting was contributed by Elaine Yu, Russell Goldman, Alexandra Stevenson, Tiffany May, Steven Lee Myers, Vivian Wang, Chris Buckley, Raymond Zhong, Denise Grady, Roni Caryn Rabin, Sheri Fink, Katie Robertson, Sui-Lee Wee, Ian Austen and Karen Zraick.

Effects of Coronavirus Begin Echoing Far From Wuhan Epicenter,2020-01-25,By Chris Buckley and Tiffany May,"['WUHAN, China — The repercussions from a mysterious virus that has sickened hundreds of people began reverberating far from its epicenter in central China on Saturday, as Hong Kong closed its schools for several weeks, Beijing began restricting buses in and out of the capital, and the country’s travel association suspended Chinese tour groups heading overseas. The new measures, coming on top of previous travel restrictions that had effectively penned in tens of millions of people in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, are certain to further dampen celebrations of the Lunar New Year, which began on Saturday. They came, too, as China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, who had said little publicly about the crisis despite growing criticism of the response, pledged Saturday that officials would “stand at the front line to safeguard social stability.” The illness linked to the virus has killed at least 56 people and sickened more than 1,300 in China, according to official reports. Cases have been confirmed in all but one of China’s provinces and autonomous regions, as well as in at least 11 other countries as the virus has spread to Europe, the United States Australia and, most recently, Canada. Among the newest victims in China was a 62-year-old ear, nose and throat specialist, who died on Saturday, according to state news media. It was unclear whether the doctor, who had retired last year, had treated patients with the disease. And officials in the southern city of Hechi said on Saturday that a 2-year-old girl suffering from the coronavirus had been admitted to a hospital, becoming the youngest person known to be infected. In a sign of how the coronavirus has shaken China, Mr. Xi convened a meeting of Communist Party leaders on Saturday to try to stem the outbreak. “We’re sure to be able to win in this battle to beat the epidemic,” said Mr. Xi, according to a summary of his remarks by state media, offering some of his most extensive remarks to date on the crisis. Mr. Xi called for stronger efforts to provide medicine and other supplies to affected areas. Shortages have angered doctors and medical workers, particularly in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital where the outbreak began. Hospitals have issued pleas for donated supplies. Party leaders also directed railway stations, airports and ports to step up measures to deter the spread of the virus, through ventilation, disinfection and body temperature checks.  Chinese officials announced later Saturday that more than 1,200 medical personnel would be sent to Wuhan and over 10,000 beds in 24 local hospitals would be requisitioned for treating confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. But the official response so far has drawn stinging rebukes on social media, where people are questioning whether the authorities are accurately reporting the number of cases or doing enough to rein in the outbreak. In particular, people have denounced the perceived indifference of local, provincial and even national authorities. “Where is that person? He is not on the front line,” one user wrote on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, in an apparent reference to Mr. Xi.  State media has maintained a steady drumbeat of positive news about the outbreak, praising the sacrifices of responders and everyday people. But there was little doubt  the disease had derailed celebrations of the Lunar New Year, the country’s biggest holiday and busiest travel period. Travel constraints imposed earlier in Wuhan and 12 nearby cities have effectively penned in 35 million people. Wuhan tightened its restrictions further on Saturday, with a ban on most vehicle traffic in the city center. The restrictions began spreading far beyond Wuhan, too: In Beijing, the city government said it would halt all inter-province buses beginning on Sunday, effectively limiting road travel into the capital. The association of China’s travel agencies said that it would suspend all tour groups and the sale of flight and hotel packages for citizens headed overseas, starting on Monday. Groups already on their trips were allowed to continue, with the directive that travelers’ health be closely monitored. The move to cut off group tours could have a ripple effect across countries that depend on Chinese tourists. While China is now home to an increasingly sophisticated population ready to hit the tourist routes by themselves, a large number of Chinese do not feel comfortable traveling abroad unless they are with a group. New measures were also imposed in Hong Kong, where its leader, Carrie Lam, declared a health emergency. Five coronavirus patients connected to Wuhan are being treated in Hong Kong, and more than 100 others are suspected of having the viral pneumonia. Lunar New Year celebrations are being canceled in Hong Kong, schools will be closed until mid-February and the Hong Kong Marathon has been called off. The city is also suspending flights and train services to Wuhan. A study by the medical journal The Lancet, published on Friday, raised new concerns that people infected with the coronavirus might be able to spread it even if they do not have flu-like symptoms. Researchers studied a family in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, five of whom had traveled to Wuhan and two of whom had come in contact with an infected relative in a hospital there. Testing conducted after the family flew home found that six members had the coronavirus, including one who had not gone to Wuhan. One infected family member, a child, had no symptoms, suggesting that people with the virus might be spreading it without knowing that they have it, the study found. “It shows this new coronavirus is able to transfer between person to person, in a hospital setting, a family home setting, and also in an intercity setting,” Yuen Kwok-yung, an author of the study, said in an interview. “This is exactly what makes this new disease difficult to control.” The United States Embassy said on Saturday that all American employees at its consulate in Wuhan have been ordered to leave. The United States government is arranging a charter flight to evacuate American diplomats and citizens on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the plan. For people in the United States with close ties to China, the outbreak has brought worry, disappointment and scrutiny. Some Chinese-Americans  have had their Lunar New Year plans waylaid, as travel schedules for the coming week and beyond are interrupted. Chinese-Americans have scrambled, though, to send aid to their friends and family in China. Sean Shi, of Issaquah, Wash., said he shipped several boxes of masks to China in a friend’s luggage, hoping that they could reach friends in the Wuhan area. Later in the day, Mr. Shi was back at a hardware store, buying another 46 masks for some of his former peers at Wuhan University. “We understand it’s a tough situation over there — the panic, the shortage of equipment,” Mr. Shi said. “We just realized the situation is very serious — more serious than we thought.” Christopher Buckley reported from Wuhan, and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.

France to Stop Using TNT-Loaded Tear Gas Grenades,2020-01-27,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — France has announced that its security forces will no longer use explosive tear gas grenades that have maimed protesters, a sign of the government’s increasing willingness to address complaints about police use of force that have mushroomed since the Yellow Vest protests. But critics said that the announcement was too little, too late, and argued that similar grenades, which the French police will continue to use, could be just as dangerous. The French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said on Sunday that the tear gas grenades — known by their technical designation, GLI-F4 — were used only “in the most serious cases,” but that they had the “flaw of containing explosives” and would be withdrawn immediately from police use. Speaking to the television broadcaster France 3, he said that grenades, which contain a TNT charge, did not have a specific color or insignia to indicate dangerousness. Fired from launchers or thrown by hand, the grenades detonate on impact or soon after, creating an explosion that is supposed to be disorienting but not wounding. But people who come into direct contact with them have been badly hurt. When police officers were “forced to use them to disengage from a threat,” Mr. Castaner said, protesters sometimes picked them up and were “seriously wounded.” “Because they are the only ones who can legitimately use force, they must do so in a proportionate, regulated way,” he said of the police. The government has come under increasing pressure in the past few weeks to address accusations of excessive force by the police after a string of events, including the death of Cédric Chouviat, a deliveryman who died this month after police officers held him on the ground during a traffic stop. Investigations were also opened this month into events during Yellow Vest protests or demonstrations against Mr. Macron’s proposed pension overhauls: One officer in Paris shot a protester at point-blank range with a rubber projectile, another punched a detained protester in the head, and an officer in the city of Toulouse intentionally tripped a demonstrator. “I expect the greatest ethics from our police officers and gendarmes,” Mr. Macron said recently, adding that he did not want to generalize or “harm the credibility and dignity” of French security forces, but that the attitude of officers in a small number of cases was “not acceptable.” But longtime critics of the grenades were unconvinced that Mr. Castaner’s announcement marked a turning point in the government’s approach to law enforcement. One group of lawyers representing protesters who have been wounded by the grenades expressed satisfaction that police violence was now “at the heart of public concerns.” But they said in a statement on Sunday that the interior minister’s announcement was a public relations move “in the context of increasing media coverage of police violence.” “It has been 14 months since we publicly warned Mr. Castaner about the dangerousness of these firearms,” the lawyers said, referring to a letter they had written to the interior minister in the fall of 2018. That was at the height of the Yellow Vest protests, when violent clashes between demonstrators and the police around the country led to a spike in the use of force by officers, who used rubber projectiles, “dispersal grenades” that spray smaller rubber pellets upon exploding, and tear gas grenades. Several protesters have lost hands to the GLI-F4 grenades, which were also used in 2014 against environmental activists in western France who had set up camp on the site of a shelved airport project. Other protesters were injured in the feet and legs by shards of the grenades. The GLI-F4s, which are roughly seven inches long and contain about an ounce of TNT, release tear gas and a strong blast of air upon loudly detonating. They are meant to be used by police officers to disperse aggressive crowds. The French authorities argue that the police need such tools to respond to increasingly violent protesters. Mr. Castaner said on Sunday, for instance, that someone whose hand was mutilated after seizing a grenade “to throw it back at security forces” was different from a bystander being injured. The Council of State, France’s highest administrative court, has rejected attempts by advocacy groups like the Human Rights League to outlaw the grenades, arguing that police forces were adequately trained to use them in specific circumstances. Critics also called Mr. Castaner’s announcement a symbolic but empty gesture, because the Interior Ministry announced several years ago that it was phasing out the GLI-F4s — which are no longer produced — and replacing them with similar tear gas grenades, known as GM2Ls. The newer grenades do not contain TNT and are designed to prevent shards from harming protesters, but they function similarly to the GLI-F4s, and critics argue it is unclear that they are much safer. “This decision is salutary but quite belated, and the replacement by the GM2L model is not without risk if there is not a radical change in law enforcement strategy,” the Human Rights League said in a statement on Monday, calling Mr. Castaner’s announcement a “fake gesture.” Another type of stun grenade was banned in 2017, three years after the death of Rémi Fraisse, an environmental activist who was killed by a grenade fired by the police during a protest over a dam construction project in southwestern France.']",The government has started to acknowledge concerns about the force that the police use against protesters. But critics say doing away with the grenades is little more than a gesture.
"U.S. Military Plane Crashed in Afghanistan, Officials Confirm",2020-01-27,By Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — An American military aircraft crashed in a Taliban-controlled area outside Kabul on Monday, the United States military command in Afghanistan said, following hours of confusion after officials had initially identified the plane as a passenger airliner. The plane crashed in the district of Deh Yak in Ghazni Province during a day of harsh weather, Afghan officials said. Senior officials, including the country’s vice president, initially said it was a passenger plane operated by the country’s national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines. Nearly 10 hours after the crash, the United States military, in a statement that provided little detail, confirmed that the plane was one of its aircraft and said it saw no evidence that it had been downed by enemy fire. The statement described the plane as a United States Bombardier E-11, a rare advanced communication aircraft deployed to Afghanistan and used to help ground troops talk to American aircraft overhead. “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” said Col. Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the military in Afghanistan. Colonel Leggett would not comment about how many were on board, and their status. Officials in Ghazni, based on information from local residents as well as Taliban messages, said the aircraft probably had a crew of half a dozen people. United States military experts, however, said the plane is frequently flown by a team of just two. Reports were conflicting on whether those onboard survived and were taken by the Taliban, or whether all had been killed. Taliban social media accounts posted pictures and videos of what they said was an aircraft that they had shot down, but the group is known to exaggerate its claims. The plane appeared wrecked and in flames amid snow. Officials said the harsh weather and the inaccessibility of land controlled by the Taliban had made gathering information difficult. The aircraft went down around 1 p.m. local time, and confusion about even the most basic details continued for hours. The country’s vice president, Sarwar Danish, who said it had been a passenger plane, had even expressed “condolences about their martyrdom to the people of Afghanistan.” But hours later, Alem Shah Ibrahimi, the president of Ariana, said the company’s initial information showed that “all our fleet are located.” Qasim Wafayezadathe, the head of Afghanistan’s civil aviation agency, said it had confirmed that no civilian plane had crashed. By early evening, officials in Ghazni revised their accounts. Adam Khan Sirat, a spokesman for Ghazni police, said the plane belonged to “foreign forces,” referring to the American-led military coalition in Afghanistan. About 12,000 American troops and thousands of NATO forces remain in Afghanistan, spread around the country. Officers from the headquarters in Kabul frequently shuttle to bases in aircraft, and surveillance planes are often deployed over battle areas. Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Julian Barnes contributed reporting from Washington, and Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs.']","After hours of confusion, the United States military said there was no indication that enemy fire had caused the aircraft to crash in Taliban territory."
Italy Election Deals Blow to Nationalist Leader Salvini,2020-01-27,By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The nationalist leader Matteo Salvini suffered a setback in his campaign to trigger the collapse of Italy’s government and set the stage for a return to power when his party’s candidate came up significantly short in a regional election on Sunday that he had framed as a bellwether of his national appeal. Mr. Salvini, the leader of the anti-migrant League party, had seized on the contest in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, which has a deep tradition of voting for communist and leftist parties. It was for him an opportunity to show his national dominance and to make the case that the wobbly coalition government of the Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement no longer represented the people and that he did. Instead, the left’s stronghold held, and Mr. Salvini was effectively repulsed. “Today Matteo Salvini has lost the election,” Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the Democratic Party, said after early results made clear the victory of his party’s candidate, the region’s incumbent. Until the very end, Mr. Zingaretti said, Mr. Salvini campaigned “to topple the government,” but the government has “come out stronger.” The usually confident Mr. Salvini sounded remarkably low key in a late-night news conference, calling himself proud of his party’s performance and insisting he would work “twice as hard” going forward. It wasn’t all bad news for him. The candidate backed by Mr. Salvini won in the southern region of Calabria despite the fact that, for decades, Mr. Salvini’s party, formerly known as the Northern League, vilified the southern regions as lazy leeches on the wealthy and hard-working north. However, since adopting a nationalist message and national strategy, Mr. Salvini has campaigned vigorously in the south. The center-right candidate Jole Santelli, whom he supported, was poised to take more than half of the vote there. But it was Emilia-Romagna that over recent weeks became the clear focus of Mr. Salvini’s, and Italy’s, attention. Mr. Salvini campaigned feverishly there, hoping a victory would effectively ratify Italy’s rightward tilt and give him more ammunition in his calls for early elections, which polls suggested he would win. This was a prospect that thrilled Europe’s populists and menaced its establishment, but which also stirred a new liberal force in Italy. Mr. Salvini’s campaign in the region gave birth to an explicitly anti-Salvini protest movement, which many discouraged liberals looked to with hope. Called the Sardines because they packed public squares with tens of thousands of people, the movement spread around the country. For weeks its leaders said that they were infusing the Democratic candidate with enthusiasm. After it became clear early Monday morning that the left-leaning incumbent, Stefano Bonaccini, had beaten his center-right opponent, Lucia Borgonzoni, a Salvini loyalist, by a margin of around five percentage points, Mr. Zingaretti attributed part of the success to the Sardines. He called them a “positive democratic shock” against the “aggressiveness of the right” and credited them with increasing turnout. The apparent center-left victory in the north brought some measure of relief to Italy’s governing majority, formed last summer with the main goal of keeping Mr. Salvini out of power. But if the Democratic Party hailed the results as a gift of breathing room, its coalition partners seemed to be running out of oxygen. Five Star collapsed in Emilia-Romagna, dropping from the nearly 28 percent it scored there during national elections in 2018, when it became the country’s leading political force, to low single digits on Sunday. The humiliating defeat raised more questions about the party’s viability only days after its leader, Luigi Di Maio, quit amid plunging poll numbers, infighting and defections to Mr. Salvini’s party. Five Star also performed terribly in Calabria, a region that once constituted part of its southern base. Mr. Salvini, deprived of a victory he called potentially “historic” on the campaign trail, was left hoping that Five Star’s thrashing and near disappearance in the regions would be enough to destabilize the government and open the door to new elections. “Tomorrow something will change in Rome,” he said. Since dramatically losing his position as Italy’s interior minister in an unsuccessful power grab last summer, Mr. Salvini has waged a war on his old allies in Five Star and his traditional enemies in the Democratic Party. He attacked on the campaign trail, on social media, in newspapers and on television programs that seemed to hang on his every word. On its own, Mr. Salvini’s League appeared to have taken more than 30 percent in Emilia-Romagna, a strong showing in a region where the League took 19.2 percent in national elections in 2018. It also won in some of the region’s municipal elections last year. Mr. Salvini said that while his candidate had not won in the northern region, the League’s improved standing was a sign that the left was losing its footing. “For the first time there was a contest,” Mr. Salvini said after the vote. “Having an open contest in Emilia-Romagna was an emotion for me, after 70 years, for the first time, there was a contest.” But Mr. Salvini’s failure to win this contest meant it was less likely that he would soon get the one he desperately wants: early national elections. And while it perhaps gave the government more time, its leaders acknowledged they must now prove it can be effective. “This government and this majority have to show that problems can be resolved,” Mr. Zingaretti said. Emma Bubola contributed reporting.']",Regional voting thwarted an effort by Matteo Salvini to set off the government’s collapse and return to power as head of the anti-migrant League party.
‘What if We All Get Sick?’: Coronavirus Strains China’s Health System,2020-01-27,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['After suffering from a fever and breathing problems for more than 15 days, Xiao Shibing, a 51-year-old resident of Wuhan, China, finally sought help at a hospital. Despite the symptoms, he was not tested for the new coronavirus —\xa0a lapse suggesting that there may be far more cases of the virus than are being officially reported. Instead, Mr. Xiao was told that he had a viral chest infection, so he went back home. As he grew sicker, he went to three other hospitals. But they told him they did not have enough beds. Like many of the thousands of Chinese patients who are concerned about the new coronavirus, Mr. Xiao is scrambling to get help from a health care system straining to serve even the basic needs of patients. “It is like kicking a ball from here to there,” said his wife, Feng Xiu. Mr. Xiao, who was eventually hospitalized on Sunday — about a week after his initial attempt — still hasn’t been tested for the pneumonialike virus. As it struggles to combat a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened more than 4,500 people and killed 106, the Chinese government is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times. While other parts of everyday life in China have significantly improved in the past decade, the quality of health care has stagnated. In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, many people have to stand in line in the wee hours of the morning to secure appointments with doctors. When they do get an appointment, patients get only a couple of minutes with a doctor. During flu season, residents set up camp overnight with blankets in hospital corridors. China does not have a functioning primary care system, so most people flock to hospitals. On an ordinary day, doctors are frustrated and exhausted as they see as many as 200 patients. Those weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China —\xa0like Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead. Despite having dealt with the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago, many Chinese hospitals in smaller cities are not fully prepared to deal with a major outbreak like the current virus. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in poorer, rural areas nearby. Last week, eight hospitals in Hubei Province — where Wuhan is situated and where most of the cases have appeared — put out a call for N95 masks, goggles, surgical masks and surgical gowns. In the absence of proper equipment, some medical workers have resorted to cutting plastic folders to jury-rig goggles. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China had invested a lot in building a robust public health infrastructure in the wake of SARS and that many of them were mostly well equipped to deal with infectious diseases. “But they apparently didn’t anticipate something so sudden, so acute and so tremendous,” he said. The government’s response to the crisis could exacerbate the problems. Across China, the authorities are sealing off cities, closing down schools and checking on residents. But the lockdown — affecting 56 million people — could make it difficult to get medical supplies to hospitals that desperately need them. Chinese officials have acknowledged that they are struggling to deal with the outbreak. At a news conference last week, the Wuhan health commission said there were long lines and a shortage of beds. In response, it said it had designated hospitals as “fever clinics” for people to go to for treatment. With medical facilities in short supply, the local government has also pledged to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days, and vowed that another new 1,300-bed hospital would be ready by the middle of next month. It is taking a page out of the government’s playbook during SARS, when it built a new hospital in Beijing in just a week. Yet it is still not clear that there will be sufficient beds to deal with the virus, which remains highly contagious. Chen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it was more important to have a working system of family doctors who can act as gatekeepers for the hospitals. “Without an efficient screening process,” he said, “these two hospitals would not be very effective.” The central government is under increasing pressure to show that it is adequately coping with the crisis. On Monday, Premier Li Keqiang, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, visited Wuhan to inspect efforts to contain the disease. He pledged to provide local health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles. As the government scrambles to contain the outbreak, the sick are just trying to get medical attention. Cai Pei, 41, of Wuhan, said his wife had begun coughing and developed a fever three days ago. He wrote on Weibo, a popular social media platform, that hospitals would not admit her, and that he had difficulty finding masks and cold medicine in pharmacies. Making matters worse, three Chinese medical companies have said that they do not have the capacity to make enough test kits for the new coronavirus, according to local news media reports. Mr. Cai and his wife still do not know whether she is infected with the coronavirus or another more common ailment. “Sometimes I can only hide and cry, but I couldn’t tell her and had to reassure her that it is not the virus,” Mr. Cai said by telephone. “It is very scary. If it’s real, we have a child and elderly parents at home. What if we all get sick?” With no proven drugs to treat the new virus, the health authorities have told doctors to prescribe a combination of treatments — anti-viral H.I.V. drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicine — to patients. Some of the medicines being prescribed are a mixture of ingredients like buffalo horn, jasmine and honeysuckle as well as anti-viral H.I.V. drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir. As happened with SARS, traditional Chinese medicine — an industry that the government has pledged to develop — is prominently being touted as a way to treat this new coronavirus. But there is no clinical evidence that the gallstones of cattle, the roots of plants and licorice could work in combating it. Journals have published studies by Chinese scientists saying that traditional Chinese medicine helped alleviate symptoms of SARS. China’s ministry of science and technology said in 2003 that it had found banlangen, the root of the woad plant, as well as a liquid made up of ingredients like cholic acid, jasmine, buffalo horn and honeysuckle to be effective in curing an acute inflammation of the lungs. “There has never been a good antiviral agent, so that means that people would try things that have some effect,” said Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at the University of Sydney. “But there’s no evidence of significant benefits with any antiviral drugs or traditional Chinese medicine.” The problem with finding a drug that can effectively fight an infectious disease like this coronavirus, SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is that it needs to be tested in sufficient numbers in a randomized way in proper clinical trials. Patients must also give informed consent. “That is very difficult in an outbreak situation,” said Kanta Subbarao, a senior researcher on respiratory illnesses at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. In Wuhan, Mr. Xiao’s daughter, Xiao Hongxia, said her father had been diagnosed with severe pneumonia and was now labeled a “highly suspicious case.” He is relying on ordinary fever medicines and anti-inflammatory drugs, she said. “There is no special medicine for the coronavirus so far,” Ms. Xiao said, “so we can only rely on the patient’s own immunity.” Amber Wang, Yiwei Wang and Elsie Chen contributed research.']","To fight the expanding outbreak, the country is relying on a medical system that is overburdened even in normal times."
Modi Prepares to Welcome Trump to India,2020-01-28,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Vindu Goel,"['NEW DELHI — Mysterious figures in sunglasses have scoped out the Taj Mahal. The hunt is on for rally venues and presidential suites. Officials in two countries are rushing ahead with feverish preparations, including final negotiations for a much-anticipated trade deal. President Trump is expected to swoop into India for a full-fledged state visit in late February, according to Indian officials. Mr. Trump, apparently eager to get out of the Washington caldron and as far away from the impeachment debate as possible, plans to spend about two days in India, a country where the United States is eager for more business and looking to find a counterweight to the rise of China. His counterpart in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has his own deepening political troubles to duck, and this visit could be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Modi’s recent policies that have deeply divided India and set off deadly nationwide protests. In recent weeks, Indians from all walks of life have railed against Mr. Modi’s government for backing a new citizenship law that is widely seen as discriminatory toward India’s Muslim minority and a blow to India’s roots as a secular democracy. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have shared a stage before, at an event in Texas called “Howdy, Modi.” Tens of thousands of Indian-Americans cheered on two populist leaders who have further polarized their own societies. The Indian news media has kicked into high gear. Its stories explore where Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi might share the stage this time, with a giant cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, in Mr. Modi’s home state of Gujarat, as one possibility. Mr. Trump is expected to stay at the same fancy hotel near the American Embassy in New Delhi, the capital, that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama used. According to accounts in the Indian news media, this trip originated during a phone call in early January, when Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump exchanged New Year’s best wishes and then spoke of getting together soon. “Howdy Trump: US President to visit India,’’ read one headline on Tuesday. A visit from an American president right now could help Mr. Modi, who for the first time since he came into office nearly six years ago faces widespread street protests against him. In August, his government revoked the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, a conflict-ridden territory that had been India’s only Muslim-majority state. To contain the disquiet, the government arrested thousands of Kashmiris without charges and shut down internet and phone service across Kashmir, throwing the area, home to as many as eight million people, into a communications black hole. (Some restrictions were just lifted.) Then in December, Mr. Modi’s government made an even more contentious decision. It passed a new law that makes it easier for migrants from all major faiths except Islam to gain Indian citizenship. Deadly demonstrations erupted, fueled by deep concerns that Mr. Modi, whose political party espouses a Hindu-centric worldview, was trying to dismantle India’s long tradition of tolerance and make India a Hindu-first nation. These moves have put Mr. Modi on the defensive, especially abroad. Some American officials have called for sanctions, and the European Union is considering half a dozen critical resolutions in its Parliament. American officials have remained tight-lipped about Mr. Trump’s India plans, citing security concerns. Several Indian news sites ran pictures this month showing a large American delegation, with many team members wearing sunglasses, visiting the Taj Mahal in an apparent security review. The tentative plans include events around New Delhi and excursions. Analysts have said that one reason a Modi-Trump event might be held in Gujarat is that many Indian-Americans trace their heritage back to Gujarat, a coastal state with a history of trading. Visiting there could lift Mr. Trump’s political fortunes among Indian-Americans who tend to be affluent and politically active. Gujarat is also where Mr. Modi is still wildly popular, despite the recent knocks he has taken for the citizenship law. Indian officials are eager to stage an event at a new 110,000-seat cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, which Mr. Modi’s side has vowed to fill with fans. Behind the pageantry, Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will have to navigate some tricky geopolitics. For years, American officials have been trying to woo India into a closer strategic partnership to contain China, though India has remained lukewarm. American and Indian officials are also eager to ink a trade deal. India’s per capita gross domestic product is about $2,000, compared to about $63,000 for the United States, according to World Bank data. But because of its scale — 1.3 billion people — India is one of the world’s largest economies. The Trump administration is obsessed with the overall American trade deficit and wants India to buy more American goods. Many analysts and business leaders believe Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will sign a limited trade deal — the first significant rapprochement after more than a year of escalating tariffs and countertariffs. India has long been one of the world’s most protectionist countries, imposing high tariffs and a maze of regulations that hamper foreign companies. India has tentatively agreed to end price caps on imported medical devices like heart stents and artificial knees, which had been a key sticking point in the talks, said business leaders briefed on the discussions. The Modi government, for its part, is insisting that the Trump administration restore a preferential trade status for India that lowers tariffs on goods like textiles. Before granting any concessions on that front, the United States wants India to promise to purchase billions of dollars of American turkeys, blueberries, apples, pecans and other agricultural products to help reduce a $25 billion trade deficit with India. The two leaders may also announce another major Indian purchase of American weapons. For Mr. Trump, who has been facing an impeachment trial and is beginning his re-election campaign, even a modest deal with India would allow him to tell voters that his tough talk on trade is working. He has loudly complained about India’s high tariffs, particularly on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. For Mr. Modi, who is battling an economic slowdown, an agreement would ease perceptions that his nationalist government is hostile to foreign companies. It could also help inject a little momentum into India’s economy at a time when Mr. Modi is eager to talk about anything other than the citizenship law.

Chinese Officials Race to Contain Anger Over Virus,2020-01-27,By Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers,"['WUHAN, China — The Chinese government scrambled to contain not only the coronavirus epidemic but also growing expressions of public fury over the management of the crisis as the death toll rose on Tuesday to at least 106. China’s National Immigration Administration on Tuesday encouraged Chinese citizens to reconsider the timing of overseas travel to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, it said on its WeChat account. That came as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged American citizens to avoid nonessential travel to China.  Premier Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese government, flew on Monday into Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to show support for medical workers and to pledge needed medical supplies — only to be mocked online for leading workers in an encouraging cheer. Mr. Li’s visit, which featured prominently in state media, came as Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged that the local authorities had moved too slowly in the first days of the crisis. In an interview with CCTV, the main state television network, the mayor said that information about the coronavirus had not been shared with the public in a timely manner, and that he and the city’s Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, were prepared to resign to “appease public indignation.” “Our names will live in infamy for shutting the door” of the city, Mr. Zhou said. “But we believe that as long as it helps to control the disease, helps keep people’s lives safe, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will shoulder any responsibility,” Mr. Zhou said. The offer to resign, which was not immediately acted on, suggested that China’s harshly practical party hierarchy could settle on local officials like the mayor and the party secretary as sacrifices to ease public ire over a spiraling public health crisis that also threatens to take a large economic toll. With the death toll rising to at least 106, and infections spreading to still more countries, the impacts reverberated globally. Stocks tumbled and oil prices fell on Monday as the virus’s spread worried investors worldwide. The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent, its sharpest decline in nearly four months, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit. Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for the holiday, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 2 percent. China’s currency also fell, while investors moved into safe havens like gold. In China, the government announced that it would extend for three days the weeklong holiday for the Lunar New Year, which had been scheduled to end on Thursday. The country’s economy, which is experiencing its worst slowdown in nearly three decades, is already hurting from the impact of the outbreak, and there are fears that consumer spending will fall as residents stay home over the extended holiday. In Beijing, where 72 cases had been reported by Monday morning, officials warned that anyone who returned to the city from other parts of China must confine themselves to their homes for 14 days. That could significantly reduce the city’s work force even after the extended holiday ends. Hundreds of millions of people travel during the holiday, which began on Saturday, and would normally begin returning in the coming days. In Shanghai, the country’s financial center, the authorities ordered businesses to stay closed until midnight on Feb. 9. In nearby Suzhou, a large manufacturing hub, businesses there were ordered to open no sooner than Feb. 8. Some companies, including the internet giant Tencent, also told their workers to stay home until Feb. 10. The epidemic has already shuttered many major tourist attractions, including the Disney theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall outside of Beijing. Major film studios postponed the opening of movies at what would normally have been a peak viewing season, while several sporting events were canceled or postponed. China’s professional basketball league, the C.B.A., announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely. The crisis has emerged as an unexpected challenge for the Communist Party leadership, especially for President Xi Jinping, who said nothing in public about the matter until he convened an extraordinary meeting of the party’s Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday. Mr. Li, an economist who has been premier since 2013, has taken the formal lead of China’s crisis management team for the epidemic. But the much more powerful Mr. Xi, who is also the Communist Party leader, has signaled that he is the real power in charge. Only days earlier, Mr. Li had reflected less urgency about the viral outbreak when discussing it — without wearing a medical mask — while meeting medical workers in faraway Qinghai province. On Monday, by contrast, he made several appearances around Wuhan, visiting a hospital, where he promised to deliver 20,000 surgical masks, and a supermarket, where — now wearing a mask — he led workers in a chant. “Wuhan,” he said. “Jia you,” they responded in chorus, using a phrase that means “add oil” but is roughly translated as a rousing “Go!” On Twitter, which is blocked in China, the gesture was mocked. “Wuhan pneumonia is afraid of slogans,” one user posted in Chinese. Wuhan’s residents have largely hunkered down to quietly wait out the epidemic. They mostly stay inside their homes, venturing out for supplies and food, medical visits and occasional bursts of exercise. Still, several said they had heard about Mr. Li’s visit and welcomed it as a sign that the central leadership was committed to supporting the city and surrounding areas, which have been locked down since last week. “This shows that they’re getting serious,” said Shao Shigui, a retired steelworker from southwest China who was strolling on a promenade by the Yangtze River. He had come to Wuhan with his wife to help their daughter, who is pregnant, and said he was taking a break from the monotony of staying indoors. “In China, if a leader visits, that shows that all the resources of the government can be mobilized,” he said. The United States, Japan, France, Russia and other countries, meanwhile, scrambled to get citizens who were trapped in the city out, after the government shut down the major modes of transportation. Since then the city of 11 million has descended into a surreal quiet — except around the hospitals. Most shops remained closed, but supermarkets, fresh produce stores and pharmacies opened, although many pharmacies have run out of protective masks, hand disinfectant and other supplies needed to protect against the virus. Residents with fevers and coughs who worried that they may have contracted the coronavirus continued to line up at clinics and hospitals, but in fewer numbers than previous days. The streets were mostly free of cars, and many residents walked or rode bicycles to do their shopping. “It’s possible to live, but it’s not a real New Year,” said Qiu Dongjun, a 38-year-old construction worker from rural Hubei who was carrying a bag of groceries. “I’ve been eating so many containers of instant noodles that my mouth and nose are flaming raw.” He said Mr. Li’s visit was a promising political gesture. “People in Wuhan have many practical problems,” he said. “How will our wages get paid? What if businesses go under? Who will ensure we get our unpaid wages? These are practical problems,” he said, his voice partly muffled by his protective mask. “You can’t expect all those problems to be solved in Beijing,” he said before walking off. The mayor of Wuhan, Mr. Zhou, defended his actions even as he accepted responsibility for falling short. He said he had been hampered from alerting the public sooner because of the reporting rules under the laws governing disease outbreaks. He suggested he had to wait for approval from higher-level officials. One woman responded angrily in the comments page below the People’s Daily’s live stream of the mayor’s interview on Weibo, the popular Chinese social media platform. She noted that the government had informed the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, but not the public most directly affected until Jan. 20. “The Wuhan government will be condemned throughout the ages if it turns the map of China all red,” she wrote, referring to maps depicting the spread of the virus. After weeks of limited steps before the gravity of the epidemic was recognized, government agencies have galvanized to fight the crisis, setting aside other priorities for now. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a notice dated Sunday that banks “must not blindly call in loans, cut off lending or hold off on lending” in response to the crisis. On Monday, State Grid, the government-controlled electricity provider, said it would halt the shut-off of electricity to residents whose bills fall into arrears while authorities deal with the outbreak.

A Divided Hong Kong Confronts the Arrival of the Coronavirus,2020-01-28,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The two Hong Kong protesters were dressed head to toe in black, their faces covered in masks. They smashed their Molotov cocktails into the lobby of a public housing estate, and flames and smoke began spewing out. This was no scene from the protest violence last year over Beijing’s dominance of Hong Kong’s affairs. This was on Sunday, and the firebombing was incited by anger over the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China — and plans by the Hong Kong government to use the unoccupied housing block as a quarantine area. Angst and anger fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 130 people on the mainland and has eight confirmed cases in Hong Kong, are compounding the bitterness from months of protests against Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s leadership. And it has set her government scrambling. On Tuesday, she relented after days of heavy pressure to put harder limits on travel from the mainland to Hong Kong. Speaking at a news conference with a mask over her face, she announced the shutdown of major rail passenger links and limits on flights for people coming from the mainland. The government in Beijing will also stop issuing visas for individual travelers to Hong Kong from the mainland. Those moves were unprecedented, Hong Kong researchers say, and were avoided even during the height of the SARS epidemic in 2003. The prospect of a new avenue for criticism of Hong Kong’s government, after months of simmering conflict with protesters, has caused alarm among officials as they are trying to appear responsive to the coronavirus outbreak. More broadly, the concern over the outbreak is again bringing resentment of the mainland to the fore. As they did during the SARS crisis, which killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong, and then again during the protests against Beijing’s intervention in the Hong Kong territory’s limited autonomy, people here are expressing distrust over the Chinese leadership’s lack of transparency and arbitrary decision-making. And for many, that distrust is extended to Mrs. Lam, Beijing’s handpicked chief executive, who will be under even heavier scrutiny as she tries to bring a divided city together to head off the outbreak. “We learned the lesson from SARS,” said Wong Hoi-ying, a district council representative in Fanling, the location of a proposed quarantine site in northern Hong Kong. “We put on our masks even before the coronavirus was confirmed to have entered Hong Kong.” Ms. Wong said she was shocked to learn from a news conference on Saturday that the Hong Kong government had identified the unoccupied public housing complex, in Fanling, as a possible quarantine site for the relatives of infected people. Her constituents “were outraged,” she said. “It’s within 100 meters of residences nearby, there are at least two schools and a few more kindergartens in the vicinity. It’s not a suitable location for quarantine purposes.” Within hours of the protest on Sunday, the authorities said they were delaying plans to use the public housing complex, while moving ahead with the use of remote, government-owned vacation bungalows. On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam said the government would abandon any plans to use the Fanling site. “The militancy of residents caught them by surprise,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He noted that the protesters included not only the contingent that has been rallying against the government for months, but also some people from the pro-establishment camp known as the blue ribbons. “They ostensibly support the government, but when it came to using their neighborhood for quarantine, they came out and blocked the roads,” Mr. Ma said. Late Sunday, the government said it would bar residents of Hubei, the province that includes Wuhan, or anyone who had traveled there in the past two weeks from entering Hong Kong. Just a day earlier Mrs. Lam had resisted calls for keeping out mainland visitors, saying it would be “inappropriate and impractical.” She faced expanded demands to restrict arrivals from the mainland. Some medical workers and epidemiologists, labor unions and even pro-Beijing politicians called for a more complete closure. On Tuesday, after a suspected explosive device was found in a trash can at a checkpoint at the mainland border, an anonymous message appeared on social media threatening a campaign to damage roads and railways connecting the city to mainland China. “If the Hong Kong Communists refuse to close (the border), we will do it for you,” the message said. Her critics point out that Mrs. Lam did not act to stop entries from Hubei until Macau, the former Portuguese colony that like Hong Kong operates with some autonomy from the central government, did it first. Macau said Sunday that it would only allow residents from Hubei to enter if they provided documentation to show they were not infected. The heightened restrictions announced Tuesday might still not be enough, as several border crossings and the airport will remain open, Mr. Ma said. “It shows she can respond to public opinion, but it might be too little too late,” he said. Many Hong Kong civil servants will work from home for the rest of the week. Officials called for private employers to permit similar working arrangements to keep people off the streets after the end of the Lunar New Year holiday. Despite the criticism, in many ways, Hong Kong is the best-equipped Chinese city for dealing with an outbreak. It was one of the first places in China to begin reporting possible cases of infection from the coronavirus. And it has deep and painfully earned experience from the SARS outbreak, which killed at least eight health care workers. Some of the survivors still have lung damage 17 years later. Doctors and nurses in Hong Kong have drawn lots to determine when they would work in coronavirus isolation wards for six-week shifts, said Arisina Ma, the president of the Public Doctors’ Association. One hospital rearranged its cafeteria so that all tables faced the walls, a precaution from the SARS era to help prevent employees from infecting each other during their meals. The health authorities were scrambling to find living quarters for health workers after they had completed duty inside isolation wards. Hotels were also unwilling to accept large numbers of medical workers for fear of public reaction. Dr. Ma suggested requiring visitors and residents who were returning from the mainland at the close of the Lunar New Year holiday to stay home for 14 days, the incubation period for the disease. “Once the community outbreak takes place, and we still let sick people from mainland to come in, I can definitely tell you our system cannot cope with all those sick patients,” she said. “We are waiting for the worst to come. Of course we will try to stop it, but I am not sure if our government is efficient and determined enough to stop the worst to come.” It was unclear, though, whether the upwelling of anger here would give new momentum to a protest movement that in recent weeks had become notably less intense. Some protesters have called for rallies this week to raise both long-running demands, such as an investigation into police use of force and expanded direct elections, and new ones, such as further limiting mainland arrivals to prevent spread of the coronavirus. But other activists have said the complaints about the government’s response to the outbreak are too local and focused on keeping quarantine sites out of neighborhoods to develop into a citywide movement. Another factor might also keep people off the streets: fear of infection. “It might make it almost impossible to have a large-scale gathering in Hong Kong,” Mr. Ma said. “Even the protesters might not suggest people come out.” Tiffany May, Elaine Yu and Ezra Cheung contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']",Hong Kong announced the shutdown of major rail passenger links and limits on flights coming from the mainland.

A Knight in Gucci Armor Helps Charge a Geothermal Dragon,2020-01-27,By Jason Horowitz,"['CASTEL GIORGIO, ITALY — Fausto Carotenuto, the owner of a spiritual wellness and yoga center in Umbria, the ancient Etruscan heartland of Italy, senses bad energy underfoot. A geothermal company wants to build a plant on a fallow field near his land. He envisions apocalyptic consequences if he and his allies fail to stop it. There would be artificially triggered earthquakes, poisoned wellsprings, barren gardens, ruined lakes. “A disaster,” he said. For nearly a decade, Mr. Carotenuto, has battled the plant with the help of the mayor of Castel Giorgio, on the rim of Lake Bolsena. But in July — after myriad lawsuits, accusations of conflicts of interest and political maneuvers — the office of Italy’s prime minister decided the experimental project could go ahead and dig deep into the volcanic land. In September, Mr. Carotenuto sprung into emergency mode, drawing together an array of illustrious allies. They include the lead designer of Gucci, a Cannes Grand Prix-winning director and luminaries of festival-circuit filmmaking and organic gardening who have adopted this part of Italy as their Holy Land. Far from the crowds of Rome and Milan, and from the Tuscany beloved by hedge fund tycoons, this area had become for them synonymous with the essence of a certain Italian ideal — a rustic, unsullied paradise. They didn’t want a geothermal plant spoiling it. So against the backdrop of a country scarred by environmental abuses, industrial eyesores, special interests and political corruption — but also a place where “dietrologia,” or the belief that a conspiracy always lurks behind the surface, is widespread — they hatched a plan. Mr. Carotenuto — who expounds on “Who’s Behind It?” web videos about the “authentically satanic elements of free masonry” and other conspiracies — convened these local knights of his round table in a room decorated with a painting of warring medieval cavaliers, Etruscan-style amphorae and a white piano. Key to have on their side was Alice Rohrwacher, the Cannes Grand Prix-winning director who grew up on a honey farm in the area, along with her sister Alba Rohrwacher, who has been recognized as one of the finest European actors of her generation. The director has deep ties to the land, and alliances with local activists. To protect the area’s biodiversity, she had waged an earlier battle against the invasion of lucrative hazelnut trees planted to feed Italy’s insatiable hunger for Nutella. (“We’re surrounded by hazelnuts,” she warned.) Now she would support their fight against a new foe. Then there was Jonathan Nossiter, a film director who has become the Errol Morris of the ecology set for his documentaries against Big Wine and for natural agriculture. “We are drawn here for a reason, culturally and environmentally,” he said. “There is something sublime here. An Italian ideal.” Mr. Nossiter (whose brother, Adam, is a correspondent for The Times in France) hustled to the emergency meeting from his nearby heirloom seed nursery and organic vegetable farm, which also was a location for his latest movie, starring, among others, Alba Rohrwacher, Charlotte Rampling and Nick Nolte. (“He’s an avid organic farmer,” Mr. Nossiter said.) To help activate the locals, Mr. Carotenuto, who said he spent 15 years in Italy’s spy services, also tapped Mr. Nossiter’s partner on the farm, Massimiliano Petrini, a local who once treated a viper’s bite with electric shocks. And then there was their Lancelot of the Lake, Alessandro Michele, the lead designer of Gucci and owner of a nearby castle. He agreed to contribute financially for an expensive environmental lawyer to sue and stall the plant’s construction, and perhaps buy surrounding land as a strategic buffer against the hazelnut hordes. Most important, the designer, who had come here to put an “embankment” between him and the world, said he would “put my face” to the issue and show there was what he called an “authentic resistance” to combat “a monster, a medieval dragon.” On a recent Sunday morning, Mr. Michele, with cascading black hair and beard, stood outside his property like a knight in Gucci armor, wearing a cardinal red sombrero, sunglasses and a luxurious plaid overcoat. Inside Mr. Michele’s living room, two languid Boston terrier dogs, the inspiration for a Gucci special collection, snored loudly as he and his boyfriend, the urban planning professor Giovanni Attili, sat next to a Christmas tree and made clear their activism was no radical chic hobby. “We have a great sensitivity to the things that cry for help,” Mr. Michele said. “This place cries for help.” Mr. Michele said he first learned about the geothermal plant while he was in France from a member of the family that had sold him his property. “Yeah, we learned about it afterwards,” he said. His first instinct was to sell. But upon reconsideration, he thought, “maybe we would have bought it anyway,” because he had become so enchanted by the ancient oak trees. “Think what these trees have seen.” He also pointed to the rugged, authentic beauty of an area that possessed a “strange energy” that attracted people like himself and the others. They all needed to defend the land as if it were a sick child, Mr. Michele said. “I’m not a geologist, I have another job,” he said shortly before pricking one of his fingers, garlanded in Renaissance rings, on an exposed nail on the back of the chair. “My job is to preserve beauty. And hasn’t beauty a value?” The opponents of the plant have tried to prove it will be an environmental menace. They also say the approval process was rigged. They have seized on the fact that Franco Barberi, a volcanologist and former government minister who is a member of a state commission that approved the project, is married to a woman who is also a volcanologist and was one of the experts who helped determine the area was seismically safe for digging. Mr. Barberi denied any wrongdoing. He said that he recused himself from the decision, that the process was legitimate, and that his wife did only preliminary examinations before the project even began. “My wife and I have a clear conscience,” he said. The company building the plant says it uses an environmentally friendly system with zero carbon emissions to produce electricity. It would help, not harm, the environment and never trigger an earthquake, it says. “The well-off want everything to remain the way it is so they can remain the ones who are well off,” Diego Righini, the company’s general manager, said in his offices near the Spanish Steps in Rome. He portrayed the resistance as “Not in my backyard” elites. He argued that the more than 10 million euros, or $11.1 million, invested to build the plant would draw workers, creating families and nursery schools. “The battle that these directors are waging is to have a future without children bothering them,” he said, adding that construction would begin in February, despite the lawsuit. He accused Mr. Carotenuto of being a “guru and hypnotist” leading an “emotional opposition” exploited by larger interests that they failed to comprehend. In Mr. Righini’s deeper dietrologia assessment, it was the Italian energy giant Enel, which had dug unsuccessfully for geothermal energy in the area decades ago, that had stuck “secret deals.” He suggested that Enel had manufactured, and potentially bought off, the opposition of local advocates and mayors to crush independent competitors like him. He warned that digging below the story’s surface could be dangerous. “Do we want to wake the dragon?” Mr. Righini asked, referring to Enel. Luigi Parisi, the head of geothermal operations for Enel’s green power company, “categorically” excluded any involvement with the opponents to geothermal energy, calling accusations of plotting against the Castel Giorgio project “groundless.” And Andrea Garbini, the town’s mayor, said the only thing he had ever received from Enel was information belying Mr. Righini’s claim of his plant having zero emissions. All this business and politics disgusted Mr. Michele. “Italy is going through a dark moment, worse than the collapse of the Roman Empire,” said Mr. Michele, who is sometimes seen getting away from Italy’s current malaise by wandering through the surrounding blackberry bushes with his friend, the actor Jared Leto, both of them dressed like pashas. Mr. Michele spoke with wonder about his new home — the deer he encountered in the wood, the “good karma” of the land, the cheese farm where a young Sicilian plays classical music for his goats. “I ask myself,” he said, “in 2020, do we really need to still destroy everything?” Anna Momigliano contributed reporting from Rome.']",A company wants to build a geothermal plant in Umbria.

Trump Plan’s First Result: Israel Will Claim Sovereignty Over Part of West Bank,2020-01-28,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — The only immediate consequence of the Trump peace plan — and possibly all that will ever come of it — was the green light President Trump gave to Israel Tuesday to expand its territory by effectively annexing vast stretches of land it has long coveted on the West Bank. On paper, the plan offers the Palestinians a state, at last, as well as a partial four-year settlement freeze while they mull it over. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not wait, saying that he would move Sunday to apply sovereignty over the strategically vital Jordan Valley and to all Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The move would take in up to 30 percent of the occupied West Bank, and for the first time establish what Israeli leaders have coveted since capturing the territory in the 1967 Six Day War: a permanent eastern border for Israel along the Jordan River, recognized by the United States. It would ensure that Israel would never have to leave places like Hebron, Shiloh and Beit El, which Jews consider their biblical heartland. Mr. Netanyahu’s action was explicitly blessed by President Trump on Tuesday, when he promised to “recognize Israeli sovereignty over the territory that my vision provides to be part of the state of Israel.” Standing beside Mr. Trump at the White House, Mr. Netanyahu commended him for recognizing Israel’s need for a buffer along the Jordan River, giving it strategic depth against enemies to the east and the ability to prevent the smuggling of weapons to the Palestinians. “This is something we’ve longed to have,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding that applying sovereignty along the Jordan would “enable Israel to defend itself, by itself.” Earlier peace proposals envisioned uprooting tens of thousands of Israelis from West Bank settlements to give those areas to the Palestinians for their own state. But the Trump plan promises to leave both settlers and Palestinians in their homes. The conceptual map drawn up by the White House looks torturously gerrymandered, all but erasing the pre-1967 boundary that long formed the baseline for a potential agreement. Islets of Israeli territory dangle on access roads from what is now Israel proper like so many earrings, and new Palestinian enclaves nearly as large as the Gaza Strip are dreamed up in what is now the Negev Desert along the Egyptian border. It also appears to reward Israel for having created facts on the ground: The would-be Palestinian capital, for example, would be cobbled together from East Jerusalem neighborhoods that Israel cut off from the rest of the city when it built its security barrier. The plan also contemplates land swaps that could give the Palestinians parts of what is now Israel in exchange for letting West Bank settlements remain, though some of those areas of Israel are heavily populated by Arab citizens. Dan Rothem, a former aide to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert who specializes in maps of proposed peace deals, estimated that the Trump plan would give the Palestinians land equivalent to 84 percent of what they had before the 1967 war.  The green light from the White House outraged Israeli supporters of a more generous accommodation with the Palestinians and alarmed those who have warned that any annexation could set off renewed violence. “It’s worse than any of us could anticipate,” said Nimrod Novik, a longtime peace negotiator and former aide to the Israeli leader Shimon Peres. The Palestinians had no hand in the plan’s drafting, having cut all ties with the Trump administration after it recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But while they reacted with predictable anger, there was no threat of specific action and little to suggest that their relationship with Israel would fundamentally change. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority made a show of inviting officials from Hamas and other factions to an emergency meeting in Ramallah. But after watching Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Abbas, in his own televised address, made no threats of substantive action, such as cutting off security cooperation with Israel, which is the cornerstone of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship and the key to Mr. Abbas’s hold on power in the West Bank. “Jerusalem is not for sale,” the aged and frail Mr. Abbas said, at times appearing to require whispered prompts from Saeb Erekat, the veteran Palestinian negotiator. “The deal of the century will not pass. Our people will throw it into the garbage can of history.” Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member, called the Trump plan “a real existential assault on Palestine and the Palestinian people.” “It’s an Israeli-American agreement that has nothing to do with peace,” she said. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump were primarily trading Palestinian rights to distract from their legal troubles — Mr. Netanyahu’s pending criminal charges and Mr. Trump’s Senate trial — and to improve their chances of re-election, she said. “In the longer term, the other strategic objective is to deliver Palestine to the Israelis,” she added. Mr. Netanyahu told Israeli reporters in Washington that his cabinet would vote on the measure on Sunday. The decision could still be subject to legal challenges because the current cabinet is an interim government. Israeli leaders, including Mr. Netanyahu, had refrained from extending Israeli law anywhere in the West Bank for decades, fearing international sanctions. Most of the world considers Israeli settlements there illegal. But Mr. Trump’s green light came with a promise to veto any such moves against Israel by the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Netanyahu indicated to Israeli reporters. For Mr. Netanyahu, who is battling for his future after being charged in three corruption cases, annexation offers the opportunity to lay down a legacy beyond being the country’s longest-serving prime minister and the first sitting one to be indicted. Mr. Netanyahu’s challenger, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, has opposed any unilateral annexation and has said that there is no rush to annex territory until after the March 2 elections. His party issued a statement Tuesday hailing Mr. Trump’s plan as “historic” and calling it “entirely consistent with the principles of state and security” espoused by the party. But it stuck to its call for international coordination, describing the plan as a “strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinians,” and emphasizing the need to preserve the existing treaties with Jordan and Egypt. Opponents of the Trump plan and of unilateral Israeli action warn of a potential domino effect leading to violence.  Ominously, the Israeli military said Tuesday it was bolstering its infantry forces in the Jordan Valley in response to security assessments, with the defense minister warning of unrest on the West Bank and of the possibility that Palestinian security forces might not cooperate in suppressing it. Critics said annexation could damage Israel’s already strained relations with Jordan, which has a large Palestinian population. The plan’s radical overhaul of the basic terms of reference for talks could so poison the atmosphere as to close the door on negotiations “for years or even decades to come,” said Yonatan Touval, an analyst at Mitvim, a left-leaning Israeli foreign policy institute. And annexation could give more fodder to the International Criminal Court, which is examining a potential war crimes case against Israel for its settlement activity on the West Bank. Yet defenders of the plan said the 1967 lines had not been sacred for a long time: The Bush administration said in 2004 that changing “realities on the ground” should be taken into account in redrawing the boundary between Israel and the West Bank. And while the Israeli response to previous American proposals has traditionally been “yes, with reservations,” Israelis say Palestinian response has either been negative or nonexistent. With the Palestinians missing in action, according to Dore Gold, a longtime Netanyahu adviser who said he had also been consulted by the Trump team, the plan is “a kind of declaration that the old paradigm had failed and that something new was needed.” Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, said Israelis would  prefer a bilaterally negotiated agreement. “But when the neighbors are not coming to the table, what’s the alternative?” he said.

Chinese Officials Race to Contain Anger Over Virus,2020-01-27,By Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers,"['WUHAN, China — The Chinese government scrambled to contain not only the coronavirus epidemic but also growing expressions of public fury over the management of the crisis as the death toll rose on Tuesday to at least 106. China’s National Immigration Administration on Tuesday encouraged Chinese citizens to reconsider the timing of overseas travel to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, it said on its WeChat account. That came as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged American citizens to avoid nonessential travel to China.  Premier Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese government, flew on Monday into Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to show support for medical workers and to pledge needed medical supplies — only to be mocked online for leading workers in an encouraging cheer. Mr. Li’s visit, which featured prominently in state media, came as Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged that the local authorities had moved too slowly in the first days of the crisis. In an interview with CCTV, the main state television network, the mayor said that information about the coronavirus had not been shared with the public in a timely manner, and that he and the city’s Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, were prepared to resign to “appease public indignation.” “Our names will live in infamy for shutting the door” of the city, Mr. Zhou said. “But we believe that as long as it helps to control the disease, helps keep people’s lives safe, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will shoulder any responsibility,” Mr. Zhou said. The offer to resign, which was not immediately acted on, suggested that China’s harshly practical party hierarchy could settle on local officials like the mayor and the party secretary as sacrifices to ease public ire over a spiraling public health crisis that also threatens to take a large economic toll. With the death toll rising to at least 106, and infections spreading to still more countries, the impacts reverberated globally. Stocks tumbled and oil prices fell on Monday as the virus’s spread worried investors worldwide. The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent, its sharpest decline in nearly four months, with shares of airlines and companies dependent on tourism from China particularly hard hit. Major stock benchmarks in Europe were down more than 2 percent. While many markets in Asia were closed for the holiday, Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 2 percent. China’s currency also fell, while investors moved into safe havens like gold. In China, the government announced that it would extend for three days the weeklong holiday for the Lunar New Year, which had been scheduled to end on Thursday. The country’s economy, which is experiencing its worst slowdown in nearly three decades, is already hurting from the impact of the outbreak, and there are fears that consumer spending will fall as residents stay home over the extended holiday. In Beijing, where 72 cases had been reported by Monday morning, officials warned that anyone who returned to the city from other parts of China must confine themselves to their homes for 14 days. That could significantly reduce the city’s work force even after the extended holiday ends. Hundreds of millions of people travel during the holiday, which began on Saturday, and would normally begin returning in the coming days. In Shanghai, the country’s financial center, the authorities ordered businesses to stay closed until midnight on Feb. 9. In nearby Suzhou, a large manufacturing hub, businesses there were ordered to open no sooner than Feb. 8. Some companies, including the internet giant Tencent, also told their workers to stay home until Feb. 10. The epidemic has already shuttered many major tourist attractions, including the Disney theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall outside of Beijing. Major film studios postponed the opening of movies at what would normally have been a peak viewing season, while several sporting events were canceled or postponed. China’s professional basketball league, the C.B.A., announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely. The crisis has emerged as an unexpected challenge for the Communist Party leadership, especially for President Xi Jinping, who said nothing in public about the matter until he convened an extraordinary meeting of the party’s Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday. Mr. Li, an economist who has been premier since 2013, has taken the formal lead of China’s crisis management team for the epidemic. But the much more powerful Mr. Xi, who is also the Communist Party leader, has signaled that he is the real power in charge. Only days earlier, Mr. Li had reflected less urgency about the viral outbreak when discussing it — without wearing a medical mask — while meeting medical workers in faraway Qinghai province. On Monday, by contrast, he made several appearances around Wuhan, visiting a hospital, where he promised to deliver 20,000 surgical masks, and a supermarket, where — now wearing a mask — he led workers in a chant. “Wuhan,” he said. “Jia you,” they responded in chorus, using a phrase that means “add oil” but is roughly translated as a rousing “Go!” On Twitter, which is blocked in China, the gesture was mocked. “Wuhan pneumonia is afraid of slogans,” one user posted in Chinese. Wuhan’s residents have largely hunkered down to quietly wait out the epidemic. They mostly stay inside their homes, venturing out for supplies and food, medical visits and occasional bursts of exercise. Still, several said they had heard about Mr. Li’s visit and welcomed it as a sign that the central leadership was committed to supporting the city and surrounding areas, which have been locked down since last week. “This shows that they’re getting serious,” said Shao Shigui, a retired steelworker from southwest China who was strolling on a promenade by the Yangtze River. He had come to Wuhan with his wife to help their daughter, who is pregnant, and said he was taking a break from the monotony of staying indoors. “In China, if a leader visits, that shows that all the resources of the government can be mobilized,” he said. The United States, Japan, France, Russia and other countries, meanwhile, scrambled to get citizens who were trapped in the city out, after the government shut down the major modes of transportation. Since then the city of 11 million has descended into a surreal quiet — except around the hospitals. Most shops remained closed, but supermarkets, fresh produce stores and pharmacies opened, although many pharmacies have run out of protective masks, hand disinfectant and other supplies needed to protect against the virus. Residents with fevers and coughs who worried that they may have contracted the coronavirus continued to line up at clinics and hospitals, but in fewer numbers than previous days. The streets were mostly free of cars, and many residents walked or rode bicycles to do their shopping. “It’s possible to live, but it’s not a real New Year,” said Qiu Dongjun, a 38-year-old construction worker from rural Hubei who was carrying a bag of groceries. “I’ve been eating so many containers of instant noodles that my mouth and nose are flaming raw.” He said Mr. Li’s visit was a promising political gesture. “People in Wuhan have many practical problems,” he said. “How will our wages get paid? What if businesses go under? Who will ensure we get our unpaid wages? These are practical problems,” he said, his voice partly muffled by his protective mask. “You can’t expect all those problems to be solved in Beijing,” he said before walking off. The mayor of Wuhan, Mr. Zhou, defended his actions even as he accepted responsibility for falling short. He said he had been hampered from alerting the public sooner because of the reporting rules under the laws governing disease outbreaks. He suggested he had to wait for approval from higher-level officials. One woman responded angrily in the comments page below the People’s Daily’s live stream of the mayor’s interview on Weibo, the popular Chinese social media platform. She noted that the government had informed the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, but not the public most directly affected until Jan. 20. “The Wuhan government will be condemned throughout the ages if it turns the map of China all red,” she wrote, referring to maps depicting the spread of the virus. After weeks of limited steps before the gravity of the epidemic was recognized, government agencies have galvanized to fight the crisis, setting aside other priorities for now. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a notice dated Sunday that banks “must not blindly call in loans, cut off lending or hold off on lending” in response to the crisis. On Monday, State Grid, the government-controlled electricity provider, said it would halt the shut-off of electricity to residents whose bills fall into arrears while authorities deal with the outbreak.

Modi Prepares to Welcome Trump to India,2020-01-28,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Vindu Goel,"['NEW DELHI — Mysterious figures in sunglasses have scoped out the Taj Mahal. The hunt is on for rally venues and presidential suites. Officials in two countries are rushing ahead with feverish preparations, including final negotiations for a much-anticipated trade deal. President Trump is expected to swoop into India for a full-fledged state visit in late February, according to Indian officials. Mr. Trump, apparently eager to get out of the Washington caldron and as far away from the impeachment debate as possible, plans to spend about two days in India, a country where the United States is eager for more business and looking to find a counterweight to the rise of China. His counterpart in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has his own deepening political troubles to duck, and this visit could be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Modi’s recent policies that have deeply divided India and set off deadly nationwide protests. In recent weeks, Indians from all walks of life have railed against Mr. Modi’s government for backing a new citizenship law that is widely seen as discriminatory toward India’s Muslim minority and a blow to India’s roots as a secular democracy. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have shared a stage before, at an event in Texas called “Howdy, Modi.” Tens of thousands of Indian-Americans cheered on two populist leaders who have further polarized their own societies. The Indian news media has kicked into high gear. Its stories explore where Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi might share the stage this time, with a giant cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, in Mr. Modi’s home state of Gujarat, as one possibility. Mr. Trump is expected to stay at the same fancy hotel near the American Embassy in New Delhi, the capital, that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama used. According to accounts in the Indian news media, this trip originated during a phone call in early January, when Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump exchanged New Year’s best wishes and then spoke of getting together soon. “Howdy Trump: US President to visit India,’’ read one headline on Tuesday. A visit from an American president right now could help Mr. Modi, who for the first time since he came into office nearly six years ago faces widespread street protests against him. In August, his government revoked the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, a conflict-ridden territory that had been India’s only Muslim-majority state. To contain the disquiet, the government arrested thousands of Kashmiris without charges and shut down internet and phone service across Kashmir, throwing the area, home to as many as eight million people, into a communications black hole. (Some restrictions were just lifted.) Then in December, Mr. Modi’s government made an even more contentious decision. It passed a new law that makes it easier for migrants from all major faiths except Islam to gain Indian citizenship. Deadly demonstrations erupted, fueled by deep concerns that Mr. Modi, whose political party espouses a Hindu-centric worldview, was trying to dismantle India’s long tradition of tolerance and make India a Hindu-first nation. These moves have put Mr. Modi on the defensive, especially abroad. Some American officials have called for sanctions, and the European Union is considering half a dozen critical resolutions in its Parliament. American officials have remained tight-lipped about Mr. Trump’s India plans, citing security concerns. Several Indian news sites ran pictures this month showing a large American delegation, with many team members wearing sunglasses, visiting the Taj Mahal in an apparent security review. The tentative plans include events around New Delhi and excursions. Analysts have said that one reason a Modi-Trump event might be held in Gujarat is that many Indian-Americans trace their heritage back to Gujarat, a coastal state with a history of trading. Visiting there could lift Mr. Trump’s political fortunes among Indian-Americans who tend to be affluent and politically active. Gujarat is also where Mr. Modi is still wildly popular, despite the recent knocks he has taken for the citizenship law. Indian officials are eager to stage an event at a new 110,000-seat cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, which Mr. Modi’s side has vowed to fill with fans. Behind the pageantry, Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will have to navigate some tricky geopolitics. For years, American officials have been trying to woo India into a closer strategic partnership to contain China, though India has remained lukewarm. American and Indian officials are also eager to ink a trade deal. India’s per capita gross domestic product is about $2,000, compared to about $63,000 for the United States, according to World Bank data. But because of its scale — 1.3 billion people — India is one of the world’s largest economies. The Trump administration is obsessed with the overall American trade deficit and wants India to buy more American goods. Many analysts and business leaders believe Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will sign a limited trade deal — the first significant rapprochement after more than a year of escalating tariffs and countertariffs. India has long been one of the world’s most protectionist countries, imposing high tariffs and a maze of regulations that hamper foreign companies. India has tentatively agreed to end price caps on imported medical devices like heart stents and artificial knees, which had been a key sticking point in the talks, said business leaders briefed on the discussions. The Modi government, for its part, is insisting that the Trump administration restore a preferential trade status for India that lowers tariffs on goods like textiles. Before granting any concessions on that front, the United States wants India to promise to purchase billions of dollars of American turkeys, blueberries, apples, pecans and other agricultural products to help reduce a $25 billion trade deficit with India. The two leaders may also announce another major Indian purchase of American weapons. For Mr. Trump, who has been facing an impeachment trial and is beginning his re-election campaign, even a modest deal with India would allow him to tell voters that his tough talk on trade is working. He has loudly complained about India’s high tariffs, particularly on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. For Mr. Modi, who is battling an economic slowdown, an agreement would ease perceptions that his nationalist government is hostile to foreign companies. It could also help inject a little momentum into India’s economy at a time when Mr. Modi is eager to talk about anything other than the citizenship law.

Powerful Storm Kills 47 in Brazil,2020-01-27,By Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado,"['Heavy rains have swept over southeastern Brazil, leaving at least 47 people dead and four missing and forcing over 18,000 people from their homes. Several cities and towns suffered landslides and floods as rainwater washed over the state of Minas Gerais, overflowing rivers, threatening to burst mining dams and leaving rescue workers scrambling to respond to several emergencies at once. Rain poured over the region on Monday and is expected to continue for at least two days, rescue workers said, raising the threat to mining dams in the region. The storms began just as residents of Brumadinho, a town in the same state, gathered for the first anniversary of a dam break that left up to 270 dead. The fire department, which scrambled to help victims of the storm, is still looking for 11 people who went missing and are presumed dead after the dam burst, releasing an avalanche of mud. A community activist in Brumadinho, Fernanda Perdigão de Oliveira, said she felt as if last year’s tragedy was happening all over again. “There were landslides in several roads,” she said. “Minas became a time bomb with these torrential rains.” Brumadinho is one of 120 towns that are now under a state of emergency because of the current storm, according to local fire departments. The National Mining Agency said Monday that it demanded that companies in charge of the dams keep a close watch on them in Minas Gerais and three other states at least until Friday. The city of Belo Horizonte, the state capital, registered between Friday and Saturday the largest volume of rain recorded in the 110 years since measures have been kept, according to the National Institute of Meteorology. The force of the floodwaters flowing underneath one of Belo Horizonte’s main avenues caused the pavement to explode into geysers. Tragic stories are mounting as fire departments release information about victims. In the city of Ibirité, on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte, four people were found dead after the house they were in was entirely buried by a landslide on Friday. Among them were a 5-month-old baby and a six-year-old child. Col. Sérgio José Ferreira, the commander of Belo Horizonte’s rescue operation, said that on that Friday, the fire department had to deal with seven different landslide events at the same time — two of them involving people who were still alive. “While we are working to rescue people, we know that the longer people are missing, the smaller the chance we have of finding them,” he said. “We had never seen rains like these.” Officials with the state government said a housing deficit, poverty and the lack of oversight worsened the storm’s impact. Governor Romeu Zema of Minas Gerais said many victims had built their homes irregularly, on dangerous slopes. “There is a lack of urban planning,” he said. “A definitive solution will only come in the long run as we have conditions to enact a housing policy that provides homes for people in neighborhoods that are risk free.” Heavy rains had already cost nine lives in the neighboring state of Espírito Santo ten days earlier, and forced more than 10,000 from their homes, according to reports in the local media. José Carlos Carvalho, a former environment minister, said he also saw signs in the tragedy that Brazil might be starting to suffer the consequences of climate change. “The first signs of climate change are extreme events,” he said. “There is a transformation of our climate pattern.”']","Rain is still pouring over the affected region, overwhelming rescue workers and worsening conditions for the 18,000 people who have been forced from their homes.

"At Auschwitz, Holocaust Survivors Plead ‘Never Forget’",2020-01-27,By Joanna Berendt,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — They wore scarves emblazoned with their prisoner numbers, the same ones tattooed on their arms. Many were frail, walking only with the support of friends or relatives. And as they slowly made their way, one by one, to what had been the wall of death, where thousands of prisoners were lined up for summary execution, it was a vivid reminder that before long the last eyewitnesses to the crimes that took place in Auschwitz will be gone. “What can I say? All I have are these tears to pour over the past,” Batsheva Dagan, 95, told the crowd that gathered Monday for a solemn ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp. “I feel uplifted when I see so many of you here who will carry the memory of innocent people from all nations of the world who met their death here,” she said, her voice often cracking with emotion. “You will make sure that those horrors are never repeated. I’m sorry, I apologize for the emotions.” The ceremony at Auschwitz culminated a week of events around the world, including a commemoration in Jerusalem attended by dozens of world leaders, who urged collective vigilance against a resurgence of anti-Semitism worldwide. Fifteen years ago, some 1,500 survivors attended the anniversary event. This year, there were about 200, and, for many, it is likely to be their last visit. As those who can testify to the monstrous crimes of the Holocaust dwindle in number, there is growing concern about the efforts by political leaders to bend the historical narrative of World War II to suit their own ends. In the weeks leading up to the anniversary, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had repeatedly whitewashed the Soviet treaty with Nazi Germany before World War II and the subsequent subjugation of Poland by both countries at the outbreak of the war. At the same time, he accused Poles of collaborating with Germans and participating in the Holocaust. As a result, Russia was not invited to the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, even though the Soviet Army liberated the camp. The president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, refused to attend the Jerusalem event because he was not asked to speak, though Mr. Putin was. But the Polish government has tried to weaponize history for its own ends as well, passing a broadly written law that would have made it a crime to accuse Poland of collaboration in the Holocaust. After an international uproar, with critics charging that the bill would stifle free speech and academic freedom, the government reversed course. Organizers of Monday’s ceremony stressed the modern-day lessons of the history of Auschwitz. “We see those old ghosts rear their heads everywhere today,” said Piotr Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. “Anti-Semitism, racism, demagogy, contempt and hatred,” he continued. “We are becoming more and more indifferent, introverted, apathetic and passive. Most were silent as the Syrians were drowning, we silently turned our backs on the Congolese people and the Rohingya people, and now the Uighurs. Our silence is our severe defeat.” As he spoke — on the same ground where 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, were murdered — delegations from more than 50 countries looked on. The ceremony was designed to be as free from politics as possible, with the focus on fighting anti-Semitism and giving survivors one more chance to tell their stories. Although the Holocaust remains a critical area of research for many historians and is a staple of school curriculums in many countries, there is fear that the memory of what happened at the camps is fading among younger generations. Prominent Jewish organizations, including the European Jewish Association, urged parliamentarians from across the Continent to toughen anti-Semitism laws in their countries as well as promote Holocaust education. That sentiment was echoed throughout the ceremony. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire and president of the World Jewish Congress, said, “The attacks on Jews, the killings, the vicious slanders have only grown worse, and they have even spread to my country.” “Words are not enough,” he said. “Political speeches are not enough. Laws must be passed. Severe, tough, real laws that will put these hatemongers away in prison for a long, long time. Children must be educated and know where the hatred of Jews leads.” The former prisoners of Auschwitz, in a series of emotional speeches, drove that point home. Most are over 90, with a few pushing 100. In the days before the ceremony, several were forced to cancel because of frail health. A team of at least 80 medical professionals, psychologists and volunteers was organized to assist the survivors, both physically and emotionally. Their stories, even all these years later, remain shocking. The day before the ceremony, Ben Lesser, 92, offered to share his experience. A Polish-born Jew, he was just 15 when he, along with his parents and four siblings, were greeted at the Auschwitz concentration camp in May 1944 by Josef Mengele. The infamous doctor surveyed newcomers to determine who was fit for labor and who was to be immediately executed. Two of his brothers and sisters were told to “go left,” referring to a line for the gas chambers. Mr. Lesser lied to Dr. Mengele, saying he was 18, healthy and fit to work. “He asked me if I can run five kilometers,” he said. “I answered yes and was told to go right.” Mr. Lesser may have been saved from death, but not from witnessing the horrors of a place that became known as the factory of death. He said he still remembered “screams of children thrown into fiery pits” and considered it his moral duty to speak of what he experienced for as long as he can. “People would love to forget the hard truths and that’s why we need to keep coming back here to refresh our memories and keep the world from acquiring amnesia,” said Mr. Lesser, founder of Zachor, a foundation dedicated to ensuring the remembrance of the Holocaust. “Unfortunately, we can’t live forever. What happens after we are gone, I don’t know.” Marian Turski, 93, a historian and Auschwitz survivor, said he attended the event as much for his daughter and grandchildren as for himself. Speaking during the ceremony, he urged people to pay attention to what was happening in the world and to speak out. “Don’t be indifferent,” he said. “That’s what I want to say today to my daughter, my grandchildren and their peers, wherever they are.” “Don’t be indifferent when you witness historical lies,” he said. “Don’t be indifferent when the past is manipulated for the sake of current political interests. Don’t be indifferent when any minority is discriminated against.”']","Organizers sought to put a spotlight on the stories of survivors, as this may be the last time that such a large number will be able to gather in one place."
Trump’s Mideast Plan Leaves Palestinians With Few Options,2020-01-29,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — For Mahmoud Abbas, the ailing octogenarian president of the Palestinian Authority, his life’s work — a viable state side-by-side with Israel — is quickly slipping away. President Trump’s Middle East plan deprives the Palestinians of nearly everything they had been fighting for: East Jerusalem as their national capital, the removal of Jewish settlements on the West Bank, and territorial contiguity and control over their own borders and security that a sovereign state normally enjoys. While it was always presumed that such a state would be forged through talks with the Israelis, years of failure, a weak and divided Palestinian leadership, and an Arab world that has largely moved on have all emboldened Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to try to impose a solution of their own. The landscape has shifted so much in recent years that Mr. Abbas has few good options. With only muted reaction from Arab neighbors, a struggling Palestinian economy, little apparent appetite among Palestinians for a violent response and the United States having abandoned any pretense of neutral mediation, a proposal that might have been considered outlandish a decade ago landed with little serious opposition. Rather than fighting back, some Palestinian activists on Wednesday were saying the best option may be breaking up the Palestinian Authority, leaving Israel to assume the burden of providing for the West Bank’s 2.5 million Palestinians. Mr. Abbas could decide that this is the moment for dramatic pushback, like walking away from the security cooperation that has long helped protect Israelis from terrorism. He could try to unleash violence to try to draw more global attention. But if his overriding motive is self-preservation, the safer option would be to try to weather the storm, hoping that Mr. Trump is defeated in November, or Mr. Netanyahu even sooner. That focus on his own survival, as Mr. Abbas’s many local detractors are keenly aware, would place him in the same category as his American and Israeli adversaries — leaders whose personal and political predicaments appear to be driving them in making the weightiest decisions of state. “One guy’s dealing with impeachment, another with an indictment, and Abbas is 85 years old,” said Dimitri Diliani, a 46-year-old member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council who is impatient for the president, who is still 84, to go. “He’s looking for a way to dodge the bullet and stay in power.” But even if they wanted to, Palestinians have only a limited ability to stand up to an American-Israeli partnership. Yara Hawari, 31, a scholar and analyst for Al Shabaka, a network of Palestinian analysts, said the Trump plan was becoming a cautionary tale about the diminishing importance of international law when those making the rules are unafraid to exploit their power. “What happens here can happen elsewhere very easily,” she said. “If you don’t care for the Palestinians, at least care for yourselves.” The assorted calls for action from Palestinian activists, thinkers and analysts eager to shake up the prevailing inertia sounded like variations on a theme of admitting the failure of the Palestinian Authority to grow into a state. Some called for the authority to dismantle itself, which would require Israel to take on the costs of health, education, social welfare and policing of West Bank Palestinians, and would remove an entity that they see as camouflaging the occupation’s ugliness. “We couldn’t have seen 50 presidents and prime ministers in Israel last week if it was revealed as an apartheid state,” said Hamada Jaber, an activist in Ramallah, referring to a Holocaust commemoration in Jerusalem that attracted dozens of world leaders. “It’s still hiding itself behind the P.A.” But Tareq Baconi, 36, a Palestinian analyst for International Crisis Group, cautioned that any wind-down of the authority should be strategic, not impulsive. “There needs to be a serious exploration — not another empty threat from the president’s office — of what dismantling the P.A. looks like,” he said. “How will the economy be managed, what kind of resilience infrastructure needs to be built to take its place, and how can security cooperation end without endangering Palestinians or risking instability?” Mr. Abbas has remained typically opaque, offering little insight into his current thinking. One of the weaknesses and failings of the leadership, said Sari Nusseibeh, 70, the former president of Al Quds University, was “its inability to address the people openly and to present ideas.” “I don’t know if they are doing any thinking at a deep level,” Mr. Nusseibeh continued, “and Abbas, as people say, is very much a one-man show.” He is also increasingly authoritarian, as Ms. Hawari noted. “I’m trying not to fall into the trap of calling for anything so I don’t get arrested,” she said, adding, “I don’t see a just and free Palestinian future with the P.A. in place.” Mr. Abbas called again Tuesday for elections, prompting eye rolls among critics who note he is entering the 16th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Few believe he is serious. A better idea, several said, would be to hold elections for the Palestine Liberation Organization, as a way of revitalizing the group still widely seen as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Still, many Palestinians view the authority, one of the few tangible achievements of the national cause, as worth preserving. “Personally I don’t think handing over the keys is a smart move,” said Nour Odeh, a Palestinian writer and analyst. “A right-wing Israel drunk on power with Trump’s support couldn’t care less,” she said, adding: “We built these institutions with the blood and sweat of our sons and daughters. Why give it up?” Raja Khalidi, a development economist who runs a research institute, said there was the added matter of a sense of duty. “I can’t see any political leadership walking away from the responsibility it’s assumed for 30 years and allowing Israel to return to that role,” he said. Disillusioned about statehood, especially the kind of statehood now on offer, Palestinians are increasingly rejecting a two-state solution to work for a single state with equal rights and the vote for all people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. That idea, though, is “unrealistic,” said Sani Meo, publisher of This Week in Palestine, a Ramallah-based magazine. “Of course Israel will never give us the vote.” A more immediate measure many Palestinians want is an end to Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, which they see more as collaboration with the enemy. Mr. Abbas has resisted that so far because the teamwork with Israel also helps keep Hamas at bay in the West Bank, ensuring his survival. Equally popular would be national reconciliation and the healing of the 13-year bitter schism between Mr. Abbas’s Fatah-led Authority in the West Bank and his rivals in Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. There was a veneer of unity the night the Trump plan was announced, with Mr. Abbas and the head of Hamas’s politburo, Ismail Haniya, speaking by phone. But few believe it will go anywhere. And the leadership has problems other than disunity. Mr. Baconi of the International Crisis Group recalled that before the British election last month, he sat with Palestinian officials who expressed the seemingly far-fetched hope that Jeremy Corbyn would win, Mr. Netanyahu would be defeated and Bernie Sanders would be elected president of the United States. “It misses the point that you don’t manage the context, you operate in it,” Mr. Baconi said. So far, though the Israeli military sent reinforcements into the West Bank and along the Gaza border on Wednesday, Palestinians were not taking to the streets in large numbers. It would be wrong to read that as acquiescence, Ms. Hawari said. The Palestinian grass roots have been weakened over time, she said, not just by the Israelis but also by the authority’s own repression, since protesters against the Israeli occupation also sometimes protest against autocracy and the corruption of their own leaders. She added that the hundreds of Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers at demonstrations along the Gaza fence had set a “really gruesome precedent” for how Israel might respond to a mass mobilization. “If thousands of us went down to the streets in the West Bank, do you think that would be met lightly?” she asked. Mr. Diliani, the Fatah Revolutionary Council member, said Palestinians were torn over whom to protest against. “Do we overcome our internal problems with Abbas first?” he asked. “Or with Israel?” He added: “You will hear this conversation in every restaurant, everywhere you go. Who do we target first? Who should we fight?” What Palestinians of every age and background still can agree on is the idea that merely staying on the land, with steadfastness, or “sumud” in Arabic, is an act of resistance. “We are not going anywhere,” Ms. Odeh, the writer, said. Their mere presence, she said, poses a long-term challenge to Israel’s right wing, not to mention Zionism itself. Mr. Khalidi, the economist, said Palestinians needed to focus inward while they wait for a better set of circumstances. “How do we get back to being one community?” he asked. “What can we do to get people engaged in building their lives, and their nation, without it necessarily being a state?” “What do I need a state for,” he added, “if it doesn’t give me more than I already have?”']",The landscape has shifted so much that a proposal that would have been a nonstarter a decade ago has put the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in a bind.
Foreigners Airlifted From Chinese City at Heart of Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-01-29,By Miriam Jordan and Austin Ramzy,"['LOS ANGELES — About 200 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, landed at a military base in Southern California on Wednesday, as countries around the world began pulling their citizens from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. “The whole plane erupted in cheers when the crew said, ‘Welcome home to the United States,’” said Dr. Anne Zink, the chief medical officer for Alaska, where the plane stopped en route to California. But “home” was not immediately in the cards for the evacuees. Upon landing at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, the passengers were met on the tarmac by personnel in biohazard suits, loaded onto waiting buses and instructed to remain on the base for three days of medical screening. Only when they are cleared will they be allowed to continue on home. The authorities, however, were at pains to to say it was not a quarantine. “We are respecting the rights of them as individuals,” said Dr. Nancy Knight, a senior official with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are doing that in a way that protects their health, the health of uniformed service members and the health of the community.” The passengers, mostly American consular officials and their families, returned to the United States as the coronavirus continued to spread around the globe, with the number of cases spiking dramatically and two major airlines canceling all flights to and from China. By early Thursday, there were confirmed reports of infection in at least 16 countries, with more than 7,700 cases in China alone — topping the SARS outbreak there in 2002 and 2003. The official death toll there stood at 170, but the real number is believed to be much higher. On Thursday, the World Health Organization will again take up the question of whether to declare a global health emergency. As governments around the world struggle to detect and prevent infection, it was clear on Wednesday that there was no international consensus on the best way to proceed. However carefully the health authorities chose their words, the evacuees in the United States, for example, appeared to be, for all practical purposes, quarantined. They will also be monitored for 14 days by medical teams in their own communities when they go home. In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said citizens evacuated from Wuhan would be held for a two-week quarantine on Christmas Island, also the site of an Australian immigration detention center. And South Korea’s National Police Agency said that it had instructed its officers that they have the power to detain people who are suspected of carrying the coronavirus and refuse to be quarantined. But other countries were taking a less strict approach. Japan, for example, also evacuated citizens from China, but acquiesced when two evacuees who did not have symptoms declined to see a doctor. A third evacuee who did show symptoms was allowed to wait for test results at home. As it spreads globally, the new coronavirus, which was first discovered in China last month, has begun to infect people who never visited China. Some have fallen ill in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. “We’ve seen it spread between people in Wuhan, in other parts of China, and now these countries,” said Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. “What we don’t know is how quickly it spreads,” Dr. Cowling said. “We’ve seen small clusters, but we don’t know if those turn into chains of transmission that grow from two to four to eight to 16 — or if it can be controlled and won’t be further transmitted.” As countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan — among them France, South Korea, Morocco, Germany, Kazakhstan, Britain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands and Myanmar — commercial airlines curtailed service to China. British Airways and Air Canada suspended flights altogether. The Americans who were repatriated on Wednesday landed at the air base shortly after 8 a.m. after the State Department-chartered flight stopped in Anchorage to refuel and for the passengers to be screened — twice — for the virus. At a news conference later in Riverside, Christopher R. Braden, a deputy director of the disease control centers, said the Americans would be “fully evaluated.” “We think we can do the full evaluation in three days,” Dr. Braden said. “Some of that evaluation is taking tests and flying samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta.” The agency has the country’s only laboratory that can test for the coronavirus. At a raucous, packed news conference, Dr. Braden and Dr. Knight were peppered with questions about the wisdom of releasing the former Wuhan residents into communities across the country. Dr. Braden said that if an evacuee deemed a danger to the community insisted on leaving before the 72-hour period expired, “we can institute an individual quarantine for that person — and we will.” But he also said there was no indication that anyone wanted to leave right away. Some Americans remained stranded in Wuhan, unable to secure a seat on the plane. Family members were incensed to learn that the Boeing 747 had taken off with empty seats. Some passengers lacked the proper documentation, and others did not show up, Dr. Braden said. In the end, around 200 passengers were evacuated, not the expected 240, he said. “I don’t even know what to say to those numbers,” said Jiacheng Yu of Dallas, whose mother, Ying Cheng, a 61-year-old American citizen, was visiting her own mother in Wuhan for the Lunar New Year and could not get a seat. When asked whether other flights were planned, a State Department official said its embassy in Beijing “continues to work with the Chinese authorities on other options for U.S. citizens in Wuhan to depart Wuhan and/or China.” At least one American chose not to try to board Wednesday’s flight. Winifred Conrad, a 27-year-old English teacher, had a lingering cough and was afraid she would instead be handed over to Chinese officials, said her mother, Anastasia Coles of Lubbock, Texas. But there was another reason: Ms. Conrad’s cat, Lulu. In text message to her mother, she said: “Don’t freak out. I was offered a seat and I surrendered it to a 10-year-old girl.” She added, “I was told I can’t bring an animal.” The number of confirmed cases in China increased by nearly 30 percent from Wednesday to Thursday, according to the country’s National Health Commission. The Chinese health authorities said Thursday that 170 people had died from the virus in the country. The previous count, on Wednesday, was 132. Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei, the home of province of Wuhan, said Wednesday evening that the fight against the virus was at a crucial point, and that medical supplies were severely insufficient. As cases emerged outside China, some appeared to involve infections between family members, who are at greater risk while caring for sick relatives. Others, however, appear to have spread between people with less intimate connections. A Japanese tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two tour groups visiting Japan from Wuhan was confirmed to have the virus, officials said on Tuesday. He had no history of traveling to Wuhan. “I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. “That’s very concerning.” On Tuesday, German officials said a 33-year-old man from Starnberg, a town near Munich, was apparently infected with the virus after attending a training event with a Chinese colleague on Jan. 21. The colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated in isolation and officials were tracing people who had been in contact with him. Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company had also been infected. They were admitted to a clinic in Munich, where they, too, were to be isolated. Forty other people who came into close contact with the company employees were to be tested on Wednesday, officials said. The outbreak and the travel restrictions it has led to have already had a big impact on businesses, some of which are temporarily halting operations in parts of China. Starbucks, for example, said it was temporarily closing half of its stores in the country. Closing were also announced by McDonald’s and Yum China, which operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China. And Apple said the outbreak could disrupt suppliers and its revenues. Miriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong. Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman from Hong Kong; Motoko Rich, Makiko Inoue and Eimi Yamamitsu from Tokyo; and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea. ']",More than a dozen nations pulled their citizens from Wuhan. But how evacuees were handled once they got home varied country by country.

"Before the Liberation of Auschwitz, a March of Misery",2020-01-27,By Marc Santora and Maciek Nabrdalik,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Along a desolate stretch of road in southeastern Poland, a dozen miles from Auschwitz, there is a graveyard. Candles and fresh flowers cover nearly all the marble tombs. But in the corner stands a large black marble slab separated from the rest. “Forty-two victims, women, men and children, prisoners from the Auschwitz concentration camp, who were murdered by the Nazis during the death march, and died on Jan. 18, 1945, in the village area of Miedzna were buried in a mass grave in this cemetery,” an inscription explains. But there are only four names. Another 21 people are identified by their inmate numbers. And 17 have never been identified. Seventy-five years ago on Jan. 27, Soviet forces swept across Poland from the east and liberated Auschwitz, the camp complex where 1.3 million were enslaved — and 1.1 million among them systematically murdered — during the war. But before they could arrive, the Nazis force marched some 56,000 weakened prisoners out of the camp ahead of their advance, in the dead of winter, with an estimated 15,000 shot or dying of cold, hunger and illness along the way. Similar marches were taking place all across the eastern front after the SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered that all able-bodied prisoners be taken to the Reich. Despite years of study and troves of testimony from witnesses, the chaos of that evacuation is one of the least understood periods of the Holocaust. Himmler’s orders served several purposes, according to research by the United States Holocaust Museum. First, he wanted to eliminate evidence of German crimes and witnesses who could testify to those crimes. He also hoped to use inmates as slave labor to keep the German war going. And rather irrationally, he believed that the prisoners could be used as bargaining chips in any peace negotiations. While death might not have been the goal of the marches, that was indeed the fate of many, as the scattered gravestones that remain along these roads today attest. Zofia Posmysz still remembers her inmate number: 7566. Sitting in her neatly kept apartment in Warsaw, the 96-year-old survivor remembered the biting cold on the night the guards gathered thousands of women outside the gates of Birkenau, a death camp that was part of the Auschwitz complex. “We didn’t know what it meant that we would leave the camp,” she said. “We didn’t know if we would have to undergo some sort of selection. “We heard that those who could not walk would get to stay in the hospital, but we weren’t sure if they would be kept alive. We knew nothing and worried.” But how could it be worse than the hell she had endured for three years? One memory came rushing back to her. “One night, I woke up and heard someone singing outside. It was a man’s voice. I thought to myself that our guard wouldn’t probably notice if I sneaked out to have a look. I went outside and saw a man dressed in a black coat. He was singing and raising his arms in the air. Suddenly I felt someone grabbing my arm. It was a Jewish friend from the ward. She asked me: ‘Do you know what he’s singing?’” “‘No,’ I replied. But it was hauntingly beautiful.” “It’s a Hebrew song, a prayer for a good death,” her friend told her. “When we woke up in the morning, there was no more singing; the square was completely empty. All we saw was the smoke coming from the crematory chimney.” Ms. Posmysz was among those made to march. In her memory, after the first bitterly cold night, the days blend together, something Holocaust scholars say is common among those who survived. Her next memory is arriving at the station in Wodzislaw Slaski for a train that would take her to another camp in Germany. She would be moved one more time before the end of the war. Once free, she walked for weeks until she finally made it back to her home in Krakow. Until recently, it would have been possible to find people who lived in the towns and villages along the route who could recall seeing the columns of starving and abused prisoners flanked by Nazi soldiers walking past their homes. Their numbers, like the survivors, grow fewer every year. Maria Kopiasz, 93, still lives in the same house in the town of Brzeszcze that she did during the war, and the grim scene of the march has stayed with her. “They marched in the middle of this road,” she said. “SS men on both sides. Every third of them or so with a German shepherd. I remember mainly women. We knew we couldn’t even show any sympathy as we would be taken with them. I could only watch quietly through the window.” Jan Stolarz, a retired miner, has led a small group of people on a trek to retrace the path of one of the marches for nine years. “I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau with my wife 10 years ago,” he explained. “I saw a handwritten note left by someone in one of the barracks. It read: We live as long as the memory of us is alive. This message resonated with me strongly.” He hopes that in some small way, his walk will help do that. For Poles who were not Jewish, their fate during the war could turn on the smallest things. The Germans who occupied the country had given all the Poles in Silesia a ranking based on ethnic purity, with different categories often determining whether your family lived or died. Eryk Langer, 91, from a town called Studzionka, said that because his father was a friend of the local German mayor they felt protected and got the second highest category. His home was along the death march route and German officers moved in during the evacuation. He said his father asked the officers if they could give the prisoners some spare food, and it was allowed. But all they had was some buckets of water for very few people. “They walked all day long. They were hungry,” he said trailing off. It’s an image he does not want to think about. “In the morning we saw one prisoner shot in front of our gate,” he said. Later, he saw a horse-drawn cart going through the village collecting the dead. At least 18 bodies were collected, and they are buried in the village cemetery. Bernard Halat, 91, also from Studzionka, said that in 1940, he and his family had to report to have their facial features measured to determined if they were Jewish. They were not, but assigned to Category IV, for people who resisted Germanization, they were still deemed undesirable and put on a list of people to be interned at a later date. They managed to avoid the camps but Mr. Halat recalls watching the death marchers pass by his home and thinking how easily his family could have been among them. “So many people. They walked all day long,” he said. “We were afraid.” But he also recalled how two Jewish women escaped and hid in the village. A few years after the war ended, they returned to thank a farmer who had helped them. It was a rare hopeful story on a road full of despair. For the millions who died during the Holocaust, including the thousands who did not die in the camps but along lonely stretches of frozen roads and snow-covered fields, their stories were buried with them long ago.']",
"Before the Liberation of Auschwitz, a March of Misery",2020-01-27,By Marc Santora and Maciek Nabrdalik,"['AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU, Poland — Along a desolate stretch of road in southeastern Poland, a dozen miles from Auschwitz, there is a graveyard. Candles and fresh flowers cover nearly all the marble tombs. But in the corner stands a large black marble slab separated from the rest. “Forty-two victims, women, men and children, prisoners from the Auschwitz concentration camp, who were murdered by the Nazis during the death march, and died on Jan. 18, 1945, in the village area of Miedzna were buried in a mass grave in this cemetery,” an inscription explains. But there are only four names. Another 21 people are identified by their inmate numbers. And 17 have never been identified. Seventy-five years ago on Jan. 27, Soviet forces swept across Poland from the east and liberated Auschwitz, the camp complex where 1.3 million were enslaved — and 1.1 million among them systematically murdered — during the war. But before they could arrive, the Nazis force marched some 56,000 weakened prisoners out of the camp ahead of their advance, in the dead of winter, with an estimated 15,000 shot or dying of cold, hunger and illness along the way. Similar marches were taking place all across the eastern front after the SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered that all able-bodied prisoners be taken to the Reich. Despite years of study and troves of testimony from witnesses, the chaos of that evacuation is one of the least understood periods of the Holocaust. Himmler’s orders served several purposes, according to research by the United States Holocaust Museum. First, he wanted to eliminate evidence of German crimes and witnesses who could testify to those crimes. He also hoped to use inmates as slave labor to keep the German war going. And rather irrationally, he believed that the prisoners could be used as bargaining chips in any peace negotiations. While death might not have been the goal of the marches, that was indeed the fate of many, as the scattered gravestones that remain along these roads today attest. Zofia Posmysz still remembers her inmate number: 7566. Sitting in her neatly kept apartment in Warsaw, the 96-year-old survivor remembered the biting cold on the night the guards gathered thousands of women outside the gates of Birkenau, a death camp that was part of the Auschwitz complex. “We didn’t know what it meant that we would leave the camp,” she said. “We didn’t know if we would have to undergo some sort of selection. “We heard that those who could not walk would get to stay in the hospital, but we weren’t sure if they would be kept alive. We knew nothing and worried.” But how could it be worse than the hell she had endured for three years? One memory came rushing back to her. “One night, I woke up and heard someone singing outside. It was a man’s voice. I thought to myself that our guard wouldn’t probably notice if I sneaked out to have a look. I went outside and saw a man dressed in a black coat. He was singing and raising his arms in the air. Suddenly I felt someone grabbing my arm. It was a Jewish friend from the ward. She asked me: ‘Do you know what he’s singing?’” “‘No,’ I replied. But it was hauntingly beautiful.” “It’s a Hebrew song, a prayer for a good death,” her friend told her. “When we woke up in the morning, there was no more singing; the square was completely empty. All we saw was the smoke coming from the crematory chimney.” Ms. Posmysz was among those made to march. In her memory, after the first bitterly cold night, the days blend together, something Holocaust scholars say is common among those who survived. Her next memory is arriving at the station in Wodzislaw Slaski for a train that would take her to another camp in Germany. She would be moved one more time before the end of the war. Once free, she walked for weeks until she finally made it back to her home in Krakow. Until recently, it would have been possible to find people who lived in the towns and villages along the route who could recall seeing the columns of starving and abused prisoners flanked by Nazi soldiers walking past their homes. Their numbers, like the survivors, grow fewer every year. Maria Kopiasz, 93, still lives in the same house in the town of Brzeszcze that she did during the war, and the grim scene of the march has stayed with her. “They marched in the middle of this road,” she said. “SS men on both sides. Every third of them or so with a German shepherd. I remember mainly women. We knew we couldn’t even show any sympathy as we would be taken with them. I could only watch quietly through the window.” Jan Stolarz, a retired miner, has led a small group of people on a trek to retrace the path of one of the marches for nine years. “I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau with my wife 10 years ago,” he explained. “I saw a handwritten note left by someone in one of the barracks. It read: We live as long as the memory of us is alive. This message resonated with me strongly.” He hopes that in some small way, his walk will help do that. For Poles who were not Jewish, their fate during the war could turn on the smallest things. The Germans who occupied the country had given all the Poles in Silesia a ranking based on ethnic purity, with different categories often determining whether your family lived or died. Eryk Langer, 91, from a town called Studzionka, said that because his father was a friend of the local German mayor they felt protected and got the second highest category. His home was along the death march route and German officers moved in during the evacuation. He said his father asked the officers if they could give the prisoners some spare food, and it was allowed. But all they had was some buckets of water for very few people. “They walked all day long. They were hungry,” he said trailing off. It’s an image he does not want to think about. “In the morning we saw one prisoner shot in front of our gate,” he said. Later, he saw a horse-drawn cart going through the village collecting the dead. At least 18 bodies were collected, and they are buried in the village cemetery. Bernard Halat, 91, also from Studzionka, said that in 1940, he and his family had to report to have their facial features measured to determined if they were Jewish. They were not, but assigned to Category IV, for people who resisted Germanization, they were still deemed undesirable and put on a list of people to be interned at a later date. They managed to avoid the camps but Mr. Halat recalls watching the death marchers pass by his home and thinking how easily his family could have been among them. “So many people. They walked all day long,” he said. “We were afraid.” But he also recalled how two Jewish women escaped and hid in the village. A few years after the war ended, they returned to thank a farmer who had helped them. It was a rare hopeful story on a road full of despair. For the millions who died during the Holocaust, including the thousands who did not die in the camps but along lonely stretches of frozen roads and snow-covered fields, their stories were buried with them long ago.']",
Cease-Fire in Libya Collapses Despite International Efforts,2020-01-27,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['A cease-fire in the Libyan civil war has collapsed and foreign shipments to the combatants have resumed, shredding the work of a conference of world leaders who convened in Berlin just eight days ago. “Battles are raging on all front lines,” Ahmed Mismari, a spokesman for the military forces based in eastern Libya, told reporters over the weekend, according to Reuters. The United Nations had already warned on Friday of “continued blatant violations of the arms embargo” by unnamed foreign powers who had pledged just days earlier to stop supplying weapons to Libyan clients. In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya said, “Over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters.” “The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting,” it added. The end of the cease-fire and the resumption of weapons shipments are grave blows to the United Nations’ attempts to resolve the conflict. But they are also setbacks for rival peace efforts by the leaders of Russia and Turkey, important backers of the two warring sides in the Libya fight. The two leaders had attempted to upstage the United Nations by privately negotiating a truce, but they have failed to impose it on their Libyan clients. Libya has struggled for nearly nine years to shake off the chaos that followed the four-decade rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, toppled in 2011 by an Arab Spring revolt supported by NATO airstrikes. The fighting has shaken world energy markets by threatening access to Libya’s large supplies of oil and gas. The mayhem has also turned the country’s long Mediterranean coastline into a departure point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants and made its vast deserts a haven for bands of extremists. The current round of conflict began last April when forces based in eastern Libya and backing the military leader Khalifa Hifter began an assault on the capital, Tripoli. The city is the headquarters of a United Nations-sponsored provisional government, and a coalition of militias based in western Libya has rushed to defend it against Mr. Hifter. The United Arab Emirates, which sees Mr. Hifter as a strongman who might restore order, has been a major supplier of weaponry to his forces and has sent fighter jets to back him. Analysts following the Libyan war have detected a surge in flights from the United Arab Emirates to Mr. Hifter’s territory in recent days, raising questions about whether the Emiratis were supplying him for a new round of fighting. Russia has also become a major backer of Mr. Hifter. The Kremlin has sent as many as 1,400 mercenaries with the private security company Wagner Group to aid his assault on Tripoli. On the other side, Turkey has been the main military backer of the forces defending Tripoli. In recent weeks, Ankara has also begun sending hundreds of fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian militias to join the defense of Tripoli, transporting them from one quagmire to another. Officials of the Tripoli government have said that the fighters are Arabic-speaking Turkish nationals from the area near the Syrian border, but recent news reports suggest that the fighters are Syrian-born and may have received Turkish citizenship. In its statement on Friday, the United Nations mission to Libya said that it “deeply regrets the continued blatant violations of the arms embargo in Libya, even after the commitments made in this regard by concerned countries during the International Conference on Libya in Berlin.” The leaders of both sides of the Libyan fight have said that they continue to uphold the cease-fire. But both have also said that they were retaliating against rivals’ attacks. In reality, sporadic fighting around the outskirts of Tripoli had continued throughout the cease-fire. By the end of the weekend, however, the clashes had escalated. The United Nations mission said in a statement on Sunday that two missiles had hit the Mitiga International Airport, which serves Tripoli, wounding at least two civilians and damaging buildings. Repeated attacks have often “deprived two million residents in the capital of their only functioning airport,” the mission said. By Monday, fighting had also resumed on another front between the coastal city of Surt, captured in recent weeks by Mr. Hifter’s forces, and the city of Misurata, home of the most potent militias defending Tripoli. A spokesman for Mr. Hifter said his forces near Surt had been forced to respond “after noticeable movements by terrorists in the area.” Mr. Hifter customarily uses the term “terrorists” to describe the forces defending Tripoli.']","Fighting has started anew and foreign shipments of arms have resumed, blasting apart attempts by world leaders to broker a truce."
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Is Hit by Mortars,2020-01-27,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The United States Embassy in Baghdad was struck by mortar fire late Sunday, with at least one shell hitting a dining facility, slightly injuring one person and causing minor building damage, American officials said. It was unclear how many of the other four shells launched in the attack landed inside the embassy compound, but the assault alarmed Washington and prompted debate over how to calibrate the response. For security reasons, neither Iraqi nor American military officials, nor the embassy staff in Baghdad, would discuss locations or other specifics of the attack. The Iraqi government moved quickly to condemn the assault and promised a vigorous investigation. “We denounce the continuation of these outlawed actions that have the goal of weakening the Iraqi state and violating its sovereignty and the sanctity of diplomatic missions on its soil,” Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said in a statement. He said Iraqi forces had been ordered to “search and investigate to prevent such attacks” and to arrest those who launched them. However, in a call with the Iraqi prime minister on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was “outraged” that groups that he described as armed by Iran were continuing to attack American bases and diplomatic posts in Iraq, according to the State Department’s spokeswoman. The spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said Mr. Abdul Mahdi committed to better protect United States facilities in Iraq, but Mr. Pompeo said the attacks displayed a failure to curb the armed groups. “We view last night’s attack on the embassy as an attempt to distract Iraqi and international attention away from the brutal suppression of peaceful Iraqi protesters by Iran and its proxies,” Ms. Ortagus said in a statement describing the call. The State Department was referring to recent moves by the Iraqi security forces to crack down on protesters who are demanding an end to corruption and the election of a new government. The security forces burned protesters’ tents and used tear gas and live fire to try to force them to flee in Baghdad, Basra and Nasiriya. A preliminary investigation found that the 120-millimeter mortar shells were launched on Sunday from the Buaytha area, in the south of Baghdad. During the 2007-8 surge of American troops, the area was a redoubt for Al Qaeda in Iraq, a predecessor to the Islamic State.  A senior Iraqi officer investigating the attack said that using coordinates for the flight path, he and his team had located the launchers. The use of mortars and the area from which they were fired, he said, led him to think that the attack could have been carried out by the Islamic State. Still, the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to journalists, said the weapons were common enough that he could not rule out a Shiite militia faction close to Iran as being responsible.  During the height of Iraq’s civil strife, between roughly 2005 and 2009, both Al Qaeda in Iraq and anti-American Shiite armed groups lobbed mortars at the Green Zone in an effort to hit the American Embassy. The prime minister’s statement, released within hours of the mortars landing in the embassy compound, appeared aimed at reassuring the Americans that the Iraqis were taking the attack seriously and would mount a vigorous response. The comments stand in stark contrast to the response both to the attack on a military base in Kirkuk, Iraq, at the end of December, which resulted in the death of an American contractor, and to the siege of the United States Embassy on Jan. 1. In those cases the government said relatively little, especially after the Kirkuk attack. By contrast, Mr. Abdul Mahdi used his statement on the mortar attack as a way to remind the public, which is divided about whether to have United States troops stay in the country, that using force now against the Americans would risk “dangerous consequences” that could damage Iraqi interests and “drag Iraq into a war.” The strikes come less than a month after the attack in Kirkuk, which set off a series of retaliatory responses that pushed the United States and Iran to the brink of war. The Americans accused Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia with close links to Iran, of responsibility in the Kirkuk attack. There has been no claim of responsibility for Sunday’s rocket attack. Notably, all of the armed groups known to have close ties to Iran went out of their way to deny responsibility and to condemn the attack as damaging to the Iraqi government at a time when it is trying to negotiate the withdrawal of American troops. The military commander for Asaib al-Haq, one of the groups with links to Iran, denied responsibility both on Asaib’s behalf and that of other similar armed factions, which call themselves the “Resistance Group.” “We stress that the recent rocket bombing against the evil embassy in Baghdad is not the action of the Iraqi resistance factions, because we have stressed earlier that the resistance factions will not target the embassies and the diplomatic missions in Iraq,” said Jawad Al-Tilaybawi, the commander of Asaib al-Haq. Similar comments were made by Kataib Hezbollah and the Badr Organization. While rocket fire in the Green Zone in Baghdad has been a regular occurrence in recent months, the rockets fired on Sunday and last week were more accurate, landing closer to the embassy, according to witnesses. Often in the past, the rockets have fallen in the Tigris River, or in the Green Zone but far from the embassy compound. Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","For the second time in a week, shelling targeted the American Embassy in Baghdad. The Iraqi government promised a strong response."
"Despite Calm in Afghan Cities, War in Villages Kills Dozens Daily",2020-01-29,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Over the past couple of months, as American and Taliban negotiators have resumed talks to try to complete a peace deal, an unusual calm has settled over major Afghan cities. Deadly terrorism attacks, once frequent, have suddenly dropped in urban centers. But a series of bloody assaults in the countryside suggests that the calm in the cities could be misleading. The war continues to kill dozens daily. And the patterns of violence in recent months have been tied closely to how negotiations between the United States and the Taliban, held in the Gulf state of Qatar, have played out. With talks now seeming to bog down, some diplomats and political leaders fear that violence could grow deadlier — even if much of it plays out in the countryside, away from the headlines. The sticking point in the negotiations: What reduction in violence is needed to move the peace process forward? The negotiators’ ultimate goal is the gradual withdrawal of American troops, and the establishment of talks between the Taliban and other Afghans over power-sharing. The drop in urban attacks most likely stems from an unacknowledged understanding with the Taliban to reduce high-profile violence in order to pave the way for an agreement. Improvements in security measures, with new leadership introduced over the past year, have also played a role. But as the Taliban have held back on urban assaults, they are attacking in rural areas. At least 40 Afghan security personnel were killed in the 24 hours before Wednesday, security officials said, with most of the losses coming in a couple of attacks in northern provinces. The Taliban have long resisted American demands for a cease-fire, seeking to push the issue later in the peace process, when they sit down with other Afghans on sharing power. Doing so earlier, they fear, will divide their ranks. Instead, they have answered the demands with a proposal for “violence reduction” — what could amount to the insurgents holding fire on United States forces as they close down their bases and withdraw, and avoiding dramatic attacks in major cities. The Afghan government, so far excluded from the talks, has asked the United States to agree to nothing but an extensive cease-fire. Its fear is that if the United States signs an initial deal with violence levels reduced only in the cities, the war will simply continue to rage in the countryside. As the United States has pushed for more from the Taliban at the negotiating table in recent weeks, the insurgents are growing mistrustful, accusing the Americans of moving the goal posts. Taliban officials say the United States had recently asked for violence reduction, which they brought to the table after a month of consultations all the way down to battlefield commanders. The American side found the Taliban offer inadequate. One Taliban official said that now the United States is seeking something closer to a cease-fire, which it hadn’t demanded earlier. Some Afghan officials and diplomats said negotiators want the reduction of violence to extend from the cities into the districts and along the highways. But stagnation in the talks has raised fears that the quest for a more expansive truce could break the fragile negotiations at a sensitive time, thrusting the country back into greater violence. Mohammed Arif Rahmani, a member of the Afghan Parliament’s national security committee, said that during past winters the Taliban would expand their attacks in the cities and reduce their activities in the rural areas because of harsh weather. “But now it feels like the Taliban have only tactically reduced attacks in the cities and expanded attacks in the countryside,” Mr. Rahmani said. “In the past week, we have seen an increase in such attacks in the rural areas, and I think it has to do with the stalemate in the talks over the past month.” A large number of the recent fatalities have come in the north — despite extreme cold temperatures. In an overnight attack in Baghlan Province on Tuesday, the Taliban killed between 11 and 18 security personnel, according to different official accounts, nearly wiping out an entire outpost with the help of an infiltrator. In neighboring Kunduz Province early on Wednesday, at least 12 security personnel were killed. In the meantime, the Afghan government and its American allies, largely relying on airstrikes, have continued killing Taliban forces at rates of dozens daily. The Afghan government reports — which are difficult to verify and prone to exaggeration — claim its soldiers have killed an as many as 30 Taliban daily over the past week. The United States has continued airstrikes across the country at high rates. Data released by the United States Air Force showed that American military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs in Afghanistan in 2019 — the most in any year since the United States began tracking the strikes in 2006 — and have pursued the recent trend of increasing airstrikes. The expanded air campaign, by both United States and Afghan Air Forces, has also come with reports of increased civilian casualties. In the latest episode, on Saturday, at least seven civilians, all members of the same family, were killed in an airstrike in the Borka area of northern Balkh Province. “The armed conflict in Afghanistan is not winding down, it is widening, and the people who continue to pay the price are Afghan civilians,” said Omar Waraich, the deputy South Asia director at Amnesty International. “There continues to be a shocking disregard for human life from all sides.” Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting from Kabul, and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington.']",A reduction in attacks in major Afghan cities amid American peace talks with the Taliban could be misleading. Bloodletting in the countryside continues.
"Asylum Seekers Find a New Route to Europe, Flowing Into a Divided Cyprus",2020-01-28,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['KOFINOU, Cyprus — Clasping his student visa, Clinton Yebga boarded a Turkish Airlines flight in his native Cameroon, switched planes in Istanbul and landed without trouble in northern Cyprus. But instead of heading to his university in the Turkish-controlled north, he made his way to the so-called green line — a nominal barrier that divides the island — and into the Republic of Cyprus, a part of the European Union. Today, awaiting a decision on his asylum application, he lives in the tidy Kofinou refugee camp, where Syrians, Palestinians and other Cameroonians are his neighbors. Mr. Yebga and the others are among the more than 11,200 people who last year discovered a circuitous route into the European Union that has left this small island with the most asylum seekers per capita in Europe. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, the bloc desperately struck a deal with Turkey to stop asylum seekers from reaching Greece. Since then, far fewer migrants have tried to cross the Aegean. But Cyprus has proved to be a vexing loophole. “The simplest way is to think of the north of Cyprus is as the world’s biggest airport transit lounge,” said James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics who specializes in the politics of southeastern Europe. “You’ve landed on the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, but it’s not until you’ve gone through the border check at the green line — which isn’t a border itself — that you’re officially in the Republic of Cyprus,” he said. More asylum seekers are doing just that, presenting Cyprus, population 850,000, with a budding migration crisis that much of the rest of the European Union has left behind. Most migrants, the Cypriot authorities said, arrived by land from the north. Mr. Yebga, a 23-year-old with a quick, beaming smile and poetic English, said he left his home country because he faced persecution as a journalist as civil strife simmered. After his mother was beaten for refusing to tell the police where he was, Mr. Yebga said he knew he had to get out. He spent 1,000 euros, about $1,100, on his Turkish Airlines flight and another €1,000 to enroll in college in northern Cyprus. In November, clasping a single bag, he left for Cyprus. Within days, he was in the European Union, housed in a quiet refugee camp made of shipping containers and a small playground nestled in the hills near the capital, Nicosia, where he applied for asylum. “I had no idea about the division of Cyprus,” Mr. Yebga said on a chilly night at his temporary home, echoing dozens of others in his situation who express bafflement at the complex political situation. “I just thought, ‘I need to get to Europe, to be safe from harassment.’” People smugglers and individuals who present themselves as agents for private universities in Turkish-controlled Cyprus often suggest the route to potential asylum seekers, but do not explain the intricacies of the political situation on the island. Many asylum seekers arrive on Cyprus believing that it is somehow linked to mainland Europe (it is not), or that it belongs to the Schengen zone of passport-free travel (it does not). Experts say this is why Cyprus emerged as a destination only after other routes to the European Union closed. The number of asylum seekers in Cyprus was five times higher in 2019 than it was four years ago, unlike in the rest of the bloc, where those numbers have tapered off markedly since 2015. The island’s budding migration crisis is a consequence of its fraught history and continuing division, which has defeated attempts at mediation for decades. After a coup overthrew the Cypriot government in 1974 and there was an attempt to unite the island with Greece, Turkey sent in its military. When the fighting stopped, the island was divided. Today, the so-called green line is neither a border nor a bridge, but it separates the ethnically Greek south from the Turkish north, which is controlled by an administration recognized only by Turkey. The status of the island, which is in the eastern Mediterranean, just 100 miles or so from the Syrian coast,  spawns myriad problems that affect Cypriots on both sides of the green line. In the black box that is the “Cyprus Problem,” as the intractable division of the island has come to be known, refugees are additional collateral damage. As the north is considered occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus, the authorities in Nicosia neither recognize nor communicate with the administration there. On the flip side, Turkey does not acknowledge the internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus in Nicosia, which means that the agreement between the European Union and Turkey on migrants de facto cuts out Cyprus. Although some asylum seekers reach southern Cyprus by air or by boat from Lebanon, Syria or Turkey, an overwhelming majority come overland from the north, the authorities say. An unknown number of migrants languish in northern Cyprus, which for years has been a destination for Middle Easterners and Africans fleeing economic hardship and war. The authorities in the north periodically crack down — and they do not offer asylum or refugee status — but they also tolerate many.  But they have found themselves at a loss with what to do with the droves of Syrians who arrived in the past two years, before they needed visas. One young woman from Homs, Syria, said she was on the last direct flight from Beirut, Lebanon, to Ercan, in northern Cyprus, in June. When she landed, she said, she was packed into a container with dozens of other Syrians by the airport for days. The fiasco prompted northern Cyprus to tighten its visa rules for Syrians. Eventually, a nongovernmental organization affiliated with the United Nations helped the stranded Syrians get to the green line, which they crossed, said the young woman, who identified herself only as Roshka. Others have found themselves trapped in limbo in the north, including Mustafa Alagha. An architect by training raised in a well-to-do professional family bouncing between Syria and Kuwait, he fled Aleppo in 2012, heading first for Alexandria, Egypt. He got his architecture degree in a northern Cypriot college, and completed a master’s degree. For a while, he was happy, he said, making friends with other Syrians. Then the walls started closing in. First, his Syrian passport expired, and he had no means of renewing it — other than turning up at a Syrian Consulate. But that would mean handing himself in to a government that wants to enlist him in the army. After the administration in northern Cyprus tightened its visa rules, he applied three times for a visa to go to Turkey, and was rejected each time. If he went to the green line and asked the Republic of Cyprus for asylum, he would be stuck waiting for a decision for years and would not be able to work as an architect.  “It would mean going back to zero,” he said. “I’m 32 — I don’t feel I can start from scratch.” For now, he has a job and an apartment. But, ultimately, he is stuck. “This is not home,” he said, “and it never will be.”']",The tiny island now hosts the most refugees per capita in the European Union.
Putin Pardons American-Israeli Swept Up in Geopolitical Game,2020-01-29,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — An American-Israeli woman was pardoned on Wednesday, months after her severe punishment on charges of having a small amount of marijuana had made her an unwitting pawn in a geopolitical game. The pardon, issued by President Vladimir V. Putin, came on the eve of a visit to Moscow by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The two leaders are expected to talk about the Middle East plan proposed by President Trump this week. The woman, Naama Issachar, was arrested in April after Russian officials said they found marijuana in her luggage during an airline stopover in Moscow while en route from India to Israel. The amount — 9.5 grams, about a third of an ounce — would normally result in no more than a month’s detention, a fine and deportation from Russia. The amount is within the legal limit in Israel. But in October, a Russian court sentenced Ms. Issachar to seven and a half years in prison on drug possession and smuggling charges, and she was sent to a penal colony. Investigators said Ms. Issachar had admitted to possession, but she later said that the statement was given under pressure. Israeli officials and Ms. Issachar’s relatives said that the Kremlin had linked her fate to that of Alexei Burkov, a Russian man being held in Israel while facing extradition to the United States on computer crime charges. Shortly after Ms. Issachar was sentenced, however, Israel went ahead with his extradition to the United States. After Ms. Issachar’s case become a political issue in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu vowed to work for her freedom and raised the issue repeatedly in meetings and phone calls with Mr. Putin. Little progress was made, however, before Mr. Putin came to Israel last week to attend an event marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. During the visit, the Russian president met with Ms. Issachar’s mother, Yaffa Issachar, and told her that “everything will be O.K.” Mr. Putin’s visit coincided with Israel’s decision to hand over to Russia the ownership of an important religious building in central Jerusalem, which once belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church. In his decree, Mr. Putin portrayed the pardon as a gesture of good will “guided by the principles of humanity.” Mr. Netanyahu thanked the Russian leader in a statement that called the Trump plan “the deal of the century.” Ms. Issachar, who was born in New Jersey but lives in Israel, was still being held late Wednesday, though officials said they expected her to be freed on Thursday. Her release is likely to help Mr. Netanyahu’s chances in Israel’s March 2 election.']",Naama Issachar had been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for a small amount of marijuana.

Containing the Coronavirus: Countries Limit Travel to China,2020-01-28,By Paul Mozur,"['HONG KONG — Countries, cities and businesses across the globe issued new travel warnings on Tuesday, vastly expanding a cordon intended to control the flow of people to and from China, where the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus. In the most drastic measure to limit travel, the Hong Kong authorities reduced by half the number of flights and shut down rail service to mainland China, and they also limited visas — moves that could inspire other governments to follow suit. Measures to contain the outbreak of the virus to its epicenter in Hubei Province appear to have failed to stop the contagion. On Wednesday morning, Chinese officials said the number of cases had increased by nearly a third overnight. Experts warned that the actual number of cases could be significantly higher and growing quickly. The number of deaths attributed to the virus also continued to grow. The new travel restrictions put a deeper freeze on China’s contact with the world, cutting off business and tourism as China’s economy faces a potential slowdown. With China’s Lunar New Year holiday nearing its end, companies ordered workers to stay home and avoid travel. The economic impact of such measures pointed to a deeper political crisis, with many people accusing the Chinese authorities online of failing to act quickly to contain the virus, even as the government continues to struggle to control its spread. The travel advisories and bans came as the virus showed early signs of spreading outside China, with cases of transmission to people who had not recently traveled to China reported in Japan, Germany and Vietnam. Countries across the world may now be faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not simply seeking to identify and quarantine infected people who had been in China. Officials at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against nonessential travel to China, noting that there is “limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.” The United States is expanding the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan to 20 airports and other ports of entry, from five, federal officials said on Tuesday. [Read: U.K. businessman linked to coronavirus cluster comes forward.] The World Health Organization revised its global risk assessment for the outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” although it noted this shift in a footnote buried in a report published on Monday. The change in the risk assessment, which coincided with a visit to China by the organization’s director general, risked confusing the public about the severity of the outbreak, which has killed more than 130 people in China and been diagnosed in at least 14 countries. The World Health Organization was criticized after it refused twice in recent days to declare the outbreak a global emergency, despite its spread. With other countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the locked-down epicenter of the outbreak in central China, the WHO said its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had discussed with Chinese officials “possible alternatives to evacuation of foreigners if there are ways to accommodate them and protect their health.” Although Chinese medical workers have described a desperate need for more resources to treat thousands of new patients, state-run Chinese media reported that Dr. Tedros had spoken highly of the Chinese efforts to contain the virus. The Chinese authorities agreed on Tuesday to allow in teams of international experts, coordinated by the World Health Organization, to help with research and containment. Chinese officials said Wednesday that 132 people had died from the virus, up from 106 the day before. The total number of confirmed cases rose sharply as well, to 5,974 on Wednesday, according to the National Health Commission. The youngest confirmed patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. While the majority of confirmed cases were in Hubei, where a number of cities have been put under effective lockdown, an additional 1,800 cases have been diagnosed outside the province, the authorities said. In Wuhan, medical workers have cited a lack of masks and kits to test for the virus. China’s medical products administration said on Sunday it had approved new virus detection kits to speed detection, but three Chinese medical companies said they did not have the capacity to produce enough of them, according to local news media reports. Many in Wuhan with symptoms of the virus have not been tested or have been told the hospitals did not have enough test kits, some local residents said. During a visit to Wuhan on Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, promised to provide more equipment, and the local government has begun building new hospitals that it hopes to open in a matter of weeks. But online, many people mocked the government’s efforts. In indications of the virus’s spread beyond China’s borders, Thailand reported 14 cases of infection, while the United States and Australia have each confirmed five cases. Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each said they had confirmed four cases. Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which has now confirmed six cases, said that the virus had been found in the first Japanese citizen. The ministry said he had worked as a bus driver for two different tour groups from Wuhan. He had no history of traveling to Wuhan. The man, who had driven for the tours earlier this month, first reported experiencing chills, a cough and joint pain on Jan. 14. He visited a clinic three days later, but was sent home. On Jan. 22, his joint pain and cough grew worse, and he returned to a health clinic on Saturday, when a chest X-ray showed abnormalities and he was admitted to a hospital. A test confirmed the coronavirus on Tuesday. German officials said Tuesday that they had identified what they believed was the first instance of the virus spreading within Europe. They said a man from Starnberg in Bavaria was infected and was being treated and kept in isolation. The health ministry described him as being in “good condition” medically and said it was also monitoring his family and other people who might have been exposed, including in his children’s day care center. “It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,” Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. “But the Bavarian case shows us that we are well prepared.” He said the risk to Germans remained low. Japan planned to send a chartered plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to bring back the first Japanese citizens who wish to be repatriated. At least 13 countries have said they would evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans. Businesses that operate in China have issued warnings of their own. In a flurry of emails sent in recent days, General Motors, Honeywell, Bloomberg, Facebook and other companies have warned employees not to travel within mainland China. Honeywell, which has offices and operations across China, said it had restricted travel to some regions, but did not specify which ones. A spokesman for General Motors said the company had issued a global travel ban to China, with only “business-critical” travel allowed and only after clearance from a doctor. Bloomberg told its employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to work remotely until further notice and it restricted travel to China and Hong Kong over the next 30 days, according to an email seen by The New York Times. The Chinese government has extended the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 3, with some of China’s biggest cities telling businesses not to open until the following week. China’s biggest technology companies went further, notifying employees to work from home until Feb. 10. NetEase, an internet and entertainment platform, asked employees who were returning from another city to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Investors in Asia were gripped on Tuesday with fear about the health of the global economy for a second day, with a widespread sell-off continuing in the markets. Investors dumped stocks in companies thought to be most vulnerable to the effects of the virus. “The coronavirus is the No. 1 threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty,” said Nigel Green, founder of an investment company, the deVere Group. In Hong Kong, medical professionals called for additional border checkpoints. “The next week or two will be a critical time for the development of the epidemic,” the faculty at the Chinese University of Hong Kong wrote on its Facebook page. “We must closely monitor whether there is a community outbreak outside Hubei Province, especially in Hong Kong’s neighboring regions.” Reporting was contributed by Chris Buckley, Russell Goldman, Elaine Yu, Raymond Zhong, Austin Ramzy, Sui-Lee Wee, Alexandra Stevenson, Eimi Yamamitsu, Tiffany May, Joseph Goldstein, Jeffrey E.

Johnson Risks a Rift with Trump by Granting New Access to Huawei,2020-01-28,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Since becoming Britain’s prime minister six months ago, Boris Johnson has managed to strike a delicate balance in his relationship with President Trump, keeping him at a distance during Britain’s election while more recently showing sympathy for his pressure tactics against Iran. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Johnson was confronted with a stark choice: In deciding to give the Chinese telecommunications giant, Huawei, limited access to Britain’s new high-speed broadband network, he broke abruptly with the president who once praised him as a “really good man” and a British version of himself. That risks opening a rift between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Trump at the very moment Britain is leaving the European Union. It could also jeopardize efforts to negotiate a trans-Atlantic trade agreement that Mr. Johnson has promoted as one of the prizes of Britain’s newly independent status. The Trump administration put heavy pressure on Mr. Johnson’s government to rule against Huawei, dispatching a high-level delegation to London two weeks ago to warn of the risks of opening up fifth-generation, or 5G, networks to a firm that they assert has ties to Chinese security agencies and the People’s Liberation Army. But British officials said the American case was not persuasive, given Britain’s plan to limit the use of Huawei’s gear to what they characterize as “fringe” parts of the network. The drive to exclude the company, they said, appeared to come less from intelligence experts than from political appointees, who view Huawei in the context of curbing China’s global influence. Some said the heavy-handed approach backfired. “You’ve had this crescendo of voices from Washington, trying with increasing stridency to put us off this decision,” said Peter Ricketts, a former British national security adviser and ambassador to France. “It put the Boris Johnson government into a difficult position: Did they defer to Trump’s view or did they defy it?” Mr. Ricketts said. “Anything other than approving it would have looked like caving into pressure.” For Mr. Johnson, who spoke to Mr. Trump on Tuesday to brief him on the decision, there are political advantages to defying Washington. British leaders are regularly pilloried for playing the poodle to American presidents, and Mr. Johnson’s show of independence played well with British commentators. “This decision is an important moment in the Johnson premiership,” said Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization. “Even if you don’t agree with it, it shows a premier becoming ever more comfortable in his position.” Experts said Mr. Johnson had calculated that however aggrieved Mr. Trump might be, the United States would not halt intelligence cooperation. The limitations on Huawei put in place by Britain’s security agencies, they said, should be sufficient to reassure the Americans that intelligence sharing channels would remain secure. Mr. Trump himself has at times appeared more relaxed about Huawei. When he visited London last June, for example, he dismissed suggestions that the United States would halt intelligence-sharing if Britain did not bar the company. “We are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else,” he said to then-Prime Minister Theresa May. The impact of Mr. Johnson’s decision on the nascent trade negotiations with the United States was harder to predict. Three Republican senators — Marco Rubio of Florida, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and John Cornyn of Texas — wrote to members of Britain’s National Security Council, warning them that a decision to approve Huawei could threaten Congressional approval of a trade deal. “Our special relationship is less special now that the U.K. has embraced the surveillance state commies at Huawei,” said Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska and a prominent China hawk. “During the Cold War, Margaret Thatcher never contracted with the K.G.B. to save a few pennies.’’ The debate over Huawei divided Mr. Johnson’s cabinet and the Conservative Party. Critics warned that Britain’s plans to limit the use of the company’s gear were unrealistic and would leave it vulnerable to Chinese intelligence. Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament who had urged Mr. Johnson to bar Huawei, said on Twitter that the plan “leaves many concerns and does not close the UK’s networks to a frequently malign international actor.” To some extent, Mr. Johnson’s decision reflects a blunt assessment of Britain’s economic interests as it tries to chart a new future outside the European Union.  Brexit, Mr. Johnson argues, will give the country the freedom to enact its own regulations to encourage new technologies like artificial intelligence. The prime minister’s influential adviser, Dominic Cummings, has put particular emphasis on the need to invest in the technologies of the future. Mr. Cummings wants to create a British version of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States, to make Britain “the best place in the world to be for those who can invent the future,” he wrote in a blog. For him, the 5G network is a critical part of that investment. British officials said they were left with little choice but to approve Huawei because of the lack of alternative providers — Samsung is not a competitor in Britain, as it is in the United States — and the fact that Huawei is a well-established player in the British network, which means that if it barred the company, it would potentially have to rip Huawei gear out of the existing 4G network. In the gesture to Washington, British officials said they hoped to reduce reliance on Huawei and other companies classified by the British government as “high risk,” by luring Samsung to invest and encouraging small new ventures. British officials acknowledged that the Huawei decision comes on top of differences over policy toward Iran and over a digital services tax that would hit American technology giants like Google and Amazon. British officials even worried that they might block Huawei, only to see a shift in policy from Mr. Trump back in its favor. The Chinese company is not completely locked out of the American market and could theoretically be given a bigger role as part of the second phase of Mr. Trump’s trade negotiations with China. The same uncertainties plague a potential trans-Atlantic trade deal, given Britain’s need to negotiate a much bigger agreement with the European Union as well as the presidential election in the United States. Moreover, compared to the potential of 5G, the gains from a trade deal look paltry. In 2018, the last time the British government estimated the economic effects of Brexit, it projected that new trade agreements with the United States — as well as with Australia, New Zealand and a host of other countries — would collectively yield a gain of just 0.2 percent of gross domestic product by 2035. To strike a trade agreement with the United States, Britain would also likely have to make politically unpopular concessions. The Trump administration would probably demand opening the British market to farm products like chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef and removing restrictions on what drug companies can charge the National Health Service for their products. “The government took a risk assessment of both Huawei and the American reaction,” Mr. Ricketts said, “and decided to press ahead.”']","Despite the Trump administration’s effort to persuade Britain to bar the Chinese technology giant from its new broadband network, Boris Johnson decided to grant Huawei limited access."
Ex-King of Belgium Acknowledges a Long-Dismissed Daughter,2020-01-28,By Aurelien Breeden,"['King Albert II, the former Belgian monarch, conceded this week that DNA tests showed he was the biological father of Delphine Boël, an artist who claimed to be his daughter from an extramarital affair, an extraordinary admission after years of lawsuits that exposed the royal family to unusual levels of scrutiny. King Albert’s lawyers said in a statement on Monday that the 85-year-old former monarch, who initially refused to comply with court-ordered DNA tests before finally submitting last year, had “taken note” of the results. The lawyers added that there were “legal arguments and objections” establishing that “a legal paternity is not necessarily the reflection of a biological paternity,” but that the king had decided “not to raise them and to put an end to this difficult procedure, in honor and dignity.” Alain Berenboom, one of the king’s lawyers, said on Tuesday that the Court of Appeal in Brussels would hear the case for a final time in June and that the legal proceedings would come to a close shortly afterward. Ms. Boël, 51, is a Belgian visual artist who has claimed for years that she was conceived during an affair in the 1960s between her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert, who was then a prince and married to Paola Ruffo di Calabria, an Italian princess. Prince Albert and his wife already had three children. Rumors of an illegitimate child were first alluded to in a 1999 book about Queen Paola by a journalist, Mario Danneels, and Ms. Boël made her first public claim that King Albert was her father in a 2005 interview. While King Albert has never explicitly denied Ms. Boël’s claim, he refused to acknowledge it, and Ms. Boël filed a lawsuit seeking recognition as his biological daughter in 2013. King Albert ceded the throne to his eldest son that year, ending his immunity from prosecution. Belgium is a constitutional monarchy, where most of the governing power rests with the Parliament, much like the systems in other European nations such as Britain, Spain or the Netherlands. Marc Uyttendaele, Ms. Boël’s lawyer, said on Tuesday that she was “relieved” to be “considered as a legitimate child” because it would “put an end to the social exclusion that she was subjected to and will prevent her children from having to bear this burden.” But Mr. Uyttendaele added that she had been “hurt” by the “coldness” of the king’s statement. In it, the king’s lawyers said that he had “never been involved with any family, social or educative decision whatsoever regarding Madame Delphine Boël” and that it was Ms. Boël who, “40 years later,” had decided to “change families” through a “long” and “painful” lawsuit. “The attitude taken by Albert II yesterday does not foretell the opening of a dialogue between his daughter and him,” Mr. Uyttendaele said. “For her part, she is open to this dialogue, but without much hope.” King Albert II was a second son and, as such, was not expected to succeed to the throne. Instead, he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of parties and travel, and when Ms. Boël was born in 1968, the prince privately recognized her as his daughter and cared for her, according to her lawyer. But Albert’s elder brother, King Baudouin, died suddenly of heart failure in 1993, leaving no children, meaning Albert became king. According to Ms. Boël, that is when her biological father, seeking to avoid a scandal, cut all ties. Ms. Boël will not enter the royal line of succession, but she will be in line to inherit some part of the king’s private fortune. Her lawyer, however, stressed that she had filed the suit for emotional reasons, not financial ones, noting that Jacques Boël, who raised Ms. Boël as his only daughter, was a wealthy man. “Her motives were therefore in no way profit-seeking — quite the opposite,” Mr. Uyttendaele said.']","After a court-ordered DNA test, the 85-year-old King Albert II, who abdicated in 2013, conceded that he was the biological father of the artist Delphine Boël, 51."
Containing the Coronavirus: Countries Limit Travel to China,2020-01-28,By Paul Mozur,"['HONG KONG — Countries, cities and businesses across the globe issued new travel warnings on Tuesday, vastly expanding a cordon intended to control the flow of people to and from China, where the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus. In the most drastic measure to limit travel, the Hong Kong authorities reduced by half the number of flights and shut down rail service to mainland China, and they also limited visas — moves that could inspire other governments to follow suit. Measures to contain the outbreak of the virus to its epicenter in Hubei Province appear to have failed to stop the contagion. On Wednesday morning, Chinese officials said the number of cases had increased by nearly a third overnight. Experts warned that the actual number of cases could be significantly higher and growing quickly. The number of deaths attributed to the virus also continued to grow. The new travel restrictions put a deeper freeze on China’s contact with the world, cutting off business and tourism as China’s economy faces a potential slowdown. With China’s Lunar New Year holiday nearing its end, companies ordered workers to stay home and avoid travel. The economic impact of such measures pointed to a deeper political crisis, with many people accusing the Chinese authorities online of failing to act quickly to contain the virus, even as the government continues to struggle to control its spread. The travel advisories and bans came as the virus showed early signs of spreading outside China, with cases of transmission to people who had not recently traveled to China reported in Japan, Germany and Vietnam. Countries across the world may now be faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not simply seeking to identify and quarantine infected people who had been in China. Officials at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against nonessential travel to China, noting that there is “limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.” The United States is expanding the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan to 20 airports and other ports of entry, from five, federal officials said on Tuesday. [Read: U.K. businessman linked to coronavirus cluster comes forward.] The World Health Organization revised its global risk assessment for the outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” although it noted this shift in a footnote buried in a report published on Monday. The change in the risk assessment, which coincided with a visit to China by the organization’s director general, risked confusing the public about the severity of the outbreak, which has killed more than 130 people in China and been diagnosed in at least 14 countries.

A Texas-Size Defeat for the E.U.: Brexit Is Here,2020-01-29,By Steven Erlanger,"['The European Parliament voted in Brussels on Wednesday to ratify the withdrawal agreement that governs Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, which will formally happen on Friday at midnight Brussels time. The occasion was marked by speechifying and the singing of “Auld Lang Syne.” Some European legislators put up a sign reading, hopefully: “It’s not goodbye, it’s au revoir” —\xa0an “until we meet again.” The vote — something of a relieved whimper rather than a bang, as its result was expected —\xa0is one of the last steps in bringing to an end three and a half years of confusion, political division and missed deadlines. The vote passed by 621 to 49, with 13 abstentions. But for the European Union, the loss of Britain is a significant defeat. It represents a loss of size, reach, momentum and permanence, comparable to Texas deciding to break away from the United States. “Brexit is a defeat, a rebellion against the concept that working together makes Europeans stronger,’’ said Rosa Balfour, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. It also gives the bloc potentially less clout. “Any room the E.U. walks into, it will carry less weight than when the U.K. was a member — on trade, climate, defense,” said Paul Taylor, a senior fellow at Friends of Europe, a research institution. At the same time, the shock of Brexit has produced a unity among the remaining 27 nations that is hard to find on any other issue — neither migration nor Russia, the budget or even the supposedly common currency, the euro. As they have negotiated with Britain, at least, the 27 have stayed together, much to London’s disappointment, and talk of other countries’ leaving the bloc has disappeared. While Brexit originally caused panic in Brussels, it has turned out to be less of an epidemic than a vaccine, noted Josep Borrell Fontelles, the bloc’s foreign-policy chief. The process has been so chaotic and painful for Britain that even Europe’s populists have stopped talking about the likes of “Frexit,” “Nexit’’ or “Italexit,” referring to France, the Netherlands and Italy. Because the European official who led the talks on the bloc’s behalf so far is now in charge of negotiating its future relationship with Britain, similar unity is to be expected. But it will have a defensive character, with Brussels intent on maintaining the integrity of the single market despite the desire to keep its large neighbor close. The negotiations will be both complicated and limited, given the timing. The transition period, during which little changes despite the formal Brexit, runs only until the end of the year. European Union leaders like the Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, have pledged, as she did this month in London, to “work day and night” to forge a close future relationship with Britain. But the loss will ripple outward for years to come. “It’s a defeat for everyone — for the European project, for Britain’s position in the world and for American interests, since the U.S. was the beneficiary of Britain in the E.U.,” said Ian Lesser, a former American diplomat who is now the director of the German Marshall Fund’s Brussels office. Britain acted as a sort of pragmatic balance between the more statist countries like France and the more frugal, federal ones, like Germany, Mr. Lesser noted. “So Brexit will make some of the divisions in the E.U. more stark and difficult to manage.’’ Britain’s departure “changes the balance within the E.U. and creates a power vacuum,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The absence of Britain will make the relationship between France and Germany even more toxic,” he said. “But it also destabilizes a lot of the countries, like the Dutch and the Nordics, on issues like the free market, anti-Russia policy and trans-Atlanticism,” Mr. Leonard added. “And it will further the imbalance between the eurozone and non-eurozone countries, leaving those like Poland, Sweden and Denmark more exposed.’’ Central European countries, Turkey and countries hoping to join the bloc may also feel Britain’s absence. “The Turks are quite concerned, because Britain has been a friend in terms of Turkish integration, even if accession is not on the cards,” Mr. Lesser said. The European Council, made up of European governments, has already approved the deal, but will make a final, pro forma vote in writing on Thursday. Britain’s economy is roughly the size of France’s, the second-largest in the European Union, and is an important security player, a nuclear power with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Britain has a close relationship with Washington and, even after its famous rebate, is the second-largest net contributor to the bloc’s budget, putting in nearly 12 percent. Already, as European governments debate the next seven-year budget — always a sour process — there are angry disagreements on how large it should be, given the need to fill the hole the British will leave behind when the transition period ends in December. And given proximity, two-way trade is enormous. The European Union is Britain’s largest trading partner, taking 45 percent of all British exports and providing 53 percent of all British imports in 2018, the latest figures from the House of Commons Library according to a report issued last month. If Britain chooses to diverge significantly from European regulations, the hit to trade will be serious for both sides, if not equally shared. Britain matters far less to the European Union, accounting for less than 10 percent of its overall trade. A lot will depend on where Britain ends up landing. With Washington dangling a separate trade deal, “there are powerful forces shaping the Brexit debate in favor of de-aligning with the European Union and moving more toward the United States,” Ms. Balfour said. “That could have a devastating impact on Europe and where it stands in the world,” she continued. “It could push Europe closer to Russia, undermine Europe’s ability to pursue an independent foreign policy and hurt Europe’s ability to shape the international world of multilateralism and the rule of law, the basics on which the E.U. was built.’’ Britain will be important to Europe on military matters and foreign policy regardless, Mr. Leonard said, pointing to so far common positions on Iran and the 2015 nuclear deal, Russia, sanctions policies and Huawei, where Washington is often in disagreement with Europe. “Iran in particular is seen as a test case in Paris and Berlin,” he said. “The U.K. is trying to balance, but pressure from Washington is being ramped up.” Despite President Trump’s apparent admiration for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, “I don’t see the U.K. becoming Trump’s poodle,” Mr. Taylor said. He noted important disagreements “on Iran, Israel-Palestine, northern Syria, Turkey, climate, trade, the World Trade Organization and Huawei,” where Britain has remained aligned with Europe against Washington. Britain, too, has an interest, post-Brexit, in demonstrating its importance as a vital regional power in military and intelligence, and in continuing to play an important role in NATO and European security. In the end, the European Union, and especially France, the other major military power, “will have an interest in creating a functional relationship with Britain, to take advantage of Britain’s assets as it tries to present a more active role in the world, especially in defense,” Mr. Lesser said. “But it won’t be easy.”']","The loss of such a rich, sizable, powerful member state will weaken the European Union’s momentum and its diplomatic weight."
"More Than 7,700 Cases of Coronavirus Recorded Worldwide",2020-01-29,By The New York Times,"['Mainland China now has more cases of coronavirus than it had of SARS, a respiratory infection that spread across China in 2002 and 2003 and killed 774 people in 17 countries.  During the SARS outbreak, China had 5,327 cases and 349 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of confirmed cases increased to more than 7,700 worldwide by early Thursday, according to Chinese officials and the World Health Organization, with all but 68 of the infections taking place in mainland China. On Wednesday, there were about 6,000 infections worldwide.  In China, a total of 170 people have now died from the mysterious new coronavirus, according to official Chinese statistics, but the real number is likely much higher. A dearth of test kits has hindered health officials ability to accurately diagnose and track the illness.  Here’s what we know about how the disease has spread:   ◆ China said early Thursday that 38 more people had died from the virus, which is believed to have originated in the central city of Wuhan and is spreading across the country. The previous count, on Wednesday, was 132.  ◆ Tibet reported its first confirmed case. ◆ Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Hong Kong has 10; the United States, Taiwan, Australia and Macau have five each; Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; Japan has 11; France has five; Germany has four; Canada has three; Vietnam has two; and Nepal, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates each have one.  ◆ Cases recorded in Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam and Japan involved patients who had not been to China. There have been no reported deaths outside China. The 195 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, have been instructed by federal health authorities to remain for three days on the air force base in Southern California where they landed on Wednesday. The passengers on the flight, which was chartered by the State Department, will be fully evaluated during those three days, according to Christopher R. Braden, a deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control. Once cleared, the passengers will be allowed to fly home, where they will be monitored for 14 days by medical teams in their area. “We think we can do the full evaluation in three days. Some of that evaluation is taking tests and flying samples to C.D.C. in Atlanta,” Dr. Braden told a news conference in Riverside, California.   “The reason we want to do active monitoring for 14 days is to determine if they can become ill during that period,” Dr. Braden added. “That is the basic public health premise of our action.“  The flight carrying the evacuated Americans landed in Southern California, at March Air Reserve Base, shortly after 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday. The flight had stopped in Anchorage for several hours, where the passengers were checked by a team from the Centers for Disease Control.  “The whole plane erupted in cheers when the crew said, ‘Welcome home to the United States,’” said Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer. [For a coming article, The New York Times would like to hear from Americans who flew on the chartered flight from China or their family members. Please contact miriam.jordan@nytimes.com to share your story.] The evacuees — consisting mainly of consular officials and their families but also including some other Americans who were in China —  will be accommodated at the base during the three-day period. But they will not have contact with any military personnel on the base. The evacuees will undergo a battery of tests. If their results, from the lab of the Centers for Disease Control, come back negative, they will be allowed to travel onward. During a news conference, Dr. Braden was peppered with questions about the wisdom of releasing the former residents of Wuhan into communities across the country. He said that if a person deemed a danger to the community insisted on leaving before the 72-hour period expired, “we can institute an individual quarantine for that person and we will.”    Other countries that have evacuated or plan to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan include France, South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Germany, Kazakhstan, Britain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Myanmar and Australia.    Researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, say they have grown the Wuhan coronavirus in a laboratory.  Scientists in China and other researchers have managed to do so as well, officials at the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Isolating and growing viral samples is standard procedure during the outbreak of a novel pathogen, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Early on in an outbreak, you still need to understand the biology of the new organism that’s causing infections,” Dr. Hotez said. Scientists collect samples from fluids obtained from the lungs or nasal passages of infected patients. Researchers may use the lab-grown virus to test antiviral drugs or develop experimental vaccines, Dr. Hotez said. By growing the novel coronavirus in controlled conditions, researchers also may get a better understanding of why the virus seems to be transmitted more easily than the SARS coronavirus, yet so far seems to have a lower mortality rate. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are trying to grow the coronavirus from patient samples collected in the United States. Once they’ve succeeded, the agency will make samples available to infectious disease researchers through a public repository. Chinese and Australian researchers have already offered to distribute samples. Scientists are also working quickly to develop  a vaccine capable of stopping the new coronavirus. Government scientists in China, the United States and Australia, as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all engaged.  Researchers at the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center in Maryland have pinpointed the parts of the genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine. But a vaccine could take months, if not years, to develop. Three Japanese citizens who returned on a government-sponsored charter plane from Wuhan on Wednesday morning tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Japan to 11. Katsunobu Kato, the country’s Health, Labor and Welfare minister, told a session of Parliament on Thursday morning that the two men and one woman who landed in Tokyo on Wednesday had tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, 206 Japanese citizens landed at Haneda airport. All except two agreed to be tested for the virus, and 12 were sent immediately to a hospital for monitoring. The majority of the passengers — 191 — were asymptomatic but are quarantined in a hotel awaiting the results of virus tests. Of the three who tested positive, one exhibited symptoms, while two others were not yet showing symptoms. Another Japanese chartered flight from Wuhan landed on Thursday morning with 210 passengers aboard. The World Health Organization will convene a meeting of experts on Thursday in Geneva to vote again on whether to declare the coronavirus epidemic a global health emergency, officials said on Wednesday.   At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, W.H.O. officials said they were  particularly concerned about recent cases of person-to-person transmission that have been reported among people who have never been to China. On Jan. 23, when there were about 800 confirmed cases and all 25 deaths were in China, the same committee recommended that an emergency not be declared at that time. Since then, the infection has spread to people in four countries who have never been to China. Most patients infected with the virus develop mild symptoms, but about 20 percent become severely ill. The death rate seems to be 2 percent, W.H.O. officials said, though they cautioned that there are many unknown variables. “This number may change,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the W.H.O. “It’s early to put a percentage on that.” The director general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China’s response to the crisis.   “The fact that to date we have only seen 68 cases outside China and no deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary steps the government has taken to prevent the export of cases,” he said. Health officials in China alerted Germany when a Chinese woman returning from Germany developed symptoms and tested positive for the coronavirus. Because of the shared information, at least one infection in Germany was discovered. “This example is a good illustration of how China is engaging” with the W.H.O. and other countries, Dr. Tedros said.  But some Chinese social media users have strongly criticized the government’s handling of the outbreak, posting harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients.  The sheer amount of complaints — and some of the clever ways users have dodged censors, like referring to President Xi Jinping as “Trump” —  have made it difficult for the Chinese government to maintain its tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. Some international sports events have been postponed or even canceled in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The biggest casualty so far is the indoor world athletics championships in Nanjing, which were postponed by a full year on Wednesday. The international ski federation has canceled the first World Cup races planned for the mountain venue where the sport will be held during the 2022 Beijing Olympics, The Associated Press reported. The governing body of athletics said the indoor championships will now be held in March 2021 instead of March 13-15 this year. Nanjing is about 330 miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. Qualifying tournaments for this summers’ Tokyo Olympics have also been affected. Women’s soccer and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The soccer games had initially been moved from Wuhan to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. British Airways has indefinitely suspended all flights to and from China, the airline said on Wednesday, citing advice from Britain’s Foreign Office that cautioned against all nonessential travel to China. “We apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” the company said in an emailed statement. Other airlines have begun to scale back flights to China as the death toll and number of cases rises, but the British flag carrier, one of the world’s largest international airlines, is the first to cancel all its scheduled flights.  The airline, based in London, makes multiple flights a week to Beijing and Shanghai.    Air Canada said on Wednesday that it was also suspending all flights to China, from Thursday until Feb. 29. And Delta announced that it was temporarily reducing its weekly flights between the United States and China, because of declining demand. From Feb. 6 through April 30, the airline will go down to 21 weekly flights, or three to four weekly flights per route. The low-cost Indonesian carrier Lion Air and Seoul Air of South Korea also suspended all their flights to China, The Associated Press reported.  United Airlines and Air Canada said on Tuesday that they would reduce flights to China, canceling dozens of scheduled trips over the coming days and weeks because of a sudden drop in demand. Health officials in the United States have also warned against all nonessential travel to China. In Hong Kong, the authorities have reduced by half the number of flights coming into the semiautonomous region from mainland China and have also shut down rail services to the mainland. Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, has also suspended all flights to and from Wuhan through March. The new coronavirus that was first discovered in China last month is showing early signs of spreading abroad, with people who never visited China during the outbreak falling ill in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. The overseas cases highlight the ability of the mysterious disease, which is believed to have originated in wild animals, to be transmitted from one person to another, increasing its chances of spreading. “These reports are concerning, if they stand up to scrutiny, which they certainly sound credible,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. Some cases that have spread outside China appear to have been spread between family members, who are at greater risk while caring for sick relatives. Other cases, however, appear to have spread between people with different connections. In Japan, a tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two different groups from Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday. The driver had no history of traveling to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. “I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” Professor Reingold said. “That’s very concerning.” German officials said on Tuesday that a 33-year-old man from Starnberg in Bavaria was apparently infected with the coronavirus after a Jan. 21 training event with a Chinese colleague. The Chinese colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated under isolation while officials identified other people with whom he might have been in contact. Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company in Bavaria were also infected. The three were admitted to a clinic in Munich, where they were to be isolated and treated. An additional 40 people with close contact to those infected would be tested on Wednesday, officials said. Taiwan said on Tuesday that a man had become infected after his wife had contracted the virus while working in Wuhan. He became Taiwan’s eighth case and the first known to be transmitted locally. In an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday, Vietnamese physicians reported that a 65-year-old man from Wuhan appeared to have transmitted the coronavirus to his son, 27, who was living in Long An Province, southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. The father developed a fever on Jan. 17, four days after flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, from Wuhan. The son met his father on Jan. 17, and by Jan. 20 he had a dry cough and fever. The father’s condition has improved, and the son is stable, the doctors wrote. None of their 28 identified close contacts, including the father’s wife, have developed symptoms of respiratory infection, they said. With demand for surgical masks on the rise in China, a drugstore in Beijing has been fined more than $400,000 by the government for charging customers roughly six times what the masks are being sold for online. State-run media said that the store was charging customers 850 yuan, or $122, for the masks, while they were being sold online for 143 yuan. Infectious disease specialists say the disposable masks, which cover the nose and mouth, can help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently. The masks have become ubiquitous in cities across China. In Hong Kong, where the outbreak has brought back painful memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, officials said that customs authorities were examining surgical masks being sold in the city for counterfeit labeling and not meeting safety standards. In announcing the fine against the Beijing drugstore, a government notice warned that the authorities would “continue to step up enforcement and make every effort to curb the excessive and rapid rise in protective enforcement prices.”  Surgical masks have become so much in demand that a website advertising more fashionable versions of them warns that deliveries are at risk of being delayed.

The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in February,2020-01-31,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Horse Girl’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Debuting on Netflix just a couple of weeks after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, “Horse Girl” is a gearshift for the director Jeff Baena, who’s known more for comedies like the absurdist “I Heart Huckabees,” which he co-wrote, and “The Little Hours,” which turned two stories from “The Decameron” into an anachronistic romp about 14th-century nuns. Here, Baena tries his hand at the psychological thriller, co-written by Alison Brie, who stars as a homely loner who tends to her horse when she’s not logging time as a clerk at an arts and crafts store. Her life takes a drastic turn, however, when she starts experiencing strange visions and suspects she’s being manipulated by an alien species. ‘Road to Roma’ Starts streaming: Feb. 11 For last year’s Oscars, Netflix bet big on “Roma,” Alfonso Cuarón’s critically lauded, semi-autobiographical drama about an upper-middle-class family in early 1970s Mexico City and the poor live-in housekeeper who helped raise their children and keep the chaos at bay. While the film failed to win the streaming service its first Best Picture prize, Netflix’s investment in the film continues to unfurl with “Road to Roma,” a feature-length making-of documentary that’s more in-depth than a typical behind-the-scenes supplement. Cuarón shares memories of his childhood and how his production team brought them to life in such sumptuous detail. ‘To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You’ Starts streaming: Feb. 12 With major studios mostly shunning romantic comedies in recent years, Netflix has made them a key niche in its production arsenal, but few have had a bigger impact on the culture than “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” a Y.A. adaptation about a high-school junior with a thing for secret love letters. “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” is the first of two quickie sequels coming to the streaming service, which means the happily-ever-after ending of the original will have to unravel. As Lara Jean (Lana Condor) settles in with her popular new boyfriend (Noah Centineo), the handsome recipient (Jordan Fisher) of an older love letter comes into the picture. Whom will she choose? Get your “Team” hashtags ready. ‘A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon’ Starts streaming: Feb. 14 The lovable simpleton Shaun the Sheep has existed as far back as Nick Park’s Wallace & Gromit short “A Close Shave” in 1995, but in the gallery of Aardman Animations characters, he tended to appeal to the younger set on his own TV series and movie. Yet the 2015 “Shaun the Sheep Movie” had more of an all-ages appeal than expected, and the sequel, “A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,” looks to take the flock leader on an even darker adventure — or at least dark by Aardman standards. Already released to wide acclaim in Britain, “Farmageddon” has Shaun befriending an alien that crash-lands near Mossy Bottom Farm and must find its way home before humans capture him in the name of science. ‘System Crasher’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 Picked up by Netflix after its debut at the Berlin Film Festival, the German drama “System Crasher” is a polarizing film about how best to deal with children whose behavior is so antisocial that the system doesn’t know where to place them. Helena Zengel stars as a 9-year-old whose verbal and physical outbursts make her a danger to other children and an undesirable prospect for foster care, but her welfare caseworker (Gabriela Maria Schmeide) is determined to turn her fortunes around. To that end, the girl spends time with a rough-hewn school escort (Albrecht Schuch) who believes that patience and emotional support will have a greater and more lasting impact than medication. ‘All the Bright Places’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 It’s taken a few years and one false start to produce a screen adaptation of “All the Bright Places,” Jennifer Niven’s widely admired Y.A. novel about two emotionally complicated teenagers who fall in love in small-town Indiana. Now that it’s finally here, the film seems likely to spark a conversation about how these adolescents handle the threat of severe mental illness. Elle Fanning stars as a popular girl whose troubled past informs an emotional connection with a bipolar outcast (Justice Smith) whose isolation from his classmates and family stoke his suicidal tendencies. ‘The Pharmacist’ Starts streaming: Feb. 5 Arriving closely on the heels of “Don’t F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,” which was a minor sensation for Netflix two months ago, the documentary series “The Pharmacist” turns again to a remarkable real-life story of amateur sleuthing. The Louisiana pharmacist Dan Schneider turned himself into a gumshoe after the police lost interest in solving his son’s death in a drug-related shooting. His obsession led him to uncover a larger and more complicated case of opioid abuse that was happening under his nose, as young people in his pharmacy were filling OxyContin prescriptions at an alarming rate. ‘Locke & Key’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Perhaps the network’s most ambitious horror series since “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Locke & Key” adapts Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez’s graphic novel about another creepy old mansion with a supernatural aura, only this one acts more like a portal to other dimensions. Jackson Robert Scott, Connor Jessup and Emilia Jones star as siblings who move to their ancestral home in Massachusetts after their father’s murder. Once there, they find it littered with magical keys to rooms that give them access to great and horrifying power. The showrunner here is Carlton Cuse, whose years in charge of “Lost” suggests he knows a thing or two about how to manage a puzzle-box premise. ‘My Holo Love’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Can a human and an A.I. fall in love? The Korean sci-fi/romance series “My Holo Love” isn’t the first fiction to ask this question — in many respects, the premise recalls Joaquin Phoenix’s fling with an operating system in “Her” — but there are some distinctive twists this time around. Ko Sung-hee stars as an anonymous P.R. functionary at an eyewear company called Prism, which is experimenting with a pair of glasses that will assist in summoning a realistic holographic companion. She falls in love with the kind “Holo,” but her feelings are complicated by the revelation that he’s been modeled off a flesh-and-blood human at the company. ‘Better Call Saul: Season 4’ Starts streaming: Feb. 9 When it was first proposed, the “Breaking Bad” spinoff “Better Call Saul” sounded like a comedy, following the misadventures of Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), a strip-mall attorney of questionable ethics, as he represents the sleaziest clients in the greater Albuquerque area. But over four seasons and counting — the fifth of six seasons premieres on AMC later this month — the show has proved to be a heartbreaking tale about a well-meaning man who goes down the slippery slope of corner-cutting and clever scams. His slow transformation reaches a tipping point in Season 4 and threatens to consume his best friend and partner Kim (Rhea Seehorn), too. ‘Narcos: Mexico: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Feb. 13 When “Narcos” first started on Netflix, it was about the hunt for Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug kingpin who spent decades building the Cali Cartel before being gunned down in the early 1990s. Yet that story was enough to cover only two seasons. “Narcos” has since evolved into more of a docudrama format for telling other pocket histories of the drug trade, so the casts and locales can be changed out. The second season of “Narcos: Mexico” continues to explore the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in the ’80s, with Diego Luna returning as the sinister Félix Gallardo and Michael Peña as a D.E.A. agent assigned to stop him. ‘The Chef Show: Volume 3’ Starts streaming: Feb. 19 When he’s not spearheading mega-franchises across the Disney empire, Jon Favreau indulges a passion for food and friendship, first evident from his early 2000s IFC conversation show “Dinner for Five.” The amiable Netflix series “The Chef Show” pairs him with the Korean-American cook Roy Choi, his adviser on the modest 2014 indie film “Chef,” and the two of them now spend every season of “The Chef Show” showcasing innovative dishes and chatting up celebrity guests. Wolfgang Puck and the director Sam Raimi pull up a chair in the third season, along with the owners of eateries like Sprinkles Cupcakes, Pizzana and Wexler’s Deli. ‘Puerta 7’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 The bilingual American playwright and screenwriter Martin Zimmerman has been in the writers room for Netflix hits like “Narcos” and “Ozark,” and now he’s gone to Argentina to create his own original show about the drug-related violence. Written by Patricio Vega, “Puerta 7” looks into the notorious Argentinean soccer hooligans known as “barra brava,” who organize in support of various teams, but also represent a constant threat of rioting and other forms of violence in the stands. Among other subplots, the show focuses on a woman (Dolores Fonzi) who takes control of a soccer club and tries to purge the fan base of its criminal elements. ‘I Am Not Okay With This’ Starts streaming: Feb. 26 After Netflix turned his graphic novel “The End of the F***ing World” into an acclaimed two-season run, the streaming service is back in the Charles Forsman business with the series “I Am Not Okay With This,” which mixes a supernatural twist with a similar dark irreverence. Sophia Lillis stars as a 15-year-old who’s dealing with the usual trials of a high-school freshman, like complicated friendships and budding sexual interests. The one major wrinkle is that she’s also gifted/cursed with superhero powers that she doesn’t understand and hasn’t yet learned to control. ‘Restaurants on the Edge’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 Remember “Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares,” the Channel 4 reality series in which the tempestuous British chef Gordon Ramsay screamed and bullied his way into revitalizing various failing restaurants? The new series “Restaurants on the Edge” attempts a positive spin on the same concept, following the chef Dennis Prescott, the designer Karin Bohn and the restaurateur Nick Liberato as they try to use a lighter touch in realizing the potential of struggling eateries. The twist of this 13-episode series is that all the restaurants are set against startlingly beautiful locales, including the beaches of Hawaii and the “cottage country” of Muskoka, Canada. Also of interest: “Frost/Nixon” (Feb. 1), “Gone With the Wind” (Feb. 1), “You’ve Got Mail” (Feb. 1), “Public Enemies” (Feb. 5), “Who Killed Malcolm X?” (Feb. 7), “Isi & Ossi” (Feb. 14), “The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia” (Feb. 17), “Gentefied” (Feb. 21), “Arrival” (Feb. 26), “Queen Sono” (Feb. 28).']",New additions include “Road to Roma” and “Better Call Saul: Season 4.”
Pompeo Calls China’s Ruling Party ‘Central Threat of Our Times’,2020-01-30,By Marc Santora,"['LONDON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared the Chinese Communist Party “the central threat of our times” on Thursday, even as he sought to talk up the prospects of a United States trade deal with Britain, which rebuffed American pressure to ban a Chinese company from future telecommunications infrastructure. The scathing criticism of the Chinese government was the strongest language Mr. Pompeo has used as the Trump administration seeks to convince American allies of the risks posed by using equipment from Huawei, a Chinese technology giant. At the same time, Mr. Pompeo sought to reassure British officials that even though the two countries saw the issue differently, it would not undermine the strong bond between them. Mr. Pompeo’s reassurances come at a delicate moment for the British government as it begins the process of forging new stand-alone trade deals after it formally leaves the European Union on Friday. Speaking at an appearance with the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, Mr. Pompeo referred derisively to a 2016 warning from President Barack Obama that Brexit would place Britain at the “back of the queue” in any trade negotiations. “We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line,” Mr. Pompeo said. Still, while Britain’s security and economy depend on a close relationship with Washington, China is a significant investor in the country and a growing buyer of British goods. That was reflected in Britain’s decision this week to allow Huawei to play a limited role in its systems for the next generation of high-speed mobile internet, known as 5G. With Washington pressing governments across Europe and elsewhere to ban Huawei equipment from new 5G networks, leaders have had to walk a fine line, trying not to antagonize either economic giant while not falling behind in the race to build the next generation of information technology. Mr. Pompeo said that the concerns of the United States were not about any one company, but rather, the Chinese system. “When you allow the information of your citizens or the national security information of your citizens to transit a network that the Chinese Communist Party has a legal mandate to obtain, it creates risk,” he said. “While we still have to be enormously vigilant about terror, there are still challenges all across the world, the Chinese Communist Party presents the central threat of our times,” he said. While Mr. Pompeo was particularly blunt in his criticism of the Chinese government on Thursday, it was in keeping with his warnings to European leaders as he has sought to persuade them to keep Huawei out of their new networks. “China has inroads too on this continent that demand our attention,” he told reporters in June during a trip to The Hague, in the Netherlands. “China wants to be the dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide.” Mr. Pompeo said he was disappointed by the British decision, but said the two countries would work through the issue and reaffirmed Britain’s vital role in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States.

Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, provoked a whistle-blower complaint and led to Mr. Trump’s impeachment and his trial in the Senate.

Pompeo Calls China’s Ruling Party ‘Central Threat of Our Times’,2020-01-30,By Marc Santora,"['LONDON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared the Chinese Communist Party “the central threat of our times” on Thursday, even as he sought to talk up the prospects of a United States trade deal with Britain, which rebuffed American pressure to ban a Chinese company from future telecommunications infrastructure. The scathing criticism of the Chinese government was the strongest language Mr. Pompeo has used as the Trump administration seeks to convince American allies of the risks posed by using equipment from Huawei, a Chinese technology giant. At the same time, Mr. Pompeo sought to reassure British officials that even though the two countries saw the issue differently, it would not undermine the strong bond between them. Mr. Pompeo’s reassurances come at a delicate moment for the British government as it begins the process of forging new stand-alone trade deals after it formally leaves the European Union on Friday. Speaking at an appearance with the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, Mr. Pompeo referred derisively to a 2016 warning from President Barack Obama that Brexit would place Britain at the “back of the queue” in any trade negotiations. “We intend to put the United Kingdom at the front of the line,” Mr. Pompeo said. Still, while Britain’s security and economy depend on a close relationship with Washington, China is a significant investor in the country and a growing buyer of British goods. That was reflected in Britain’s decision this week to allow Huawei to play a limited role in its systems for the next generation of high-speed mobile internet, known as 5G. With Washington pressing governments across Europe and elsewhere to ban Huawei equipment from new 5G networks, leaders have had to walk a fine line, trying not to antagonize either economic giant while not falling behind in the race to build the next generation of information technology. Mr. Pompeo said that the concerns of the United States were not about any one company, but rather, the Chinese system. “When you allow the information of your citizens or the national security information of your citizens to transit a network that the Chinese Communist Party has a legal mandate to obtain, it creates risk,” he said. “While we still have to be enormously vigilant about terror, there are still challenges all across the world, the Chinese Communist Party presents the central threat of our times,” he said. While Mr. Pompeo was particularly blunt in his criticism of the Chinese government on Thursday, it was in keeping with his warnings to European leaders as he has sought to persuade them to keep Huawei out of their new networks. “China has inroads too on this continent that demand our attention,” he told reporters in June during a trip to The Hague, in the Netherlands. “China wants to be the dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide.” Mr. Pompeo said he was disappointed by the British decision, but said the two countries would work through the issue and reaffirmed Britain’s vital role in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States. Still, he cautioned it could still affect the way information was shared. “We will never permit American national security information to go across a network we do not have trust and confidence in,” he said. Mr. Pompeo also mentions Iran regularly as a threat, but not using language as strong as what he applied to China today.

The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in February,2020-01-31,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Horse Girl’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Debuting on Netflix just a couple of weeks after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, “Horse Girl” is a gearshift for the director Jeff Baena, who’s known more for comedies like the absurdist “I Heart Huckabees,” which he co-wrote, and “The Little Hours,” which turned two stories from “The Decameron” into an anachronistic romp about 14th-century nuns. Here, Baena tries his hand at the psychological thriller, co-written by Alison Brie, who stars as a homely loner who tends to her horse when she’s not logging time as a clerk at an arts and crafts store. Her life takes a drastic turn, however, when she starts experiencing strange visions and suspects she’s being manipulated by an alien species. ‘Road to Roma’ Starts streaming: Feb. 11 For last year’s Oscars, Netflix bet big on “Roma,” Alfonso Cuarón’s critically lauded, semi-autobiographical drama about an upper-middle-class family in early 1970s Mexico City and the poor live-in housekeeper who helped raise their children and keep the chaos at bay. While the film failed to win the streaming service its first Best Picture prize, Netflix’s investment in the film continues to unfurl with “Road to Roma,” a feature-length making-of documentary that’s more in-depth than a typical behind-the-scenes supplement. Cuarón shares memories of his childhood and how his production team brought them to life in such sumptuous detail. ‘To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You’ Starts streaming: Feb. 12 With major studios mostly shunning romantic comedies in recent years, Netflix has made them a key niche in its production arsenal, but few have had a bigger impact on the culture than “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” a Y.A. adaptation about a high-school junior with a thing for secret love letters. “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” is the first of two quickie sequels coming to the streaming service, which means the happily-ever-after ending of the original will have to unravel. As Lara Jean (Lana Condor) settles in with her popular new boyfriend (Noah Centineo), the handsome recipient (Jordan Fisher) of an older love letter comes into the picture. Whom will she choose? Get your “Team” hashtags ready. ‘A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon’ Starts streaming: Feb. 14 The lovable simpleton Shaun the Sheep has existed as far back as Nick Park’s Wallace & Gromit short “A Close Shave” in 1995, but in the gallery of Aardman Animations characters, he tended to appeal to the younger set on his own TV series and movie. Yet the 2015 “Shaun the Sheep Movie” had more of an all-ages appeal than expected, and the sequel, “A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,” looks to take the flock leader on an even darker adventure — or at least dark by Aardman standards. Already released to wide acclaim in Britain, “Farmageddon” has Shaun befriending an alien that crash-lands near Mossy Bottom Farm and must find its way home before humans capture him in the name of science. ‘System Crasher’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 Picked up by Netflix after its debut at the Berlin Film Festival, the German drama “System Crasher” is a polarizing film about how best to deal with children whose behavior is so antisocial that the system doesn’t know where to place them. Helena Zengel stars as a 9-year-old whose verbal and physical outbursts make her a danger to other children and an undesirable prospect for foster care, but her welfare caseworker (Gabriela Maria Schmeide) is determined to turn her fortunes around. To that end, the girl spends time with a rough-hewn school escort (Albrecht Schuch) who believes that patience and emotional support will have a greater and more lasting impact than medication. ‘All the Bright Places’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 It’s taken a few years and one false start to produce a screen adaptation of “All the Bright Places,” Jennifer Niven’s widely admired Y.A. novel about two emotionally complicated teenagers who fall in love in small-town Indiana. Now that it’s finally here, the film seems likely to spark a conversation about how these adolescents handle the threat of severe mental illness. Elle Fanning stars as a popular girl whose troubled past informs an emotional connection with a bipolar outcast (Justice Smith) whose isolation from his classmates and family stoke his suicidal tendencies. ‘The Pharmacist’ Starts streaming: Feb. 5 Arriving closely on the heels of “Don’t F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,” which was a minor sensation for Netflix two months ago, the documentary series “The Pharmacist” turns again to a remarkable real-life story of amateur sleuthing. The Louisiana pharmacist Dan Schneider turned himself into a gumshoe after the police lost interest in solving his son’s death in a drug-related shooting. His obsession led him to uncover a larger and more complicated case of opioid abuse that was happening under his nose, as young people in his pharmacy were filling OxyContin prescriptions at an alarming rate. ‘Locke & Key’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Perhaps the network’s most ambitious horror series since “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Locke & Key” adapts Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez’s graphic novel about another creepy old mansion with a supernatural aura, only this one acts more like a portal to other dimensions. Jackson Robert Scott, Connor Jessup and Emilia Jones star as siblings who move to their ancestral home in Massachusetts after their father’s murder. Once there, they find it littered with magical keys to rooms that give them access to great and horrifying power. The showrunner here is Carlton Cuse, whose years in charge of “Lost” suggests he knows a thing or two about how to manage a puzzle-box premise. ‘My Holo Love’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Can a human and an A.I. fall in love? The Korean sci-fi/romance series “My Holo Love” isn’t the first fiction to ask this question — in many respects, the premise recalls Joaquin Phoenix’s fling with an operating system in “Her” — but there are some distinctive twists this time around. Ko Sung-hee stars as an anonymous P.R. functionary at an eyewear company called Prism, which is experimenting with a pair of glasses that will assist in summoning a realistic holographic companion. She falls in love with the kind “Holo,” but her feelings are complicated by the revelation that he’s been modeled off a flesh-and-blood human at the company. ‘Better Call Saul: Season 4’ Starts streaming: Feb. 9 When it was first proposed, the “Breaking Bad” spinoff “Better Call Saul” sounded like a comedy, following the misadventures of Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), a strip-mall attorney of questionable ethics, as he represents the sleaziest clients in the greater Albuquerque area. But over four seasons and counting — the fifth of six seasons premieres on AMC later this month — the show has proved to be a heartbreaking tale about a well-meaning man who goes down the slippery slope of corner-cutting and clever scams. His slow transformation reaches a tipping point in Season 4 and threatens to consume his best friend and partner Kim (Rhea Seehorn), too. ‘Narcos: Mexico: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Feb. 13 When “Narcos” first started on Netflix, it was about the hunt for Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug kingpin who spent decades building the Cali Cartel before being gunned down in the early 1990s. Yet that story was enough to cover only two seasons. “Narcos” has since evolved into more of a docudrama format for telling other pocket histories of the drug trade, so the casts and locales can be changed out. The second season of “Narcos: Mexico” continues to explore the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in the ’80s, with Diego Luna returning as the sinister Félix Gallardo and Michael Peña as a D.E.A. agent assigned to stop him. ‘The Chef Show: Volume 3’ Starts streaming: Feb. 19 When he’s not spearheading mega-franchises across the Disney empire, Jon Favreau indulges a passion for food and friendship, first evident from his early 2000s IFC conversation show “Dinner for Five.” The amiable Netflix series “The Chef Show” pairs him with the Korean-American cook Roy Choi, his adviser on the modest 2014 indie film “Chef,” and the two of them now spend every season of “The Chef Show” showcasing innovative dishes and chatting up celebrity guests. Wolfgang Puck and the director Sam Raimi pull up a chair in the third season, along with the owners of eateries like Sprinkles Cupcakes, Pizzana and Wexler’s Deli. ‘Puerta 7’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 The bilingual American playwright and screenwriter Martin Zimmerman has been in the writers room for Netflix hits like “Narcos” and “Ozark,” and now he’s gone to Argentina to create his own original show about the drug-related violence. Written by Patricio Vega, “Puerta 7” looks into the notorious Argentinean soccer hooligans known as “barra brava,” who organize in support of various teams, but also represent a constant threat of rioting and other forms of violence in the stands. Among other subplots, the show focuses on a woman (Dolores Fonzi) who takes control of a soccer club and tries to purge the fan base of its criminal elements. ‘I Am Not Okay With This’ Starts streaming: Feb. 26 After Netflix turned his graphic novel “The End of the F***ing World” into an acclaimed two-season run, the streaming service is back in the Charles Forsman business with the series “I Am Not Okay With This,” which mixes a supernatural twist with a similar dark irreverence. Sophia Lillis stars as a 15-year-old who’s dealing with the usual trials of a high-school freshman, like complicated friendships and budding sexual interests. The one major wrinkle is that she’s also gifted/cursed with superhero powers that she doesn’t understand and hasn’t yet learned to control. ‘Restaurants on the Edge’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 Remember “Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares,” the Channel 4 reality series in which the tempestuous British chef Gordon Ramsay screamed and bullied his way into revitalizing various failing restaurants? The new series “Restaurants on the Edge” attempts a positive spin on the same concept, following the chef Dennis Prescott, the designer Karin Bohn and the restaurateur Nick Liberato as they try to use a lighter touch in realizing the potential of struggling eateries. The twist of this 13-episode series is that all the restaurants are set against startlingly beautiful locales, including the beaches of Hawaii and the “cottage country” of Muskoka, Canada. Also of interest: “Frost/Nixon” (Feb. 1), “Gone With the Wind” (Feb. 1), “You’ve Got Mail” (Feb. 1), “Public Enemies” (Feb. 5), “Who Killed Malcolm X?” (Feb. 7), “Isi & Ossi” (Feb. 14), “The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia” (Feb. 17), “Gentefied” (Feb. 21), “Arrival” (Feb. 26), “Queen Sono” (Feb. 28).']",New additions include “Road to Roma” and “Better Call Saul: Season 4.”
"As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Anti-Chinese Sentiment",2020-01-30,By Motoko Rich,"['In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter. In Singapore, tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country. In Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome. In France, a front-page headline in a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” And in a suburb of Toronto, parents demanded that a school district keep children of a family that had recently returned from China out of classes for 17 days. The rapid spread of the coronavirus that has sickened about 9,800 people — the overwhelming majority in China, with all of the 213 deaths there — has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe. While officials scramble to contain the crisis — the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and the State Department issued a “do not travel” to China advisory — fears over the dangerous outbreak have fueled xenophobia. And the wave of spreading panic has, at times, far outstripped practical concerns. At a time when China’s rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China. “Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa. [Read: Coronavirus is forcing foreign students in China to choose: stay or go.] Some of the response to the outbreak can be seen as a rational calculation based on the risk of infection: Airlines are canceling flights to Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, and other Chinese cities, and conference organizers are asking Chinese delegations not to attend.  Late Thursday, Italy’s prime minister said that his country had blocked all flights to and from China. And countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether. “I think it is time to put a temporary ‘do not enter’ sign on our doorstep for visitors from China,” said Ralph Recto, a lawmaker in the Philippines. Bangkok residents are avoiding malls that are particularly popular with Chinese tourists. A plastic surgery office in the wealthy Gangnam neighborhood of Seoul has instructed employees that they can see Chinese customers only if they can prove that they have been in South Korea for 14 days or more, the potential period that the virus can lie dormant. At a sushi restaurant in the neighborhood that once housed the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, where about 90 percent of the customers are Chinese, Yaeko Suenaga, 70, a server, said she understood why some stores might want to reject visitors from China. “I don’t think this fear comes from discrimination,” Ms. Suenaga said, “but from the true fear that humans have of getting infected with a virus that may lead to death.” Ms. Suenaga said that her restaurant would continue to welcome all customers, but that workers would wear masks. It is not always easy to discern the boundary between understandable fear and unmistakable discrimination. But some protective measures have effectively amounted to racial or ethnic profiling. At Bread Box, a banh mi restaurant in central Hoi An, a popular tourist outpost in Vietnam, the owners posted a makeshift sign outside their storefront this month reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY!” Up the coast, the Danang Riverside Hotel announced on Saturday that it would not accept any Chinese guests because of the virus. Kwong Wing Catering, a small restaurant chain in Hong Kong, announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday that it would serve only patrons speaking English or Cantonese, the city’s native language — a tongue distinct from the Mandarin spoken on the mainland. The business has been a vocal supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement that has risen up in defiance of Beijing. Public health experts said they understood some of the impulses. “In a sense, it’s a natural reaction to try to distance yourself from a potential cause of illness, particularly when there’s no known cure,” said Karen Eggleston, director of the Asia health policy program at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University. But examples in both mass and social media have clearly crossed a line. In Australia, The Herald Sun, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, published the words “China Virus Panda-monium” over an image of a red mask. More than 46,000 people from the resident Chinese community in Australia signed a petition that called the headline “unacceptable race discrimination.” Le Courrier Picard, a regional newspaper in northern France, caused outrage with its “Yellow Alert” headline this month. The newspaper later apologized. On Twitter in Japan, where there has long been unease about the conduct of Chinese tourists, commenters have labeled them “dirty” and “insensitive” and have called them “bioterrorists.” Disinformation is also running high. A much-viewed YouTube video in South Korea claims that a biochemical weapons facility in China leaked the coronavirus, a theory that has gained currency in other corners of the globe. In Australia, a fake post circulating on Instagram warned that shops in Sydney containing items like fortune cookies, rice and “Chinese Red Bull” were contaminated. The episodes of racism have swept up other people of Asian descent. In France, one Vietnamese woman told the newspaper Le Monde that she had been insulted by a car driver who shouted “Keep your virus, dirty Chinese!” and “You are not welcome in France” as he sped away through a puddle, splashing her. In Australia, Andy Miao, 24, an ethnic Chinese Australian who returned this month from a trip to China, said that passengers on public transport gave him odd looks if he was not wearing a face mask. “It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” Mr. Miao said. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.” The Chinese — and Asians in general — were subjected to similar xenophobic reactions during the SARS epidemic of 2003. But now far more Chinese are traveling abroad: According to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Chinese travelers made about 150 million overseas trips in 2018, up more than 14 percent from the previous year. China’s lockdown of tens of millions of people, intended to curb the spread of the virus, may be spurring other governments to overreact, said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. “The fact that the Chinese government itself is treating people like that would in some ways enable or encourage some of the other people or governments to take equally draconian measures,” Mr. Nakano said. Some governments are trying to ease the panic. In Toronto, politicians, a school board and some community groups have issued public appeals to avoid a repetition of the racism that swept the city in 2003, when SARS killed 44 people there. “While the virus can be traced to a province in China, we have to be cautious that this not be seen as a Chinese virus,” the school board in the York Region, a suburb with many Asian residents, said in a statement issued on Monday. “At times such as this, we must come together as Canadians and avoid any hint of xenophobia, which in this case can victimize our East Asian Chinese community.” Although Indonesia has suspended flights from Wuhan, the governor of West Sumatra, Irwan Prayitno, ignored a plea from a citizens group to reject all Chinese tourists. On Sunday, he went to the airport to welcome 174 Chinese visitors from the southwestern city of Kunming. In the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo, which is often thronged with Chinese tourists, Michiko Kubota, who runs a clothing boutique, said she hoped the Japanese government might do more to help China, such as by sending masks or other medical supplies. “Japan and China may be critical of each other sometimes, but the kindness is mutual,” Ms. Kubota said. “I hope we could do more to help eradicate fear in China as well.” Reporting was contributed by Ian Austen, Hannah Beech, Aurelien Breeden, Jason Gutierrez, Makiko Inoue, Isabella Kwai, Su-Hyun Lee, Tiffany May, Seth Mydans, Katrina Northrop, Jin Wu, Eimi Yamamitsu and Li Yuan.']","Fears of the outbreak have fueled xenophobia as a wave of panic spreads, sometimes outstripping practical concerns."
"As Virus Spreads, U.S. Temporarily Bars Foreigners Who’ve Visited China",2020-01-31,,"['[This briefing has ended. Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.] The Trump administration is imposing temporary travel restrictions that bar entry into the United States by any foreign national who has traveled to China in the past 14 days, officials said Friday. The restrictions, a reaction to the coronavirus that has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, will be put into place at 5 p.m. on Sunday. The United States on Friday also declared the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 12,000 people and has spread to the United States and other countries, a public health emergency. Friday’s action exempts immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents. In addition, officials said, any United States citizen returning home who has been in the Hubei province of China within the past 14 days will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei. Those who have been to other parts of China within the past 14 days will be subject to “proactive entry screening” and up to 14 days of monitoring and self quarantine. The United States will also funnel all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy Airport, Chicago’s O’Hare and San Francisco International Airport. The travel restrictions were announced Friday by Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, who declared that the coronavirus posed “a public health emergency in the United States.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the actions were being taken because there were “a lot of unknowns” surrounding the virus and its transmission path. “The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,” Dr. Fauci said. The broadening outbreak has roiled stock markets and raised alarms about possible harm to global economic growth. The S&P 500 suffered its sharpest decline of the year on Friday after major airlines in the United States said they would cancel flights to and from mainland China. It was the worst daily decline since October, and pushed the markets into negative territory for the year. The cancellations by Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines were the latest example of economic disruption wrought by the coronavirus, just as the global economy had begun to recover from the trade war tensions that dominated 2019. Companies have restricted travel to the region, shut stores in China and warned of the possible financial impact. Economists seem certain that the travel shutdowns, factory closures and quarantines in mainland China will dampen economic activity there, but have said it is too soon to know the impact elsewhere. “It is a wild card — I think even the experts would confirm that it’s too soon to tell,” said Richard Clarida, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, during an interview on Friday on Bloomberg Television. The Fed is “monitoring closely,” he said. Concerns about global growth sent oil prices down below $52 a barrel. That pushed shares of energy companies down: Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropped by roughly 4 percent. Tech stocks also suffered, with particular weakness in the semiconductor sector, which is closely linked to supply chains based in and around China. Economists have only begun to sketch out estimates on the potential effects of the outbreak. Many have taken comfort from the economic record of the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 and 2003, which suggests that any downturn might be limited in scope. SARS coincided with a relatively brief slowdown of global growth in early 2003, that was followed by a sharp rebound. SARS, however, is an imperfect comparison. Some economists have suggested the ripple effects could be larger this time. At the time of the SARS outbreak, China represented just 5 percent of the global economy. In 2019, that number was 18 percent, according to JPMorgan economists. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines all said on Friday that they were suspending all service to mainland China as concerns about the coronavirus spread internationally. American said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China immediately through March 27. American and United will continue flights to Hong Kong. Delta and United said they would suspend service starting on Feb. 6. United said it expected to resume operations on March 28. Delta, which does not fly to Hong Kong, said it would suspend service through April 30. Delta said in a statement that its last flight to mainland China from the United States would depart on Monday, and that its last flight to the United States from mainland China would leave on Wednesday. Delta was the first American airline to completely suspend service to China because of the virus. United Airlines had already reduced its service to the country this week. Share prices in all three airlines had fallen by midday. Airlines outside the United States are also clamping down on travel. In Rwanda and Kenya, RwandAir and Kenya Airways said they would cancel all flights to and from Guangzhou, the southern Chinese metropolis, until further notice. There have been no confirmed cases in Africa. Poland’s national airline, LOT Polish Airlines, has suspended flights to China until Feb. 9, a deputy prime minister said on Twitter. More than a dozen people suspected of having the coronavirus are hospitalized in Poland, and over 500 people are being monitored by health services. Iran has suspended all flights to China because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters. Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported on Friday that all flights from China to the Islamic Republic have also been banned. Several Canadian companies have suspended employee travel to China after Air Canada’s decision on Wednesday to suspend service to Shanghai and Beijing. The Montreal-based carrier normally operates 33 flights a week to and from the two Chinese cities. The United States government has imposed a federal quarantine on 195 people who were evacuated on Wednesday from Wuhan, China, to a California military base, officials said on Friday. The group will be held at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., for 14 days, to ensure that they are not infected with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 9,800 people in China and killed more than 200 people. Chinese officials on Saturday reported the highest death toll so far in a 24-hour period. ◆ The 46 new deaths in China raised the toll to 259. ◆ About 2,100 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 12,000, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 100 cases have been confirmed in 21 other countries. ◆ All of China’s provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak. ◆  Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland. ◆ Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China. ◆ No deaths have been reported outside China. A call has been issued for classes to be canceled at Arizona State University. Basketball games were postponed at Miami University in Ohio. And at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, two students from Wuhan were moved to a special dorm. On college campuses across the United States, the global alarm over coronavirus is particularly intense. Hundreds of students are being screened for the virus. Suspected cases at many colleges — Baylor, Wesleyan and Tennessee Tech — have turned out to be false alarms, but the anxiety continues. At A.S.U., where there is one confirmed case of coronavirus, a cough in the back of a classroom now brings nervous glances. Students who had planned to study abroad this semester are furiously adjusting schedules. Carolyn Kleve, 20, a junior at Arizona State who is 13 weeks pregnant, is afraid. “We’re trapped in a room of 20 to 30 people and I don’t know who has what illness,” Ms. Kleve said of her classes. “Have I already come into contact with it? Who knows?” A high-ranking Chinese official said on Friday that he felt responsible for the spread of the coronavirus, offering his most direct expression of responsibility for the crisis. Many residents and experts have said that the reluctance by the government in Wuhan to warn the public about the spreading disease created dangerous complacency. “Above all, I feel guilty and remorseful and I reproach myself,” said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party secretary of Wuhan. “I’ve been constantly thinking that if I’d made the decision earlier to take the kind of strict controls we have in place now, the outcome would have been much better than now.” Mr. Ma was asked about his feelings in an interview on China’s main television network, CCTV. Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who is less powerful than Mr. Ma, said the government’s own laws hindered faster public disclosure. The State Department on Thursday night issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the dangerous new coronavirus. The department set the new advisory at Level 4, or red — its highest alert, reserved for the most perilous situations. “Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the State Department said. “Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.” A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, called the advisory an unfriendly act at a difficult time for China. “True feeling shines through in hardship,” Ms. Hua said on Friday. “Many countries have shown their support and help for China’s fight against the epidemic. By contrast, the United States’ words and deeds are not in keeping with the facts and less are they in keeping with friendship.” The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a global emergency after cases were discovered in more than a dozen countries. Singapore on Friday announced a sweeping ban on Chinese visitors and other foreigners who had been to China in the past 14 days, in an escalation of travel restrictions by the Southeast Asian transportation hub. The city-state will also stop issuing all forms of visas to people holding Chinese passports, Lawrence Wong, the minister for national development, said on Friday. Singapore has 13 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The outbreak and the entry shutdown will be another blow to its economy, which was already hit by the fallout from the United States-China trade war. Regional neighbors and airlines from countries that have not had any confirmed cases are also taking extra precautions to cope with the rapidly spreading epidemic. The government of Mongolia said on Friday that it would close its border with China until March 2. The authorities said they would work to bring home 30 Mongolian nationals from Wuhan, and its citizens in China would have until Feb. 6 to return. Non-Chinese foreigners visiting Mongolia will also not be able to enter through China. Russia, which shares a 2,600-mile border with China, has also been racing to prevent the spread of the disease. The country reported its first two coronavirus cases on Friday, both in Siberia and among Chinese nationals who had recently traveled to China. Russia closed the border to pedestrians and cars on Thursday, and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana A. Golikova said that Russia’s border with Mongolia would be closed to Chinese citizens. Russia will also temporarily stop issuing work visas to Chinese citizens, she added. On Friday, Britain’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said two residents had tested positive for coronavirus, the first known cases in the country. In a statement, Mr. Whitty said the patients were members of the same family. The announcement came as a flight carrying 83 British and 27 foreign nationals from Wuhan landed in Britain on Friday afternoon. The Britons were to be quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, in northwest England, according to the BBC. The others will be flown on to Spain. The Italian government declared a six-month state of emergency on Friday after the first two cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Rome, according to a government official. In a statement, the government said that it had allocated the “necessary funds” to begin precautionary measures. A government official said on Friday that five million euros, about $5.5 million, had been set aside for the effort. Two Chinese nationals, a husband and wife, were being held in isolation at Rome’s Spallanzani Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases, after they tested positive for the virus. The couple arrived in Milan a week ago and traveled to Parma and other cities before getting to Rome, where the husband began showing flu symptoms, the official said. A group of Chinese tourists who had been traveling with the couple were also being held in isolation at the hospital, Italian officials said Friday. At present, none of the other Chinese visitors showed any symptoms, said the Lazio region’s councilor for health, Alessio D’Amato, at a news conference on Friday.Three people who had come in contact with the infected couple were also being monitored at home, he also said. On Thursday, thousands of passengers had been blocked from leaving a cruise ship that docked at an Italian port for more than 12 hours over concerns that someone aboard might have had the virus. That episode was ultimately found to be a false alarm. In Germany, the Bavarian state Health Ministry confirmed a sixth case of the virus on Friday — the first child to be infected in the country. The child is related to another coronavirus patient identified this week.  On Friday, a German  passenger jet left for China to evacuate more than 100 German citizens from Wuhan and Hubei province, according to the German foreign ministry. Although none of the people on the passenger list appear to be infected, they will spend two weeks in quarantine once they arrive in Germany. As foreign governments evacuated their citizens from China this week, China said it was arranging chartered flights to bring Wuhan residents who were overseas back to the epicenter of the outbreak. Citing the “practical difficulties recently encountered” by residents abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday that evacuations would begin as soon as possible. Five million people from Wuhan left the city last week before travel restrictions were enforced. Unnerved by the exodus, some regional countries and territories have banned entry to people from Wuhan or Hubei province. Travel restrictions across China and the suspension of international flights to the country have left Chinese travelers stranded around the world. But it was unclear if the Chinese government was also targeting those who had intentionally fled the center of the outbreak. It was similarly unknown where the residents had traveled. Someone stole 25,000 face masks from a warehouse in Hong Kong on Friday as the city, still haunted by memories of SARS, is struggling with a severe shortage. The police said 500 boxes containing 50 masks each were reported missing from a building in an industrial neighborhood. The warehouse mostly supplied an e-commerce platform in the city, The Apple Daily newspaper reported. The theft came as residents in Hong Kong desperately searched for the item, often displayed at inflated prices, in pharmacies and retailers. In a dangerous practice, families that cannot afford new disposable masks have resorted to reusing them, according to local reports.

A View of Brexit From the Soccer Field,2020-01-31,By Allison McCann,"['PORTSMOUTH, England — The team bus for the Leyton Orient women’s soccer team can sometimes be stifling. More than a dozen players sit, shoulder-to-shoulder, for hours in tedium under fluorescent blue lights (and in fear of having to use the one bathroom). There is, at least, free tea. The team’s striker, Otesha Charles, a dual citizen of Guyana and Britain, owns a hair salon in south London and eats Sainsbury’s salmon sandwiches before games. Cheryl Anderson, an accountant and defender from Scotland, is so soft-spoken and nice that it can be stunning to see her dive into a hard slide tackle. The others are teachers, postal workers, lawyers and a London subway driver. And then there is me, a former collegiate athlete from America who landed in London last January at a moment when every day brought another screaming headline about how Brexit had torn the country apart. “We had to move forward before the damage caused became irreparable,” one Briton lamented. On the surface, our team is a snapshot of Britain, containing many of its divisions. There are Leavers and Remainers. There are immigrants from different corners of the world, transplanted Europeans and players from across Britain. On hourslong bus rides to bleak stadiums, I started to understand this country a little better through the personal stories of my teammates more than I had from any shouting lawmaker or television talking head. Two players talked about insufficient government funding at state schools where they taught. Another who had endured several knee surgeries emphasized the importance of the National Health Service. And everyone complained about the train delays. Some of the European players who want to continue living and working in Britain were working to secure their settled status before Brexit takes full effect at the end of this year. Leyton Orient was just one team, in one city, in a country with deep economic, social and political division. But seeing everything through the prism of Brexit wasn’t how these women lived. On a particularly wet Sunday in December, we drove a few hours to Portsmouth, a city on England’s south coast that voted overwhelmingly to leave the European Union. It was so cold that the stadium served Bovril — a kind of salty, meaty broth engineered to warm fans during the bleakest weather. The field was a waterlogged pit of mud, beaten into submission by never-ending rain. One teammate saw my horrified gaze and smiled: “Welcome to English football.” The fear that Brexit has polarized Britain beyond repair is often discussed by commentators. But activities like sports, music clubs and communal gardens — the “micro-publics” of everyday life — can change how people from different backgrounds or political leanings think and interact with one another. “Physical proximity in its own right doesn’t yield a huge amount,” said Ash Amin, a geography professor at the University of Cambridge. “But if the shared activity lasts, then the political discussion may follow. And disagreement may not close down the dialogue because of the civility that arises from a shared activity and shared space.” Our two starting central midfielders are an example. They play together seamlessly, bouncing one-and-two-touch passes off each other, but off the field they’re two very different people. Fran Ali, a 26-year-old midfielder from east London, works as a planning specialist for Britain’s rail system. She said she voted for Brexit because she wanted Britain to have more control over its future. “I’m not too into politics, don’t get me wrong,” she said later at a packed pub back in London. “But my main reason voting for leave was so that we could control our laws, our borders and our money.” Her midfield partner is Egle Trezzi, a 31-year-old photographer from outside Milan who moved to Britain more than a decade ago and teaches at Goldsmiths University in London. “Personally, I think it’s a stupid idea,” she said of Brexit as we drove home from a game in January, under the kind of sky that suggests the sun will never come out again. “I don’t support it, and whatever happens, it’s going to be bad.” Fran said she recalled once teasing Egle for “being lefty,” but said they had never gotten into an argument over politics. “I respect her views, and she respects mine.” In November, when we played in Cheltenham — an area that voted to remain — the general election was just weeks away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was campaigning on a promise to “get Brexit done,” while the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats offered another vote on Brexit. But we didn’t talk about any of that. The muddy field defined our world that day as we picked one another up out of wet holes, cleared clods of earth from our cleats and laughed at who was the dirtiest. We won the game 1-0 and, for the first time in the team’s history, made it to the second round of the FA Cup, one of the world’s oldest soccer tournaments. We were promised a celebratory dinner on the ride home, but this was a Sunday in England and almost everything was closed. At a gas station, we bought cheap beers and canned gin and tonics instead. At a January game against Cambridge City, a university town that overwhelmingly supported staying in the bloc, the locker room was covered in a thin layer of filth. A sign taped to the wall said, “Please do not clean your boots in the showers.” The showers were cold. There was no trainer with us that day, so the players started getting one another ready for the game: taping ankles, stretching hamstrings, passing around any pain reliever we had. “Football is its own form of communication, and it’s often a nonverbal form of communication,” said Becca Hirst, 23, who grew up playing in Liverpool and voted to remain. But she wondered whether soccer on its own was enough to bridge any real divides. “How far do the people that you meet playing football translate into your everyday politics, your everyday actions, your feelings toward other people?” Some British voters said they favored leaving the bloc so that Britain could have more control over immigration and over who is allowed to live and work in the country. But that debate revived questions around British identity — including who is British and who is not. Otesha came to Britain when she was seven years old, and said she remembered feeling like an outsider. The other students at her school “wanted to hear my little Caribbean accent,” she said. “I didn’t feel British. I knew I was Guyanese in England.” She credits soccer with helping shape her sense of British identity. “Having a big team of 22 girls, I started to feel like this was my community,” she said. “I am a part of England and everything that comes with it.” Britain’s official departure from the European Union on Friday is mostly symbolic. The transition period is due to last through the end of the year, allowing time for negotiations over trade and other relations. But maybe once the tie is formally cut, people on both sides of Brexit can reconcile. “There are people on this team who voted leave and who voted remain, and it had no impact on our team ethos or hanging out outside of football,” said Sophie Le Marchand, a 31-year-old player from Worcester who is a teacher. “It had no impact whatsoever.”']","Political turmoil may have roiled Westminster. But on wet fields across Britain, a fourth-tier team shows what it looks like to just get on with it."
Trump’s Mideast Plan Leaves Palestinians With Few Options,2020-01-29,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — For Mahmoud Abbas, the ailing octogenarian president of the Palestinian Authority, his life’s work — a viable state side-by-side with Israel — is quickly slipping away. President Trump’s Middle East plan deprives the Palestinians of nearly everything they had been fighting for: East Jerusalem as their national capital, the removal of Jewish settlements on the West Bank, and territorial contiguity and control over their own borders and security that a sovereign state normally enjoys. While it was always presumed that such a state would be forged through talks with the Israelis, years of failure, a weak and divided Palestinian leadership, and an Arab world that has largely moved on have all emboldened Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to try to impose a solution of their own. The landscape has shifted so much in recent years that Mr. Abbas has few good options. With only muted reaction from Arab neighbors, a struggling Palestinian economy, little apparent appetite among Palestinians for a violent response and the United States having abandoned any pretense of neutral mediation, a proposal that might have been considered outlandish a decade ago landed with little serious opposition. Rather than fighting back, some Palestinian activists on Wednesday were saying the best option may be breaking up the Palestinian Authority, leaving Israel to assume the burden of providing for the West Bank’s 2.5 million Palestinians. Mr. Abbas could decide that this is the moment for dramatic pushback, like walking away from the security cooperation that has long helped protect Israelis from terrorism. He could try to unleash violence to try to draw more global attention. But if his overriding motive is self-preservation, the safer option would be to try to weather the storm, hoping that Mr. Trump is defeated in November, or Mr. Netanyahu even sooner. That focus on his own survival, as Mr. Abbas’s many local detractors are keenly aware, would place him in the same category as his American and Israeli adversaries — leaders whose personal and political predicaments appear to be driving them in making the weightiest decisions of state. “One guy’s dealing with impeachment, another with an indictment, and Abbas is 85 years old,” said Dimitri Diliani, a 46-year-old member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council who is impatient for the president, who is still 84, to go. “He’s looking for a way to dodge the bullet and stay in power.” But even if they wanted to, Palestinians have only a limited ability to stand up to an American-Israeli partnership. Yara Hawari, 31, a scholar and analyst for Al Shabaka, a network of Palestinian analysts, said the Trump plan was becoming a cautionary tale about the diminishing importance of international law when those making the rules are unafraid to exploit their power. “What happens here can happen elsewhere very easily,” she said. “If you don’t care for the Palestinians, at least care for yourselves.” The assorted calls for action from Palestinian activists, thinkers and analysts eager to shake up the prevailing inertia sounded like variations on a theme of admitting the failure of the Palestinian Authority to grow into a state. Some called for the authority to dismantle itself, which would require Israel to take on the costs of health, education, social welfare and policing of West Bank Palestinians, and would remove an entity that they see as camouflaging the occupation’s ugliness. “We couldn’t have seen 50 presidents and prime ministers in Israel last week if it was revealed as an apartheid state,” said Hamada Jaber, an activist in Ramallah, referring to a Holocaust commemoration in Jerusalem that attracted dozens of world leaders. “It’s still hiding itself behind the P.A.” But Tareq Baconi, 36, a Palestinian analyst for International Crisis Group, cautioned that any wind-down of the authority should be strategic, not impulsive. “There needs to be a serious exploration — not another empty threat from the president’s office — of what dismantling the P.A. looks like,” he said. “How will the economy be managed, what kind of resilience infrastructure needs to be built to take its place, and how can security cooperation end without endangering Palestinians or risking instability?” Mr. Abbas has remained typically opaque, offering little insight into his current thinking. One of the weaknesses and failings of the leadership, said Sari Nusseibeh, 70, the former president of Al Quds University, was “its inability to address the people openly and to present ideas.” “I don’t know if they are doing any thinking at a deep level,” Mr. Nusseibeh continued, “and Abbas, as people say, is very much a one-man show.” He is also increasingly authoritarian, as Ms. Hawari noted. “I’m trying not to fall into the trap of calling for anything so I don’t get arrested,” she said, adding, “I don’t see a just and free Palestinian future with the P.A. in place.” Mr. Abbas called again Tuesday for elections, prompting eye rolls among critics who note he is entering the 16th year of what was supposed to be a four-year term. Few believe he is serious. A better idea, several said, would be to hold elections for the Palestine Liberation Organization, as a way of revitalizing the group still widely seen as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Still, many Palestinians view the authority, one of the few tangible achievements of the national cause, as worth preserving. “Personally I don’t think handing over the keys is a smart move,” said Nour Odeh, a Palestinian writer and analyst. “A right-wing Israel drunk on power with Trump’s support couldn’t care less,” she said, adding: “We built these institutions with the blood and sweat of our sons and daughters. Why give it up?” Raja Khalidi, a development economist who runs a research institute, said there was the added matter of a sense of duty. “I can’t see any political leadership walking away from the responsibility it’s assumed for 30 years and allowing Israel to return to that role,” he said. Disillusioned about statehood, especially the kind of statehood now on offer, Palestinians are increasingly rejecting a two-state solution to work for a single state with equal rights and the vote for all people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. That idea, though, is “unrealistic,” said Sani Meo, publisher of This Week in Palestine, a Ramallah-based magazine. “Of course Israel will never give us the vote.” A more immediate measure many Palestinians want is an end to Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, which they see more as collaboration with the enemy. Mr. Abbas has resisted that so far because the teamwork with Israel also helps keep Hamas at bay in the West Bank, ensuring his survival. Equally popular would be national reconciliation and the healing of the 13-year bitter schism between Mr. Abbas’s Fatah-led Authority in the West Bank and his rivals in Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. There was a veneer of unity the night the Trump plan was announced, with Mr. Abbas and the head of Hamas’s politburo, Ismail Haniya, speaking by phone. But few believe it will go anywhere. And the leadership has problems other than disunity. Mr. Baconi of the International Crisis Group recalled that before the British election last month, he sat with Palestinian officials who expressed the seemingly far-fetched hope that Jeremy Corbyn would win, Mr. Netanyahu would be defeated and Bernie Sanders would be elected president of the United States. “It misses the point that you don’t manage the context, you operate in it,” Mr. Baconi said. So far, though the Israeli military sent reinforcements into the West Bank and along the Gaza border on Wednesday, Palestinians were not taking to the streets in large numbers. It would be wrong to read that as acquiescence, Ms. Hawari said. The Palestinian grass roots have been weakened over time, she said, not just by the Israelis but also by the authority’s own repression, since protesters against the Israeli occupation also sometimes protest against autocracy and the corruption of their own leaders. She added that the hundreds of Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers at demonstrations along the Gaza fence had set a “really gruesome precedent” for how Israel might respond to a mass mobilization. “If thousands of us went down to the streets in the West Bank, do you think that would be met lightly?” she asked. Mr. Diliani, the Fatah Revolutionary Council member, said Palestinians were torn over whom to protest against. “Do we overcome our internal problems with Abbas first?” he asked. “Or with Israel?” He added: “You will hear this conversation in every restaurant, everywhere you go. Who do we target first? Who should we fight?” What Palestinians of every age and background still can agree on is the idea that merely staying on the land, with steadfastness, or “sumud” in Arabic, is an act of resistance. “We are not going anywhere,” Ms. Odeh, the writer, said. Their mere presence, she said, poses a long-term challenge to Israel’s right wing, not to mention Zionism itself. Mr. Khalidi, the economist, said Palestinians needed to focus inward while they wait for a better set of circumstances. “How do we get back to being one community?” he asked. “What can we do to get people engaged in building their lives, and their nation, without it necessarily being a state?” “What do I need a state for,” he added, “if it doesn’t give me more than I already have?”']",The landscape has shifted so much that a proposal that would have been a nonstarter a decade ago has put the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in a bind.

Abduction of Ethiopian Students Fuels Anger at the Government,2020-01-30,By Simon Marks and Abdi Latif Dahir,"['ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopians are taking to the streets and to social media to protest their government’s failure to find at least a dozen university students and five other people who were believed to have been kidnapped from a bus by masked men in December in the latest in a chain of ethnically driven conflicts. The students, most of whom are women who belong to the Amhara ethnic group, were studying at Dembi Dolo University in Oromia, a region populated by ethnic Oromos, officials said. The two ethnic groups, which have clashed in the past, account for about 60 percent of the population of about 100 million in this nation in the Horn of Africa. The disappearance has stoked anger, resentment and frustration at the government, with thousands of protesters joining demonstrations in recent days to demand answers. Relatives and supporters began a campaign using the hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurStudents, reminiscent of the efforts to rescue schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in the northern Nigerian village of Chibok in 2014. “The families are crying — they are begging for help,” said Dessalegn Chanie, the chairman of the National Movement of Amhara, an opposition party. “These are poor farmers who have invested a lot in their kids to send them to school.” The case poses a danger to the governing party of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has introduced sweeping political reforms that have won him global praise and the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Amid the growing criticism, Mr. Abiy met on Thursday with eight parents of the kidnapped students, his office said. Officials said on Wednesday that they had organized a group to investigate the kidnappings, and that federal and regional security forces were collaborating in the search. If the authorities know the kidnappers’ identities, they have not said so. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction. But Asmera Shime, a first-year student at Dembi Dolo University, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that she was on the bus on Dec. 4 when it was stopped by more than a dozen men armed with sticks. She said that the students had been fleeing violence between Amhara and Oromo students that had erupted on campus the day before. Ms. Shime said the men confiscated their phones and forced the group to walk in the jungle for about 40 minutes. She said the kidnappers were Oromo, but she did not know if they represented an organized group. When they began arguing with some of the students about why they were being kidnapped, she says she escaped. Ms. Shime said she had spent three days in the forest before encountering a farmer. “He took me to his house and gave me his hoodie to keep me from being identified,” she said in a telephone interview. “He got me on the bus going back to Dembi Dolo.” Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Abiy, confirmed that Ms. Shime had related the account of her escape to a “command post officer in the area” of the kidnapping. A relative of Ms. Shime corroborated her account. The abduction of the students comes after a number of deadly clashes on Ethiopian campuses in recent months. In November, the government confirmed the death of three students — two students at Woldia University in Amhara region and one at Dembi Dolo University. In December, the government deployed federal police to universities in an attempt to calm ethnic tensions. Mr. Abiy, who is expected to run in the general elections in August, has faced criticism for his handling of the abductions. “There was nothing from the Ethiopian government — there was no acknowledgment,” said Tewodrose Tirfe, the chairman of the Amhara Association of America, an advocacy group. “When people began to question the details and information, they went silent, they went dead.” Since coming to power in April 2018, Mr. Abiy has introduced economic, political and social reforms, including legalizing outlawed opposition groups, releasing political prisoners and pushing to resolve the decades-long border conflict with neighboring Eritrea. Yet his tenure has also been dogged by eruptions of ethnic violence that have forced about three million people from their homes, according to the United Nations. In October, 86 people were killed after Jawar Mohammed, a prominent critic and media baron, accused the police of plotting to attack him. Amnesty International said on Monday that 75 opposition party supporters were detained last weekend in sweeping arrests that the group said “risk undermining the rights to freedom of expression and association ahead of the 2020 elections.” Despite the improved political atmosphere in the country, Mr. Abiy has been accused of following in the footsteps of his predecessors by arbitrarily detaining journalists and shutting down the internet. The authorities said on Jan. 11 that they had freed 21 of the kidnap victims, but families said they had seen no sign yet of their relatives. The prime minister’s press secretary, Nigussu Tilahun, said at the briefing on Wednesday that 17 people are still being held, 12 of them students from Dembi Dolo University — but the families and their advocates question those numbers. Those protesting the students’ kidnappings have faced reprisals, according to Laetitia Bader, a senior researcher in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. Three leaders of the Amhara Students Association, a national body representing ethnic Amharas, were detained this week in the capital, Addis Ababa, and questioned for several hours about their plans to protest, Ms. Bader said. “The government should be allowing individuals to question and criticize its response to the situation of the Dembi Dolo students, and the situation in universities, not trying to silence them,” she said. “Ethiopian students should feel safe when they are at school and university, but they can’t right now.” The case has taken an ominous turn: Ms. Shime said that two weeks after the kidnapping, she received a text message from one of her abducted friends, using a kidnapper’s telephone.

Abduction of Ethiopian Students Fuels Anger at the Government,2020-01-30,By Simon Marks and Abdi Latif Dahir,"['ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopians are taking to the streets and to social media to protest their government’s failure to find at least a dozen university students and five other people who were believed to have been kidnapped from a bus by masked men in December in the latest in a chain of ethnically driven conflicts. The students, most of whom are women who belong to the Amhara ethnic group, were studying at Dembi Dolo University in Oromia, a region populated by ethnic Oromos, officials said. The two ethnic groups, which have clashed in the past, account for about 60 percent of the population of about 100 million in this nation in the Horn of Africa. The disappearance has stoked anger, resentment and frustration at the government, with thousands of protesters joining demonstrations in recent days to demand answers. Relatives and supporters began a campaign using the hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurStudents, reminiscent of the efforts to rescue schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in the northern Nigerian village of Chibok in 2014. “The families are crying — they are begging for help,” said Dessalegn Chanie, the chairman of the National Movement of Amhara, an opposition party. “These are poor farmers who have invested a lot in their kids to send them to school.” The case poses a danger to the governing party of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has introduced sweeping political reforms that have won him global praise and the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. Amid the growing criticism, Mr. Abiy met on Thursday with eight parents of the kidnapped students, his office said. Officials said on Wednesday that they had organized a group to investigate the kidnappings, and that federal and regional security forces were collaborating in the search.

Press Send for Brexit: E.U. Seals U.K. Withdrawal by Email,2020-01-30,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['LONDON — It’s done. At last. The European Union gave its final, formal approval to Brexit on Thursday, clearing the way for Britain to reverse 47 years of integration with the Continent and leave the bloc on Friday night. Following a sometimes emotional vote in the European Parliament on Wednesday, the governments of the 27 countries still in the union gave a unanimous seal of approval to Britain’s withdrawal, officially ending nearly four years of impassioned wrangling over whether, when and how it would happen. [Just get on with it, says Britain. Remainers are girding for the next fight.] In the end, the way the decision became final was vintage Brussels: bureaucratic and undramatic. Diplomats from the remaining member countries were given plain instructions over email just after 8 p.m. Wednesday: Answer these four dry, procedural questions with “yes,” “no,” or “abstain” and send them in an email to the European Council, which represents the 27 nations’ governments. At 1 p.m. Thursday, the replies came in — a foregone conclusion, but the last step needed for the withdrawal agreement to take effect. All member states answered “yes” to all the questions, a European Union official said. On the biggest questions, the European Council meets in person, often with presidents and prime ministers representing their countries. But on Thursday, as if to emphasize how anticlimactic the event was, it used a vote-by-email process reserved for technical decisions that don’t require top officials or august gatherings. And it cloaked the news in the drabbest possible language. “The council has adopted, by written procedure, the decision on the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement on behalf of the E.U.,” the European Council said in a brief statement. “The withdrawal agreement will enter into force upon the U.K.’s exit from the E.U., on 31 January 2020 at midnight” in most of Europe, 11 p.m. in Britain, it added. “From that time on, the U.K. will no longer be an E.U. member state and will be considered as a third country.” In Brussels, some of the next steps will be just as formal and muted, before the negotiations on the future relationship between the European Union and Britain go into full swing. But first come the parties.

French Cardinal Acquitted of Abuse Cover-Up on Appeal,2020-01-30,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — A French appeals court on Thursday overturned a ruling against a cardinal who had been found guilty of covering up decades-old sexual abuse by a priest in his diocese, the latest twist in the most high-profile legal case against a clergyman in France.  Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, 69, the archbishop of Lyon, had been found guilty last year of failing to report allegations of child abuse by the Rev. Bernard Preynat to the authorities.  Father Preynat, 74, went on trial this month and has admitted there to systematically abusing dozens of Boy Scouts in the Lyon region from the 1970s to the 1990s. A verdict in that case is expected in March.  Cardinal Barbarin argued in court — and the appeals court agreed — that he wasn’t legally obligated to report the allegations to the authorities because Father Preynat’s victims were adults when they alerted the cardinal about the abuse, and because he did nothing to intentionally discourage them from going to the authorities themselves. André Soulier, a lawyer for the cardinal, told reporters in Lyon on Thursday that he was “more than satisfied” and that the cardinal should not be an “expiatory victim” held responsible for the failings of the entire Catholic Church.  Cardinal Barbarin, a conservative, was appointed to his post in the Lyon Diocese in 2002, and for years he cultivated the image of an energetic and outspoken clergyman. But the cardinal’s involvement in Father Preynat’s case made him a symbol of the church’s failings and its secretive approach to dealing with sexual abuse cases.  Plaintiffs in the case against the cardinal said he had a responsibility to warn the authorities as soon as he learned about the abuse, even though it had occurred on his predecessor’s watch. François Devaux, one of Father Preynat’s accusers, said the appeal court’s decision was disappointing to victims.  “We are falling short of the reality of this problem of sexual abuse against minors,” he told reporters in Lyon on Thursday. The cardinal served none of his original six-month sentence in prison. It was a suspended sentence — which, under French law, goes into effect only if the person is convicted of a new crime within a certain time frame — and the court overturned it on Thursday. The cardinal, speaking at a brief news conference in Lyon, said that he would once again offer his resignation to Pope Francis. The pope had rejected the cardinal’s  offer to resign after the initial conviction but had let him step down from day-to-day duties at the church while the appeal ran its course.  “This decision enables me to turn the page, and for the church in Lyon it is an opportunity to open a new chapter,” Cardinal Barbarin said. “My thoughts today — always — go to the victims.” Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, said on Thursday that the Holy See “reiterates its proximity to all the victims of abuse” and that it was “at the side” of the Church in Lyon, which had been “sorely afflicted.” Mr. Bruni said that the pope, “who continues to closely follow the unfolding of these painful events,” had taken note of Cardinal Barbarin’s resignation offer and would “make his decision known in good time.” Still, the legal case against the cardinal is not over. Lawyers for the plaintiffs announced on Thursday that they would appeal the verdict before the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in the French judiciary, which will not hold a third trial but instead verify that the law was correctly applied by lower courts. Jean Boudot, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, told reporters in Lyon that the cardinal’s acquittal was “totally incoherent” because it suggested that the obligation under French law to report sexual abuse on a minor ended once victims entered adulthood, disregarding the long-lasting psychological impact of abuse.  Still, the cardinal’s acquittal did not come as a complete surprise. Prosecutors had dropped the charges against Cardinal Barbarin in 2016 after an investigation, but nine of Father Preynat’s accusers used a special procedure to force the cardinal and five other French church officials and employees of the diocese to stand trial. All five of them were acquitted in March.  At his trial on appeal, prosecutors once again sought the cardinal’s acquittal.  Mr. Devaux said on Thursday that he did not regret bringing the case to trial, despite the acquittal, because the lawsuit had helped raise awareness about “the problems of psychic control, of spiritual control” by abusive clergymen.  “Everyone agrees that emerging from all of this is a growing realization and clairvoyance that was lacking for a certain amount of time,” Mr. Devaux told reporters at the courthouse in Lyon.  In 2014, the cardinal was contacted by a parishioner and former Boy Scout who said that he had been abused by Father Preynat and that he was disturbed to learn that the priest was still officiating and still in contact with children. But it later emerged, in press reports and at trial, that the cardinal had been aware of the abuse several years earlier and had only removed the priest from office in August 2015 — which the appeals court called “seriously objectionable.”  It also found, as the lower court had, that the cardinal should have reported the abuse when he learned about it at that earlier stage — before the victims contacted him — but that his failure to do so was no longer punishable because the statute of limitations for that offense had passed.  An independent commission created by the bishops’ conference of France to shed light on sexual abuse in the French clergy has already heard from thousands of people reporting such cases, and a report is expected in 2021. In a statement on Thursday, the conference expressed “gratitude” to the victims of Father Preynat for coming forward and said it was determined to “pursue the necessary work” against sexual abuse in the Church.  Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.

An Outbreak of Racist Sentiment as Coronavirus Reaches Australia,2020-01-31,By Isabella Kwai,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Isabella Kwai, a reporter with the Australia bureau. Recently, when Andy Miao takes the train to work in Sydney, he has noticed other people’s disapproving looks if he does not wear a face mask. Although he does not have the coronavirus, Mr. Miao, who is of Chinese heritage and grew up in Australia, knows it’s because of one reason: his ethnicity. “It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” said Mr. Miao, 24, who returned from a trip to China earlier this month and has since seen jokes degrading Chinese people. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.” But as the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency after the virus spread to countries including Australia, he is worried about an outbreak of misinformation, panic and xenophobia. The virus has killed more than 200 people, with nearly 10,000 cases reported, though in Australia there are just a handful of cases, and health officials have said that the risk of catching it for many Australians is low. Still, universities have delayed exams, face masks — used only weeks ago against bush-fire smoke — are a common sight, and the government plans to evacuate Australians from the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Other responses here in Australia, where the relationship with China is contentious, have taken a more xenophobic bent.  Some far-right lawmakers polled their followers, asking if Australians should ban Chinese people temporarily from the country. A newspaper in Victoria, The Herald Sun, called the coronavirus a “Chinese Virus” on its front page, prompting over 40,000 people to sign a petition demanding an apology. On social media, fake announcements are warning people away from Chinese-populated areas, and memes are making light of early reports that the virus jumped from wild animals to humans. “Racism feeds on fear and anxiety,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a former race-discrimination commissioner and now a professor at the University of Sydney. While the virus originated in China, “viral diseases don’t have ethnic, racial or national characteristics,” he said, adding that the misinformation was “alarming.” On Wednesday, the government said that it planned to evacuate Australians citizens from the province to Christmas Island, an Australian territory 2,000 miles away from the mainland, to be quarantined for 14 days. But many questioned the implications of using Christmas Island, where refugees and asylum seekers have been held, instead of military bases on the mainland.  It was not an “appropriate” place to quarantine people, Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a television news interview. Faced with the decision, many Australians are opting to stay behind in lockdown. Some of the rhetoric has been reminiscent of a time when Chinese people were purposely excluded from the country. “You could read a similar article in the goldfields in 1860s Victoria,” said Jon Piccini, a lecturer in history at the Australian Catholic University. As scientists race to develop a vaccine, the virus is likely to continue to spread. Many wonder if it will further perpetuate stereotypes — the same ones that once prompted Australia to ban nonwhites from calling the country home. Mr. Miao said he did not blame people for being ignorant, though he added, “I don’t think it’s very fair.” Have you noticed or been affected by the fear around the coronavirus?

One hundred miles from Portland, and there’s a lot of real —  but ocean-less —  forest in between. Why all the way to the dunes? If you go into the dunes, there are just no people in there. It’s quiet, except for the Pacific Ocean. The sound of the ocean is there all the time, day and night. The ocean never sleeps. I walk to the water. The water runs to meet you. You can touch it. It’s thousands of miles to the next shore.  Sometimes, at night, the stars come down to the horizon almost all the way around. But I never go in the water there either. Just back into the dunes.” — Fred Cann  Enjoying the Australia Letter? Sign up here or forward to a friend.

"E.U. Recommends Limiting, but Not Banning, Huawei in 5G Rollout",2020-01-29,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['The European Union told its members on Wednesday that they should limit so-called high-risk 5G vendors, a category that includes the Chinese tech giant Huawei, but stopped short of recommending a ban on the firm, despite a lengthy and aggressive campaign by the Trump administration. The recommendations are as far as the European Union can go in dictating policy to its member nations, whose governments will have the final word on whether and how they want to let Huawei help build their next generation of wireless telecommunications networks. The European Union guidance, referred to as the “5G toolbox,” is a key moment in the bloc’s intensive work to help its members decide how to navigate fraught political and technical considerations as they and their wireless carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in telecommunications infrastructure. “We can do great things with 5G,” said Margrethe Vestager, a top official of the European Commission, the European Union’s executive body. “But only if we can make our networks secure.” The United States maintains that Huawei poses an espionage threat, as it can be compelled by Chinese law to hand over data or spy on behalf of the Chinese government, and some European officials have voiced similar concerns. The company vehemently rejects the accusations and has repeatedly said it would never engage in espionage. The British government said on Tuesday that it would permit Huawei to develop part of its own next-generation networks. Huawei, considered a high-risk vendor under the British rules, would be limited to 35 percent of the network and would be kept at arm’s length from some more strategically sensitive infrastructure, such as nuclear power and defense systems. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, commenting on the European Union’s announcement, said, “We’ll have to see what they actually do and, importantly, how they implement what they’ve laid out.” “There is also a chance for the United Kingdom to relook at this as implementation moves forward,” he added. The European Commission experts recommended that national regulators should enforce some restrictions to protect so-called core parts of their networks seen as particularly vulnerable to hacking or espionage. Countries should “apply relevant restrictions for suppliers considered to be high risk, including necessary exclusions to effectively mitigate risks for key assets,” the commission said. The twin announcements, in Brussels on Wednesday and London on Tuesday, represent a victory for the Chinese tech giant, which has launched a charm offensive in Europe after it was practically banned from doing business in the United States. They also highlighted the limited impact of a monthslong, intensive and highly publicized lobbying effort by the Trump administration, which pressured both the European Union as a whole and member countries individually to follow its lead and ban Huawei. The campaign included multiple visits by senior United States officials to Brussels and other European capitals. Mr. Pompeo wrote an op-ed, published last month in Politico Europe, that urged European leaders to keep Huawei out of their countries’ networks. “China steals intellectual property for military purposes,” Mr. Pompeo said in May on a trip to London. “It wants to dominate A.I., space technology, ballistic missiles and many other areas.” Germany, the European Union’s biggest and most important economy, is due in the coming months to publish its own decision on how to treat Huawei, a matter that has driven bitter internal debate in the main governing party. The European Union recommendations also come ahead of trade negotiations with the United States that were already likely to be fraught. Brussels has been treading a fine line between China and the United States, trying to balance and maintain both relationships despite pressure from Washington to pick sides. The treatment of Huawei also indicates that despite Brexit, which takes effect later this week, London and Brussels may remain largely aligned on strategic issues, even in the face of pressure from the United States. Still, experts warn that the battle for Huawei isn’t over. In the Czech Republic, for example, the cybersecurity authorities have warned against using Huawei in their 5G rollout. The European Commission guidance will permit outright bans of companies, if that’s what the national authorities prefer. “The toolbox suggests we need to take strategic measures to mitigate these risks — and these strategic measures mention all approaches currently on the table,” said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group based in Brussels. He added that, despite the European Union’s guidance, Britain’s decision to include Huawei was a reflection of the country’s large cyberdefense abilities. “Other countries may find it cheaper to just ‘rip and replace’ Chinese equipment, or they may have no state secrets to protect vis-à-vis China,” he added.']",The bloc’s experts suggested members limit and monitor the involvement of “high-risk” vendors as they invest in next-generation mobile communications infrastructure.
Belgium Acquits Three Doctors in Landmark Euthanasia Case,2020-01-31,By Elian Peltier,"['A Belgian court on Friday acquitted three doctors who had been charged with manslaughter by poisoning, in a landmark case that for the first time charged health professionals criminally under Belgium’s euthanasia law. Euthanasia has been legal in Belgium since 2002. It also is legal in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, but has long been debated in European countries. While certain forms of assisted suicide are practiced in France and Switzerland, the Belgian law goes further. Belgium allows euthanasia if an individual who is incurably ill and encounters unbearable physical or psychological pain, makes a voluntary, well-considered and repeated request, without external pressure. Since 2014, minors can also request euthanasia under certain conditions. The three doctors were facing life-imprisonment sentences over accusations that they had unlawfully poisoned a 38-year-old woman in 2010. The woman, Tine Nys, requested euthanasia under the law in 2009, according to Joris Van Cauter, the lawyer for Sophie Nys, one of her two sisters, who said Tine Nys had suffered from depression and heroin addiction and had tried to commit suicide several times. A few months later, the lawyer said, she was diagnosed with autism by a psychiatrist. She received a lethal injection on April 27, 2010, in the company of her parents and her two sisters. But Sophie Nys later argued that Tine Nys had not received sufficient advice, and that doctors had not tried to treat her mental illness. She filed a complaint, saying Tine Nys had not been incurably ill, as the Belgian euthanasia law requires. A minority of euthanasia requests are granted in Belgium when the patient has psychological issues. Sophie Nys’s complaint was initially rejected by a court but later permitted on appeal. “It makes you wonder about medicine and how you make life or death decisions,” the lawyer, Mr. Van Cauter, said about the three doctors who were standing trial. “My client asked, ‘How can you say that you tried to treat her?’” Mr. Van Cauter added that his client and her family had not wanted the doctors to go to prison; instead, they wanted an official acknowledgment that euthanasia should not have been administered under the circumstances. “It’s a bit disappointing,” the lawyer said of the decision, adding that the way Tine Nys was treated “was very sad.” After a two-week trial and eight hours of final debate, a 12-person jury in the criminal court of Ghent, in northwestern Belgium, cleared the three practitioners — the doctor who made the lethal injection, the general practitioner and a psychiatrist. Walter Van Steenbrugge, the lawyer of one of the doctors, Joris Van Hove, said a conviction would have established a dangerous precedent for professionals practicing euthanasia. He said he and his peers had received dozens of letters from worried doctors who said they had halted euthanasia procedures for fear of legal consequences. “My client is very relieved,” Mr. Van Steenbrugge said. “There was a lot at stake, not only for Belgium but for Europe in general.” More than 2,350 people were permitted euthanasia in Belgium in 2018, according to the latest public figures. In the Netherlands, a doctor was acquitted in September after having been accused of failing to secure proper consent from a 74-year-old patient who suffered from Alzheimer’s and had been administered euthanasia by the doctor. In France, a 42-year-old nurse who had been in a vegetative state for more than a decade died in July, after doctors had stopped feeding him artificially, following years of legal battles. The case that received the most attention in recent years in Belgium was  40-year-old Paralympian champion Marieke Vervoort, who was suffering from an incurable degenerative muscle disease, and who died last October, 11 years after having signed the papers paving the way to her death. In Tine Nys’s case, Mr. Van Steenbrugge said the acquittal had sent a strong, reassuring message to doctors. “It was not manslaughter, it wasn’t a crime,” he said. “It was euthanasia.” ']","It was the first time doctors were prosecuted after having administered euthanasia, in the case of a 38-year-old woman who died in 2010."
More Violence. Fewer Prisoners. Inside Mexico’s Criminal Justice Reform.,2020-01-30,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — The raid delivered a resounding blow to Mexico City’s most fearsome criminal group: 31 suspected gang members were arrested, two drug labs were uncovered and a criminal bounty was seized, including two and a half tons of marijuana, 44 pounds of cocaine and an arsenal of weapons. Within a few days, however, the case had collapsed. A judge, finding inconsistencies in the prosecution’s files, freed nearly all of the suspects. And a major victory for the government turned into a major embarrassment. The outcome was, in some ways, a reaffirmation of Mexico’s new criminal justice system. A sweeping overhaul of the judiciary, fully carried out in 2016, has created more transparency in the courts, raised the standards of evidence and given judges more authority to toss out charges because of procedural errors. But with this shift to stronger due process, government officials have come to a difficult realization: An overhaul meant to strengthen the nation’s ability to combat violence and impunity has also made it more difficult to put people behind bars and keep them there. And this has become a political problem for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose efforts to counter the nation’s relentless criminal groups have largely seemed futile. Desperate to show gains, the government is now seeking to re-engineer the justice system once again, through a broad package of reforms intended to strengthen its hand in the fight against crime. Officials said they planned to submit the proposed reforms on Feb. 1 to the legislature. But leaked drafts that have circulated in recent days have outraged legal experts, who said they contained changes that would unwind hard-fought due process guarantees and human rights protections. “It’s a complete reversal,” said María Novoa, director of the justice program at México Evalúa, a research group that analyzes government policies. “It’s a counter-reform.” When Mexico’s Congress approved the overhaul of the judicial system in 2008, it sought to modernize an opaque, corrupt and deeply inefficient system, increasing not only due process and accountability but the public’s faith in the rule of law. Unlike the previous system, in which court procedures were largely conducted behind closed doors, with a judge reviewing written arguments and evidence, the new system was based on oral trials that allowed prosecutors and defense lawyers to present their cases in open court. The reforms created a special due-process judge — separate from the trial judge — to ensure that a defendant’s human rights were respected during the pretrial phase, among many other changes. The new system also severely limited automatic pretrial detention, which was sometimes used to imprison suspects for years without trial, and provided more mechanisms for alternative dispute resolutions. The reforms were adopted according to an eight-year timetable, requiring the retraining of police officers, prosecutors, judges and defense lawyers; the building of new courthouses; and the revamping of law school curriculums. Given the herculean nature of the effort, and the cultural shifts it demanded, many warned that it might take years for the system to come to full fruition — and unwavering political will to see it through. The transition received the robust support of the United States, which invested more than $300 million in the project, and the new system was officially in place in all 32 states of Mexico by the deadline of June 2016. But since then, two continuing trends have spooked government officials: a rise in violence and a decrease in the prison population. In the last publicly available prison census, from November, there were nearly 202,000 inmates in prison, down about 14 percent from when the reforms were fully implemented, according to government statistics. At the same time, violence has soared. In 2019, Mr. López Obrador’s first full year in office, Mexico recorded more than 34,500 murders, the highest annual tally since the late 1990s, when the government started keeping such data. And last year was marked by several high-profile public security failures that have cost the administration public confidence. Among them was the sudden collapse of the case against the Unión Tepito, the Mexico City criminal group that was the target of the raid. It was another example of what many legal experts say is the continuing struggle of prosecutors and the police to present cases that can stand up in the new criminal justice system. Mr. López Obrador and other elected officials could barely contain their frustration with the judge’s decision in the case, handed down in October. “With total respect for judicial power and its autonomy, the judge’s decision seems unfortunate to me,” Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City, told reporters. “I think the judges should analyze the cases in an integral way, weigh the collective interest and review all the evidence.” When asked about the matter, Mr. López Obrador acknowledged that some public officials still needed additional training in the new judicial standards. When prosecutorial files are flawed, he said, “Judges can say: ‘It is poorly compiled, there is insufficient evidence, there are contradictions.’ And: freedom.” But he also raised the specter of corruption, saying that a longstanding practice among dishonest judges has been to use the errors in case files as “an excuse” to release defendants. Some public officials have even tried to draw a direct link between the drop in the prison population and the rise in violence. They have specifically blamed the new justice system for allowing the accused to more easily walk free and return to a life of crime — a phenomenon some refer to as “the revolving door.” Among those vowing to close that door is Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico’s attorney general and a lead author of the new set of reforms. “They came in one way and went out the other, the number of criminals multiplied, some prisons reduced their population but multiplied their damage to society,” he said at a committee meeting in the Mexican Senate this month. “The system, instead of improving, got more complicated.” The leaked drafts of the initiatives include measures that would significantly expand the use of pretrial detention, eliminate the due-process judge and eliminate rules that automatically prohibit the use of evidence obtained illegally, legal experts said. The drafts have stunned judges, defense lawyers, legal scholars and other experts in the Mexican criminal justice system, particularly those who have spent years helping to implement the 2008 reforms. “It’s a quite extensive regression,” said Jorge Arturo Gutiérrez Muñoz, a former judge who now works as a consultant and teacher for the new justice system. “It causes me a certain amount of anxiety and sadness.” Alejandra Ramos, a judge in the northern state of Chihuahua, said the proposed initiatives amounted to “a return to barbarism.” She laid out the government’s logic: “Since I don’t have the capacity to investigate and find evidence, I need new mechanisms to judge and convict without proof,” she said. “I need to implement a new model that allows me to detain and put people in prison: guilty without proof.” Supporters of the 2008 reforms say that while there may be room for adjustment and fine tuning, the system is strong but needs more time to come to full fruition, especially amid lags in the training of police officers. “It’s in diapers,” Jesús I. Moreno de Leija, a defense lawyer in Mexico City, said of the newly implemented system. Officials who have been drafting the new initiatives seemed to be caught off guard by the leak and the resulting outrage. Mr. López Obrador and officials in his administration have since sought to distance themselves from the package of reforms, with some officials privately insisting that it was largely the work of Mr. Gertz, the attorney general. Asked about the draft reforms at a recent news conference, Mr. López Obrador responded: “There will be no going backward in anything. It’s real, authentic liberty and democracy.” Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.']",Leaked drafts of reforms intended to strengthen the government’s hand in the fight against crime have outraged judicial and human rights workers.
Coronavirus Anger Boils Over in China and Doctors Plead for Supplies,2020-01-30,By Chris Buckley and Amy Qin,"['WUHAN, China — One week into a lockdown, anger and anxiety deepened in China on Thursday as the central province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak endured shortages of hospital beds, medical supplies and doctors.  In a sign of growing frustration, a relative of a patient infected with the virus beat up a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the police. The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor’s mask and protective clothing — potentially exposing him to the virus — after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained. [Read: China says 1,700 health workers have contracted coronavirus.] At the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of seven million not far from Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, according to Yicai, a financial news site. Amid growing unease, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency,  which acknowledges that the disease now represents a risk beyond China. Nations can then decide whether to shut their borders, cancel flights or screen people arriving at ports of entry. Late Thursday, the State Department urged Americans not to travel to China, issuing a Level 4 advisory, which represents the highest safety risk. Also Thursday, Chinese government agencies announced plans to issue subsidies of up to $43 per day to front-line medical workers and to reopen factories to boost production of medical supplies and protective gear. “We absolutely cannot let Huanggang become a second Wuhan,” Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. On Thursday evening, provincial leaders said at a news briefing that the director of Huanggang’s health committee had been fired. For many Chinese, such decisive government announcements are too little, too late. Concerns have grown as the death toll from the coronavirus has quickly ticked upward, rising by 43 to hit 213 on Friday. All but one of those recent deaths have occurred in Hubei Province; the other died in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Fueling the anger on Thursday was the publication this week of a new paper about the coronavirus in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of researchers affiliated with, among other places, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hubei Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drawing on data from the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the paper states that “there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.” Chinese people online were incensed, asking why the government had waited until Jan. 20 to inform the public that the virus was capable of being transmitted from human to human. By Thursday evening, many had seized on the paper as evidence that the authors had purposely withheld valuable information out of academic self-interest. “I’m about to explode, I need an explanation from the authors!!!!” Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, wrote in a widely shared social media post that was quickly deleted. “As a researcher with firsthand information, you knew that the virus could be transmitted between humans three weeks before the public did. Did you do what you were supposed to do?” As China raced to contain the outbreak, countries grappled with how to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and how to stop the virus from spreading. Australia announced a plan to evacuate its citizens in Wuhan to Christmas Island, which has played an important but checkered role in the country’s contentious use of faraway sites to house refugees and other migrants. The announcement drew immediate questions over the implications of using the island as a quarantine site. Moving people to Christmas Island is not an “appropriate solution,” Dr. Tony Bartone, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a television news interview. He said the government had other, more suitable facilities, such as military sites. In Japan, a furor erupted over the refusal of some evacuees who had returned to submit to medical testing. Two of the Japanese citizens who have been evacuated from Wuhan refused to be tested for the coronavirus, leading the prime minister to explain that citizens could not be forced to submit to a medical examination. Japanese social media users said the travelers, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, were putting the country at risk. Some called them terrorists. “We tried to persuade the two returnees from Wuhan for many hours” to be tested, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Parliament on Thursday, when asked about the government’s treatment of repatriated citizens. “But there is no legally binding force, and that’s a great regret.” Mr. Abe said. Russia ordered 16 of its approximately 25 crossing points on its 2,600-mile border Chinese border to be closed as of midnight local time as fears about the coronavirus outbreak mounted in Moscow. “We have to do everything to protect our people,” Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday in televised remarks at a cabinet meeting. Italy blocked thousands of people from leaving a cruise ship that docked there on Thursday over concerns that someone aboard might have the virus. Although a Chinese national with a fever later tested negative for the coronavirus and the Italian authorities said passengers were allowed to disembark, for much of the day the country was gripped by fears that the coronavirus had arrived on its shores.  That concern proved warranted later Thursday, when the government reported the country’s first two confirmed cases, neither of which were related to the ship. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced that Italy had halted all flights to and from China.  In the United States, health officials on Thursday reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus in the United States. The patient is the husband of a woman who was the first reported case in Chicago, officials said at a news briefing. The woman, who is in her 60s, had returned from Wuhan.  The American commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said the United States could see a positive byproduct from China’s woes because the outbreak could prompt employers to move jobs to its shores. “I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Mr. Ross said in an interview on Fox Business. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.” His remarks may be seen as insensitive to a country in crisis, and he has faced such criticism in the past. During the government shutdown in early 2019, Mr. Ross suggested that furloughed workers should take out loans while they went without pay for more than a month. With the evacuations and lockdown, Wuhan, a typically bustling metropolis, has been transformed into a ghost town. Since the city was effectively sealed off last week, most shops have shut down. The city government has put restrictions on traffic. The lack of transportation options has made it difficult for medical workers and sick residents to get to hospitals. But most residents of Wuhan  are not leaving their homes because they are too scared of catching the virus. “Local Wuhan residents who aren’t worried about being sick aren’t even going on the streets,” Chen Qiushi, a Beijing-based lawyer who has been in Wuhan since the lockdown began, said in a video blog posted on Thursday. “The locals are all very scared.”  When Wuhan residents step outside, it’s mostly to go to the supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies that stay open as part of a government effort to sustain the city. Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about vegetables, fruit or other staples. While Wuhan residents have been able to buy food, some complained about price increases or expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. And if the shutdown lasts weeks longer, with the rest of China also scrambling to secure food supplies, it could make things more serious, several residents said. “If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips’ price. “Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,” Mr. Zuo said. “Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won’t be easy — all those road checks.” Amy Qin reported from Beijing, and Christopher Buckley from Wuhan, China.

"U.K. Leaves E.U., Embarking On an Uncertain Future",2020-01-31,By The New York Times,"['At 11 p.m. — midnight in Brussels and 6 p.m. in New York — Britain officially left the European Union. Flags lined Parliament Square and the Mall, the ceremonial avenue leading to Buckingham Palace, and government buildings were lit up in the red, white and blue of the Union Jack. A countdown clock was projected onto the front of 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, along with a commemorative light display to “symbolize the strength and unity” of the United Kingdom. “This is not an end but a beginning,” Prime Minister Bris Johnson said in a speech to the nation shortly before the official departure. “This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act.” The departure, 1,317 days after Britain voted to leave the bloc, carries not only enormous symbolic weight, but also significant legal consequences. It concluded three years of fractious debates over whether the country should really leave the bloc, the terms of its departure and the kind of relationship it should forge with Europe. “We’ll have a couple months of people trying not to talk about it again, trying to pretend it’s not a thing that’s happening,” said Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, who led a group that tried to overturn Brexit. “But realistically it’s not going to be sorted in a year. It’s going to start rearing its head and opening divisions within families again.” The departure marks the start of a transition period in which London and Brussels will hash out the terms of their future ties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet began Friday with a meeting in Sunderland, a city in northern England that was the first to announce it had voted in favor of leaving the European Union on the night of the 2016 referendum. It was the first of a handful of celebratory, but noticeably muted, official events to mark the day, suggesting that the pro-Brexit government wanted to avoid the appearance of gloating. In the referendum, 48 percent of voters wanted to remain part of the European Union, and later polls suggest that number may have grown since. In the years of debate over Britain’s exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was never one for nuance, even declaring that he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than see Brexit delayed again. But as the hour of reckoning approached, Downing Street was remarkably subdued, not wanting to rub salt in the still raw wounds of those who desperately wanted to remain — about half the country. When he addressed the nation at 10 p.m., an hour before the official departure, Mr. Johnson struck a hopeful and conciliatory note. “Our job as the government, my job, is to bring this country together and take us forward,” he said. Of course, the next year of negotiations over Britain’s new trade relationship with the European Union will play a large role in determining what the future will hold. But that concern was for another day. Mr. Johnson, instead, used his remarks to try to persuade the public that Brexit was “not an end but a beginning.” “This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances — your family’s life chances — should depend on which part of the country you grow up in,” he said. “This is the moment when we begin to unite and level up.”   President Emmanuel Macron of France called Britain’s departure from the bloc a “historic alarm signal that must ring in each of our countries to be heard by all of Europe and make us reflect.” In a video statement released Friday evening, Mr. Macron described it as “a sad day.” “There is no denying it,"" he added, “but it is also a day that must lead us to proceed differently.” He called for a “powerful” and “efficient” European Union. Mr. Macron said the 2016 Leave campaign in Britain was based on “lies, exaggerations, simplifications” and on “checks that were promised and will never arrive.” “Brexit was made possible because too often we made Europe the scapegoat of our own difficulties,” Mr. Macron said. Still, he said, the European Union needs to change and “we have not changed our Europe enough.” And the need for a unified Europe is greater than ever, Mr. Macron said. He checked off a list of challenges — facing powers like China and the United States, tackling immigration and global warming, transitioning to a digital economy — that he said were best addressed by the bloc. “But I am aware that Europe will only be able to continue going forward if we deeply reform it to make it more sovereign, more democratic, closer to our fellow citizens and therefore simpler in its day-to-day life,” Mr. Macron said. Mr. Macron also tried to reassure the French that they would not “wake up tomorrow morning with different rules.” France will pick up five seats in the European Parliament left vacant by the British departure, he noted, but immediate changes otherwise would be limited. Mr. Macron said he would fight for French interests in negotiations over the future relationship between Britain and the European Union, arguing that he wanted “the closest, strongest, most durable partnership as possible” but that it would never be the same as the one Britain had as a member of the union. “One cannot be both inside and outside,” Mr. Macron said. France and Britain will continue to have a strong bilateral relationship, he said, tied as the two countries are by “a long history, made of blood, of freedom, of courage, of fights that we shared.” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said his country would work through the bloc to ensure that Britain remains a “privileged and strategic partner” in a trade agreement without quotas, tariffs or dumping.  He said would meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson next week to discuss the transition. “There isn’t much time to work on a serious and effective free exchange accord,” Mr. Conte told the Confederation of Italian Agriculture, meeting to celebrate its 100th anniversary. “A lot is at stake.” “It won’t be easy,” he said, adding that the bloc’s negotiators must “find a balance between protecting our production from deals that London could make with other countries.”  “We want facts,” Mr. Conte said, “to follow words.” Hundreds of Europeans lined up at City Hall in London on Friday to get advice about their future in Britain after it leaves the bloc. “They tell us the application is easy, but everyone has unique circumstances and there can be complications,” said Laurie Bassot, a French citizen.  Ms. Bassot said she will be allowed to stay in the country for five years under her “presettled status,” but she was worried about her future prospects. “It is a stressful process,” she said. “I have a job, a husband and children in school. I want to know how long I will be able to stay.” Along with legal experts, counselors were available at City Hall to provide emotional support. “There are lots of European citizens who feel anxious during this uncertain period so it is important for us to provide free services to support them,” said one of them, Dan Thomson. The leader of Gibraltar, a British territory at the southern tip of Spain, pledged that the thousands of Spaniards who cross the border daily to work there will not face the loss of their jobs or new obstacles as a result of Brexit. “We want to continue to see them working in our economy,” said Gibraltar’s leader, Fabian Picardo, calling the Spaniards “a key part of our success and prosperity.” Gibraltar’s 33,000 residents voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Mr. Picardo also warned Spain and the European Union against any move that could undermine Gibraltar. “We will not accept any attempt to compromise our sovereignty, jurisdiction or control,” he said. At the close of the business day in Brussels, Britain lowered the blue, yellow-starred European Union flag at its Brussels diplomatic post. The post becomes the British Embassy to the European Union at the stroke of midnight in Brussels. Britain’s own flag comes down at midnight at the European Council and Parliament buildings. Last year, Britain’s economy grew at its weakest pace since 2010, hampered by weak business investment. And now the Bank of England has lowered its expectations for growth this year  to 0.75 percent, from 1.25 percent.  At his final news conference on Thursday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who has extended his tenure three times to accommodate Brexit, said that from an economic perspective, “the last decade ended with a whimper.” Recently published figures have indicated an uptick in sentiment and activity since Britain’s December election produced a clear Conservative majority in Parliament, reducing uncertainty and clearing the way for a final decision on Brexit. As a result, the Bank of England decided it did not need to lower interest rates to bolster the economy. Still, Mr. Carney warned that a recovery was not guaranteed. “To be clear, these are still early days, and it is less a case of ‘so far so good’ than ‘so far, good enough,’” he said. “Although early signs are encouraging, the recoveries in growth and inflation are also not yet assured.” Christine Lagarde, Europe’s top central banker, said she was sorry that Britain was leaving the European Union, but offered assurances that the split could take place without disrupting the financial system. “It is with great regret that we see our British friends leave the European Union,” Ms. Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said in a statement. “We will work hard to ensure Brexit causes as little disruption as possible for the citizens, employers and financial markets in the euro area and the rest of the E.U.” The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have already set up a system to swap pounds and euros to ensure that banks don’t run short of either currency. Bank regulators on both sides have agreed to continue sharing information. And the European Central Bank has already issued licenses for 25 banks relocating from Britain to the euro currency zone. Britain was never a member of the eurozone. But as a member of the European Union it contributed about 58 million euros, or $64 million, to the European Central Bank’s capital. It will now get that money back. But fears that Brexit could hurt the European economy may already be proving justified. The eurozone grew only 0.1 percent during the last three months of 2019 compared with the previous quarter, according to official statistics published on Friday. That was a significant slowdown from previous quarters and meant that the 19 countries in the eurozone grew only 1.2 percent during last year, according to a preliminary estimate. “The specter of recession is back,” Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to investors on Friday. Eurostat, the official statistics agency, didn’t give a reason for the slowdown. But one factor was probably the uncertainty caused by Brexit, which has made businesses hesitant to hire or to invest in expansion. Trade between the European Union and Britain has also shrunk since the country voted to leave. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany described Brexit as a “decisive turning point for us all,” in a video message released on Friday. “Germany would like to remain a close partner and friend of Britain because we share common values,” she said. In the video, Ms. Merkel explains that the rights of British people living in the European Union had been ensured under the withdrawal agreement.  But for one German town, Britain’s departure meant a big change: losing their mayor of 12 years.  The mayor, Iain Macnab, is originally from Scotland but has lived in Brunsmark, a town of 161 people in northern Germany, since 1992. But he had to give up his office on Friday, as he will not be able to vote in municipal elections as he is no longer a European citizen.  According to local laws, Mr. Macnab cannot be elected to an office he is not allowed to vote for.  “It’s a bit sad,” Mr. Macnab said by telephone from the Town Hall on his last day in office. “It didn’t strike me until yesterday, when I had my last committee meeting.”  The former British ambassador to Washington fired a shot over the bow of the good ship Brexit on Friday, warning that President Trump would be likely to demand that the country’s revered National Health Service pay higher prices for American drugs in a potential post-Brexit trade deal. Kim Darroch, who resigned from his post in July after critical comments he made about Mr. Trump were leaked, told The Guardian that the Trump administration would prioritize the demands of large American corporations and farmers who want more access to British markets. “I know what the U.S. will be pitching for when they negotiate a free-trade deal with us,” Mr. Darroch said in the interview with The Guardian. “People talk about chlorinated chicken — it is a lot more than that.” Currently, Britain’s National Health Service has a price cap on some pharmaceuticals, which pressures American drug firms to sell their products in Britain at a lower price.  “Do they want us to pay more for their pharmaceuticals? Do the pharmaceutical companies want to use this leverage? Of course, they do,” Mr. Darroch said. In documents from 2017 that were later leaked, Mr. Darroch had described the Trump administration as “uniquely dysfunctional,” and called Mr. Trump “inept” and “insecure.” After the revelation, President Trump said he would no longer deal with the ambassador, and Mr. Darroch was forced to resign. Before the row, Mr. Darroch had driven attempts to expand trade relations with the United States.  To mark Britain’s exit from the European Union, three million commemorative 50-pence coins are entering circulation, bearing the message “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.”  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to become one of the first owners of the coin on Friday when Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the Exchequer, plans to hand one over. Seven million more will come into use later in the year. But as with almost everything Brexit-related, the short history of the coin, which has a face value equivalent to about 65 cents, has already been fraught. Production began ahead of a previously planned departure on Oct. 31, but when Brexit was pushed back to January, over a million coins had to be melted down. When re-dated coins were unveiled, some people called for a boycott, either to display opposition to Brexit or because they find the message on the coin grammatically offensive. “The ‘Brexit’ 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma, and should be boycotted by all literate people,” the novelist Philip Pullman wrote on Twitter, arguing that the inscription should instead read “Peace, prosperity, and friendship with all nations.” For those who don’t mind the lack of the Oxford comma, a gold version of the coin was offered. But according to the royal mint, those coins — priced at 945 pounds, or about $1,240, each — are out of stock. In an opinion article published across the European press, the presidents of the three main European Union institutions called Brexit Friday a “new dawn” for Europe. After offering kind words on Britain’s departure, Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission, Charles Michel of the European Council and David Sassoli of the European Parliament tried to strike an upbeat tone. “We need to look to the future and build a new partnership between enduring friends,” they wrote. “Together, our three institutions will do everything in their power to make it a success. We are ready to be ambitious.” The article was published alongside a cheery video touting the European Union’s economic and climate-friendly credentials and maintaining that its remaining 27 members were “#strongertogether.” Brussels wants the message to be clear, because while Britain’s departure has yet to inspire strong withdrawal movements in other countries, as some expected immediately after the 2016 referendum, many Europeans are disillusioned with the project of ever closer union. “We have a common vision of where we want to go and a commitment to be ambitious on the defining issues of our times,” the three presidents said. “That work continues as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.” Megan Specia, Marc Santora, Elian Peltier, Jack Ewing, Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Christopher F.

Capital in Trump Mideast Plan Makes ‘a Joke’ of Palestinian Aspirations,2020-01-31,By Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger,"['ABU DIS, West Bank — Like a monument to dashed hopes, an unfinished Palestinian parliament building stands derelict on a ridge in Abu Dis, an unimposing West Bank suburb of Jerusalem that the Trump administration has proposed as the capital of a future Palestinian state. A symbol of the possibilities of sovereignty when it was begun in the mid-1990s, the parliament was supposed to have a clear line of sight to the glimmering domes of the revered Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, barely two-and-a-half miles away as the crow flies. Today it backs onto a hulking, razor wire-topped concrete wall, a section of Israel’s security barrier that went up in 2005, isolating wingless creatures in Abu Dis from Jerusalem and its holy sites. Days after the rollout of the long-awaited Trump plan for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which strongly favored Israel and disregarded most Palestinian claims, there was little sense of gathering majesty or of Palestinian control here in Abu Dis. American administrations have tried repeatedly over decades to mediate a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on far more evenhanded terms than the new proposal. But nothing epitomizes the asymmetry more than how it addresses a Palestinian capital. Palestinians have long aspired to an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, but the proposal does away with the long-held notion that the two sides would negotiate Jerusalem’s future. Instead, it gives all the desirable parts of the city to Israel and proposes a group of obscure, outlying areas as the closest thing to a capital in Jerusalem that the Palestinians should ever get. It offers Palestinians the tiny, crowded Abu Dis, along with troubled faraway neighborhoods technically in East Jerusalem, but also on the other side of the security barrier. One of the neighborhoods designated for the capital, the Shuafat refugee camp, is a gang-ridden slum where the Palestinian police have no jurisdiction and the Israeli police fear to tread. Another, Kufr Aqab, became a Wild West of unregulated and unsafe construction when Israeli policies and sky-high housing prices drove middle-class Arabs to seek homes beyond the security barrier but still inside the Jerusalem municipality. And then there is Abu Dis, the hilly home of Al-Quds University, which opened in the 1980s when the village was just a 10-minute drive from Damascus Gate — one of the portals leading into Jerusalem’s Old City. Most of Abu Dis was never inside the Jerusalem city limits. “How can this be a capital?” asked Ahmed Bader, 25, incredulously. He had come in a small truck to collect garbage from a patch of wasteland behind the parliament building. Children rode horses bareback in an adjacent alley. “Jerusalem has the Aqsa mosque, the churches, business, places to work,” he continued. “What do we have here, in our little town? If I stop my little Vespa in the main street to speak on the phone, cars pile up behind and can’t get past me!” Next to the\xa0Parliament building,\xa0there is\xa0a once-grand, five-story mansion with a White House-like portico\xa0that\xa0had its top floors demolished on Israeli orders because of the apparent risk posed by anyone high up enough to peep over the security wall. Israeli border police officers come and go at will through an iron door in the barrier. When the Palestinians say they want Jerusalem as their capital, they do not mean areas like Abu Dis, Shuafat or Kufr Aqab. Shuafat and Kufr Aqab are part of territory that the Israelis annexed to Jerusalem in 1967, in the heady days after their victory in the Six-Day War. “Jerusalem is the old walled city. The rest is not Jerusalem,” said Nazmi Jubeh, an archaeologist and historian who runs the Birzeit University Museum in the West Bank. “We mean by Jerusalem — and I think everybody around the world means — the holy sites. This game of playing with words has no meaning at all.” In broad terms, the Trump administration plan would allow Israel to annex about 30 percent of the West Bank along with all the Jewish settlements in the territory, though most of the world considers those settlements a violation of international law. Previous peace proposals envisaged Israel dismantling the more isolated settlements and maintaining a special security arrangement along the border with Jordan rather than annexing the entire area. The Trump plan makes the Palestinians an unattractive and heavily conditional offer: an entity that they could call a state made up of the Gaza Strip and several enclaves in the West Bank — pockmarked with settlements and surrounded by Israeli territory — that would be linked by roads or other transportation. While Israel hailed the plan, the Palestinians angrily rejected it out of hand. In myriad ways, the Trump plan seemed to reward the Israelis and punish the Palestinians for what each has considered the other’s bad behavior. The Israelis relentlessly created facts on the ground, like settlements in the heart of the West Bank aimed at preventing a Palestinian state from coming together. The Palestinians repeatedly resorted to violence, even after Israeli withdrawals, which led Israel to expand its security presence at the Palestinians’ expense and to insist on never uprooting its people again. In its conceptual map of a Palestinian state, the Trump plan did not even mark the location of a capital, though the document did suggest calling it Al-Quds, the Arabic name for Jerusalem. It did mark Jerusalem — in Israeli territory. The Americans determined that Israel should remain sovereign over all parts of Jerusalem, including the ancient holy sites that are inside the security barrier built in the early 2000s after a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings. At least 120,000 Palestinians live beyond the barrier but still inside the Jerusalem city limits so they can cling to their Jerusalem residency cards, which allow them to work and travel inside Israel. Under the American plan, they would find themselves living in Palestine. (Inside the barrier, the plan says, the approximately 200,000 Palestinians would get the choice of becoming citizens of Palestine or of Israel, or of maintaining the in-between residency status that most of them have today.) As a purely geographical matter, the Palestinian capital would be fragmented across several neighborhoods that are miles apart from each other, separated by Israeli communities and major roads, and share little in common. It is not unlike cobbling together a new city from parts of Teaneck, N.J., Queens, and the South Bronx. The Trump plan promises to manage the feat with new roads, tunnels or bridges. “If you know these areas, you know they’re just making a joke of you and your national aspiration,” said Mr. Jubeh. “A capital is a symbol,” he added. “These areas are not a symbol for anybody.” Indeed, the Palestinians are denied even a symbolic toehold in or near the ancient heart of the city. But Israel gets rid of its only refugee camp, and of the violent outland it has become. In carving off Shuafat, the Trump plan completes what the Israelis first tried to do when they built the security barrier, said Danny Seidemann, an expert on the geography and political history of Jerusalem who is a harsh critic of the Trump plan. It would correct what he said was a mistake in hastily drawing the city boundaries in 1967. The refugee camp had been a hot spot of violence for years, he said. So the decision was made to build the security wall inside the city “in order to cut them out,” Mr. Seidemann said. In the Shuafat camp on Thursday, residents laughed at the idea of making their neighborhood a Palestinian showpiece. Water and sewer services in the camp are unreliable at best; the streets contain potholes big enough to lose much of a car. “It’s a ghost city, not a capital,” said Muhammad Inbawi, 30. “It’s chaos here. At night, we’re ruled by the gangsters. What kind of capital is that? Is Trump sane?” The place is not so safe by day, either: As Mr. Inbawi spoke, a fog was billowing down the street. It was tear gas fired by Israeli security forces. Crowds of children in school uniforms broke into a run to get away. Seeing a girl struggling to withstand the effects of the acrid cloud, Mr. Inbawi shouted at no one in particular, “You don’t throw stones when school is letting out!” Abu Dis, which started out as a sleepy village, now has about 13,000 residents in less than two square miles. It consists of a single main street and higgledy-piggledy alleys shooting off at strange angles. “We love it,” said Safia, 35, an English teacher who would only provide her first name for fear of repercussions from the authorities. But she added, “Like all Palestinians, I refuse what we call the American-Israeli agreement to take Jerusalem.” She last visited Jerusalem three years ago to pray during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a visit that required a special permit from the Israeli authorities. Tareq Bader, 22, who works in a car accessory store, was last in Jerusalem about 10 years ago. “It’s so close,” he said, “but difficult to get to.” But he hasn’t lost faith. “Trump promised Jerusalem to the Jews,” he said. “God promised it to us, and God is greater than Trump.” Mohammed Najib contributed reporting.']","Part of the proposed capital, far from Jerusalem’s holy sites, would encompass a gang-ridden slum. “These areas are not a symbol for anybody,” said one Palestinian."
A Muted Arab Response to Trump’s Mideast Peace Plan,2020-01-29,By Ben Hubbard and Declan Walsh,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In unveiling his plan Tuesday for solving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, President Trump confidently declared that Arab countries would play a key role in its success. But none of the United States’ Arab allies formally endorsed the plan or made concrete commitments to back it, raising questions about how helpful they will really be in bringing it to fruition. Mr. Trump announced the plan in an appearance at the White House with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, describing it both as necessary for Israel’s security and as an opportunity for the Palestinians to govern themselves and grow their economy. There are “many, many countries who want to partake in this,” he told Mr. Netanyahu, predicting that “you are going to have tremendous support from your neighbors and beyond your neighbors.” But clear indications of that support were lacking. While three Arab ambassadors — from Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates — were present at the announcement, Mr. Trump said, there were no Palestinians. “You couldn’t find a single Palestinian to attend?” asked Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist and columnist with Al-Monitor, an online news site. And despite Egypt and Jordan having peace treaties with Israel, and Mr. Trump having chosen Saudi Arabia for the first overseas trip of his presidency, “none of them came,” Mr. Daoud noted. For decades, the Palestinian cause was that rare issue that united Arabs across the Middle East. But in recent years, it waned in importance as the peace process foundered. Some Arab leaders turned their focus inward to domestic security and economic problems. Others, including Persian Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have come to see Iran as the region’s greatest threat, and Israel as a potential ally against it. Concerns about Iran had become “much more existential than the Palestinian issue,” Mr. Kuttab said. “They are worried about their physical presence being threatened from Iran, much more than Israel,” he said. Still, for all the changes, Arab leaders refrained from publicly backing Mr. Trump’s plan. In his address at the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Trump thanked Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates “for the incredible work they’ve done in helping us with so much,” and noted that their ambassadors were in attendance. But even those countries did not formally endorse the plan. Some other countries took a notedly measured stance. The foreign ministry of Egypt, the first Arab country to reach a peace treaty with Israel, praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to reach an agreement, but the language of its statement remained inside the boundaries of Egypt’s longstanding policy on the conflict. Egypt “appreciates the continuous efforts” of the Trump administration to end the conflict, the statement said. It encouraged both sides to resume talks that might eventually restore to Palestinians their “full legitimate rights through the establishment of a sovereign independent state.” The carefully worded statement was a clear expression of support for the American president, if not for the plan itself, from Egypt’s authoritarian ruler, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whom Mr. Trump once called “my favorite dictator.” The Trump administration is currently mediating a dispute involving Egypt by hosting negotiations with officials from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over a contentious $4 billion dam that Ethiopia is building. Jordan, another American ally that has made peace with the Jewish state, effectively ignored Mr. Trump’s plan and restated its commitment to many of the Palestinian demands that the White House proposal disregarded. Among them: the general borders of a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem. In a statement, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Jordan would continue to work with Arab countries and the international community for “the achievement of a just and lasting peace that meets all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” Saudi Arabia, too, praised Mr. Trump’s efforts, but did not endorse his plan. The kingdom stuck to its longstanding stance that negotiations should lead to “an agreement that achieves legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” The de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has broken with previous Saudi leaders by speaking of Israel’s right to its own land and by praising its economy. But Prince Mohammed has not taken formal steps to improve relations because of potential blowback from his own population. As American allies reacted cautiously to the proposal, adversaries heaped scorn on the United States for its support for Israel. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party, called Mr. Trump’s plan “the deal of shame” and pointed an accusing finger at those Arab countries that have allied themselves with the United States. “This deal would not have taken place had it not been for the complicity and betrayal of a number of Arab regimes, secretly and publicly involved in this conspiracy,” it said in a statement. In much of the Arab world, Mr. Trump’s proposal was variously received with outrage, humiliation or weary resignation. Hostility toward the Americans and Israelis appeared matched only by a sense of disillusionment among some Arabs toward their own leaders. “Historical farces are repeating themselves,” Gamal Eid, a veteran human rights activist in Cairo, said on Twitter. “From the miserable 1917 Balfour Declaration to the farcical 2020 Trump Declaration. And Arab leaders are either useless or cheering.” Nabil Fahmy, a former foreign minister of Egypt, said he feared that Mr. Trump’s proposal would not only fail to bring peace to the region, but that it might also scupper the chances for a lasting deal. “To put the proposal this way, you must want to have it rejected,” he said. “And if you reject this deal, you are destroying the tenets of the peace process and all possibilities for progress. It is just astonishing.” Ali Shihabi, a commentator close to the government of Saudi Arabia, said the plan was “all downside and no upside for U.S. allies in the region.” Paula Yacoubian, a member of the Lebanese Parliament, was equally dismissive. “A deal from one side is the joke of the century,” she said on Twitter. Mohamed ElBaradei, a former vice president of Egypt, said he felt the same sense of shame and humiliation that followed the defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. “How would we justify this miserable state of affairs to the upcoming generations?” he wrote on Twitter. For many, the Trump proposal marked another dismal milestone in what many Arabs view as America’s decades-long abandonment of the Palestinian cause. A thread of mournful, broader regret ran through some of the commentary, too, a sense that a cause that had united the Middle East for decades was quietly fading away, losing its relevance, and that ordinary Arabs were simply losing interest. Some said young Arabs were simply preoccupied by the violence or political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising in several countries, or had themselves been silenced. “If the governments of the region were representing the will of their people, then perhaps Arab voices would be louder,” said Timothy E. Kaldas, a Cairo-based analyst with the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “But with the extraordinary repression the region has seen, with regimes uninterested in critical conversations in their own countries, it’s very hard to see what the publics in those countries could actually do.” Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Declan Walsh from Cairo.

"Despite Calm in Afghan Cities, War in Villages Kills Dozens Daily",2020-01-29,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Over the past couple of months, as American and Taliban negotiators have resumed talks to try to complete a peace deal, an unusual calm has settled over major Afghan cities. Deadly terrorism attacks, once frequent, have suddenly dropped in urban centers. But a series of bloody assaults in the countryside suggests that the calm in the cities could be misleading. The war continues to kill dozens daily. And the patterns of violence in recent months have been tied closely to how negotiations between the United States and the Taliban, held in the Gulf state of Qatar, have played out. With talks now seeming to bog down, some diplomats and political leaders fear that violence could grow deadlier — even if much of it plays out in the countryside, away from the headlines. The sticking point in the negotiations: What reduction in violence is needed to move the peace process forward? The negotiators’ ultimate goal is the gradual withdrawal of American troops, and the establishment of talks between the Taliban and other Afghans over power-sharing. The drop in urban attacks most likely stems from an unacknowledged understanding with the Taliban to reduce high-profile violence in order to pave the way for an agreement. Improvements in security measures, with new leadership introduced over the past year, have also played a role. But as the Taliban have held back on urban assaults, they are attacking in rural areas. At least 40 Afghan security personnel were killed in the 24 hours before Wednesday, security officials said, with most of the losses coming in a couple of attacks in northern provinces. The Taliban have long resisted American demands for a cease-fire, seeking to push the issue later in the peace process, when they sit down with other Afghans on sharing power. Doing so earlier, they fear, will divide their ranks. Instead, they have answered the demands with a proposal for “violence reduction” — what could amount to the insurgents holding fire on United States forces as they close down their bases and withdraw, and avoiding dramatic attacks in major cities. The Afghan government, so far excluded from the talks, has asked the United States to agree to nothing but an extensive cease-fire. Its fear is that if the United States signs an initial deal with violence levels reduced only in the cities, the war will simply continue to rage in the countryside. As the United States has pushed for more from the Taliban at the negotiating table in recent weeks, the insurgents are growing mistrustful, accusing the Americans of moving the goal posts. Taliban officials say the United States had recently asked for violence reduction, which they brought to the table after a month of consultations all the way down to battlefield commanders. The American side found the Taliban offer inadequate. One Taliban official said that now the United States is seeking something closer to a cease-fire, which it hadn’t demanded earlier. Some Afghan officials and diplomats said negotiators want the reduction of violence to extend from the cities into the districts and along the highways. But stagnation in the talks has raised fears that the quest for a more expansive truce could break the fragile negotiations at a sensitive time, thrusting the country back into greater violence. Mohammed Arif Rahmani, a member of the Afghan Parliament’s national security committee, said that during past winters the Taliban would expand their attacks in the cities and reduce their activities in the rural areas because of harsh weather. “But now it feels like the Taliban have only tactically reduced attacks in the cities and expanded attacks in the countryside,” Mr. Rahmani said. “In the past week, we have seen an increase in such attacks in the rural areas, and I think it has to do with the stalemate in the talks over the past month.” A large number of the recent fatalities have come in the north — despite extreme cold temperatures. In an overnight attack in Baghlan Province on Tuesday, the Taliban killed between 11 and 18 security personnel, according to different official accounts, nearly wiping out an entire outpost with the help of an infiltrator. In neighboring Kunduz Province early on Wednesday, at least 12 security personnel were killed. In the meantime, the Afghan government and its American allies, largely relying on airstrikes, have continued killing Taliban forces at rates of dozens daily. The Afghan government reports — which are difficult to verify and prone to exaggeration — claim its soldiers have killed an as many as 30 Taliban daily over the past week. The United States has continued airstrikes across the country at high rates. Data released by the United States Air Force showed that American military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs in Afghanistan in 2019 — the most in any year since the United States began tracking the strikes in 2006 — and have pursued the recent trend of increasing airstrikes. The expanded air campaign, by both United States and Afghan Air Forces, has also come with reports of increased civilian casualties. In the latest episode, on Saturday, at least seven civilians, all members of the same family, were killed in an airstrike in the Borka area of northern Balkh Province. “The armed conflict in Afghanistan is not winding down, it is widening, and the people who continue to pay the price are Afghan civilians,” said Omar Waraich, the deputy South Asia director at Amnesty International. “There continues to be a shocking disregard for human life from all sides.” Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting from Kabul, and Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Washington.']",A reduction in attacks in major Afghan cities amid American peace talks with the Taliban could be misleading.

Putin Pardons American-Israeli Swept Up in Geopolitical Game,2020-01-29,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — An American-Israeli woman was pardoned on Wednesday, months after her severe punishment on charges of having a small amount of marijuana had made her an unwitting pawn in a geopolitical game. The pardon, issued by President Vladimir V. Putin, came on the eve of a visit to Moscow by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The two leaders are expected to talk about the Middle East plan proposed by President Trump this week. The woman, Naama Issachar, was arrested in April after Russian officials said they found marijuana in her luggage during an airline stopover in Moscow while en route from India to Israel. The amount — 9.5 grams, about a third of an ounce — would normally result in no more than a month’s detention, a fine and deportation from Russia. The amount is within the legal limit in Israel. But in October, a Russian court sentenced Ms. Issachar to seven and a half years in prison on drug possession and smuggling charges, and she was sent to a penal colony. Investigators said Ms. Issachar had admitted to possession, but she later said that the statement was given under pressure. Israeli officials and Ms. Issachar’s relatives said that the Kremlin had linked her fate to that of Alexei Burkov, a Russian man being held in Israel while facing extradition to the United States on computer crime charges. Shortly after Ms. Issachar was sentenced, however, Israel went ahead with his extradition to the United States. After Ms. Issachar’s case become a political issue in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu vowed to work for her freedom and raised the issue repeatedly in meetings and phone calls with Mr. Putin. Little progress was made, however, before Mr. Putin came to Israel last week to attend an event marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. During the visit, the Russian president met with Ms. Issachar’s mother, Yaffa Issachar, and told her that “everything will be O.K.” Mr. Putin’s visit coincided with Israel’s decision to hand over to Russia the ownership of an important religious building in central Jerusalem, which once belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church. In his decree, Mr. Putin portrayed the pardon as a gesture of good will “guided by the principles of humanity.” Mr. Netanyahu thanked the Russian leader in a statement that called the Trump plan “the deal of the century.” Ms. Issachar, who was born in New Jersey but lives in Israel, was still being held late Wednesday, though officials said they expected her to be freed on Thursday. Her release is likely to help Mr. Netanyahu’s chances in Israel’s March 2 election.']",Naama Issachar had been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for a small amount of marijuana.

Longest Smuggling Tunnel Is Found at U.S.-Mexico Border,2020-01-30,By Elian Peltier,"['Ventilation tubes and electricity cables run along the rough-hewed walls. Rudimentary rails stretch along the ground. The dank, waterlogged conditions belie the desert conditions at the surface, some 70 feet above. Pictures and video of the remarkable smuggling tunnel, the longest ever found at the Mexico-United States border, were released by the American authorities on Wednesday. The shaft stretched some 4,309 feet, nearly a mile, between Tijuana, Mexico, and the outskirts of San Diego. “The sophistication and length of this particular tunnel demonstrates the time-consuming efforts transnational criminal organizations will undertake to facilitate cross-border smuggling,” Cardell T. Morant, the acting special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego, said in a statement from United States Customs and Border Protection. Before the latest discovery, the longest smuggling tunnel across the United States-Mexico border was an excavation found in 2014, also in San Diego, the authorities said. That tunnel was 2,966 feet long. For all the talk about a wall between the United States and Mexico, the proliferation of such subterranean passageways demonstrates that the problem with border security is as much below ground as above. Cross-border tunnels have long been used by cartels to move drugs and people into the United States, but even so, the sophistication of the recent find stood out, the American border agency said. Images and footage taken inside the tunnel showed a claustrophobic channel hacked through rock, measuring just 2 feet across and about 5.5 feet high. Officials said the shaft was equipped with a rail system and ventilation, with high-voltage electrical cables, a drainage system and even an elevator at the opening in Tijuana. The video shows wires dangling from the walls, ventilation equipment and detritus including discarded clothing and what looked like the remains of wooden storage shelves. Water sloshes around the floor of the chambers. The exit on the American side was hidden by hundreds of sandbags, the authorities said. An offshoot of the main tunnel was also discovered, they added, running 3,529 feet into United States territory but with no opening to the surface. The American authorities said that no arrests had been made in relation to the discovery and that no drugs had been found inside the tunnel. The border area has been a stronghold of the Sinaloa Cartel of Mexico, whose leader, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, was sentenced to life in prison in July. In 2015, Mr. Guzmán staged a stunning escape from prison in Mexico, when he vanished from his cell in full view of a video camera through a tunnel that was more than 600 feet longer than the one announced on Wednesday. That tunnel was one of the longest ever built by the cartel, though it did not cross the border. Guards later discovered a small hole in the floor of his shower that led to a nearly mile-long tunnel 30 feet underground. The shaft was equipped with lighting, ventilation and a motorcycle on rails. Some engineers estimated that it had taken more than a year and at least $1 million to build. Authorities have been trying for decades to find and cut off the sophisticated cross-border tunnels, many of which include lighting and ventilation systems and have been used by the Sinaloa cartel to move drugs quickly. In 2018, another cross-border tunnel was discovered in Jacumba, about 55 miles east of San Diego, with a similar rail system and solar-powered lighting. After the discovery of the latest tunnel the United States border agency said that the Mexican authorities had identified the opening on the southern side and that American investigators had then mapped the entire construction. On the American side, the shaft emerged in the industrial neighborhood of Otay Mesa, on the southern outskirts of San Diego, an area that has been a favorite spot for tunnels because of its easy-to-dig soil and the presence of many warehouses that provide cover. Many tunnels end in these warehouses, making them difficult to detect. The length of the cross-border tunnel, equivalent to 14 football fields, prompted surprise from officials. “We never really thought they had the moxie to go that far,” a Border Patrol operations supervisor, Lance LeNoir, told The Associated Press. “They continue to surprise me.”']","The shaft ran for four-fifths of a mile between Tijuana and San Diego and was equipped with rails, ventilation, a drainage system and even an elevator, officials said."
"From Armed Struggle to Peaceful Protest, a Road Still to Travel",2020-01-31,By Carlotta Gall,"['LONDON — From a small prefabricated office in a northwest London suburb, a satellite television channel has been broadcasting since the early days of the Arab Spring in 2011, offering Algerians a viewpoint that their country’s tightly controlled state channels do not give. The main voice on its programs, Abdullah Anas, is little known in the West but a giant in jihadi circles from the 1980s war in Afghanistan against the invading Soviet Army. A lifelong Algerian activist from student days, Mr. Anas, 61, spent 12 years with the Afghan mujahedeen and then served as a close aide to Abdullah Azzam, the Palestinian professor and preacher often called the father of the international resistance to the Soviet occupation. Since those days, Mr. Anas has become a champion of peaceful change and dialogue, not only for Algeria but for restive societies across the Muslim world. In Afghanistan, he helped facilitate the first exploratory peace talks with the Taliban in 2006. “Really, I can say with full confidence, it is a new chapter for the Algerian people,” he said in an interview this week as the protests in Algeria approached their first anniversary. Compared to violent clashes with protesters in Lebanon and Iraq, and Algeria’s own bloody past, he said the Algerian protest movement was setting a new example. “In one year not one drop of blood was lost, praise be to God.” Mr. Anas remains in exile in England, since he risks arrest by the military-dominated government if he returns to Algeria. Nevertheless, he has been closely involved in shaping and encouraging the protest movement through the satellite channel, Al-Magharibia TV, which live-streams the protests and commentary on the internet, puncturing a virtual government news media blackout. Born in 1958, Mr. Anas grew up in the small town of Ben Badis in eastern Algeria, and recalls a happy childhood in the optimistic post-colonialist period. His family, like thousands of Algerians, moved from the old Arab quarter into homes abandoned by the French colonialists after independence in 1962. After his father became deeply religious, the young Mr. Anas was sent to a madrasa, or religious seminary, for his schooling, and later studied with a preacher of the Tablighi group of Muslim missionaries. It was in 1980, after having read a magazine article, that he was inspired by the idea of fighting jihad in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan he came to work closely with Mr. Azzam, and later married his daughter. He helped Mr. Azzam run the Arab Services Bureau, which organized the participation of Arab volunteers in the Afghan jihad. In a memoir published last year, “To the Mountains: My Life in Jihad from Algeria to Afghanistan,” Mr. Anas sought to correct what he called many of the myths about the Arab volunteers that arose after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Foremost among those, he said, was the notion that thousands of them fought in Afghanistan. By his count, there were only around a hundred committed fighters in Afghanistan at any one time. He describes his time in Afghanistan as helping guide the volunteers in religion and moral behavior as much as military activity, and mediating between warring Afghan factions as much as fighting the war. But he is also frank about the damage that extremists and sectarianism have done to the course of jihad — including those who perpetrated the Sept. 11 attacks and those, who remain unidentified, who assassinated his father-in-law. “I will never denounce jihad,” he writes. “As a Muslim I know this to be a noble deed, the peak of perfection — where man can be the most beastly, he chooses to be humane.” To Mr. Anas, as to most Muslims, jihad — literally, “struggle” — is a fundamental principle of the Muslim faith. Defending your country and other Muslims against occupation and repression, they believe, will be rewarded in heaven. But he distinguishes that sort of jihad from what in Islam is often called “offensive jihad,” removing impediments to the spreading of Islam. Islamic jurists have argued in the past that impediments can include political powers, which can lead to armed struggle against established governments. Mr. Anas said he believes this concept has no place in the modern age. “The door must be closed,” he writes. “Why should we fight a people irrespective of their religion just to bring them into the sphere of Islam even if they don’t convert?” There are many ways to pursue jihad peacefully, he said. “The word jihad is not just taking a Kalashnikov,” he said. “The word jihad is wider in Islam: media jihad, academic jihad, legal jihad, money jihad, thinktanks jihad, politics jihad, diplomacy jihad. Fighting is just one part of it.” After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr. Anas returned to Algeria in 1990 but was detained — his relationship with Mr. Azzam made him a person of extreme interest for the Algerian authorities — and after his release began a life of precarious exile with his young family. He went back to Afghanistan for several years, rejoining the legendary guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whom Mr. Anas considered a friend and mentor. It was there in the early 1990s that he learned of the first democratic stirrings in Algeria, watching election rallies on videos carried over the mountain passes. He knew the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front, or F.I.S., and followed from afar their success in local elections and then the crackdown that followed as the military government imposed martial law, plunging Algeria into a decade of savage civil war. Looking back, Mr. Anas said, Algerian society was not ready for the suddenness of what he called the “remote-control change” of 1992 but he blamed the military government for the deadly violence. “I understand democracy cannot be born with one press” of the button, he said. “But what I cannot understand was, ‘You had more than one option, why did you go for the bloody option?’” After a decade of bloodletting, Algerians accepted the rule of Abdelaziz Bouteflika because he offered a respite from violence. Even as the Arab world exploded in protests in 2011, Algeria remained quiet. Then suddenly in 2019 Algerians blew up in anger when Mr. Bouteflika, wheelchair-bound and barely able to speak after a stroke, proposed to run for a fifth term as president. They haven’t stopped since. “Now they are one year in the streets, on Tuesday the students and on Friday all Algerian people,” he said. “They are academics, workers, agricultural workers, ordinary people, scholars, lawyers, politicians, you cannot imagine, in the street, side by side, men and women, Islamists and non-Islamists, all repeating very simple slogans.” He said the protesters, like those across the Arab world, want justice and rule of law. “If you have a legal state, a state of law, it is not a problem if you want to be Muslim Brotherhood, or Islamist, or secularist,” he said. The protesters forced Mr. Bouteflika’s resignation and the arrest of his brother, but rigged elections brought in a new president from the same old ruling circle. “Completely the old and the miserable chapter,” as Mr. Anas put it. Yet, he remains optimistic and insists the only way ahead is through dialogue, even if it takes five or 10 years to persuade the military to allow free elections. “The Algerian movement is not under pressure,” he said. “I am saying, ‘Hang on, be patient.’” He remains engaged as well in Afghanistan, where he sees a new generation of Afghans who no longer care about old divisions. “You have 30 to 35 million Afghans, most of them in the cities, it is not necessary to be Taliban, to be pro-American against Taliban, it is not necessary to be Communist,” he said. “We have initiatives, we have the minds of the new generation saying ‘listen to us, we have our own way, we can do it, we can solve the problem, but give us a chance.’”']",A veteran of the Afghan jihad working for nonviolent change in Algeria
Kenya’s High Court Delays National Biometric ID Program,2020-01-31,By Abdi Latif Dahir and Carlos Mureithi,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya’s high court on Thursday temporarily suspended the country’s new national biometric identity program until the government enacts laws to protect the security of the data and prevent discrimination against minorities. The government had said the IDs would be required for all Kenyan citizens and foreign residents to access a broad range of rights and services, including health care, education, public housing, voting, marriage licenses and registering mobile phones. But the court’s three-judge panel announced in proceedings on Thursday that it is suspending the digital ID program until the government has in place “an appropriate and comprehensive regulatory framework” that would protect the personal data it collects and safeguard minorities from discrimination. The panel’s 500-page judgment is expected to be released next week. The decision is a setback for the government, which had already collected data from nearly 40 million Kenyans during a mass registration in April and May last year. The government will now have to pass new legislation — under public scrutiny — to build in protections and implement the biometric program. It is unclear how long that might take. The program, called the National Integrated Management System, was introduced last year and sought to collect personal and biometric data — including fingerprints, facial photographs and residential addresses — from Kenya’s population of almost 50 million. But last February, civil rights groups in Kenya challenged the system’s constitutionality, citing concerns over data privacy, inadequate public participation, and the marginalization of minorities, who already find it difficult to get the government documentation they need to register for the biometric IDs. “We are hopeful that this judgment is a milestone in the quest for equality for all Kenyans,” said Yussuf Bashir, a lawyer representing the Nubian Rights Forum, the first of many civil rights organizations that filed legal challenges to the digital registry. Kenya’s digital registry drew comparisons to India’s giant biometric program, known as Aadhaar, whose sweeping powers were limited by the Indian Supreme Court in 2018. Each person who registers is supposed to receive a unique identification number called Huduma Namba — or “service number” in Swahili. Officials said the number will be required to pay taxes, open bank accounts and get a drivers’ license, in addition to accessing health and schooling services. Civil rights groups, however, said the program risked disenfranchising millions of people who already face systemic challenges getting the documents required to obtain biometric ID cards. To enroll, adults had to provide a national identity card, and birth certificates for those under 18. For decades, racial, religious and ethnic minority groups like Nubians, Somalis and Kenyans of Indian origin have faced obstacles and delays when applying for government-issued papers. (Nubians were originally brought to Kenya from Sudan as soldiers by British colonial rulers more than a century ago.) Human rights advocates said many members of these communities were turned away from Huduma registration centers last spring. The court, however, found that the government took the right steps to introduce the sweeping program, provided the public enough information, and did not coerce people to register. Still, the program “was rushed” and introduced without proper legislation, said Justice Pauline Nyamweya, one of the judges on the panel. The legislation was not published until July, after the mass registration exercise had ended — a move that Justice Nyamweya said was “contrary to principles of democratic governance and rule of law.” Kenya passed a data protection law last November, which established a data commission to regulate the processing of personal data. It is not clear when this body will be operational and how much sway it will have over regulating the biometric program. The justices also ruled that collection of DNA and GPS data, which was barred by another court last April, was “intrusive and unnecessary.” The ruling “partially recognized” how essential biometric data is “to who you are as a human being, and that the government shouldn’t have unchecked power to collect that information and to use it without your consent,” said Nanjala Nyabola, the author of “Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics: How the Internet Era is Transforming Kenya.” For 22-year-old Hassan Noor, the court’s decision magnifies his anxieties. For four years now, Mr. Noor, who is a Kenyan of Nubian descent, has not been able to get a national identity card. That mean he has not been able to get a job, register a business or travel easily — or get a biometric ID. He is unemployed and lives in Kibera, a poor area southwest of Nairobi. “I feel bad,” he said of the court’s decision. “I’m not the only one who’ll suffer.”']","The biometric system was challenged in court over privacy concerns, and fears that it could exclude millions from accessing public services."
U.S. Strikes at Leader of Qaeda in Yemen,2020-01-31,"By Rukmini Callimachi, Eric Schmitt and Julian E. Barnes","['The United States has carried out an airstrike against the leader of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen after months of tracking him by using aerial surveillance and other intelligence, according to three current or former American officials. The officials expressed confidence that the Qaeda leader, Qassim al-Rimi, was killed in a January airstrike in Yemen but were awaiting confirmation before making a public announcement. If confirmed, his death could represent a significant blow to the Qaeda affiliate, which remains one of the most potent branches of the terrorist group. The Yemen branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has tried to attack the United States and Europe and is thought to still want to. The group’s ability to orchestrate or attack targets in the West has atrophied in recent years, as American airstrikes have targeted their bomb-makers and English-language propagandists. But the group, American officials have previously said, remains a dangerous one. Qaeda and Islamic State leaders have been targeted in the past by American military or C.I.A. drone strikes, only for United States officials to learn later that the militants had survived. That has made American officials more cautious about declaring these kind of strikes successful. Military officials said they were not aware of any strikes. The C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to comment. The C.I.A. learned of Mr. al-Rimi’s location from an informer in Yemen in November, according to a United States official who was briefed on the strike. That information allowed the government to begin tracking him through surveillance drones. Local news reports in Yemen said that a drone strike this month killed two militant suspects in the area of Wadi Abedah in central Yemen. The reports did not identify the people killed in the strike. Mr. al-Rimi, 41, is among the few Qaeda leaders whose terrorist pedigree traces to the era before the Sept. 11 attacks. A veteran of Qaeda’s training camps in Afghanistan, Mr. al-Rimi later returned to his native Yemen, where he was sentenced to five years in prison for plotting to kill the American ambassador there. He broke out of jail a year later, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Qaeda affiliate. The State Department offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to Mr. al-Rimi’s capture, and later doubled the reward to $10 million, as he was linked to numerous plots against American interests. According to the State Department, he is believed to have played a role in the 2008 attack on the American Embassy in Sana, which killed 10 guards and four civilians, as well as the 2009 plot by the Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to take down a Detroit-bound flight with explosives concealed in his underwear. In the first major military operation authorized by President Trump, Chief Petty Officer William (Ryan) Owens, a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, was killed in Yemen in 2017 trying to kill or capture Mr. al-Rimi. “He was an Al Qaeda veteran whose career started in the camps in pre-9/11 Afghanistan,” said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. “After he was busted out of prison, he was part of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula’s relaunch management team, becoming their military commander.” Mr. Joscelyn said that Mr. al-Rimi was one of just four Qaeda officials who appeared in a video announcing the group’s relaunch in 2009. Analysts said that numerous Qaeda leaders have been killed in similar strikes. “These strikes are necessary to degrade the group, but not sufficient to destroy it,” Mr. Joscelyn said. The affiliate in Yemen was for a time considered the most capable of striking American interests, but it hasn’t pursued a plot targeting the United States in years. Bruce Riedel, a 30-year veteran former C.I.A. officer, said he had heard about the strike but added that it was unclear whether Mr. al-Rimi had been killed. “Al-Rimi is an important target, probably more dangerous to Yemen and Saudi Arabia than for Americans given the group’s diminished capabilities during the Yemen war,” he said. The strike against Mr. al-Rimi came at roughly the same time the American military unsuccessfully tried to kill a senior Iranian military official in Yemen, Abdul Reza Shahlai. The attempted strike against Mr. Shahlai came on the same day an American drone killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s most powerful commander. Saeed al-Batati and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.']","American officials believe they may have killed the terrorist leader, Qassim al-Rimi, but have not confirmed his death."
Britons on Brexit: ‘We’ve Made a Spectacle of Ourselves’,2020-01-31,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — When Britain leaves the European Union at 11 p.m. on Friday, some will be celebrating and others will be mourning. But for most people interviewed this week around the country, it seems to mark a time for recovery — from years of wrangling that has upended the political system and sometimes strained the country’s social fabric. “It’s just been day after day of dysfunction, division and economic uncertainty. I’m not sure how we are supposed to bounce back from this,” said Andrew Fielden, a 39-year-old London-based accountant who supported Britain remaining in the European Union. “The irony is that Brexit was all about taking back control, but we’ve never been so out of control. No one even knows what the reality of Brexit will look like.” Since the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the union, political discord has rippled through the country, sundering towns and cities and rupturing relationships among families and friends. The atmosphere became so toxic that in December’s general election, many Britons crossed traditional political divides to deliver the Conservative government a substantial mandate to “get Brexit done.” “Voting in the election was one of the hardest decisions of my life,” said Madeline Shaw, 42, a social worker from the southern port city of Southampton. She said she had almost always voted for the opposition Labour Party, but switched to the Conservatives this year because they promised to deliver Brexit. “We’ve made a spectacle of ourselves squabbling over Brexit for years. We’ve let down vulnerable communities, whose needs have been neglected because the government was paralyzed by Brexit,” Ms. Shaw said. “We had to move forward before the damage caused became irreparable.” Nothing has divided Britain quite like the question of Brexit. Those in favor are adamant that cutting financial and legal ties with the European Union and taking back control of immigration will allow Britain to reclaim its sovereignty and prosper. Those who want to remain feel an impending sense of loss at the prospect of being excluded from the bloc, its economic benefits and influence in the rest of the world. The tension between the two camps is visible in the port town of Boston on the east coast of England, which has both Britain’s highest proportion of Eastern European immigrants and one of its largest majorities for Brexit. Around 13 percent of the town’s 65,000 people were born elsewhere in Europe, according to the 2011 census, and Boston’s European population has continued to grow over subsequent years. “This isn’t about racism or discrimination against foreigners,” said Martin Lewis, a retired teacher from the town. “We welcome different nationalities and cultures in England, but the number we have absorbed is out of control. There aren’t enough jobs, houses and services to accommodate these people.” A Polish handyman from the town, who did not give his name for fear of damaging his business, said that many of the anxieties Boston residents had over immigration were inflated and not representative of reality. “We do the work they do not want to do, we live 10 people to one house, we earn our way of life and we do not burden anybody,” he said, adding that while he felt welcome in the town he was aware of hostile comments about the Polish community made “behind closed doors.” Boston residents were reluctant to talk about Brexit on a recent cold and rainy day — “There’s more to this town, there’s more to this country” one pensioner said. But reflecting on the past three and a half years, many of them said that the “Remain” movement’s reluctance to honor the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum felt like the biggest threat to the country’s democracy. “I do worry about the divides that have arisen from Brexit, but I fear that we would have seen unrest if the Brexit decision had been reversed,” Mr. Lewis said. Young Britons, who see Brexit as a major threat to their future, criticize older generations for being out of touch with their needs as the terms of the country’s relationship with its European neighbors are hammered out. “I am concerned about the people who carry the perspective that as long as issues of the country aren’t harming them personally, they can remain uninformed and uninvolved,” said Eden Reyhanian, an 18-year-old student at a school in North London. “Events within politics have made me feel as the likelihood of cohesion within our country is out of the picture, and while our nation is ideally supposed to become more unified when faced with threats of division, the opposite has occurred.” Oscar Redgrave, a 17-year-old student in Shrewsbury, Western England, who started a pro-European Union campaign group for young people, said one of the most worrying aspects of Brexit was how it had pushed racism and discrimination into the mainstream. “As we’ve become more divided on the subject of immigration, racism and hate crimes have become normalized, and British society has become more closed-minded,” he said. “It’s very disturbing.” But Mr. Redgrave is still hopeful that Brexit might be one day be reversed. He hopes for an overhaul of Britain’s electoral system, which critics say favors larger political parties. “Most young people are really for Europe,” he said. “If we get a voting system that allows us to really vote for who we want then I can see a scenario where we are back in Europe in five to 10 years. It’s possible.”']","As Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union becomes a reality, some people are celebrating and others are mourning. But for most, it seems, it is a time for recuperation and healing."
Portraits of Brexit Day: U.K. Celebrates and Mourns Leaving E.U.,2020-01-31,By The New York Times,"['After three years of uncertainty, political acrimony and fractured opinions across a nation that found itself divided as never before, Brexit finally arrived on Friday night. At 11 p.m. — midnight in Brussels — Britain said farewell to the European Union, officially departing from the bloc after 47 years of membership and setting off on a new solo journey. While the moment was highly anticipated in the years since the country’s 2016 referendum, little will immediately change when the countdown is over. The commemorations have been notably subdued. Even the official government celebrations — a victory lap for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had pledged to see through Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union “do or die” — were muted. British flags lined the square outside Parliament and the Mall leading to Buckingham Palace, and a light show was staged outside Mr. Johnson’s official residence in Downing Street, a side road that is closed to the public. Elsewhere, those who supported remaining in the European Union staged protests and others wore mourning clothes to show their grief at the end of Britain’s membership. Though little will be different for Britons waking up on Saturday morning — the beginning of an 11-month transition period while Brussels and London negotiate the terms of their new relationship — the moment is a hugely symbolic one.

"At the Stroke of Brexit, Britain Steps, Guardedly, Into a New Dawn",2020-01-31,"By Mark Landler, Stephen Castle and Benjamin Mueller","['LONDON — To the recorded peals of Big Ben and the gentle fluttering of Union Jacks, Britain bade farewell to the European Union at 11 p.m. on Friday, severing ties to the world’s largest trading bloc after nearly half a century and embarking on an uncertain future as a midsize economy off the coast of Europe. For Britain, having transitioned in the postwar era from a globe-girdling empire to a reluctant member of the European project, it was yet another epoch-making departure. It is a departure that will upend settled relations in virtually all areas of society, the economy and security matters, while confronting Britain with new questions of national identity. Three and a half years after the former prime minister, Theresa May, proclaimed that “Brexit means Brexit,” the British government will finally have to decide precisely what that means. Britain must still negotiate its future trade relations with the European Union, a thorny process that could take through the end of the year, or longer. On Friday, the departure elicited both hope and trepidation from Britons. Many simply were relieved that the bitter and divisive debate over Brexit is over. “This is the moment when the dawn breaks, and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in an address to the nation on Friday night that he also posted on his Twitter account. Brexit, he said, was a chance to “spread hope and opportunity to every part of the U.K.” Mr. Johnson, whose vow to “Get Brexit Done” won him a commanding majority in elections last month, vowed to knit together a country that had been split geographically and generationally by the Brexit debate. Even the future of the United Kingdom now seemed uncertain, with Scotland threatening to renew its drive for independence and Northern Ireland musing about unification with Ireland. On Friday, Mr. Johnson’s cabinet met in Sunderland, an industrial city in the north, a traditional Labour stronghold where the early returns after the referendum in June 2016 foretold the country’s stunning decision to leave the European Union. The prime minister celebrated Brexit as a triumph for self-government, and promised to undertake the “biggest revival of our infrastructure since the Victorians.” For all the historical resonance, the celebrations of Britain’s departure were oddly attenuated. A countdown clock flickered on the darkened wall of 10 Downing Street, while inside the prime minister hosted a party with British-sourced food and English sparkling wine. British embassies were instructed to hold low-key affairs — no special events — and to avoid anything that smacked of “triumphalism.” In a chilly Parliament Square, several thousand Brexiteers gathered to sing “God Save the Queen” as the clock struck 11 p.m. Even the timing of the exit seemed a compromise: the European Union decided to make Britain’s departure effective at midnight in its Brussels headquarters. Some British commentators complained that the Europeans made a greater show of Britain’s leaving, which they had opposed, than Britain did. Brussels staged a light show in the Grand Place on Thursday, while members of the European Parliament serenaded their departing British colleagues with “Auld Lang Syne.” The ambivalence attested to the divisions that still run through Britain. Pro-Europe activists were despairing, some channeling their anger into efforts to help Europeans in London navigate the reality of reduced rights and a more tenuous life in a country they had long made their home. Still, even the most vociferous opponents of Brexit seemed eager to end, or at least suspend, the toxic debate, make the best of the outcome and try to forge a new relationship with the European Union more to their liking. “Britain can alter its political relationship with Europe, but it can’t alter its historical or geographical relationship and, in the end, we’ll have to find a way of working together,” Tony Blair, a former prime minister and ardent opponent of Brexit, said on Friday to foreign journalists in London. “It’s a destiny-changing decision and obviously it’s one I’m profoundly sad about,” said Mr. Blair, who had his own struggles with Britain’s fitful relationship with Europe. “But you’ve got to take a big historical look at this.” As Britain casts off from Europe, Mr. Johnson hopes to deepen his country’s alliance with the United States, starting with a trade deal that the government wants to negotiate in tandem with its agreement with the European Union. President Trump avidly encouraged Brexit and his emissary welcomed Britain’s new status. “America shares your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring,” Robert Wood Johnson IV, the United States ambassador to Britain, said in a statement. Yet, doubts remained about what sort of a trade deal Britain could expect from President Trump. “He believes in America first,” said Kim Darroch, the former ambassador to the United States, in an interview with the Guardian. “And he believes, particularly, in rewarding people who vote for him — and that is American farmers and big American corporations.” For Mr. Johnson, whose capacious Parliamentary majority leaves him with few domestic constraints, the question is which sectors of the economy to prioritize and what trade-offs to make in the post-Brexit era. His government argues that by freeing itself from European regulation, it could become a leader in new technologies like artificial intelligence. As Mr. Johnson’s influential adviser, Dominic Cummings, once put it, Britain can become the best place for those who want to “invent the future.” Yet in leaving Europe’s single market and customs union, Britain is sacrificing the smooth and frictionless flow of goods across its borders — something businesses currently take for granted. Whatever the outcome of the trade talks, exporters and importers will almost certainly face extra layers of bureaucracy and border checks. That will affect industries, from aerospace to food, and could cost jobs in parts of the country where Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won unexpected victories in last month’s general election. Formal negotiations between London and Brussels are expected to start in late February or early March. Mr. Johnson has insisted they must conclude this year, but critics say the timetable is unrealistic. Though the European Union is the far bigger economic entity, it is wary of allowing Britain to become a competitor with lighter regulations, which could undercut European producers. Its goal will be to extract pledges from Britain not to dilute its environmental, labor, or antitrust rules. Britain will probably want to negotiate everything simultaneously, while also engaging in talks with the United States and other nations — a strategy that it hopes will increase its leverage. In Sunderland, Mr. Johnson said he hoped to strike deals covering 80 percent of British trade within three years. In time, Brexit will overhaul how the country trades. But well before that, the split has sent tremors through the lives of Europeans who make their homes in Britain, instantly unraveling the promise that they could live and work there without question. For British cities shaped by waves of migration, none more so than London, the change could be seismic. In shops, restaurants and cultural centers, Europeans talk of going back to their home countries sooner than planned. They bemoan the application required to stay. And those who might once have taken their place are increasingly choosing not to come at all. “Through no fault of their own, people who thought they had forever built their lives on their rights as European Union citizens are all of a sudden having the rug pulled out from under them,” said Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the3million, a group that promotes European citizens’ rights. When the links between Britain and the European Union are severed at the end of the transition period, European citizens’ rights to live and work in Britain will end, as will the rights of Britons to move and work throughout the bloc. For Britons, too, the date of Britain’s departure hardly means an end to rancorous debates that have split families and friends over the last three years. The wounds remain raw. And the labels born of Brexit — Remainers who fought to keep Britain in the European Union, and Leavers who fought to do the opposite — have yet to wear off. Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, a co-founder of For our Future’s Sake, a youth-led group that campaigned to hold a new Brexit referendum last year, said there was only so much healing that could happen while the battle over what kind of Brexit Britain should pursue rages on. Coming from a family with many members who supported Leave, and from a part of England that voted to leave, she said the three years of turmoil were still taking their toll. “We’ll have a couple months of people trying not to talk about it again, trying to pretend it’s not a thing that’s happening, trying not to bring it up at dinner,” Ms. Chetwynd-Cowieson said. “But realistically it’s not going to be sorted in a year. It’s going to start rearing its head and opening divisions within families again.” Mr. Blair, the former prime minister, warned that Mr. Johnson would have to work hard to prevent the breakup of the country, given renewed calls for Scottish independence and Irish unification. A majority in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted against Brexit in 2016, and on Friday evening, the headquarters of the Scottish government in Edinburgh was lit up in the colors of the European flag. Mr. Blair acknowledged that the British had always been ambivalent about European integration. But he said, “the tragedy is that it was actually quite a successful relationship.” Those who dream of Britain rejoining the bloc one day will have to wait for a while, he added. “Who knows?” Mr. Blair said. “The thing I’m sure about is that there’s no point in occupying a lot of time on that now.”']","On a rainy evening of dampened festivities, its epoch-making departure stirred hopes and fears, but also relief that the ordeal is finally over."
Duterte Orders Cabinet Not to Visit U.S. After Official’s Visa Is Denied,2020-01-30,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has ordered all members of his cabinet not to travel to the United States after Washington blacklisted his former national police chief over the government’s drug war, which has left thousands dead, a top aide said Thursday. The order comes as Mr. Duterte has ratcheted up his threats against the United States, the Philippines’ longtime military ally, including with warnings of reduced cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries. “Last night, the president issued a directive for cabinet members not to travel to the U.S.,” Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano told an annual breakfast forum of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines. “We will abide with the instruction of the president.” A cabinet meeting has been scheduled for next week to discuss the order, Mr. Ano said. He said that Mr. Duterte had issued the directive after his former national police chief, Senator Ronald dela Rosa, recently learned from the United States State Department that his visa was revoked. Mr. dela Rosa said he had not been told the reason for the denial, although he suspected that it was because of his part in carrying out the drug war under Mr. Duterte’s direction. That campaign has resulted in the deaths of nearly 6,000 suspected addicts and drug dealers, and, rights groups say, some innocent civilians. Mr. dela Rosa subsequently retired, but was among several Duterte allies who won a seat in the Philippine Senate last year. The brutality and brazenness of the killings has shocked many in this largely Catholic country, with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch leading a campaign to help families of the victims take their case to the International Criminal Court. But Mr. Duterte last year moved to undo a treaty that recognized that court’s jurisdiction, and insisted that he would not be tried by a foreign court. On Thursday, his spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said the president’s order was very clear — for his cabinet to boycott America. The United States Embassy in Manila has yet to respond to the order. But Washington has for decades been one of the Philippines’ most reliable partners. The two are bound by a 1951 mutual defense treaty that calls on each to come to the other’s defense in the face of foreign aggression. And Manila has in recent years received the American military’s help in fighting militants linked to the Islamic State. United States troops in 2017 flew drones and helped the Philippine government defeat militants who had taken over the city of Marawi on Mindanao Island in the southern Philippines. But Mr. Duterte has recently warned the United States that he would abrogate a defense agreement, the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows for large-scale American military exercises in the Philippines, unless Washington “corrected” its visa denial of Mr. dela Rosa. “As he said before, the decision of the president to terminate the V.F.A. is a studied decision,” Mr. Panelo said, referring to the agreement. Renato De Castro, who teaches international relations at the De La Salle University in Manila, said that Mr. Duterte’s threat to reduce bilateral ties with the United States signaled that the country was drifting toward its traditional nemesis, China. “This is a signal to say that we are basically favoring China,” Mr. De Castro said. “It is the beginning of the unraveling of the Philippine-U.S. security alliance. He is articulating the Chinese position that the U.S. is the troublemaker in the region.” Since assuming office in 2016, Mr. Duterte has gradually tried to reduce tensions with Beijing. He has not enforced an international ruling that found in favor of Manila in its territorial dispute against Beijing’s vast claims to the disputed South China Sea. And critics say he has been bending over backward to accommodate the Chinese to gain certain business and investment favors. When a Filipino boat was rammed last year by a much bigger Chinese vessel in the South China Sea, sending 22 Filipino fishermen overboard, Mr. Duterte made a show of getting angry at first, promising to confront China’s leader, Xi Jinping. But he later conceded that there was nothing he could do about it.']",The Philippine president issued the order after one of the architects of his bloody drug war was denied a visa for the United States.
"In India, Protesters and Modi Tussle Over Who Can Claim Gandhi",2020-01-30,By Maria Abi-Habib,"['NEW DELHI — The protesters who are challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-centric vision for India liberally evoke the legacy of a national icon: Mohandas K. Gandhi, who wanted a country where Hindus and Muslims lived together and a secular government kept the peace. So it has been galling for them to watch Mr. Modi and his allies claim Gandhi’s mantle to promote their own agenda, including the issue that set off the protests — a contentious citizenship law that critics say blatantly discriminates against Muslims. With Thursday the 72nd anniversary of Gandhi’s assassination, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have deployed his name and image at an ever-faster clip in an information campaign meant to counter the protests and drum up support for the citizenship law. “We only implemented what the great freedom fighters had wished to do. We have done Gandhiji’s bidding,” Mr. Modi said this month in defense of the law, adding a Hindi suffix indicating respect. But the protesters say that the government’s actions are directly at odds with Gandhi’s goal of a secular, pluralistic India. [Analysis: Violence in India threatens its global ambitions.] Since his landslide re-election in May, Mr. Modi has made several bold moves that thrilled Indians who long for a Hindu state. He canceled the statehood of the predominantly Muslim territory of Kashmir, and thousands were arrested there without charge. His party championed a court ruling that allowed a Hindu temple to be built on the site of a centuries-old mosque, touching on a dangerous sectarian flash point. And now the party has pushed through the citizenship law, which favors immigrants of every major South Asian religion but Islam. Critics fear that if the law were combined with a citizenship test, Muslims could be disenfranchised, stripped of their nationality or their right to vote. “Modi invokes everything about Gandhi except Hindu-Muslim harmony, and this was the most crucial element of his work,” said Ramachandra Guha, a historian who wrote an authoritative biography of Gandhi, and who was arrested at a recent protest. “You can’t have Einstein without relativity,” Mr. Guha said. “You can’t have Darwin without evolution. And you can’t have Gandhi without Hindu-Muslim harmony.” Clashes broke out at some early protests, but more recent demonstrations have been peaceful, deliberately drawing on Gandhi’s example of nonviolent resistance. The government has responded with both force and a virulent disinformation campaign. (Officials have denied cracking down on peaceful protests, despite many images and witness accounts of violence.) In recent days, a protest camp of hundreds of women in the Shaheen Bagh neighborhood of New Delhi has come to symbolize the movement. Officials have said the women are radicals or have been paid to be there, and many believe a police crackdown is imminent. Throughout his six years in power, Mr. Modi has frequently linked himself to Gandhi’s legacy, saying he was “made of the same soil” as the champion of Indian independence. His vice president has called it “divine coincidence” that both men were born in the state of Gujarat. Mr. Modi has even used Gandhi’s signature round, wire-rimmed spectacles as a logo for his “Clean India” sanitation campaign. Mr. Modi has also drawn on Gandhi’s globally resonant image overseas as he cuts military alliances and trade deals. In October, as he wrapped up meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he wrote an Opinion piece for The New York Times calling on the world to learn from Gandhi’s teachings. But one fact omitted by the prime minister was that Gandhi was killed by a Hindu nationalist — a man nurtured by the same hard-line ideological group that shaped Mr. Modi: the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, believed that Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims. That line is still echoed today by Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is filled with officials who revere Godse and see Gandhi as a traitor. One party official, Pragya Singh Thakur, who has repeatedly called Godse a patriot, was arrested in 2008 in connection with a mosque bombing that killed 10 people. Mr. Modi’s government dropped some of the most serious terrorism charges against her, and she was elected to Parliament in an overwhelming victory last year. “The ideology that killed him is now trying to claim him,” said Tushar Gandhi, a great-grandson of Gandhi who has supported the protests. “It’s nauseating to see them snatch my great-grandfather’s legacy, but at the same time I take pride that even a person like Modi must seek refuge in a person like my great-grandfather,” Mr. Gandhi said. Mr. Modi’s party is hardly the first Indian political group to evoke Gandhi’s image for its own gain. His portrait hangs everywhere, and most Indians proudly revere him as a model of morality and conscience. For Mr. Modi, cultivating the association helps him attract Indian voters who have traditionally been wary of his party’s sectarianism. A pamphlet recently distributed by the party, addressing what it calls “misinformation” about the citizenship law, features Gandhi’s image along with a quote from him appearing to suggest that he would have supported the law. But the quote — about India welcoming Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan — is taken out of context, and critics contend that it is actually itself misinformation. Originally, Gandhi was excoriating Hindus who questioned Muslims’ loyalty to India. When contacted, the pamphlet’s editor, a B.J.P. lawmaker named Prabhat Jha, said he had gotten the quote from the Home Ministry, which is led by Mr. Modi’s closest confidant, Amit Shah. Mr. Shah has boasted about the party’s talent for manipulating imagery and political messages, saying in one speech: “We are capable of delivering any message we want to the public, whether sweet, sour, true or fake.” The B.J.P.’s media operations have been fully mobilized against the protesters, who have been depicted as violent, “anti-national” and exclusively Muslim, even though a diverse group of Indians has participated.  In a widely circulated Twitter post, the party’s social media chief, Amit Malviya, accused some protesters of chanting “long live Pakistan,” playing on stereotypes that Indian Muslims’ true loyalty is to India’s neighbor and archrival, which was founded as an Islamic state. Mr. Malviya’s claim was debunked, but he refused to take the post down. He declined to comment. “They’ve branded them anti-nationals, a term that has caught on in last five or six years to say that anyone that is antigovernment is against the nation,” said Chitranshu Tewari, an analyst of the Indian news media. “The government wants to create that link in people’s minds, that the government and nation are one.” In some B.J.P.-controlled states where protests have taken place, the police have ransacked shops and homes belonging to Muslims, part of what one government official called an act of “revenge.” In scenes reminiscent of Gandhi’s struggle against British rule, protesters have been dragged from auto rickshaws as they arrived at demonstrations. Police officers have charged at people who were marching peacefully. The protest movement lacks the international support that gave Gandhi’s campaign strength. But demonstrators are still clinging to their cause — and to Gandhi’s methods. In Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, hundreds of women have braved the winter cold to shut down one of India’s busiest thoroughfares, sleeping on thin sheets of cardboard. They began fasting this month, to demonstrate against the citizenship law and to pay tribute to the last weeks of Gandhi’s life, when he went without food to protest the sectarian violence wracking India and Pakistan. “It’s painful to us that Gandhi was protesting against a foreign occupation power and we now need to use these tactics against our own government, an Indian government,” said Saima Khan, 33. She added that Gandhi had fought and died for an India where Muslims felt at home, an ideal that was now under threat. “When people think about India, they think about Gandhi’s India,” she said. “But this is not the India this government wants.” Kai Schultz, Hari Kumar, Sameer Yasir and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the national icon would have supported his contentious citizenship law.

Berlin Freezes Rents for 5 Years in a Bid to Slow Gentrification,2020-01-31,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Rental prices on more than 1.5 million Berlin apartments will be frozen or lowered for five years as a result of new legislation aimed at halting a recent spike in rents that is driving out older and lower-income residents. The measure, which lawmakers approved on Thursday and which is to take effect next month, is an attempt by Berlin’s leftist government to slow the gentrification of a city that built a reputation on a creative scene but is being squeezed by real estate investors and infrastructure projects. “We have created an instrument that will stop the partially absurd price developments for the next five years,” Katrin Lompscher, Berlin’s senator for city development and living, said at a news conference on Friday. “It is up to politicians to create the basic conditions for lower- and middle-class earners to be able to afford to live in Berlin.” Renting is more common in Germany than homeownership, with more than half of the country’s residents renting their homes. In Berlin, a city of three million people, only 18 percent of residents own their homes. The new law caps most rents in the city at 2019 levels and limits the amount that can be charged based on the apartment’s condition and amenities. Critics say the move will hamper desperately needed growth in the property market and frighten off those willing to build affordable housing in a city once known for its “poor but sexy” party scene of the 1990s that has become a rapidly changing European capital. Real estate developers and members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party have threatened to challenge the law. They argue that it violates the country’s Constitution, which stipulates that rents are set by the federal government. “The rent cap is equivalent to an expropriation and is a catastrophe for Berlin’s real estate market,” said Jürgen Michael Schick, the president of Germany’s Real Estate Association. The group has warned about the negative effects the measure could have since the city government proposed it last year. “Limiting and reducing the income from rents will create uncertainty for investors and will ward off real estate developers from investing,” Mr. Schick said. Ms. Lompscher said the aim was not to halt growth in the city’s housing stock, but to ease the strain on renters while private developers and city officials facilitate the construction of more housing. The city, Germany’s capital, plans to construct more than 60,000 apartments in the coming years, many of them lower-priced properties, she said. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the reunited city found itself with a glut of apartments, many of which were publicly owned. In an effort to bring in desperately needed cash to pay for the reunification of East and West Berlin, many properties were privatized. Foreign property investors quickly understood the potential for growth in Berlin — where rents are still notably cheaper than in London, Paris or Rome —\xa0and began buying and renovating apartments. They also started charging higher rent. At the same time, the city’s population continued to grow, adding about 250,000 new residents from 2012 to 2017, according to official figures. That combination of factors led to a spike in rental prices, especially in the most desirable areas of the city. In 2017, Berlin ranked internationally as the only major city where property values had increased more than 20 percent from a year earlier, with rents keeping pace. “Three million tenants will benefit in the city,” said Iris Spranger, the housing affairs spokeswoman for the city’s Social Democrats, one of the governing parties that approved the law. “After a long phase of galloping prices, rents will now be stopped,” she said, “and that is sorely needed.”']","The move, in a capital once known for its artists and its party scene, aims to reverse a trend that is driving out older and lower-income residents."
"Deaths Surpass 200, and State Department Urges Against Travel to China",2020-01-30,By The New York Times,"['Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.  The State Department on Thursday night issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the coronavirus. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the travel advisory on Twitter. The department set the new advisory at Level 4, or Red, its highest caution, which is reserved for the most dangerous situations. The World Health Organization declared on Thursday that the new coronavirus outbreak was a global health emergency, acknowledging that the disease represents a risk outside of China, where it emerged last month. The declaration — officially called a Public Health Emergency of International Concern —  serves notice to all United Nations member states that the world’s top health advisory body rates the situation as serious.  Countries can then decide whether to close their borders, cancel flights, screen people arriving at airports or take other measures. The decision came as cases have begun to appear in people who had not traveled to China during the outbreak.  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced in a Thursday night news conference that Italy had blocked all flights to and from China as the country confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus. The government announced the country’s first two confirmed cases during the news conference. Officials said they would investigate the movements of the two people, Chinese tourists, and try to identify those they may have been in contact with. The news capped a tense day in Italy, after thousands of passengers had been blocked from leaving a cruise ship that docked at an Italian port for more than 12 hours over concerns that someone aboard might have had the virus. That episode was ultimately a false alarm. A Chinese national with a fever later tested negative for the coronavirus and the Italian authorities said that passengers were allowed to disembark.       The American Airlines pilots’ union said on Thursday that it was suing the airline in an attempt to halt all service between the United States and China, citing “a threat to the safety of passengers and flight crew.” In a statement, the union, the Allied Pilots Association, said it was instructing its members to turn down requests to fly to China.  The airline had previously announced that, because of declining demand, it would suspend flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai starting on Feb. 9. Service from Dallas to those cities is expected to continue. In another development, United Airlines on Thursday announced a new wave of cancellations affecting hundreds of flights through the end of March. The cutback, a response to declining demand, will reduce the number of daily flights from 12 to four from its United States hubs to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai. In all, the reduction includes 332 round trip cancellations between Feb. 9 and March 28.  Health officials on Thursday reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus in the United States.  The patient is the husband of a woman who was the first reported case in Chicago, officials said at a news briefing. The woman, who is in her 60s, had returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. She was hospitalized but appears to be doing well, said Dr. Jennifer Layden, an epidemiologist at the Illinois Department of Public Health.  Her husband, who had not traveled to China, recently began showing symptoms and was immediately isolated in the hospital. Lab tests have now confirmed that he was infected with the coronavirus, Dr. Layden said. Health officials are tracking the places visited by both patients and identifying all close contacts to monitor them. The public is at low risk, officials said.  Person-to-person transmission may occur if someone who is sick breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes in the vicinity of others. Respiratory droplets carrying the virus may then travel from the sick person to other people or surfaces. Based on the transmission patterns seen in China and other countries, experts have expected to see some person-to-person spread in the United States, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We understand that this may be concerning,” Dr. Redfield said. “But our assessment remains that the immediate risk to the American public is low.” The disease is not spreading widely in the U.S. and people who have not had close contact with someone who recently traveled to China are unlikely to get infected. ◆ Forty-three more deaths in China were announced early Friday, bringing the toll to 213.  ◆ Nearly 2,000 new cases were recorded in China in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 9,800, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; 98 cases have been confirmed in 18 other countries.   ◆ Tibet has reported its first confirmed case. This means that all of China’s provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak. ◆ Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Japan has 11; Hong Kong and Singapore have 10; Taiwan has eight; Australia, Malaysia and Macau each have seven; France and the United States have six; South Korea, Germany and the United Arab Emirates each have 4; Canada has three; Vietnam and Italy each have two; and India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland each have one. ◆ Confirming India’s first case, the government said the patient, in the southern state of Kerala, was a student at Wuhan University. It said arriving passengers with a history of travel to China were being screened at 20 airports, up from seven earlier in the week. ◆ Cases recorded in Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan and France involved patients who had not been to China. There have been no reported deaths outside China. The rapid spread of the coronavirus has unleashed a wave of panic and, in some cases, outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe. In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter. In Singapore, tens of thousands of residents have signed a petition calling for the government to ban Chinese nationals from entering the country. In Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam, businesses have posted signs saying that mainland Chinese customers are not welcome. And in France, a front-page headline in a regional newspaper warned of a “Yellow Alert.” At a time when China’s rise as a global economic and military power has unsettled its neighbors in Asia as well as its rivals in the West, the coronavirus is feeding into latent bigotry against the people of mainland China. “Some of the xenophobia is likely undergirded by broader political and economic tensions and anxieties related to China, which are interacting with more recent fears of contagion,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa. With China’s emergence as a major cultural market in recent years, the effects of the coronavirus outbreak quickly rippled through the arts world. The Boston Symphony Orchestra announced Thursday morning that it was canceling a tour of Asia that had been scheduled to begin next week. The Hong Kong Philharmonic called off a pair of Beethoven concerts this weekend under the baton of its music director, Jaap van Zweden, who holds the same post at the New York Philharmonic, after its venue was closed. Film shoots were shut down; movie premieres postponed; a dozen concerts by the Cantopop star Andy Lau were canceled; and some prominent galleries were calling for Art Basel Hong Kong, the prestigious international art fair scheduled for March, to be canceled. The Boston Symphony called off its tour, which was to have featured the pianist Yefim Bronfman, after learning that one of the halls it planned to play at, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, had canceled its performances, and amid rising concerns about the spread of the virus. Tours are hugely expensive undertakings for large symphony orchestras, and the Boston Symphony, which does not carry insurance for tour concert interruptions, will now begin discussions about costs with various vendors — including for its flights, cargo, and hotels — as well as with the concert presenters. The National Symphony Orchestra, of Washington, is scheduled to perform in Beijing and Shanghai with its music director, Gianandrea Noseda, after several dates in Japan. Gary Ginstling, the orchestra’s executive director, said that the orchestra had been conferring with government officials, presenters and medical experts as it monitors the situation.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that China’s loss might be America’s gain, because the coronavirus outbreak could prompt employers to move jobs to the United States. “I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Mr. Ross said in an interview on Fox Business. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.” Mr. Ross cited previous disease outbreaks in China, suggesting that a prevalence of diseases there would become a factor in businesses leaving the country and relocating to North America. “You had SARS, you have the African swine virus there, now you have this,” Mr. Ross said. His remarks may be seen as insensitive to a country in crisis, and he has faced such criticism in the past. During the government shutdown in early 2019, Mr. Ross suggested that furloughed workers should take out loans while they went without pay for more than a month.  Russia prepared for a partial closure of its 2,600-mile border with China as fears about the coronavirus outbreak mounted in Moscow. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Thursday ordered 16 of the approximately 25 crossing points that Russia operates on the Chinese border to be closed as of midnight local time. He said the closures would be part of a new raft of measures to stop the infection from spreading to the country from Russia’s southeastern neighbor. Russia’s Foreign Ministry urged Russians to postpone all travel to China and suspended the issuance of electronic visas for Chinese citizens. Russian officials say that no cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in Russia. “We have to do everything to protect our people,” Mr. Mishustin said in televised remarks at a cabinet meeting. “We will inform everyone about the relevant actions being taken to close the border in the Far Eastern region and other measures being taken by the government.” Anger and frustration have escalated in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, as the city’s overwhelmed hospitals pleaded for urgent help to replenish diminishing supplies. A relative of a coronavirus patient assaulted a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, pulling and damaging the doctor’s mask and protective clothing, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the local police. The Beijing Youth Daily, a state-owned newspaper, reported that two doctors had been attacked at the hospital, including one who was threatened and had his protective gown torn off. In the face of rising public anger, the central government has sought to present itself as intervening to hold accountable local officials in areas that have been hit hard by the epidemic. CCTV aired footage on Thursday showing a central government inspection team grilling officials in Huanggang, a city about 50 miles from Wuhan, about the number of beds they had set aside for coronavirus patients. As the two local health officials fumbled their responses to seemingly basic questions, the visiting inspectors’ questions took on a more impatient tone. Unusual in its blunt portrayal of inadequate government response, the report was quickly shared on Chinese social media sites with the hashtag “one question, three don’t knows.” Officials say medical supplies are running dangerously low in central China, despite gear being delivered in bulk from around the world. The Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan wrote on Weibo, a social media platform, that the city had received 240,000 masks, 25,000 protective gowns and 4,000 pairs of medical goggles from its alumni group in Germany. The Chinese community in Singapore sent 75,000 medical masks. Photographs posted online showed hospital workers, many still in protective gear, slumped over their desks and on the floors in exhaustion. From Chris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, on the ground in Wuhan: Since the central Chinese city of Wuhan went under official lockdown last week, most shops have shut, few cars venture onto the roads and fear has kept most people in their homes. When Wuhan residents do step outside, it’s mostly to the supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies that have stayed open as part of a government effort to sustain the city. Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about supplies of vegetables, fruit or other staples, even as large swaths of the province, Hubei, are also locked down to curtail the outbreak. Yet Wuhan residents complained about price hikes, and expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. Poorer people, both in urban Wuhan and in the countryside, would suffer more acutely from tightening supplies. “If we can’t bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,” said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips’ price. “Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,” Mr. Zuo said. “Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won’t be easy — all those road checks.”  In Taiwan, anger has been growing over China’s refusal this week to let Taiwan evacuate about 300 of its people from Wuhan, even as it has given the United States, Japan and other countries permission to do so. China’s ruling Communist Party considers Taiwan, a democratically governed island, to be part of China, and the two sides have no formal ties. Referring to the rebuffed evacuation request on Tuesday, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement that Taiwanese people in Hubei Province, which includes Wuhan, were receiving “appropriate care.” Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Taiwan’s government, said China was prioritizing politics over lives. Many of the Taiwanese seeking evacuation from Wuhan were tourists or on business trips, while others were residents of the city who suffered from chronic diseases, Ms. Kolas said. “We call on the Chinese government to demonstrate basic humanity and agree to our request as soon as possible,” she said. As part of its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, China has blocked it from participating in international bodies like the World Health Organization — a fact that has also angered Taiwanese people this week, as they try to prepare along with the rest of the world for the possibility of a worsening epidemic.   Fears that a fast-moving virus in China could impact the global economy drove investors in Asia to dump stocks on Thursday. Money fled riskier assets like stocks and oil and flowed instead into investments that are considered safe havens, like gold, as growing numbers of policymakers, economists and corporate executives sounded alarms. Major benchmarks across the region fell by more than 1 percent.  China’s markets remain closed for an extended holiday until Feb. 3. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, hit its lowest price this year before paring some of its losses. It was trading at about $59 a barrel.  European markets finished higher, and the S&P 500 closed up 0.3 percent.    A growing number of companies have  warned they will have to close or shift operations and could take a financial hit from widespread business disruptions in China.

Berlin Freezes Rents for 5 Years in a Bid to Slow Gentrification,2020-01-31,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Rental prices on more than 1.5 million Berlin apartments will be frozen or lowered for five years as a result of new legislation aimed at halting a recent spike in rents that is driving out older and lower-income residents. The measure, which lawmakers approved on Thursday and which is to take effect next month, is an attempt by Berlin’s leftist government to slow the gentrification of a city that built a reputation on a creative scene but is being squeezed by real estate investors and infrastructure projects. “We have created an instrument that will stop the partially absurd price developments for the next five years,” Katrin Lompscher, Berlin’s senator for city development and living, said at a news conference on Friday. “It is up to politicians to create the basic conditions for lower- and middle-class earners to be able to afford to live in Berlin.” Renting is more common in Germany than homeownership, with more than half of the country’s residents renting their homes. In Berlin, a city of three million people, only 18 percent of residents own their homes. The new law caps most rents in the city at 2019 levels and limits the amount that can be charged based on the apartment’s condition and amenities. Critics say the move will hamper desperately needed growth in the property market and frighten off those willing to build affordable housing in a city once known for its “poor but sexy” party scene of the 1990s that has become a rapidly changing European capital. Real estate developers and members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party have threatened to challenge the law. They argue that it violates the country’s Constitution, which stipulates that rents are set by the federal government. “The rent cap is equivalent to an expropriation and is a catastrophe for Berlin’s real estate market,” said Jürgen Michael Schick, the president of Germany’s Real Estate Association. The group has warned about the negative effects the measure could have since the city government proposed it last year. “Limiting and reducing the income from rents will create uncertainty for investors and will ward off real estate developers from investing,” Mr. Schick said. Ms. Lompscher said the aim was not to halt growth in the city’s housing stock, but to ease the strain on renters while private developers and city officials facilitate the construction of more housing. The city, Germany’s capital, plans to construct more than 60,000 apartments in the coming years, many of them lower-priced properties, she said. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the reunited city found itself with a glut of apartments, many of which were publicly owned. In an effort to bring in desperately needed cash to pay for the reunification of East and West Berlin, many properties were privatized. Foreign property investors quickly understood the potential for growth in Berlin — where rents are still notably cheaper than in London, Paris or Rome —\xa0and began buying and renovating apartments. They also started charging higher rent. At the same time, the city’s population continued to grow, adding about 250,000 new residents from 2012 to 2017, according to official figures. That combination of factors led to a spike in rental prices, especially in the most desirable areas of the city. In 2017, Berlin ranked internationally as the only major city where property values had increased more than 20 percent from a year earlier, with rents keeping pace. “Three million tenants will benefit in the city,” said Iris Spranger, the housing affairs spokeswoman for the city’s Social Democrats, one of the governing parties that approved the law. “After a long phase of galloping prices, rents will now be stopped,” she said, “and that is sorely needed.”']","The move, in a capital once known for its artists and its party scene, aims to reverse a trend that is driving out older and lower-income residents."
"More Than 7,700 Cases of Coronavirus Recorded Worldwide",2020-01-29,By The New York Times,"['Mainland China now has more cases of coronavirus than it had of SARS, a respiratory infection that spread across China in 2002 and 2003 and killed 774 people in 17 countries.  During the SARS outbreak, China had 5,327 cases and 349 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of confirmed cases increased to more than 7,700 worldwide by early Thursday, according to Chinese officials and the World Health Organization, with all but 68 of the infections taking place in mainland China. On Wednesday, there were about 6,000 infections worldwide.  In China, a total of 170 people have now died from the mysterious new coronavirus, according to official Chinese statistics, but the real number is likely much higher. A dearth of test kits has hindered health officials ability to accurately diagnose and track the illness.  Here’s what we know about how the disease has spread:   ◆ China said early Thursday that 38 more people had died from the virus, which is believed to have originated in the central city of Wuhan and is spreading across the country. The previous count, on Wednesday, was 132.  ◆ Tibet reported its first confirmed case. ◆ Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Hong Kong has 10; the United States, Taiwan, Australia and Macau have five each; Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; Japan has 11; France has five; Germany has four; Canada has three; Vietnam has two; and Nepal, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates each have one.  ◆ Cases recorded in Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam and Japan involved patients who had not been to China. There have been no reported deaths outside China. The 195 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, have been instructed by federal health authorities to remain for three days on the air force base in Southern California where they landed on Wednesday. The passengers on the flight, which was chartered by the State Department, will be fully evaluated during those three days, according to Christopher R. Braden, a deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control. Once cleared, the passengers will be allowed to fly home, where they will be monitored for 14 days by medical teams in their area. “We think we can do the full evaluation in three days. Some of that evaluation is taking tests and flying samples to C.D.C. in Atlanta,” Dr. Braden told a news conference in Riverside, California.   “The reason we want to do active monitoring for 14 days is to determine if they can become ill during that period,” Dr. Braden added. “That is the basic public health premise of our action.“  The flight carrying the evacuated Americans landed in Southern California, at March Air Reserve Base, shortly after 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday. The flight had stopped in Anchorage for several hours, where the passengers were checked by a team from the Centers for Disease Control.  “The whole plane erupted in cheers when the crew said, ‘Welcome home to the United States,’” said Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer. [For a coming article, The New York Times would like to hear from Americans who flew on the chartered flight from China or their family members. Please contact miriam.jordan@nytimes.com to share your story.] The evacuees — consisting mainly of consular officials and their families but also including some other Americans who were in China —  will be accommodated at the base during the three-day period. But they will not have contact with any military personnel on the base. The evacuees will undergo a battery of tests. If their results, from the lab of the Centers for Disease Control, come back negative, they will be allowed to travel onward. During a news conference, Dr. Braden was peppered with questions about the wisdom of releasing the former residents of Wuhan into communities across the country. He said that if a person deemed a danger to the community insisted on leaving before the 72-hour period expired, “we can institute an individual quarantine for that person and we will.”    Other countries that have evacuated or plan to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan include France, South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Germany, Kazakhstan, Britain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Myanmar and Australia.    Researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, say they have grown the Wuhan coronavirus in a laboratory.  Scientists in China and other researchers have managed to do so as well, officials at the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Isolating and growing viral samples is standard procedure during the outbreak of a novel pathogen, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Early on in an outbreak, you still need to understand the biology of the new organism that’s causing infections,” Dr. Hotez said. Scientists collect samples from fluids obtained from the lungs or nasal passages of infected patients. Researchers may use the lab-grown virus to test antiviral drugs or develop experimental vaccines, Dr. Hotez said. By growing the novel coronavirus in controlled conditions, researchers also may get a better understanding of why the virus seems to be transmitted more easily than the SARS coronavirus, yet so far seems to have a lower mortality rate. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are trying to grow the coronavirus from patient samples collected in the United States. Once they’ve succeeded, the agency will make samples available to infectious disease researchers through a public repository. Chinese and Australian researchers have already offered to distribute samples. Scientists are also working quickly to develop  a vaccine capable of stopping the new coronavirus. Government scientists in China, the United States and Australia, as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all engaged.  Researchers at the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center in Maryland have pinpointed the parts of the genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine. But a vaccine could take months, if not years, to develop. Three Japanese citizens who returned on a government-sponsored charter plane from Wuhan on Wednesday morning tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Japan to 11. Katsunobu Kato, the country’s Health, Labor and Welfare minister, told a session of Parliament on Thursday morning that the two men and one woman who landed in Tokyo on Wednesday had tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, 206 Japanese citizens landed at Haneda airport. All except two agreed to be tested for the virus, and 12 were sent immediately to a hospital for monitoring. The majority of the passengers — 191 — were asymptomatic but are quarantined in a hotel awaiting the results of virus tests. Of the three who tested positive, one exhibited symptoms, while two others were not yet showing symptoms. Another Japanese chartered flight from Wuhan landed on Thursday morning with 210 passengers aboard. The World Health Organization will convene a meeting of experts on Thursday in Geneva to vote again on whether to declare the coronavirus epidemic a global health emergency, officials said on Wednesday.   At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, W.H.O. officials said they were  particularly concerned about recent cases of person-to-person transmission that have been reported among people who have never been to China. On Jan. 23, when there were about 800 confirmed cases and all 25 deaths were in China, the same committee recommended that an emergency not be declared at that time. Since then, the infection has spread to people in four countries who have never been to China. Most patients infected with the virus develop mild symptoms, but about 20 percent become severely ill. The death rate seems to be 2 percent, W.H.O. officials said, though they cautioned that there are many unknown variables. “This number may change,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the W.H.O. “It’s early to put a percentage on that.” The director general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China’s response to the crisis.   “The fact that to date we have only seen 68 cases outside China and no deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary steps the government has taken to prevent the export of cases,” he said. Health officials in China alerted Germany when a Chinese woman returning from Germany developed symptoms and tested positive for the coronavirus. Because of the shared information, at least one infection in Germany was discovered. “This example is a good illustration of how China is engaging” with the W.H.O. and other countries, Dr. Tedros said.  But some Chinese social media users have strongly criticized the government’s handling of the outbreak, posting harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients.  The sheer amount of complaints — and some of the clever ways users have dodged censors, like referring to President Xi Jinping as “Trump” —  have made it difficult for the Chinese government to maintain its tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. Some international sports events have been postponed or even canceled in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The biggest casualty so far is the indoor world athletics championships in Nanjing, which were postponed by a full year on Wednesday. The international ski federation has canceled the first World Cup races planned for the mountain venue where the sport will be held during the 2022 Beijing Olympics, The Associated Press reported. The governing body of athletics said the indoor championships will now be held in March 2021 instead of March 13-15 this year. Nanjing is about 330 miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. Qualifying tournaments for this summers’ Tokyo Olympics have also been affected. Women’s soccer and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The soccer games had initially been moved from Wuhan to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. British Airways has indefinitely suspended all flights to and from China, the airline said on Wednesday, citing advice from Britain’s Foreign Office that cautioned against all nonessential travel to China. “We apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” the company said in an emailed statement. Other airlines have begun to scale back flights to China as the death toll and number of cases rises, but the British flag carrier, one of the world’s largest international airlines, is the first to cancel all its scheduled flights.  The airline, based in London, makes multiple flights a week to Beijing and Shanghai.    Air Canada said on Wednesday that it was also suspending all flights to China, from Thursday until Feb. 29. And Delta announced that it was temporarily reducing its weekly flights between the United States and China, because of declining demand. From Feb. 6 through April 30, the airline will go down to 21 weekly flights, or three to four weekly flights per route. The low-cost Indonesian carrier Lion Air and Seoul Air of South Korea also suspended all their flights to China, The Associated Press reported.  United Airlines and Air Canada said on Tuesday that they would reduce flights to China, canceling dozens of scheduled trips over the coming days and weeks because of a sudden drop in demand. Health officials in the United States have also warned against all nonessential travel to China. In Hong Kong, the authorities have reduced by half the number of flights coming into the semiautonomous region from mainland China and have also shut down rail services to the mainland. Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, has also suspended all flights to and from Wuhan through March. The new coronavirus that was first discovered in China last month is showing early signs of spreading abroad, with people who never visited China during the outbreak falling ill in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. The overseas cases highlight the ability of the mysterious disease, which is believed to have originated in wild animals, to be transmitted from one person to another, increasing its chances of spreading. “These reports are concerning, if they stand up to scrutiny, which they certainly sound credible,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. Some cases that have spread outside China appear to have been spread between family members, who are at greater risk while caring for sick relatives. Other cases, however, appear to have spread between people with different connections. In Japan, a tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two different groups from Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday. The driver had no history of traveling to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. “I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” Professor Reingold said. “That’s very concerning.” German officials said on Tuesday that a 33-year-old man from Starnberg in Bavaria was apparently infected with the coronavirus after a Jan. 21 training event with a Chinese colleague. The Chinese colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated under isolation while officials identified other people with whom he might have been in contact. Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company in Bavaria were also infected. The three were admitted to a clinic in Munich, where they were to be isolated and treated. An additional 40 people with close contact to those infected would be tested on Wednesday, officials said. Taiwan said on Tuesday that a man had become infected after his wife had contracted the virus while working in Wuhan. He became Taiwan’s eighth case and the first known to be transmitted locally. In an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday, Vietnamese physicians reported that a 65-year-old man from Wuhan appeared to have transmitted the coronavirus to his son, 27, who was living in Long An Province, southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. The father developed a fever on Jan. 17, four days after flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, from Wuhan. The son met his father on Jan. 17, and by Jan. 20 he had a dry cough and fever. The father’s condition has improved, and the son is stable, the doctors wrote. None of their 28 identified close contacts, including the father’s wife, have developed symptoms of respiratory infection, they said. With demand for surgical masks on the rise in China, a drugstore in Beijing has been fined more than $400,000 by the government for charging customers roughly six times what the masks are being sold for online. State-run media said that the store was charging customers 850 yuan, or $122, for the masks, while they were being sold online for 143 yuan. Infectious disease specialists say the disposable masks, which cover the nose and mouth, can help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently. The masks have become ubiquitous in cities across China. In Hong Kong, where the outbreak has brought back painful memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, officials said that customs authorities were examining surgical masks being sold in the city for counterfeit labeling and not meeting safety standards. In announcing the fine against the Beijing drugstore, a government notice warned that the authorities would “continue to step up enforcement and make every effort to curb the excessive and rapid rise in protective enforcement prices.”  Surgical masks have become so much in demand that a website advertising more fashionable versions of them warns that deliveries are at risk of being delayed.

"In India, Protesters and Modi Tussle Over Who Can Claim Gandhi",2020-01-30,By Maria Abi-Habib,"['NEW DELHI — The protesters who are challenging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-centric vision for India liberally evoke the legacy of a national icon: Mohandas K. Gandhi, who wanted a country where Hindus and Muslims lived together and a secular government kept the peace. So it has been galling for them to watch Mr. Modi and his allies claim Gandhi’s mantle to promote their own agenda, including the issue that set off the protests — a contentious citizenship law that critics say blatantly discriminates against Muslims. With Thursday the 72nd anniversary of Gandhi’s assassination, Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have deployed his name and image at an ever-faster clip in an information campaign meant to counter the protests and drum up support for the citizenship law. “We only implemented what the great freedom fighters had wished to do. We have done Gandhiji’s bidding,” Mr. Modi said this month in defense of the law, adding a Hindi suffix indicating respect. But the protesters say that the government’s actions are directly at odds with Gandhi’s goal of a secular, pluralistic India. [Analysis: Violence in India threatens its global ambitions.] Since his landslide re-election in May, Mr. Modi has made several bold moves that thrilled Indians who long for a Hindu state. He canceled the statehood of the predominantly Muslim territory of Kashmir, and thousands were arrested there without charge. His party championed a court ruling that allowed a Hindu temple to be built on the site of a centuries-old mosque, touching on a dangerous sectarian flash point. And now the party has pushed through the citizenship law, which favors immigrants of every major South Asian religion but Islam. Critics fear that if the law were combined with a citizenship test, Muslims could be disenfranchised, stripped of their nationality or their right to vote. “Modi invokes everything about Gandhi except Hindu-Muslim harmony, and this was the most crucial element of his work,” said Ramachandra Guha, a historian who wrote an authoritative biography of Gandhi, and who was arrested at a recent protest. “You can’t have Einstein without relativity,” Mr. Guha said. “You can’t have Darwin without evolution. And you can’t have Gandhi without Hindu-Muslim harmony.” Clashes broke out at some early protests, but more recent demonstrations have been peaceful, deliberately drawing on Gandhi’s example of nonviolent resistance. The government has responded with both force and a virulent disinformation campaign. (Officials have denied cracking down on peaceful protests, despite many images and witness accounts of violence.) In recent days, a protest camp of hundreds of women in the Shaheen Bagh neighborhood of New Delhi has come to symbolize the movement. Officials have said the women are radicals or have been paid to be there, and many believe a police crackdown is imminent. Throughout his six years in power, Mr. Modi has frequently linked himself to Gandhi’s legacy, saying he was “made of the same soil” as the champion of Indian independence. His vice president has called it “divine coincidence” that both men were born in the state of Gujarat. Mr. Modi has even used Gandhi’s signature round, wire-rimmed spectacles as a logo for his “Clean India” sanitation campaign. Mr. Modi has also drawn on Gandhi’s globally resonant image overseas as he cuts military alliances and trade deals. In October, as he wrapped up meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, he wrote an Opinion piece for The New York Times calling on the world to learn from Gandhi’s teachings. But one fact omitted by the prime minister was that Gandhi was killed by a Hindu nationalist — a man nurtured by the same hard-line ideological group that shaped Mr. Modi: the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, believed that Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims. That line is still echoed today by Mr. Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is filled with officials who revere Godse and see Gandhi as a traitor. One party official, Pragya Singh Thakur, who has repeatedly called Godse a patriot, was arrested in 2008 in connection with a mosque bombing that killed 10 people. Mr. Modi’s government dropped some of the most serious terrorism charges against her, and she was elected to Parliament in an overwhelming victory last year. “The ideology that killed him is now trying to claim him,” said Tushar Gandhi, a great-grandson of Gandhi who has supported the protests. “It’s nauseating to see them snatch my great-grandfather’s legacy, but at the same time I take pride that even a person like Modi must seek refuge in a person like my great-grandfather,” Mr. Gandhi said. Mr. Modi’s party is hardly the first Indian political group to evoke Gandhi’s image for its own gain. His portrait hangs everywhere, and most Indians proudly revere him as a model of morality and conscience. For Mr. Modi, cultivating the association helps him attract Indian voters who have traditionally been wary of his party’s sectarianism. A pamphlet recently distributed by the party, addressing what it calls “misinformation” about the citizenship law, features Gandhi’s image along with a quote from him appearing to suggest that he would have supported the law. But the quote — about India welcoming Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan — is taken out of context, and critics contend that it is actually itself misinformation. Originally, Gandhi was excoriating Hindus who questioned Muslims’ loyalty to India. When contacted, the pamphlet’s editor, a B.J.P. lawmaker named Prabhat Jha, said he had gotten the quote from the Home Ministry, which is led by Mr. Modi’s closest confidant, Amit Shah. Mr. Shah has boasted about the party’s talent for manipulating imagery and political messages, saying in one speech: “We are capable of delivering any message we want to the public, whether sweet, sour, true or fake.” The B.J.P.’s media operations have been fully mobilized against the protesters, who have been depicted as violent, “anti-national” and exclusively Muslim, even though a diverse group of Indians has participated.  In a widely circulated Twitter post, the party’s social media chief, Amit Malviya, accused some protesters of chanting “long live Pakistan,” playing on stereotypes that Indian Muslims’ true loyalty is to India’s neighbor and archrival, which was founded as an Islamic state. Mr. Malviya’s claim was debunked, but he refused to take the post down. He declined to comment. “They’ve branded them anti-nationals, a term that has caught on in last five or six years to say that anyone that is antigovernment is against the nation,” said Chitranshu Tewari, an analyst of the Indian news media. “The government wants to create that link in people’s minds, that the government and nation are one.” In some B.J.P.-controlled states where protests have taken place, the police have ransacked shops and homes belonging to Muslims, part of what one government official called an act of “revenge.” In scenes reminiscent of Gandhi’s struggle against British rule, protesters have been dragged from auto rickshaws as they arrived at demonstrations. Police officers have charged at people who were marching peacefully. The protest movement lacks the international support that gave Gandhi’s campaign strength. But demonstrators are still clinging to their cause — and to Gandhi’s methods. In Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, hundreds of women have braved the winter cold to shut down one of India’s busiest thoroughfares, sleeping on thin sheets of cardboard. They began fasting this month, to demonstrate against the citizenship law and to pay tribute to the last weeks of Gandhi’s life, when he went without food to protest the sectarian violence wracking India and Pakistan. “It’s painful to us that Gandhi was protesting against a foreign occupation power and we now need to use these tactics against our own government, an Indian government,” said Saima Khan, 33. She added that Gandhi had fought and died for an India where Muslims felt at home, an ideal that was now under threat. “When people think about India, they think about Gandhi’s India,” she said. “But this is not the India this government wants.” Kai Schultz, Hari Kumar, Sameer Yasir and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the national icon would have supported his contentious citizenship law.

The flight had stopped in Anchorage for several hours, where the passengers were checked by a team from the Centers for Disease Control.  “The whole plane erupted in cheers when the crew said, ‘Welcome home to the United States,’” said Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer. [For a coming article, The New York Times would like to hear from Americans who flew on the chartered flight from China or their family members. Please contact miriam.jordan@nytimes.com to share your story.] The evacuees — consisting mainly of consular officials and their families but also including some other Americans who were in China —  will be accommodated at the base during the three-day period. But they will not have contact with any military personnel on the base. The evacuees will undergo a battery of tests. If their results, from the lab of the Centers for Disease Control, come back negative, they will be allowed to travel onward. During a news conference, Dr. Braden was peppered with questions about the wisdom of releasing the former residents of Wuhan into communities across the country. He said that if a person deemed a danger to the community insisted on leaving before the 72-hour period expired, “we can institute an individual quarantine for that person and we will.”    Other countries that have evacuated or plan to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan include France, South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Germany, Kazakhstan, Britain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Myanmar and Australia.    Researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, say they have grown the Wuhan coronavirus in a laboratory.  Scientists in China and other researchers have managed to do so as well, officials at the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Isolating and growing viral samples is standard procedure during the outbreak of a novel pathogen, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Early on in an outbreak, you still need to understand the biology of the new organism that’s causing infections,” Dr. Hotez said. Scientists collect samples from fluids obtained from the lungs or nasal passages of infected patients. Researchers may use the lab-grown virus to test antiviral drugs or develop experimental vaccines, Dr. Hotez said. By growing the novel coronavirus in controlled conditions, researchers also may get a better understanding of why the virus seems to be transmitted more easily than the SARS coronavirus, yet so far seems to have a lower mortality rate. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are trying to grow the coronavirus from patient samples collected in the United States. Once they’ve succeeded, the agency will make samples available to infectious disease researchers through a public repository. Chinese and Australian researchers have already offered to distribute samples. Scientists are also working quickly to develop  a vaccine capable of stopping the new coronavirus. Government scientists in China, the United States and Australia, as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all engaged.  Researchers at the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center in Maryland have pinpointed the parts of the genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine. But a vaccine could take months, if not years, to develop. Three Japanese citizens who returned on a government-sponsored charter plane from Wuhan on Wednesday morning tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Japan to 11. Katsunobu Kato, the country’s Health, Labor and Welfare minister, told a session of Parliament on Thursday morning that the two men and one woman who landed in Tokyo on Wednesday had tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, 206 Japanese citizens landed at Haneda airport. All except two agreed to be tested for the virus, and 12 were sent immediately to a hospital for monitoring. The majority of the passengers — 191 — were asymptomatic but are quarantined in a hotel awaiting the results of virus tests. Of the three who tested positive, one exhibited symptoms, while two others were not yet showing symptoms. Another Japanese chartered flight from Wuhan landed on Thursday morning with 210 passengers aboard. The World Health Organization will convene a meeting of experts on Thursday in Geneva to vote again on whether to declare the coronavirus epidemic a global health emergency, officials said on Wednesday.   At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, W.H.O. officials said they were  particularly concerned about recent cases of person-to-person transmission that have been reported among people who have never been to China. On Jan. 23, when there were about 800 confirmed cases and all 25 deaths were in China, the same committee recommended that an emergency not be declared at that time. Since then, the infection has spread to people in four countries who have never been to China. Most patients infected with the virus develop mild symptoms, but about 20 percent become severely ill. The death rate seems to be 2 percent, W.H.O. officials said, though they cautioned that there are many unknown variables. “This number may change,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the W.H.O. “It’s early to put a percentage on that.” The director general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China’s response to the crisis.   “The fact that to date we have only seen 68 cases outside China and no deaths is due in no small part to the extraordinary steps the government has taken to prevent the export of cases,” he said. Health officials in China alerted Germany when a Chinese woman returning from Germany developed symptoms and tested positive for the coronavirus. Because of the shared information, at least one infection in Germany was discovered. “This example is a good illustration of how China is engaging” with the W.H.O. and other countries, Dr. Tedros said.  But some Chinese social media users have strongly criticized the government’s handling of the outbreak, posting harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients.  The sheer amount of complaints — and some of the clever ways users have dodged censors, like referring to President Xi Jinping as “Trump” —  have made it difficult for the Chinese government to maintain its tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. Some international sports events have been postponed or even canceled in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The biggest casualty so far is the indoor world athletics championships in Nanjing, which were postponed by a full year on Wednesday. The international ski federation has canceled the first World Cup races planned for the mountain venue where the sport will be held during the 2022 Beijing Olympics, The Associated Press reported. The governing body of athletics said the indoor championships will now be held in March 2021 instead of March 13-15 this year. Nanjing is about 330 miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. Qualifying tournaments for this summers’ Tokyo Olympics have also been affected. Women’s soccer and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The soccer games had initially been moved from Wuhan to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. British Airways has indefinitely suspended all flights to and from China, the airline said on Wednesday, citing advice from Britain’s Foreign Office that cautioned against all nonessential travel to China. “We apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” the company said in an emailed statement. Other airlines have begun to scale back flights to China as the death toll and number of cases rises, but the British flag carrier, one of the world’s largest international airlines, is the first to cancel all its scheduled flights.  The airline, based in London, makes multiple flights a week to Beijing and Shanghai.    Air Canada said on Wednesday that it was also suspending all flights to China, from Thursday until Feb. 29. And Delta announced that it was temporarily reducing its weekly flights between the United States and China, because of declining demand. From Feb. 6 through April 30, the airline will go down to 21 weekly flights, or three to four weekly flights per route. The low-cost Indonesian carrier Lion Air and Seoul Air of South Korea also suspended all their flights to China, The Associated Press reported.  United Airlines and Air Canada said on Tuesday that they would reduce flights to China, canceling dozens of scheduled trips over the coming days and weeks because of a sudden drop in demand. Health officials in the United States have also warned against all nonessential travel to China. In Hong Kong, the authorities have reduced by half the number of flights coming into the semiautonomous region from mainland China and have also shut down rail services to the mainland. Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, has also suspended all flights to and from Wuhan through March. The new coronavirus that was first discovered in China last month is showing early signs of spreading abroad, with people who never visited China during the outbreak falling ill in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. The overseas cases highlight the ability of the mysterious disease, which is believed to have originated in wild animals, to be transmitted from one person to another, increasing its chances of spreading. “These reports are concerning, if they stand up to scrutiny, which they certainly sound credible,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. Some cases that have spread outside China appear to have been spread between family members, who are at greater risk while caring for sick relatives. Other cases, however, appear to have spread between people with different connections. In Japan, a tour bus driver in his 60s who had driven two different groups from Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday. The driver had no history of traveling to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. “I think what that says is, if we can get transmission in such a setting, then we can certainly get it in the waiting room of a clinic or a hospital,” Professor Reingold said. “That’s very concerning.” German officials said on Tuesday that a 33-year-old man from Starnberg in Bavaria was apparently infected with the coronavirus after a Jan. 21 training event with a Chinese colleague. The Chinese colleague flew home two days later. The German man was being treated under isolation while officials identified other people with whom he might have been in contact. Late Tuesday, health officials in Germany said three more people from the same company in Bavaria were also infected. The three were admitted to a clinic in Munich, where they were to be isolated and treated. An additional 40 people with close contact to those infected would be tested on Wednesday, officials said. Taiwan said on Tuesday that a man had become infected after his wife had contracted the virus while working in Wuhan. He became Taiwan’s eighth case and the first known to be transmitted locally. In an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday, Vietnamese physicians reported that a 65-year-old man from Wuhan appeared to have transmitted the coronavirus to his son, 27, who was living in Long An Province, southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. The father developed a fever on Jan. 17, four days after flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, from Wuhan. The son met his father on Jan. 17, and by Jan. 20 he had a dry cough and fever. The father’s condition has improved, and the son is stable, the doctors wrote. None of their 28 identified close contacts, including the father’s wife, have developed symptoms of respiratory infection, they said. With demand for surgical masks on the rise in China, a drugstore in Beijing has been fined more than $400,000 by the government for charging customers roughly six times what the masks are being sold for online. State-run media said that the store was charging customers 850 yuan, or $122, for the masks, while they were being sold online for 143 yuan. Infectious disease specialists say the disposable masks, which cover the nose and mouth, can help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently. The masks have become ubiquitous in cities across China. In Hong Kong, where the outbreak has brought back painful memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, officials said that customs authorities were examining surgical masks being sold in the city for counterfeit labeling and not meeting safety standards. In announcing the fine against the Beijing drugstore, a government notice warned that the authorities would “continue to step up enforcement and make every effort to curb the excessive and rapid rise in protective enforcement prices.”  Surgical masks have become so much in demand that a website advertising more fashionable versions of them warns that deliveries are at risk of being delayed.

What’s Next for Britons Who Lost the Brexit Battle,2020-01-31,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — They marched by the hundreds of thousands to stop Brexit. They mourned when Prime Minister Boris Johnson walloped their side in the latest election. And now, on the precipice of Brexit, ardent pro-European Britons, who by some measures outnumber those favoring Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, are looking for new outlets for their rage — something, anything, to keep from staring into the abyss of a generation-long exile from the bloc. “I don’t know what to do anymore,” said Tanya Luker, standing in the corner of the Coach & Horses pub in central London this week. “We’re just like a group of unhappy people that don’t know what to do.” On Friday, Brexit will pass from the realm of left-wing nightmare to reality. And Britain’s Remainers, who fought for years to stay in the European Union, are reckoning with how to keep afloat a movement that may not get another chance to reverse Brexit for 30 or 40 years. After going for broke last year with a strategy of trying to undo the withdrawal, they are rallying their weary, despairing supporters for hugely consequential battles ahead over the shape of Brexit, leaning on lawmakers to preserve smooth trading ties with Europe so British workers can keep their jobs. They are agitating on behalf of Europeans living in Britain who have been refused long-term permission to stay. And they are trying to deny Mr. Johnson his wish of stashing Brexit on the business pages of the newspapers, arguing instead that now is the very moment when the threat of brutal factory closures and migrant crackdowns needs to be forced on to the front pages. “For three years, we’ve been in a phony war,” said Naomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, one of the biggest remaining anti-Brexit campaign groups. “Nobody really felt any of the actual effects of it, because we hadn’t yet had to look at border checks, we hadn’t had to consider what happens to our right to live, work, study and love in another country.” In many Britons’ eyes, it was remarkable that pro-European Britons mounted a serious fight to overturn Brexit at all. In converting scores of British lawmakers, campaigners turned stopping Brexit from a fringe cause into the largest pro-Europe movement on the Continent. Enough people changed sides that in many opinion polls before the general election in December, Remainers narrowly beat out the Leavers favoring withdrawal from the bloc. And in the general election, parties that favored rerunning the Brexit referendum won more than half the votes. But the Remain vote splintered into competing parties, consigning the anti-Brexit side to a historically awful defeat to Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party. What followed was a long Christmastime stupor. “It’s the end of everything you fought for for years, and the end of your vision of Britain for many people as a country they thought of as open and international and rational,” said Ian Dunt, a pro-Remain writer whose book, “How to be a Liberal,” will be released this year. “You obviously get a sense of detachment from your country.” But the approaching date of Britain’s departure, on Friday, seems to have shaken many people from their daze. In their rage at the government’s migration plans, and their desperation not to sink into years of despair, they said they were looking to the way left-wing voters in the United States reacted to President Trump’s win in 2016. “In the U.S., we’ve seen mass mobilization in defense of migrants, Abolish ICE protests,” said Ana Oppenheim, an organizer for Another Europe is Possible, a leftist anti-Brexit group. “This is something we have to do here. We can’t let the energy dissipate in a situation where our rights and our freedoms are under threat.” On university campuses, organizers are advising Europeans about how to apply for permission to stay in Britain, said Eve Alcock, president of the University of Bath students’ union. Pro-Remain groups are now asking Conservative members of Parliament to keep their party from pursuing a sharp split from the European Union, arguing that it would only hurt the blue-collar workers who helped put them in Parliament. And political operatives are making plans to pounce when Mr. Johnson finally turns his party’s aspirations for Brexit into the hard reality of a plan. If he tries to preserve close ties with Europe, Mr. Johnson could infuriate hard-line, pro-Brexit voters. But cutting the European Union adrift carries its own risks, especially in ex-Labour heartland seats that are home to automobile or aerospace industry workers who stand to suffer if the bloc responds with trade barriers, as its leaders have promised. “More than three years on, they still have not defined Brexit,” said Tom Baldwin, who helped run the People’s Vote, the umbrella group that organized marches for a second Brexit referendum. “I’m not sure he knows which ones yet, but Boris Johnson will inevitably betray more people, more promises, and his opponents have a duty to expose that.” Not that anyone thinks rejoining the European Union is in the cards, at least in the next decade.  Nor do pro-Europeans have access to the same well-funded, data-rich organizations that helped set up the largest rallies last year. People’s Vote split into warring camps in October, with one side trying to turn it into an avowedly pro-Remain organization and the other trying to keep recruiting a broader range of lawmakers. Another challenge for pro-Europeans in Britain is that, unlike with anti-Trump voters in the United States, there is more than one party competing for their votes, said Denise Baron, a political researcher who has worked for campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic. While Democrats alone benefited from the swell of anti-Trump sentiment in the 2018 midterm elections, many pro-European voters are waiting for the results of the Labour leadership race this year to decide whether to make that the vessel for their opposition to Mr. Johnson or turn to another party. And in Britain’s political system, which gives a government with Mr. Johnson’s majority almost total control over what does or does not pass, opposition is a lonely place. Of all the opposition’s battles ahead, perhaps none has attracted as much concern as the roughly 3.4 million European Union citizens in Britain, some of whom are struggling to secure long-term residency rights and are anxious about being denied housing or jobs.  Tanja Bueltmann, a professor of migration at Northumbria University, said that while the attention was welcome, pro-European campaigners were coming belatedly to the cause, given that the window for easing the process of applying for so-called “settled status” had closed. Still, some groups that have long been agitating for European citizens, like the3million, have already launched legal action to fight for their voting and privacy rights. At the Coach & Horses pub, where the3million was hosting a pub crawl, Ms. Luker and her husband, Trevor Luker, who met while working in Frankfurt, said they would wake up Saturday in a different country from the one they had chosen to make their home in. “Most of my life, I’ve been able to move freely throughout Europe,” Mr. Luker said. “All of a sudden, that’s no longer an option. That freedom to pick up sticks is gone.” The European trading office of Mr. Luker’s financial services firm had already moved to Brussels. With changes like that starting to affect more people, Ms. Luker, a Finnish-American, said she hoped protests to limit the damage of Brexit might catch on. As people filled the pub, among them a group of pro-Remain Britons who were nevertheless making fun of the Europeans there, Mr. Luker bemoaned the decades of upheaval ahead. “We might have a hangover tomorrow,” he said, “but the country will have one for the next 20 years.”']","Having bet it all on stopping Brexit and lost, Remainers now look to keeping Britain as close to the European Union as possible."
"Amid Trump’s Trial, Pompeo Visited Ukraine. Here’s How It Went.",2020-01-31,By Edward Wong,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that the Trump administration was committed to supporting Ukraine in its defense against aggression by Russia, which invaded and annexed part of the country and is supporting a separatist insurgency. “Today I’m here with a clear message: The United States sees that the Ukrainian struggle for freedom, democracy and prosperity is a valiant one,” Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference after meeting with Ukraine’s leader in Kyiv. “Our commitment to support it will not waver.” Ukraine is a “bulwark between freedom and authoritarianism in Eastern Europe,” Mr. Pompeo added. His visit, in which he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, was aimed at calming unease among Ukrainian officials about the relationship between Washington and Kyiv, which has been thrust into the spotlight because of the impeachment of Mr. Trump, based on charges of abuse of power and obstruction over the president’s actions on Ukraine. Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Zelensky met before noon in the president’s office in central Kyiv, and the Ukrainian leader said they had talked about new steps to strengthen the partnership between the two nations. “I don’t think these friendly and warm relations have been influenced by the impeachment trial of the president,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news conference with Mr. Pompeo when asked whether Mr. Trump’s impeachment had affected ties between Kyiv and Washington. While the two officials offered reassurances that relations were strong, Mr. Pompeo did not give Mr. Zelensky one thing he has sought since his election in April: an invitation to meet President Trump at the White House, which would be an important signal to Russia of American support for Ukraine. Mr. Pompeo’s message that Mr. Trump was not ready to receive Mr. Zelensky at the White House was a blow to the Ukrainian president’s national security efforts. Evidence that Mr. Trump had earlier demanded, in return for such a visit, that Ukraine announce the start of an investigation that could benefit him became an important part of the impeachment inquiry. In response to a question on Friday, Mr. Pompeo said a White House visit by Mr. Zelensky was not dependent on the kind of investigation Mr. Trump had sought. Ukrainian officials are angry that the Americans have granted Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, two visits with Mr. Trump in White House, most recently in December. In renewing his request for a meeting Friday, Mr. Zelensky said, “If we have an important subject for this conversation other than strategy and tactics, but important things we can negotiate over, something to sign and that I can bring back, then I am ready to go tomorrow!” Mr. Pompeo was the first official from Mr. Trump’s cabinet to meet with Mr. Zelensky since the impeachment inquiry began last fall. Mr. Trump met briefly with the Ukrainian leader on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York — the day after Democrats in the House of Representatives announced the opening of the inquiry. The Democrats’ move was prompted by a formal complaint filed by a C.I.A. whistle-blower who said that Mr. Trump had pressed Mr. Zelensky in a July 25 call for political favors at the same time he was withholding from Ukraine $391 million of military aid mandated by Congress. The impeachment trial in the Senate began this month but appeared as of early Friday to be moving to a swift close. The military aid from Washington, which the White House released on Sept. 11, after Mr. Trump heard about the formal whistle-blower complaint, is aimed at helping Ukrainian soldiers fight a yearslong Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine and other European nations want the Trump administration to get involved in talks with leaders in Kyiv and Moscow to help settle the conflict. Analysts say that Mr. Trump’s actions on Ukraine — which critics say centered on gaining political advantage for his re-election campaign this year — and his open admiration of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have weakened decades of American support for Ukraine. Mr. Trump and his aides deny that he withheld the aid for political reasons, and say they were asking that Ukraine conduct legitimate investigations into corruption. And Mr. Pompeo said on Friday that “the United States under President Trump has been the world’s fiercest defender of Ukraine’s sovereignty.” Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center in Kyiv, a research group, welcomed the move by Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Zelensky to reaffirm American aid for Ukraine, including military support, but said there were still major concerns. “At the same time, we feel that Ukraine has become toxic in Washington, and there is a lack of new initiatives toward Ukraine,” she said. “There’s also a lack of U.S. support and U.S. involvement in peace negotiations with Russia.” On Friday morning, as snow fell lightly in Kyiv, Mr. Pompeo met with Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s foreign minister, and went to the golden-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral downtown to attend a wreath-laying ceremony for the soldiers who have died fighting in the Donbas. In the evening, Mr. Pompeo visited wounded soldiers at a hospital. More than 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed since the war began in 2014, the same year Russia invaded and occupied the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea. The conflict has become grinding trench warfare in open fields with regular shelling. The Ukraine trip is a fraught one for Mr. Pompeo, who arrived on Thursday night after a stop in London and plans to travel afterward to three more nations that became independent from Moscow. Mr. Pompeo has been dogged by sharp questions over his role in the Ukraine affair and, more recently, an acid comment he made about Ukraine in a Jan. 24 conversation with a National Public Radio reporter. The reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, a veteran national security correspondent, said that after she asked about Ukraine, Mr. Pompeo shouted at her and asked her to locate Ukraine on an unmarked map. She added that, using the “f-word,” he asked, “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” Mr. Pompeo enabled Mr. Trump’s actions on Ukraine by ordering the recall of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the respected ambassador to Ukraine, last April. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and associates with Ukraine business ties had been pressing the president hard for the ouster of the ambassador, who had been an anticorruption advocate. Mr. Trump’s main demand of Mr. Zelensky had been that he announce investigations into Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, who had been on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence that the older Mr. Biden acted inappropriately on Ukraine policy because of his son’s corporate ties. On several occasions, Mr. Pompeo, an ardent Trump loyalist, has reiterated Mr. Trump’s conspiratorial assertions about Ukraine, the Bidens and questions of interference in the 2016 presidential election — assertions that have been discredited and have angered the Ukrainians. “As secretary of state and C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo had every opportunity to put his mark on Russia and Ukraine policy,” said Andrew S. Weiss, a former American official who worked on Russia and Ukraine and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “But at nearly every turn he focused instead on the audience of one — Donald Trump.” “That’s why he turned a blind eye when Trump and cronies like Rudy Giuliani decided to totally dismantle the Ukraine policy framework that has been in place since 1991 and, knowingly or unknowingly, did a huge solid for the Kremlin,” he added. “Making a short pit stop in Kyiv hardly begins to undo the damage that has been wrought.” Mr. Pompeo canceled planned trips to Ukraine twice — once in November and once at the start of January. William B. Taylor Jr., the veteran diplomat whom Mr. Pompeo appointed to be chief of mission after Ms. Yovanovitch was forced out, wrote a Jan. 26 opinion piece for The New York Times in which he tried to address Mr. Pompeo’s angry, dismissive question to NPR about Ukraine. “Russia is fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, Europe and the United States,” Mr. Taylor wrote. “This war has many components: armed military aggression, energy supply, cyberattacks, disinformation and election interference. On each of these battlegrounds, Ukraine is the front line.” In an interview in Kyiv with ABC News, Mr. Pompeo said he “absolutely” wanted the Ukrainians to get the military aid and did not deny that he had argued to the president to lift the hold on aid, as The New York Times reported. But he also said Mr. Trump wanted to ensure that “resources get to the right place,” and Mr. Pompeo would help “deliver for him.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Lara Jakes from Washington.']","The secretary of state met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, during the impeachment trial of President Trump over a pressure campaign against Ukraine."

The reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, a veteran national security correspondent, said that after she asked about Ukraine, Mr. Pompeo shouted at her and asked her to locate Ukraine on an unmarked map. She added that, using the “f-word,” he asked, “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” Mr. Pompeo enabled Mr. Trump’s actions on Ukraine by ordering the recall of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the respected ambassador to Ukraine, last April. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and associates with Ukraine business ties had been pressing the president hard for the ouster of the ambassador, who had been an anticorruption advocate. Mr. Trump’s main demand of Mr. Zelensky had been that he announce investigations into Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, who had been on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence that the older Mr. Biden acted inappropriately on Ukraine policy because of his son’s corporate ties. On several occasions, Mr. Pompeo, an ardent Trump loyalist, has reiterated Mr. Trump’s conspiratorial assertions about Ukraine, the Bidens and questions of interference in the 2016 presidential election — assertions that have been discredited and have angered the Ukrainians. “As secretary of state and C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo had every opportunity to put his mark on Russia and Ukraine policy,” said Andrew S. Weiss, a former American official who worked on Russia and Ukraine and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “But at nearly every turn he focused instead on the audience of one — Donald Trump.” “That’s why he turned a blind eye when Trump and cronies like Rudy Giuliani decided to totally dismantle the Ukraine policy framework that has been in place since 1991 and, knowingly or unknowingly, did a huge solid for the Kremlin,” he added. “Making a short pit stop in Kyiv hardly begins to undo the damage that has been wrought.” Mr. Pompeo canceled planned trips to Ukraine twice — once in November and once at the start of January. William B. Taylor Jr., the veteran diplomat whom Mr. Pompeo appointed to be chief of mission after Ms. Yovanovitch was forced out, wrote a Jan. 26 opinion piece for The New York Times in which he tried to address Mr. Pompeo’s angry, dismissive question to NPR about Ukraine. “Russia is fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, Europe and the United States,” Mr. Taylor wrote. “This war has many components: armed military aggression, energy supply, cyberattacks, disinformation and election interference. On each of these battlegrounds, Ukraine is the front line.” In an interview in Kyiv with ABC News, Mr. Pompeo said he “absolutely” wanted the Ukrainians to get the military aid and did not deny that he had argued to the president to lift the hold on aid, as The New York Times reported. But he also said Mr. Trump wanted to ensure that “resources get to the right place,” and Mr. Pompeo would help “deliver for him.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Lara Jakes from Washington.']","The secretary of state met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, during the impeachment trial of President Trump over a pressure campaign against Ukraine."
The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in February,2020-01-31,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘Horse Girl’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Debuting on Netflix just a couple of weeks after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, “Horse Girl” is a gearshift for the director Jeff Baena, who’s known more for comedies like the absurdist “I Heart Huckabees,” which he co-wrote, and “The Little Hours,” which turned two stories from “The Decameron” into an anachronistic romp about 14th-century nuns. Here, Baena tries his hand at the psychological thriller, co-written by Alison Brie, who stars as a homely loner who tends to her horse when she’s not logging time as a clerk at an arts and crafts store. Her life takes a drastic turn, however, when she starts experiencing strange visions and suspects she’s being manipulated by an alien species. ‘Road to Roma’ Starts streaming: Feb. 11 For last year’s Oscars, Netflix bet big on “Roma,” Alfonso Cuarón’s critically lauded, semi-autobiographical drama about an upper-middle-class family in early 1970s Mexico City and the poor live-in housekeeper who helped raise their children and keep the chaos at bay. While the film failed to win the streaming service its first Best Picture prize, Netflix’s investment in the film continues to unfurl with “Road to Roma,” a feature-length making-of documentary that’s more in-depth than a typical behind-the-scenes supplement. Cuarón shares memories of his childhood and how his production team brought them to life in such sumptuous detail. ‘To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You’ Starts streaming: Feb. 12 With major studios mostly shunning romantic comedies in recent years, Netflix has made them a key niche in its production arsenal, but few have had a bigger impact on the culture than “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” a Y.A. adaptation about a high-school junior with a thing for secret love letters. “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” is the first of two quickie sequels coming to the streaming service, which means the happily-ever-after ending of the original will have to unravel. As Lara Jean (Lana Condor) settles in with her popular new boyfriend (Noah Centineo), the handsome recipient (Jordan Fisher) of an older love letter comes into the picture. Whom will she choose? Get your “Team” hashtags ready. ‘A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon’ Starts streaming: Feb. 14 The lovable simpleton Shaun the Sheep has existed as far back as Nick Park’s Wallace & Gromit short “A Close Shave” in 1995, but in the gallery of Aardman Animations characters, he tended to appeal to the younger set on his own TV series and movie. Yet the 2015 “Shaun the Sheep Movie” had more of an all-ages appeal than expected, and the sequel, “A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,” looks to take the flock leader on an even darker adventure — or at least dark by Aardman standards. Already released to wide acclaim in Britain, “Farmageddon” has Shaun befriending an alien that crash-lands near Mossy Bottom Farm and must find its way home before humans capture him in the name of science. ‘System Crasher’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 Picked up by Netflix after its debut at the Berlin Film Festival, the German drama “System Crasher” is a polarizing film about how best to deal with children whose behavior is so antisocial that the system doesn’t know where to place them. Helena Zengel stars as a 9-year-old whose verbal and physical outbursts make her a danger to other children and an undesirable prospect for foster care, but her welfare caseworker (Gabriela Maria Schmeide) is determined to turn her fortunes around. To that end, the girl spends time with a rough-hewn school escort (Albrecht Schuch) who believes that patience and emotional support will have a greater and more lasting impact than medication. ‘All the Bright Places’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 It’s taken a few years and one false start to produce a screen adaptation of “All the Bright Places,” Jennifer Niven’s widely admired Y.A. novel about two emotionally complicated teenagers who fall in love in small-town Indiana. Now that it’s finally here, the film seems likely to spark a conversation about how these adolescents handle the threat of severe mental illness. Elle Fanning stars as a popular girl whose troubled past informs an emotional connection with a bipolar outcast (Justice Smith) whose isolation from his classmates and family stoke his suicidal tendencies. ‘The Pharmacist’ Starts streaming: Feb. 5 Arriving closely on the heels of “Don’t F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,” which was a minor sensation for Netflix two months ago, the documentary series “The Pharmacist” turns again to a remarkable real-life story of amateur sleuthing. The Louisiana pharmacist Dan Schneider turned himself into a gumshoe after the police lost interest in solving his son’s death in a drug-related shooting. His obsession led him to uncover a larger and more complicated case of opioid abuse that was happening under his nose, as young people in his pharmacy were filling OxyContin prescriptions at an alarming rate. ‘Locke & Key’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Perhaps the network’s most ambitious horror series since “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Locke & Key” adapts Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez’s graphic novel about another creepy old mansion with a supernatural aura, only this one acts more like a portal to other dimensions. Jackson Robert Scott, Connor Jessup and Emilia Jones star as siblings who move to their ancestral home in Massachusetts after their father’s murder. Once there, they find it littered with magical keys to rooms that give them access to great and horrifying power. The showrunner here is Carlton Cuse, whose years in charge of “Lost” suggests he knows a thing or two about how to manage a puzzle-box premise. ‘My Holo Love’ Starts streaming: Feb. 7 Can a human and an A.I. fall in love? The Korean sci-fi/romance series “My Holo Love” isn’t the first fiction to ask this question — in many respects, the premise recalls Joaquin Phoenix’s fling with an operating system in “Her” — but there are some distinctive twists this time around. Ko Sung-hee stars as an anonymous P.R. functionary at an eyewear company called Prism, which is experimenting with a pair of glasses that will assist in summoning a realistic holographic companion. She falls in love with the kind “Holo,” but her feelings are complicated by the revelation that he’s been modeled off a flesh-and-blood human at the company. ‘Better Call Saul: Season 4’ Starts streaming: Feb. 9 When it was first proposed, the “Breaking Bad” spinoff “Better Call Saul” sounded like a comedy, following the misadventures of Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), a strip-mall attorney of questionable ethics, as he represents the sleaziest clients in the greater Albuquerque area. But over four seasons and counting — the fifth of six seasons premieres on AMC later this month — the show has proved to be a heartbreaking tale about a well-meaning man who goes down the slippery slope of corner-cutting and clever scams. His slow transformation reaches a tipping point in Season 4 and threatens to consume his best friend and partner Kim (Rhea Seehorn), too. ‘Narcos: Mexico: Season 2’ Starts streaming: Feb. 13 When “Narcos” first started on Netflix, it was about the hunt for Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug kingpin who spent decades building the Cali Cartel before being gunned down in the early 1990s. Yet that story was enough to cover only two seasons. “Narcos” has since evolved into more of a docudrama format for telling other pocket histories of the drug trade, so the casts and locales can be changed out. The second season of “Narcos: Mexico” continues to explore the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in the ’80s, with Diego Luna returning as the sinister Félix Gallardo and Michael Peña as a D.E.A. agent assigned to stop him. ‘The Chef Show: Volume 3’ Starts streaming: Feb. 19 When he’s not spearheading mega-franchises across the Disney empire, Jon Favreau indulges a passion for food and friendship, first evident from his early 2000s IFC conversation show “Dinner for Five.” The amiable Netflix series “The Chef Show” pairs him with the Korean-American cook Roy Choi, his adviser on the modest 2014 indie film “Chef,” and the two of them now spend every season of “The Chef Show” showcasing innovative dishes and chatting up celebrity guests. Wolfgang Puck and the director Sam Raimi pull up a chair in the third season, along with the owners of eateries like Sprinkles Cupcakes, Pizzana and Wexler’s Deli. ‘Puerta 7’ Starts streaming: Feb. 21 The bilingual American playwright and screenwriter Martin Zimmerman has been in the writers room for Netflix hits like “Narcos” and “Ozark,” and now he’s gone to Argentina to create his own original show about the drug-related violence. Written by Patricio Vega, “Puerta 7” looks into the notorious Argentinean soccer hooligans known as “barra brava,” who organize in support of various teams, but also represent a constant threat of rioting and other forms of violence in the stands. Among other subplots, the show focuses on a woman (Dolores Fonzi) who takes control of a soccer club and tries to purge the fan base of its criminal elements. ‘I Am Not Okay With This’ Starts streaming: Feb. 26 After Netflix turned his graphic novel “The End of the F***ing World” into an acclaimed two-season run, the streaming service is back in the Charles Forsman business with the series “I Am Not Okay With This,” which mixes a supernatural twist with a similar dark irreverence. Sophia Lillis stars as a 15-year-old who’s dealing with the usual trials of a high-school freshman, like complicated friendships and budding sexual interests. The one major wrinkle is that she’s also gifted/cursed with superhero powers that she doesn’t understand and hasn’t yet learned to control. ‘Restaurants on the Edge’ Starts streaming: Feb. 28 Remember “Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares,” the Channel 4 reality series in which the tempestuous British chef Gordon Ramsay screamed and bullied his way into revitalizing various failing restaurants? The new series “Restaurants on the Edge” attempts a positive spin on the same concept, following the chef Dennis Prescott, the designer Karin Bohn and the restaurateur Nick Liberato as they try to use a lighter touch in realizing the potential of struggling eateries. The twist of this 13-episode series is that all the restaurants are set against startlingly beautiful locales, including the beaches of Hawaii and the “cottage country” of Muskoka, Canada. Also of interest: “Frost/Nixon” (Feb. 1), “Gone With the Wind” (Feb. 1), “You’ve Got Mail” (Feb. 1), “Public Enemies” (Feb. 5), “Who Killed Malcolm X?” (Feb. 7), “Isi & Ossi” (Feb. 14), “The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia” (Feb. 17), “Gentefied” (Feb. 21), “Arrival” (Feb. 26), “Queen Sono” (Feb. 28).']",New additions include “Road to Roma” and “Better Call Saul: Season 4.”

"As Virus Spreads, U.S. Temporarily Bars Foreigners Who’ve Visited China",2020-01-31,,"['[This briefing has ended. Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.] The Trump administration is imposing temporary travel restrictions that bar entry into the United States by any foreign national who has traveled to China in the past 14 days, officials said Friday. The restrictions, a reaction to the coronavirus that has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, will be put into place at 5 p.m. on Sunday. The United States on Friday also declared the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 12,000 people and has spread to the United States and other countries, a public health emergency. Friday’s action exempts immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents. In addition, officials said, any United States citizen returning home who has been in the Hubei province of China within the past 14 days will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei. Those who have been to other parts of China within the past 14 days will be subject to “proactive entry screening” and up to 14 days of monitoring and self quarantine. The United States will also funnel all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy Airport, Chicago’s O’Hare and San Francisco International Airport. The travel restrictions were announced Friday by Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, who declared that the coronavirus posed “a public health emergency in the United States.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the actions were being taken because there were “a lot of unknowns” surrounding the virus and its transmission path. “The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,” Dr. Fauci said. The broadening outbreak has roiled stock markets and raised alarms about possible harm to global economic growth. The S&P 500 suffered its sharpest decline of the year on Friday after major airlines in the United States said they would cancel flights to and from mainland China. It was the worst daily decline since October, and pushed the markets into negative territory for the year. The cancellations by Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines were the latest example of economic disruption wrought by the coronavirus, just as the global economy had begun to recover from the trade war tensions that dominated 2019. Companies have restricted travel to the region, shut stores in China and warned of the possible financial impact. Economists seem certain that the travel shutdowns, factory closures and quarantines in mainland China will dampen economic activity there, but have said it is too soon to know the impact elsewhere. “It is a wild card — I think even the experts would confirm that it’s too soon to tell,” said Richard Clarida, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, during an interview on Friday on Bloomberg Television. The Fed is “monitoring closely,” he said. Concerns about global growth sent oil prices down below $52 a barrel. That pushed shares of energy companies down: Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropped by roughly 4 percent. Tech stocks also suffered, with particular weakness in the semiconductor sector, which is closely linked to supply chains based in and around China. Economists have only begun to sketch out estimates on the potential effects of the outbreak. Many have taken comfort from the economic record of the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 and 2003, which suggests that any downturn might be limited in scope. SARS coincided with a relatively brief slowdown of global growth in early 2003, that was followed by a sharp rebound. SARS, however, is an imperfect comparison. Some economists have suggested the ripple effects could be larger this time. At the time of the SARS outbreak, China represented just 5 percent of the global economy. In 2019, that number was 18 percent, according to JPMorgan economists. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines all said on Friday that they were suspending all service to mainland China as concerns about the coronavirus spread internationally. American said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China immediately through March 27. American and United will continue flights to Hong Kong. Delta and United said they would suspend service starting on Feb. 6. United said it expected to resume operations on March 28. Delta, which does not fly to Hong Kong, said it would suspend service through April 30. Delta said in a statement that its last flight to mainland China from the United States would depart on Monday, and that its last flight to the United States from mainland China would leave on Wednesday. Delta was the first American airline to completely suspend service to China because of the virus. United Airlines had already reduced its service to the country this week. Share prices in all three airlines had fallen by midday. Airlines outside the United States are also clamping down on travel. In Rwanda and Kenya, RwandAir and Kenya Airways said they would cancel all flights to and from Guangzhou, the southern Chinese metropolis, until further notice. There have been no confirmed cases in Africa. Poland’s national airline, LOT Polish Airlines, has suspended flights to China until Feb. 9, a deputy prime minister said on Twitter. More than a dozen people suspected of having the coronavirus are hospitalized in Poland, and over 500 people are being monitored by health services. Iran has suspended all flights to China because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters. Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported on Friday that all flights from China to the Islamic Republic have also been banned. Several Canadian companies have suspended employee travel to China after Air Canada’s decision on Wednesday to suspend service to Shanghai and Beijing. The Montreal-based carrier normally operates 33 flights a week to and from the two Chinese cities. The United States government has imposed a federal quarantine on 195 people who were evacuated on Wednesday from Wuhan, China, to a California military base, officials said on Friday. The group will be held at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., for 14 days, to ensure that they are not infected with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 9,800 people in China and killed more than 200 people. Chinese officials on Saturday reported the highest death toll so far in a 24-hour period. ◆ The 46 new deaths in China raised the toll to 259. ◆ About 2,100 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 12,000, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 100 cases have been confirmed in 21 other countries. ◆ All of China’s provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak. ◆  Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland. ◆ Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China. ◆ No deaths have been reported outside China. A call has been issued for classes to be canceled at Arizona State University. Basketball games were postponed at Miami University in Ohio. And at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, two students from Wuhan were moved to a special dorm. On college campuses across the United States, the global alarm over coronavirus is particularly intense. Hundreds of students are being screened for the virus. Suspected cases at many colleges — Baylor, Wesleyan and Tennessee Tech — have turned out to be false alarms, but the anxiety continues. At A.S.U., where there is one confirmed case of coronavirus, a cough in the back of a classroom now brings nervous glances. Students who had planned to study abroad this semester are furiously adjusting schedules. Carolyn Kleve, 20, a junior at Arizona State who is 13 weeks pregnant, is afraid. “We’re trapped in a room of 20 to 30 people and I don’t know who has what illness,” Ms. Kleve said of her classes. “Have I already come into contact with it? Who knows?” A high-ranking Chinese official said on Friday that he felt responsible for the spread of the coronavirus, offering his most direct expression of responsibility for the crisis. Many residents and experts have said that the reluctance by the government in Wuhan to warn the public about the spreading disease created dangerous complacency. “Above all, I feel guilty and remorseful and I reproach myself,” said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party secretary of Wuhan. “I’ve been constantly thinking that if I’d made the decision earlier to take the kind of strict controls we have in place now, the outcome would have been much better than now.” Mr. Ma was asked about his feelings in an interview on China’s main television network, CCTV. Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who is less powerful than Mr. Ma, said the government’s own laws hindered faster public disclosure. The State Department on Thursday night issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the dangerous new coronavirus. The department set the new advisory at Level 4, or red — its highest alert, reserved for the most perilous situations. “Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the State Department said. “Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.” A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, called the advisory an unfriendly act at a difficult time for China. “True feeling shines through in hardship,” Ms. Hua said on Friday. “Many countries have shown their support and help for China’s fight against the epidemic. By contrast, the United States’ words and deeds are not in keeping with the facts and less are they in keeping with friendship.” The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a global emergency after cases were discovered in more than a dozen countries. Singapore on Friday announced a sweeping ban on Chinese visitors and other foreigners who had been to China in the past 14 days, in an escalation of travel restrictions by the Southeast Asian transportation hub. The city-state will also stop issuing all forms of visas to people holding Chinese passports, Lawrence Wong, the minister for national development, said on Friday. Singapore has 13 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The outbreak and the entry shutdown will be another blow to its economy, which was already hit by the fallout from the United States-China trade war. Regional neighbors and airlines from countries that have not had any confirmed cases are also taking extra precautions to cope with the rapidly spreading epidemic. The government of Mongolia said on Friday that it would close its border with China until March 2. The authorities said they would work to bring home 30 Mongolian nationals from Wuhan, and its citizens in China would have until Feb. 6 to return. Non-Chinese foreigners visiting Mongolia will also not be able to enter through China. Russia, which shares a 2,600-mile border with China, has also been racing to prevent the spread of the disease. The country reported its first two coronavirus cases on Friday, both in Siberia and among Chinese nationals who had recently traveled to China. Russia closed the border to pedestrians and cars on Thursday, and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana A. Golikova said that Russia’s border with Mongolia would be closed to Chinese citizens. Russia will also temporarily stop issuing work visas to Chinese citizens, she added. On Friday, Britain’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said two residents had tested positive for coronavirus, the first known cases in the country. In a statement, Mr. Whitty said the patients were members of the same family. The announcement came as a flight carrying 83 British and 27 foreign nationals from Wuhan landed in Britain on Friday afternoon. The Britons were to be quarantined at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, in northwest England, according to the BBC. The others will be flown on to Spain. The Italian government declared a six-month state of emergency on Friday after the first two cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Rome, according to a government official. In a statement, the government said that it had allocated the “necessary funds” to begin precautionary measures. A government official said on Friday that five million euros, about $5.5 million, had been set aside for the effort. Two Chinese nationals, a husband and wife, were being held in isolation at Rome’s Spallanzani Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases, after they tested positive for the virus. The couple arrived in Milan a week ago and traveled to Parma and other cities before getting to Rome, where the husband began showing flu symptoms, the official said. A group of Chinese tourists who had been traveling with the couple were also being held in isolation at the hospital, Italian officials said Friday. At present, none of the other Chinese visitors showed any symptoms, said the Lazio region’s councilor for health, Alessio D’Amato, at a news conference on Friday.Three people who had come in contact with the infected couple were also being monitored at home, he also said. On Thursday, thousands of passengers had been blocked from leaving a cruise ship that docked at an Italian port for more than 12 hours over concerns that someone aboard might have had the virus. That episode was ultimately found to be a false alarm. In Germany, the Bavarian state Health Ministry confirmed a sixth case of the virus on Friday — the first child to be infected in the country. The child is related to another coronavirus patient identified this week.  On Friday, a German  passenger jet left for China to evacuate more than 100 German citizens from Wuhan and Hubei province, according to the German foreign ministry. Although none of the people on the passenger list appear to be infected, they will spend two weeks in quarantine once they arrive in Germany. As foreign governments evacuated their citizens from China this week, China said it was arranging chartered flights to bring Wuhan residents who were overseas back to the epicenter of the outbreak. Citing the “practical difficulties recently encountered” by residents abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday that evacuations would begin as soon as possible. Five million people from Wuhan left the city last week before travel restrictions were enforced. Unnerved by the exodus, some regional countries and territories have banned entry to people from Wuhan or Hubei province. Travel restrictions across China and the suspension of international flights to the country have left Chinese travelers stranded around the world. But it was unclear if the Chinese government was also targeting those who had intentionally fled the center of the outbreak. It was similarly unknown where the residents had traveled. Someone stole 25,000 face masks from a warehouse in Hong Kong on Friday as the city, still haunted by memories of SARS, is struggling with a severe shortage. The police said 500 boxes containing 50 masks each were reported missing from a building in an industrial neighborhood. The warehouse mostly supplied an e-commerce platform in the city, The Apple Daily newspaper reported. The theft came as residents in Hong Kong desperately searched for the item, often displayed at inflated prices, in pharmacies and retailers. In a dangerous practice, families that cannot afford new disposable masks have resorted to reusing them, according to local reports.

"As Virus Spreads, U.S. Temporarily Bars Foreigners Who’ve Visited China",2020-01-31,,"['[This briefing has ended. Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.] The Trump administration is imposing temporary travel restrictions that bar entry into the United States by any foreign national who has traveled to China in the past 14 days, officials said Friday. The restrictions, a reaction to the coronavirus that has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, will be put into place at 5 p.m. on Sunday. The United States on Friday also declared the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 12,000 people and has spread to the United States and other countries, a public health emergency. Friday’s action exempts immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents. In addition, officials said, any United States citizen returning home who has been in the Hubei province of China within the past 14 days will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei. Those who have been to other parts of China within the past 14 days will be subject to “proactive entry screening” and up to 14 days of monitoring and self quarantine. The United States will also funnel all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy Airport, Chicago’s O’Hare and San Francisco International Airport. The travel restrictions were announced Friday by Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, who declared that the coronavirus posed “a public health emergency in the United States.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the actions were being taken because there were “a lot of unknowns” surrounding the virus and its transmission path. “The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,” Dr. Fauci said. The broadening outbreak has roiled stock markets and raised alarms about possible harm to global economic growth. The S&P 500 suffered its sharpest decline of the year on Friday after major airlines in the United States said they would cancel flights to and from mainland China. It was the worst daily decline since October, and pushed the markets into negative territory for the year. The cancellations by Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines were the latest example of economic disruption wrought by the coronavirus, just as the global economy had begun to recover from the trade war tensions that dominated 2019. Companies have restricted travel to the region, shut stores in China and warned of the possible financial impact. Economists seem certain that the travel shutdowns, factory closures and quarantines in mainland China will dampen economic activity there, but have said it is too soon to know the impact elsewhere. “It is a wild card — I think even the experts would confirm that it’s too soon to tell,” said Richard Clarida, the vice chair of the Federal Reserve, during an interview on Friday on Bloomberg Television. The Fed is “monitoring closely,” he said. Concerns about global growth sent oil prices down below $52 a barrel. That pushed shares of energy companies down: Exxon Mobil and Chevron dropped by roughly 4 percent. Tech stocks also suffered, with particular weakness in the semiconductor sector, which is closely linked to supply chains based in and around China. Economists have only begun to sketch out estimates on the potential effects of the outbreak. Many have taken comfort from the economic record of the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 and 2003, which suggests that any downturn might be limited in scope. SARS coincided with a relatively brief slowdown of global growth in early 2003, that was followed by a sharp rebound. SARS, however, is an imperfect comparison. Some economists have suggested the ripple effects could be larger this time. At the time of the SARS outbreak, China represented just 5 percent of the global economy. In 2019, that number was 18 percent, according to JPMorgan economists. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines all said on Friday that they were suspending all service to mainland China as concerns about the coronavirus spread internationally. American said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China immediately through March 27. American and United will continue flights to Hong Kong. Delta and United said they would suspend service starting on Feb. 6. United said it expected to resume operations on March 28. Delta, which does not fly to Hong Kong, said it would suspend service through April 30. Delta said in a statement that its last flight to mainland China from the United States would depart on Monday, and that its last flight to the United States from mainland China would leave on Wednesday. Delta was the first American airline to completely suspend service to China because of the virus. United Airlines had already reduced its service to the country this week. Share prices in all three airlines had fallen by midday. Airlines outside the United States are also clamping down on travel. In Rwanda and Kenya, RwandAir and Kenya Airways said they would cancel all flights to and from Guangzhou, the southern Chinese metropolis, until further notice. There have been no confirmed cases in Africa. Poland’s national airline, LOT Polish Airlines, has suspended flights to China until Feb. 9, a deputy prime minister said on Twitter. More than a dozen people suspected of having the coronavirus are hospitalized in Poland, and over 500 people are being monitored by health services. Iran has suspended all flights to China because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters. Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported on Friday that all flights from China to the Islamic Republic have also been banned. Several Canadian companies have suspended employee travel to China after Air Canada’s decision on Wednesday to suspend service to Shanghai and Beijing. The Montreal-based carrier normally operates 33 flights a week to and from the two Chinese cities. The United States government has imposed a federal quarantine on 195 people who were evacuated on Wednesday from Wuhan, China, to a California military base, officials said on Friday. The group will be held at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., for 14 days, to ensure that they are not infected with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 9,800 people in China and killed more than 200 people. Chinese officials on Saturday reported the highest death toll so far in a 24-hour period. ◆ The 46 new deaths in China raised the toll to 259. ◆ About 2,100 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 12,000, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 100 cases have been confirmed in 21 other countries. ◆ All of China’s provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak. ◆  Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland. ◆ Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China. ◆ No deaths have been reported outside China. A call has been issued for classes to be canceled at Arizona State University. Basketball games were postponed at Miami University in Ohio. And at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, two students from Wuhan were moved to a special dorm. On college campuses across the United States, the global alarm over coronavirus is particularly intense. Hundreds of students are being screened for the virus. Suspected cases at many colleges — Baylor, Wesleyan and Tennessee Tech — have turned out to be false alarms, but the anxiety continues. At A.S.U., where there is one confirmed case of coronavirus, a cough in the back of a classroom now brings nervous glances. Students who had planned to study abroad this semester are furiously adjusting schedules. Carolyn Kleve, 20, a junior at Arizona State who is 13 weeks pregnant, is afraid. “We’re trapped in a room of 20 to 30 people and I don’t know who has what illness,” Ms. Kleve said of her classes. “Have I already come into contact with it? Who knows?” A high-ranking Chinese official said on Friday that he felt responsible for the spread of the coronavirus, offering his most direct expression of responsibility for the crisis. Many residents and experts have said that the reluctance by the government in Wuhan to warn the public about the spreading disease created dangerous complacency. “Above all, I feel guilty and remorseful and I reproach myself,” said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party secretary of Wuhan. “I’ve been constantly thinking that if I’d made the decision earlier to take the kind of strict controls we have in place now, the outcome would have been much better than now.” Mr. Ma was asked about his feelings in an interview on China’s main television network, CCTV. Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who is less powerful than Mr. Ma, said the government’s own laws hindered faster public disclosure. The State Department on Thursday night issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the dangerous new coronavirus.

A View of Brexit From the Soccer Field,2020-01-31,By Allison McCann,"['PORTSMOUTH, England — The team bus for the Leyton Orient women’s soccer team can sometimes be stifling. More than a dozen players sit, shoulder-to-shoulder, for hours in tedium under fluorescent blue lights (and in fear of having to use the one bathroom). There is, at least, free tea. The team’s striker, Otesha Charles, a dual citizen of Guyana and Britain, owns a hair salon in south London and eats Sainsbury’s salmon sandwiches before games. Cheryl Anderson, an accountant and defender from Scotland, is so soft-spoken and nice that it can be stunning to see her dive into a hard slide tackle. The others are teachers, postal workers, lawyers and a London subway driver. And then there is me, a former collegiate athlete from America who landed in London last January at a moment when every day brought another screaming headline about how Brexit had torn the country apart. “We had to move forward before the damage caused became irreparable,” one Briton lamented. On the surface, our team is a snapshot of Britain, containing many of its divisions. There are Leavers and Remainers. There are immigrants from different corners of the world, transplanted Europeans and players from across Britain. On hourslong bus rides to bleak stadiums, I started to understand this country a little better through the personal stories of my teammates more than I had from any shouting lawmaker or television talking head. Two players talked about insufficient government funding at state schools where they taught. Another who had endured several knee surgeries emphasized the importance of the National Health Service. And everyone complained about the train delays. Some of the European players who want to continue living and working in Britain were working to secure their settled status before Brexit takes full effect at the end of this year. Leyton Orient was just one team, in one city, in a country with deep economic, social and political division. But seeing everything through the prism of Brexit wasn’t how these women lived. On a particularly wet Sunday in December, we drove a few hours to Portsmouth, a city on England’s south coast that voted overwhelmingly to leave the European Union. It was so cold that the stadium served Bovril — a kind of salty, meaty broth engineered to warm fans during the bleakest weather. The field was a waterlogged pit of mud, beaten into submission by never-ending rain. One teammate saw my horrified gaze and smiled: “Welcome to English football.” The fear that Brexit has polarized Britain beyond repair is often discussed by commentators. But activities like sports, music clubs and communal gardens — the “micro-publics” of everyday life — can change how people from different backgrounds or political leanings think and interact with one another. “Physical proximity in its own right doesn’t yield a huge amount,” said Ash Amin, a geography professor at the University of Cambridge. “But if the shared activity lasts, then the political discussion may follow. And disagreement may not close down the dialogue because of the civility that arises from a shared activity and shared space.” Our two starting central midfielders are an example. They play together seamlessly, bouncing one-and-two-touch passes off each other, but off the field they’re two very different people. Fran Ali, a 26-year-old midfielder from east London, works as a planning specialist for Britain’s rail system. She said she voted for Brexit because she wanted Britain to have more control over its future. “I’m not too into politics, don’t get me wrong,” she said later at a packed pub back in London. “But my main reason voting for leave was so that we could control our laws, our borders and our money.” Her midfield partner is Egle Trezzi, a 31-year-old photographer from outside Milan who moved to Britain more than a decade ago and teaches at Goldsmiths University in London. “Personally, I think it’s a stupid idea,” she said of Brexit as we drove home from a game in January, under the kind of sky that suggests the sun will never come out again. “I don’t support it, and whatever happens, it’s going to be bad.” Fran said she recalled once teasing Egle for “being lefty,” but said they had never gotten into an argument over politics. “I respect her views, and she respects mine.” In November, when we played in Cheltenham — an area that voted to remain — the general election was just weeks away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was campaigning on a promise to “get Brexit done,” while the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats offered another vote on Brexit. But we didn’t talk about any of that. The muddy field defined our world that day as we picked one another up out of wet holes, cleared clods of earth from our cleats and laughed at who was the dirtiest. We won the game 1-0 and, for the first time in the team’s history, made it to the second round of the FA Cup, one of the world’s oldest soccer tournaments. We were promised a celebratory dinner on the ride home, but this was a Sunday in England and almost everything was closed. At a gas station, we bought cheap beers and canned gin and tonics instead. At a January game against Cambridge City, a university town that overwhelmingly supported staying in the bloc, the locker room was covered in a thin layer of filth. A sign taped to the wall said, “Please do not clean your boots in the showers.” The showers were cold. There was no trainer with us that day, so the players started getting one another ready for the game: taping ankles, stretching hamstrings, passing around any pain reliever we had. “Football is its own form of communication, and it’s often a nonverbal form of communication,” said Becca Hirst, 23, who grew up playing in Liverpool and voted to remain. But she wondered whether soccer on its own was enough to bridge any real divides. “How far do the people that you meet playing football translate into your everyday politics, your everyday actions, your feelings toward other people?” Some British voters said they favored leaving the bloc so that Britain could have more control over immigration and over who is allowed to live and work in the country. But that debate revived questions around British identity — including who is British and who is not. Otesha came to Britain when she was seven years old, and said she remembered feeling like an outsider. The other students at her school “wanted to hear my little Caribbean accent,” she said. “I didn’t feel British. I knew I was Guyanese in England.” She credits soccer with helping shape her sense of British identity. “Having a big team of 22 girls, I started to feel like this was my community,” she said. “I am a part of England and everything that comes with it.” Britain’s official departure from the European Union on Friday is mostly symbolic. The transition period is due to last through the end of the year, allowing time for negotiations over trade and other relations. But maybe once the tie is formally cut, people on both sides of Brexit can reconcile. “There are people on this team who voted leave and who voted remain, and it had no impact on our team ethos or hanging out outside of football,” said Sophie Le Marchand, a 31-year-old player from Worcester who is a teacher. “It had no impact whatsoever.”']","Political turmoil may have roiled Westminster. But on wet fields across Britain, a fourth-tier team shows what it looks like to just get on with it."
An Outbreak of Racist Sentiment as Coronavirus Reaches Australia,2020-01-31,By Isabella Kwai,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Isabella Kwai, a reporter with the Australia bureau. Recently, when Andy Miao takes the train to work in Sydney, he has noticed other people’s disapproving looks if he does not wear a face mask. Although he does not have the coronavirus, Mr. Miao, who is of Chinese heritage and grew up in Australia, knows it’s because of one reason: his ethnicity. “It makes people like me who are very, very Australian feel like outsiders,” said Mr. Miao, 24, who returned from a trip to China earlier this month and has since seen jokes degrading Chinese people. “It’s definitely invoking a lot of past racial stereotypes.” But as the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency after the virus spread to countries including Australia, he is worried about an outbreak of misinformation, panic and xenophobia. The virus has killed more than 200 people, with nearly 10,000 cases reported, though in Australia there are just a handful of cases, and health officials have said that the risk of catching it for many Australians is low. Still, universities have delayed exams, face masks — used only weeks ago against bush-fire smoke — are a common sight, and the government plans to evacuate Australians from the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Other responses here in Australia, where the relationship with China is contentious, have taken a more xenophobic bent.  Some far-right lawmakers polled their followers, asking if Australians should ban Chinese people temporarily from the country. A newspaper in Victoria, The Herald Sun, called the coronavirus a “Chinese Virus” on its front page, prompting over 40,000 people to sign a petition demanding an apology. On social media, fake announcements are warning people away from Chinese-populated areas, and memes are making light of early reports that the virus jumped from wild animals to humans. “Racism feeds on fear and anxiety,” said Tim Soutphommasane, a former race-discrimination commissioner and now a professor at the University of Sydney. While the virus originated in China, “viral diseases don’t have ethnic, racial or national characteristics,” he said, adding that the misinformation was “alarming.” On Wednesday, the government said that it planned to evacuate Australians citizens from the province to Christmas Island, an Australian territory 2,000 miles away from the mainland, to be quarantined for 14 days. But many questioned the implications of using Christmas Island, where refugees and asylum seekers have been held, instead of military bases on the mainland.  It was not an “appropriate” place to quarantine people, Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a television news interview. Faced with the decision, many Australians are opting to stay behind in lockdown. Some of the rhetoric has been reminiscent of a time when Chinese people were purposely excluded from the country. “You could read a similar article in the goldfields in 1860s Victoria,” said Jon Piccini, a lecturer in history at the Australian Catholic University. As scientists race to develop a vaccine, the virus is likely to continue to spread. Many wonder if it will further perpetuate stereotypes — the same ones that once prompted Australia to ban nonwhites from calling the country home. Mr. Miao said he did not blame people for being ignorant, though he added, “I don’t think it’s very fair.” Have you noticed or been affected by the fear around the coronavirus?

It’s quiet, except for the Pacific Ocean. The sound of the ocean is there all the time, day and night. The ocean never sleeps. I walk to the water. The water runs to meet you. You can touch it. It’s thousands of miles to the next shore.  Sometimes, at night, the stars come down to the horizon almost all the way around. But I never go in the water there either. Just back into the dunes.” — Fred Cann  Enjoying the Australia Letter? Sign up here or forward to a friend.

Belgium Acquits Three Doctors in Landmark Euthanasia Case,2020-01-31,By Elian Peltier,"['A Belgian court on Friday acquitted three doctors who had been charged with manslaughter by poisoning, in a landmark case that for the first time charged health professionals criminally under Belgium’s euthanasia law. Euthanasia has been legal in Belgium since 2002. It also is legal in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, but has long been debated in European countries. While certain forms of assisted suicide are practiced in France and Switzerland, the Belgian law goes further. Belgium allows euthanasia if an individual who is incurably ill and encounters unbearable physical or psychological pain, makes a voluntary, well-considered and repeated request, without external pressure. Since 2014, minors can also request euthanasia under certain conditions. The three doctors were facing life-imprisonment sentences over accusations that they had unlawfully poisoned a 38-year-old woman in 2010. The woman, Tine Nys, requested euthanasia under the law in 2009, according to Joris Van Cauter, the lawyer for Sophie Nys, one of her two sisters, who said Tine Nys had suffered from depression and heroin addiction and had tried to commit suicide several times. A few months later, the lawyer said, she was diagnosed with autism by a psychiatrist. She received a lethal injection on April 27, 2010, in the company of her parents and her two sisters. But Sophie Nys later argued that Tine Nys had not received sufficient advice, and that doctors had not tried to treat her mental illness. She filed a complaint, saying Tine Nys had not been incurably ill, as the Belgian euthanasia law requires. A minority of euthanasia requests are granted in Belgium when the patient has psychological issues. Sophie Nys’s complaint was initially rejected by a court but later permitted on appeal. “It makes you wonder about medicine and how you make life or death decisions,” the lawyer, Mr. Van Cauter, said about the three doctors who were standing trial. “My client asked, ‘How can you say that you tried to treat her?’” Mr. Van Cauter added that his client and her family had not wanted the doctors to go to prison; instead, they wanted an official acknowledgment that euthanasia should not have been administered under the circumstances. “It’s a bit disappointing,” the lawyer said of the decision, adding that the way Tine Nys was treated “was very sad.” After a two-week trial and eight hours of final debate, a 12-person jury in the criminal court of Ghent, in northwestern Belgium, cleared the three practitioners — the doctor who made the lethal injection, the general practitioner and a psychiatrist. Walter Van Steenbrugge, the lawyer of one of the doctors, Joris Van Hove, said a conviction would have established a dangerous precedent for professionals practicing euthanasia. He said he and his peers had received dozens of letters from worried doctors who said they had halted euthanasia procedures for fear of legal consequences. “My client is very relieved,” Mr. Van Steenbrugge said. “There was a lot at stake, not only for Belgium but for Europe in general.” More than 2,350 people were permitted euthanasia in Belgium in 2018, according to the latest public figures. In the Netherlands, a doctor was acquitted in September after having been accused of failing to secure proper consent from a 74-year-old patient who suffered from Alzheimer’s and had been administered euthanasia by the doctor. In France, a 42-year-old nurse who had been in a vegetative state for more than a decade died in July, after doctors had stopped feeding him artificially, following years of legal battles. The case that received the most attention in recent years in Belgium was  40-year-old Paralympian champion Marieke Vervoort, who was suffering from an incurable degenerative muscle disease, and who died last October, 11 years after having signed the papers paving the way to her death. In Tine Nys’s case, Mr. Van Steenbrugge said the acquittal had sent a strong, reassuring message to doctors. “It was not manslaughter, it wasn’t a crime,” he said. “It was euthanasia.” ']","It was the first time doctors were prosecuted after having administered euthanasia, in the case of a 38-year-old woman who died in 2010."
"U.K. Leaves E.U., Embarking On an Uncertain Future",2020-01-31,By The New York Times,"['At 11 p.m. — midnight in Brussels and 6 p.m. in New York — Britain officially left the European Union. Flags lined Parliament Square and the Mall, the ceremonial avenue leading to Buckingham Palace, and government buildings were lit up in the red, white and blue of the Union Jack. A countdown clock was projected onto the front of 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s official residence, along with a commemorative light display to “symbolize the strength and unity” of the United Kingdom. “This is not an end but a beginning,” Prime Minister Bris Johnson said in a speech to the nation shortly before the official departure. “This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act.” The departure, 1,317 days after Britain voted to leave the bloc, carries not only enormous symbolic weight, but also significant legal consequences. It concluded three years of fractious debates over whether the country should really leave the bloc, the terms of its departure and the kind of relationship it should forge with Europe. “We’ll have a couple months of people trying not to talk about it again, trying to pretend it’s not a thing that’s happening,” said Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, who led a group that tried to overturn Brexit. “But realistically it’s not going to be sorted in a year. It’s going to start rearing its head and opening divisions within families again.” The departure marks the start of a transition period in which London and Brussels will hash out the terms of their future ties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet began Friday with a meeting in Sunderland, a city in northern England that was the first to announce it had voted in favor of leaving the European Union on the night of the 2016 referendum. It was the first of a handful of celebratory, but noticeably muted, official events to mark the day, suggesting that the pro-Brexit government wanted to avoid the appearance of gloating. In the referendum, 48 percent of voters wanted to remain part of the European Union, and later polls suggest that number may have grown since. In the years of debate over Britain’s exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was never one for nuance, even declaring that he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than see Brexit delayed again. But as the hour of reckoning approached, Downing Street was remarkably subdued, not wanting to rub salt in the still raw wounds of those who desperately wanted to remain — about half the country. When he addressed the nation at 10 p.m., an hour before the official departure, Mr. Johnson struck a hopeful and conciliatory note. “Our job as the government, my job, is to bring this country together and take us forward,” he said. Of course, the next year of negotiations over Britain’s new trade relationship with the European Union will play a large role in determining what the future will hold. But that concern was for another day. Mr. Johnson, instead, used his remarks to try to persuade the public that Brexit was “not an end but a beginning.” “This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances — your family’s life chances — should depend on which part of the country you grow up in,” he said. “This is the moment when we begin to unite and level up.”   President Emmanuel Macron of France called Britain’s departure from the bloc a “historic alarm signal that must ring in each of our countries to be heard by all of Europe and make us reflect.” In a video statement released Friday evening, Mr. Macron described it as “a sad day.” “There is no denying it,"" he added, “but it is also a day that must lead us to proceed differently.” He called for a “powerful” and “efficient” European Union. Mr. Macron said the 2016 Leave campaign in Britain was based on “lies, exaggerations, simplifications” and on “checks that were promised and will never arrive.” “Brexit was made possible because too often we made Europe the scapegoat of our own difficulties,” Mr. Macron said. Still, he said, the European Union needs to change and “we have not changed our Europe enough.” And the need for a unified Europe is greater than ever, Mr. Macron said. He checked off a list of challenges — facing powers like China and the United States, tackling immigration and global warming, transitioning to a digital economy — that he said were best addressed by the bloc. “But I am aware that Europe will only be able to continue going forward if we deeply reform it to make it more sovereign, more democratic, closer to our fellow citizens and therefore simpler in its day-to-day life,” Mr. Macron said. Mr. Macron also tried to reassure the French that they would not “wake up tomorrow morning with different rules.” France will pick up five seats in the European Parliament left vacant by the British departure, he noted, but immediate changes otherwise would be limited. Mr. Macron said he would fight for French interests in negotiations over the future relationship between Britain and the European Union, arguing that he wanted “the closest, strongest, most durable partnership as possible” but that it would never be the same as the one Britain had as a member of the union. “One cannot be both inside and outside,” Mr. Macron said. France and Britain will continue to have a strong bilateral relationship, he said, tied as the two countries are by “a long history, made of blood, of freedom, of courage, of fights that we shared.” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said his country would work through the bloc to ensure that Britain remains a “privileged and strategic partner” in a trade agreement without quotas, tariffs or dumping.  He said would meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson next week to discuss the transition. “There isn’t much time to work on a serious and effective free exchange accord,” Mr. Conte told the Confederation of Italian Agriculture, meeting to celebrate its 100th anniversary. “A lot is at stake.” “It won’t be easy,” he said, adding that the bloc’s negotiators must “find a balance between protecting our production from deals that London could make with other countries.”  “We want facts,” Mr. Conte said, “to follow words.” Hundreds of Europeans lined up at City Hall in London on Friday to get advice about their future in Britain after it leaves the bloc. “They tell us the application is easy, but everyone has unique circumstances and there can be complications,” said Laurie Bassot, a French citizen.  Ms. Bassot said she will be allowed to stay in the country for five years under her “presettled status,” but she was worried about her future prospects. “It is a stressful process,” she said. “I have a job, a husband and children in school. I want to know how long I will be able to stay.” Along with legal experts, counselors were available at City Hall to provide emotional support. “There are lots of European citizens who feel anxious during this uncertain period so it is important for us to provide free services to support them,” said one of them, Dan Thomson. The leader of Gibraltar, a British territory at the southern tip of Spain, pledged that the thousands of Spaniards who cross the border daily to work there will not face the loss of their jobs or new obstacles as a result of Brexit. “We want to continue to see them working in our economy,” said Gibraltar’s leader, Fabian Picardo, calling the Spaniards “a key part of our success and prosperity.” Gibraltar’s 33,000 residents voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Mr. Picardo also warned Spain and the European Union against any move that could undermine Gibraltar. “We will not accept any attempt to compromise our sovereignty, jurisdiction or control,” he said. At the close of the business day in Brussels, Britain lowered the blue, yellow-starred European Union flag at its Brussels diplomatic post. The post becomes the British Embassy to the European Union at the stroke of midnight in Brussels. Britain’s own flag comes down at midnight at the European Council and Parliament buildings. Last year, Britain’s economy grew at its weakest pace since 2010, hampered by weak business investment. And now the Bank of England has lowered its expectations for growth this year  to 0.75 percent, from 1.25 percent.  At his final news conference on Thursday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who has extended his tenure three times to accommodate Brexit, said that from an economic perspective, “the last decade ended with a whimper.” Recently published figures have indicated an uptick in sentiment and activity since Britain’s December election produced a clear Conservative majority in Parliament, reducing uncertainty and clearing the way for a final decision on Brexit. As a result, the Bank of England decided it did not need to lower interest rates to bolster the economy. Still, Mr. Carney warned that a recovery was not guaranteed. “To be clear, these are still early days, and it is less a case of ‘so far so good’ than ‘so far, good enough,’” he said. “Although early signs are encouraging, the recoveries in growth and inflation are also not yet assured.” Christine Lagarde, Europe’s top central banker, said she was sorry that Britain was leaving the European Union, but offered assurances that the split could take place without disrupting the financial system. “It is with great regret that we see our British friends leave the European Union,” Ms. Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said in a statement. “We will work hard to ensure Brexit causes as little disruption as possible for the citizens, employers and financial markets in the euro area and the rest of the E.U.” The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have already set up a system to swap pounds and euros to ensure that banks don’t run short of either currency. Bank regulators on both sides have agreed to continue sharing information. And the European Central Bank has already issued licenses for 25 banks relocating from Britain to the euro currency zone. Britain was never a member of the eurozone. But as a member of the European Union it contributed about 58 million euros, or $64 million, to the European Central Bank’s capital. It will now get that money back. But fears that Brexit could hurt the European economy may already be proving justified. The eurozone grew only 0.1 percent during the last three months of 2019 compared with the previous quarter, according to official statistics published on Friday. That was a significant slowdown from previous quarters and meant that the 19 countries in the eurozone grew only 1.2 percent during last year, according to a preliminary estimate. “The specter of recession is back,” Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to investors on Friday. Eurostat, the official statistics agency, didn’t give a reason for the slowdown. But one factor was probably the uncertainty caused by Brexit, which has made businesses hesitant to hire or to invest in expansion. Trade between the European Union and Britain has also shrunk since the country voted to leave. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany described Brexit as a “decisive turning point for us all,” in a video message released on Friday. “Germany would like to remain a close partner and friend of Britain because we share common values,” she said. In the video, Ms. Merkel explains that the rights of British people living in the European Union had been ensured under the withdrawal agreement.  But for one German town, Britain’s departure meant a big change: losing their mayor of 12 years.  The mayor, Iain Macnab, is originally from Scotland but has lived in Brunsmark, a town of 161 people in northern Germany, since 1992. But he had to give up his office on Friday, as he will not be able to vote in municipal elections as he is no longer a European citizen.  According to local laws, Mr. Macnab cannot be elected to an office he is not allowed to vote for.  “It’s a bit sad,” Mr. Macnab said by telephone from the Town Hall on his last day in office. “It didn’t strike me until yesterday, when I had my last committee meeting.”  The former British ambassador to Washington fired a shot over the bow of the good ship Brexit on Friday, warning that President Trump would be likely to demand that the country’s revered National Health Service pay higher prices for American drugs in a potential post-Brexit trade deal. Kim Darroch, who resigned from his post in July after critical comments he made about Mr. Trump were leaked, told The Guardian that the Trump administration would prioritize the demands of large American corporations and farmers who want more access to British markets. “I know what the U.S. will be pitching for when they negotiate a free-trade deal with us,” Mr. Darroch said in the interview with The Guardian. “People talk about chlorinated chicken — it is a lot more than that.” Currently, Britain’s National Health Service has a price cap on some pharmaceuticals, which pressures American drug firms to sell their products in Britain at a lower price.  “Do they want us to pay more for their pharmaceuticals? Do the pharmaceutical companies want to use this leverage? Of course, they do,” Mr. Darroch said. In documents from 2017 that were later leaked, Mr. Darroch had described the Trump administration as “uniquely dysfunctional,” and called Mr. Trump “inept” and “insecure.” After the revelation, President Trump said he would no longer deal with the ambassador, and Mr. Darroch was forced to resign. Before the row, Mr. Darroch had driven attempts to expand trade relations with the United States.  To mark Britain’s exit from the European Union, three million commemorative 50-pence coins are entering circulation, bearing the message “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.”  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to become one of the first owners of the coin on Friday when Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the Exchequer, plans to hand one over. Seven million more will come into use later in the year. But as with almost everything Brexit-related, the short history of the coin, which has a face value equivalent to about 65 cents, has already been fraught. Production began ahead of a previously planned departure on Oct. 31, but when Brexit was pushed back to January, over a million coins had to be melted down. When re-dated coins were unveiled, some people called for a boycott, either to display opposition to Brexit or because they find the message on the coin grammatically offensive. “The ‘Brexit’ 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma, and should be boycotted by all literate people,” the novelist Philip Pullman wrote on Twitter, arguing that the inscription should instead read “Peace, prosperity, and friendship with all nations.” For those who don’t mind the lack of the Oxford comma, a gold version of the coin was offered. But according to the royal mint, those coins — priced at 945 pounds, or about $1,240, each — are out of stock. In an opinion article published across the European press, the presidents of the three main European Union institutions called Brexit Friday a “new dawn” for Europe. After offering kind words on Britain’s departure, Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission, Charles Michel of the European Council and David Sassoli of the European Parliament tried to strike an upbeat tone. “We need to look to the future and build a new partnership between enduring friends,” they wrote. “Together, our three institutions will do everything in their power to make it a success. We are ready to be ambitious.” The article was published alongside a cheery video touting the European Union’s economic and climate-friendly credentials and maintaining that its remaining 27 members were “#strongertogether.” Brussels wants the message to be clear, because while Britain’s departure has yet to inspire strong withdrawal movements in other countries, as some expected immediately after the 2016 referendum, many Europeans are disillusioned with the project of ever closer union. “We have a common vision of where we want to go and a commitment to be ambitious on the defining issues of our times,” the three presidents said. “That work continues as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.” Megan Specia, Marc Santora, Elian Peltier, Jack Ewing, Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Christopher F.

Capital in Trump Mideast Plan Makes ‘a Joke’ of Palestinian Aspirations,2020-01-31,By Isabel Kershner and David M. Halbfinger,"['ABU DIS, West Bank — Like a monument to dashed hopes, an unfinished Palestinian parliament building stands derelict on a ridge in Abu Dis, an unimposing West Bank suburb of Jerusalem that the Trump administration has proposed as the capital of a future Palestinian state. A symbol of the possibilities of sovereignty when it was begun in the mid-1990s, the parliament was supposed to have a clear line of sight to the glimmering domes of the revered Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, barely two-and-a-half miles away as the crow flies. Today it backs onto a hulking, razor wire-topped concrete wall, a section of Israel’s security barrier that went up in 2005, isolating wingless creatures in Abu Dis from Jerusalem and its holy sites. Days after the rollout of the long-awaited Trump plan for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which strongly favored Israel and disregarded most Palestinian claims, there was little sense of gathering majesty or of Palestinian control here in Abu Dis. American administrations have tried repeatedly over decades to mediate a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on far more evenhanded terms than the new proposal. But nothing epitomizes the asymmetry more than how it addresses a Palestinian capital. Palestinians have long aspired to an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, but the proposal does away with the long-held notion that the two sides would negotiate Jerusalem’s future. Instead, it gives all the desirable parts of the city to Israel and proposes a group of obscure, outlying areas as the closest thing to a capital in Jerusalem that the Palestinians should ever get. It offers Palestinians the tiny, crowded Abu Dis, along with troubled faraway neighborhoods technically in East Jerusalem, but also on the other side of the security barrier. One of the neighborhoods designated for the capital, the Shuafat refugee camp, is a gang-ridden slum where the Palestinian police have no jurisdiction and the Israeli police fear to tread. Another, Kufr Aqab, became a Wild West of unregulated and unsafe construction when Israeli policies and sky-high housing prices drove middle-class Arabs to seek homes beyond the security barrier but still inside the Jerusalem municipality. And then there is Abu Dis, the hilly home of Al-Quds University, which opened in the 1980s when the village was just a 10-minute drive from Damascus Gate — one of the portals leading into Jerusalem’s Old City. Most of Abu Dis was never inside the Jerusalem city limits. “How can this be a capital?” asked Ahmed Bader, 25, incredulously. He had come in a small truck to collect garbage from a patch of wasteland behind the parliament building. Children rode horses bareback in an adjacent alley. “Jerusalem has the Aqsa mosque, the churches, business, places to work,” he continued. “What do we have here, in our little town? If I stop my little Vespa in the main street to speak on the phone, cars pile up behind and can’t get past me!” Next to the\xa0Parliament building,\xa0there is\xa0a once-grand, five-story mansion with a White House-like portico\xa0that\xa0had its top floors demolished on Israeli orders because of the apparent risk posed by anyone high up enough to peep over the security wall. Israeli border police officers come and go at will through an iron door in the barrier. When the Palestinians say they want Jerusalem as their capital, they do not mean areas like Abu Dis, Shuafat or Kufr Aqab. Shuafat and Kufr Aqab are part of territory that the Israelis annexed to Jerusalem in 1967, in the heady days after their victory in the Six-Day War. “Jerusalem is the old walled city. The rest is not Jerusalem,” said Nazmi Jubeh, an archaeologist and historian who runs the Birzeit University Museum in the West Bank. “We mean by Jerusalem — and I think everybody around the world means — the holy sites. This game of playing with words has no meaning at all.” In broad terms, the Trump administration plan would allow Israel to annex about 30 percent of the West Bank along with all the Jewish settlements in the territory, though most of the world considers those settlements a violation of international law. Previous peace proposals envisaged Israel dismantling the more isolated settlements and maintaining a special security arrangement along the border with Jordan rather than annexing the entire area. The Trump plan makes the Palestinians an unattractive and heavily conditional offer: an entity that they could call a state made up of the Gaza Strip and several enclaves in the West Bank — pockmarked with settlements and surrounded by Israeli territory — that would be linked by roads or other transportation. While Israel hailed the plan, the Palestinians angrily rejected it out of hand. In myriad ways, the Trump plan seemed to reward the Israelis and punish the Palestinians for what each has considered the other’s bad behavior. The Israelis relentlessly created facts on the ground, like settlements in the heart of the West Bank aimed at preventing a Palestinian state from coming together. The Palestinians repeatedly resorted to violence, even after Israeli withdrawals, which led Israel to expand its security presence at the Palestinians’ expense and to insist on never uprooting its people again. In its conceptual map of a Palestinian state, the Trump plan did not even mark the location of a capital, though the document did suggest calling it Al-Quds, the Arabic name for Jerusalem. It did mark Jerusalem — in Israeli territory. The Americans determined that Israel should remain sovereign over all parts of Jerusalem, including the ancient holy sites that are inside the security barrier built in the early 2000s after a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings. At least 120,000 Palestinians live beyond the barrier but still inside the Jerusalem city limits so they can cling to their Jerusalem residency cards, which allow them to work and travel inside Israel. Under the American plan, they would find themselves living in Palestine. (Inside the barrier, the plan says, the approximately 200,000 Palestinians would get the choice of becoming citizens of Palestine or of Israel, or of maintaining the in-between residency status that most of them have today.) As a purely geographical matter, the Palestinian capital would be fragmented across several neighborhoods that are miles apart from each other, separated by Israeli communities and major roads, and share little in common. It is not unlike cobbling together a new city from parts of Teaneck, N.J., Queens, and the South Bronx. The Trump plan promises to manage the feat with new roads, tunnels or bridges. “If you know these areas, you know they’re just making a joke of you and your national aspiration,” said Mr. Jubeh. “A capital is a symbol,” he added. “These areas are not a symbol for anybody.” Indeed, the Palestinians are denied even a symbolic toehold in or near the ancient heart of the city. But Israel gets rid of its only refugee camp, and of the violent outland it has become. In carving off Shuafat, the Trump plan completes what the Israelis first tried to do when they built the security barrier, said Danny Seidemann, an expert on the geography and political history of Jerusalem who is a harsh critic of the Trump plan. It would correct what he said was a mistake in hastily drawing the city boundaries in 1967. The refugee camp had been a hot spot of violence for years, he said. So the decision was made to build the security wall inside the city “in order to cut them out,” Mr. Seidemann said. In the Shuafat camp on Thursday, residents laughed at the idea of making their neighborhood a Palestinian showpiece. Water and sewer services in the camp are unreliable at best; the streets contain potholes big enough to lose much of a car. “It’s a ghost city, not a capital,” said Muhammad Inbawi, 30. “It’s chaos here. At night, we’re ruled by the gangsters. What kind of capital is that? Is Trump sane?” The place is not so safe by day, either: As Mr. Inbawi spoke, a fog was billowing down the street. It was tear gas fired by Israeli security forces. Crowds of children in school uniforms broke into a run to get away. Seeing a girl struggling to withstand the effects of the acrid cloud, Mr. Inbawi shouted at no one in particular, “You don’t throw stones when school is letting out!” Abu Dis, which started out as a sleepy village, now has about 13,000 residents in less than two square miles. It consists of a single main street and higgledy-piggledy alleys shooting off at strange angles. “We love it,” said Safia, 35, an English teacher who would only provide her first name for fear of repercussions from the authorities. But she added, “Like all Palestinians, I refuse what we call the American-Israeli agreement to take Jerusalem.” She last visited Jerusalem three years ago to pray during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a visit that required a special permit from the Israeli authorities. Tareq Bader, 22, who works in a car accessory store, was last in Jerusalem about 10 years ago. “It’s so close,” he said, “but difficult to get to.” But he hasn’t lost faith. “Trump promised Jerusalem to the Jews,” he said. “God promised it to us, and God is greater than Trump.” Mohammed Najib contributed reporting.']","Part of the proposed capital, far from Jerusalem’s holy sites, would encompass a gang-ridden slum. “These areas are not a symbol for anybody,” said one Palestinian."
SARS Was Deadly in Canada. Is the Country Ready for Coronavirus?,2020-01-31,By Ian Austen,"['Canada Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Canada bureau, written by Canadian correspondent Ian Austen. Sign up to get it by email. The SARS virus outbreak in 2003 that infected 375 people in Toronto, killing 44, left behind a widespread physical reminder of that dark time. While they have become often out of order and otherwise neglected in recent years, dispensers for hand sanitizer are still found in most public buildings at their entrances and dotted along their hallways. The fear that pervaded the Toronto area during SARS resurfaced this week, if to a lesser extent, as the Wuhan coronavirus continued its rapid spread in China and around the world. Traveling alongside that fear is xenophobia and discrimination against people of Chinese origin or people who simply appear to be from China. The public school board in York Region, north of Toronto, issued a statement effectively rebuking more than 9,000 people who signed a petition demanding that the children in a family recently returned from China be kept from their classes. [Read: As Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Anti-Chinese Sentiment] As I write this, four cases of coronavirus have been reported in Canada and the anti-Chinese sentiment appears limited. The health care system is working smoothly, and officials have been open about what they’re doing and what’s going on. That’s a marked contrast to SARS, where chaos and mistakes, all cloaked in secrecy, dominated. The extent of the turmoil in 2003 had dimmed in my memory until I recently read the report from an inquiry Ontario did after the outbreak. “Our public health and emergency infrastructures were in a sorry state of decay, starved for resources by governments of all three political parties,” Justice Archie Campbell wrote in his final report released in 2006. “The only thing that saved us from a worse disaster was the courage and sacrifice and personal initiative of those who stepped up — the nurses, the doctors, the paramedics and all the others — sometimes at great personal risk, to get us through a crisis that never should have happened.” Looking back, two things stand out about Toronto’s SARS outbreak. First, hospitals became the place where most people contracted SARS, 72 percent of them. And of the those patients, 45 percent were health care workers who became infected on the job. Then, after officials believed the crisis had turned the corner — to the point where Health Canada ran advertisements to that effect — they were forced to acknowledge under questioning at a news conference that a second lethal round of infections was underway. SARS was even less understood than the coronavirus, which is nevertheless surrounded by many unknowns. There was not, among other things, any diagnostic test available for SARS during the outbreak. “The commission has not heard of any country or any health system that foresaw SARS,” the 2006 inquiry found. “SARS taught us that we must be ready for the unseen.” As the report repeatedly notes, Canada had an example of the right way to handle outbreaks during SARS. Vancouver’s infection control systems, its well-developed systems for protecting health care workers and its clearly defined hospital protocols for dealing with outbreaks, made it possible for the city to successfully contain its five cases, only one of which involved a health care worker. The coronavirus, so far, isn’t as virulent as SARS, and the number of admissions related to it here remains relatively low. “When I compare this to what I experienced as an emergency physician during SARS, this is a different situation and a better situation,” Dr. Daniel Kollek, a professor of emergency medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton told me. “I think we are more ready.” The changes over the last 17 years include better training, better systems for identifying infected patients and more hospital rooms with air filtering equipment. Additionally, clear and consistent updates and instructions from health authorities are now being given promptly to doctors, nurses and hospital administrators. Canada does still lag, Dr. Kollek said, in planning for handling large-scale emergencies. Among other things, he said, in an era when many hospitals are regularly running at or beyond capacity, there is still no way to discharge patients who are not as seriously ill to free up beds during a crisis. He also said that large-scale health crises could be better handled by initially assessing patients outside of hospitals. Times journalists from around the world, including me, are following the coronavirus situation as it develops. Among the results of that is a regularly updated map of infections worldwide and a constantly revised briefing. You can find the most recent live briefing via the link at the top of every article we’ve published related to the outbreak, including the map.

"From Armed Struggle to Peaceful Protest, a Road Still to Travel",2020-01-31,By Carlotta Gall,"['LONDON — From a small prefabricated office in a northwest London suburb, a satellite television channel has been broadcasting since the early days of the Arab Spring in 2011, offering Algerians a viewpoint that their country’s tightly controlled state channels do not give. The main voice on its programs, Abdullah Anas, is little known in the West but a giant in jihadi circles from the 1980s war in Afghanistan against the invading Soviet Army. A lifelong Algerian activist from student days, Mr. Anas, 61, spent 12 years with the Afghan mujahedeen and then served as a close aide to Abdullah Azzam, the Palestinian professor and preacher often called the father of the international resistance to the Soviet occupation. Since those days, Mr. Anas has become a champion of peaceful change and dialogue, not only for Algeria but for restive societies across the Muslim world. In Afghanistan, he helped facilitate the first exploratory peace talks with the Taliban in 2006. “Really, I can say with full confidence, it is a new chapter for the Algerian people,” he said in an interview this week as the protests in Algeria approached their first anniversary. Compared to violent clashes with protesters in Lebanon and Iraq, and Algeria’s own bloody past, he said the Algerian protest movement was setting a new example. “In one year not one drop of blood was lost, praise be to God.” Mr. Anas remains in exile in England, since he risks arrest by the military-dominated government if he returns to Algeria. Nevertheless, he has been closely involved in shaping and encouraging the protest movement through the satellite channel, Al-Magharibia TV, which live-streams the protests and commentary on the internet, puncturing a virtual government news media blackout. Born in 1958, Mr. Anas grew up in the small town of Ben Badis in eastern Algeria, and recalls a happy childhood in the optimistic post-colonialist period. His family, like thousands of Algerians, moved from the old Arab quarter into homes abandoned by the French colonialists after independence in 1962. After his father became deeply religious, the young Mr. Anas was sent to a madrasa, or religious seminary, for his schooling, and later studied with a preacher of the Tablighi group of Muslim missionaries. It was in 1980, after having read a magazine article, that he was inspired by the idea of fighting jihad in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan he came to work closely with Mr. Azzam, and later married his daughter. He helped Mr. Azzam run the Arab Services Bureau, which organized the participation of Arab volunteers in the Afghan jihad. In a memoir published last year, “To the Mountains: My Life in Jihad from Algeria to Afghanistan,” Mr. Anas sought to correct what he called many of the myths about the Arab volunteers that arose after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Foremost among those, he said, was the notion that thousands of them fought in Afghanistan. By his count, there were only around a hundred committed fighters in Afghanistan at any one time. He describes his time in Afghanistan as helping guide the volunteers in religion and moral behavior as much as military activity, and mediating between warring Afghan factions as much as fighting the war. But he is also frank about the damage that extremists and sectarianism have done to the course of jihad — including those who perpetrated the Sept. 11 attacks and those, who remain unidentified, who assassinated his father-in-law. “I will never denounce jihad,” he writes. “As a Muslim I know this to be a noble deed, the peak of perfection — where man can be the most beastly, he chooses to be humane.” To Mr. Anas, as to most Muslims, jihad — literally, “struggle” — is a fundamental principle of the Muslim faith. Defending your country and other Muslims against occupation and repression, they believe, will be rewarded in heaven. But he distinguishes that sort of jihad from what in Islam is often called “offensive jihad,” removing impediments to the spreading of Islam. Islamic jurists have argued in the past that impediments can include political powers, which can lead to armed struggle against established governments. Mr. Anas said he believes this concept has no place in the modern age. “The door must be closed,” he writes. “Why should we fight a people irrespective of their religion just to bring them into the sphere of Islam even if they don’t convert?” There are many ways to pursue jihad peacefully, he said. “The word jihad is not just taking a Kalashnikov,” he said. “The word jihad is wider in Islam: media jihad, academic jihad, legal jihad, money jihad, thinktanks jihad, politics jihad, diplomacy jihad. Fighting is just one part of it.” After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr. Anas returned to Algeria in 1990 but was detained — his relationship with Mr. Azzam made him a person of extreme interest for the Algerian authorities — and after his release began a life of precarious exile with his young family. He went back to Afghanistan for several years, rejoining the legendary guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, whom Mr. Anas considered a friend and mentor. It was there in the early 1990s that he learned of the first democratic stirrings in Algeria, watching election rallies on videos carried over the mountain passes. He knew the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front, or F.I.S., and followed from afar their success in local elections and then the crackdown that followed as the military government imposed martial law, plunging Algeria into a decade of savage civil war. Looking back, Mr. Anas said, Algerian society was not ready for the suddenness of what he called the “remote-control change” of 1992 but he blamed the military government for the deadly violence. “I understand democracy cannot be born with one press” of the button, he said. “But what I cannot understand was, ‘You had more than one option, why did you go for the bloody option?’” After a decade of bloodletting, Algerians accepted the rule of Abdelaziz Bouteflika because he offered a respite from violence. Even as the Arab world exploded in protests in 2011, Algeria remained quiet. Then suddenly in 2019 Algerians blew up in anger when Mr. Bouteflika, wheelchair-bound and barely able to speak after a stroke, proposed to run for a fifth term as president. They haven’t stopped since. “Now they are one year in the streets, on Tuesday the students and on Friday all Algerian people,” he said. “They are academics, workers, agricultural workers, ordinary people, scholars, lawyers, politicians, you cannot imagine, in the street, side by side, men and women, Islamists and non-Islamists, all repeating very simple slogans.” He said the protesters, like those across the Arab world, want justice and rule of law. “If you have a legal state, a state of law, it is not a problem if you want to be Muslim Brotherhood, or Islamist, or secularist,” he said. The protesters forced Mr. Bouteflika’s resignation and the arrest of his brother, but rigged elections brought in a new president from the same old ruling circle. “Completely the old and the miserable chapter,” as Mr. Anas put it. Yet, he remains optimistic and insists the only way ahead is through dialogue, even if it takes five or 10 years to persuade the military to allow free elections. “The Algerian movement is not under pressure,” he said. “I am saying, ‘Hang on, be patient.’” He remains engaged as well in Afghanistan, where he sees a new generation of Afghans who no longer care about old divisions. “You have 30 to 35 million Afghans, most of them in the cities, it is not necessary to be Taliban, to be pro-American against Taliban, it is not necessary to be Communist,” he said. “We have initiatives, we have the minds of the new generation saying ‘listen to us, we have our own way, we can do it, we can solve the problem, but give us a chance.’”']",A veteran of the Afghan jihad working for nonviolent change in Algeria
Kenya’s High Court Delays National Biometric ID Program,2020-01-31,By Abdi Latif Dahir and Carlos Mureithi,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya’s high court on Thursday temporarily suspended the country’s new national biometric identity program until the government enacts laws to protect the security of the data and prevent discrimination against minorities. The government had said the IDs would be required for all Kenyan citizens and foreign residents to access a broad range of rights and services, including health care, education, public housing, voting, marriage licenses and registering mobile phones. But the court’s three-judge panel announced in proceedings on Thursday that it is suspending the digital ID program until the government has in place “an appropriate and comprehensive regulatory framework” that would protect the personal data it collects and safeguard minorities from discrimination. The panel’s 500-page judgment is expected to be released next week. The decision is a setback for the government, which had already collected data from nearly 40 million Kenyans during a mass registration in April and May last year. The government will now have to pass new legislation — under public scrutiny — to build in protections and implement the biometric program. It is unclear how long that might take. The program, called the National Integrated Management System, was introduced last year and sought to collect personal and biometric data — including fingerprints, facial photographs and residential addresses — from Kenya’s population of almost 50 million. But last February, civil rights groups in Kenya challenged the system’s constitutionality, citing concerns over data privacy, inadequate public participation, and the marginalization of minorities, who already find it difficult to get the government documentation they need to register for the biometric IDs. “We are hopeful that this judgment is a milestone in the quest for equality for all Kenyans,” said Yussuf Bashir, a lawyer representing the Nubian Rights Forum, the first of many civil rights organizations that filed legal challenges to the digital registry. Kenya’s digital registry drew comparisons to India’s giant biometric program, known as Aadhaar, whose sweeping powers were limited by the Indian Supreme Court in 2018. Each person who registers is supposed to receive a unique identification number called Huduma Namba — or “service number” in Swahili. Officials said the number will be required to pay taxes, open bank accounts and get a drivers’ license, in addition to accessing health and schooling services. Civil rights groups, however, said the program risked disenfranchising millions of people who already face systemic challenges getting the documents required to obtain biometric ID cards. To enroll, adults had to provide a national identity card, and birth certificates for those under 18. For decades, racial, religious and ethnic minority groups like Nubians, Somalis and Kenyans of Indian origin have faced obstacles and delays when applying for government-issued papers. (Nubians were originally brought to Kenya from Sudan as soldiers by British colonial rulers more than a century ago.) Human rights advocates said many members of these communities were turned away from Huduma registration centers last spring. The court, however, found that the government took the right steps to introduce the sweeping program, provided the public enough information, and did not coerce people to register. Still, the program “was rushed” and introduced without proper legislation, said Justice Pauline Nyamweya, one of the judges on the panel. The legislation was not published until July, after the mass registration exercise had ended — a move that Justice Nyamweya said was “contrary to principles of democratic governance and rule of law.” Kenya passed a data protection law last November, which established a data commission to regulate the processing of personal data. It is not clear when this body will be operational and how much sway it will have over regulating the biometric program. The justices also ruled that collection of DNA and GPS data, which was barred by another court last April, was “intrusive and unnecessary.” The ruling “partially recognized” how essential biometric data is “to who you are as a human being, and that the government shouldn’t have unchecked power to collect that information and to use it without your consent,” said Nanjala Nyabola, the author of “Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics: How the Internet Era is Transforming Kenya.” For 22-year-old Hassan Noor, the court’s decision magnifies his anxieties. For four years now, Mr. Noor, who is a Kenyan of Nubian descent, has not been able to get a national identity card. That mean he has not been able to get a job, register a business or travel easily — or get a biometric ID. He is unemployed and lives in Kibera, a poor area southwest of Nairobi. “I feel bad,” he said of the court’s decision. “I’m not the only one who’ll suffer.”']","The biometric system was challenged in court over privacy concerns, and fears that it could exclude millions from accessing public services."
U.S. Strikes at Leader of Qaeda in Yemen,2020-01-31,"By Rukmini Callimachi, Eric Schmitt and Julian E. Barnes","['The United States has carried out an airstrike against the leader of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen after months of tracking him by using aerial surveillance and other intelligence, according to three current or former American officials. The officials expressed confidence that the Qaeda leader, Qassim al-Rimi, was killed in a January airstrike in Yemen but were awaiting confirmation before making a public announcement. If confirmed, his death could represent a significant blow to the Qaeda affiliate, which remains one of the most potent branches of the terrorist group. The Yemen branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has tried to attack the United States and Europe and is thought to still want to. The group’s ability to orchestrate or attack targets in the West has atrophied in recent years, as American airstrikes have targeted their bomb-makers and English-language propagandists. But the group, American officials have previously said, remains a dangerous one. Qaeda and Islamic State leaders have been targeted in the past by American military or C.I.A. drone strikes, only for United States officials to learn later that the militants had survived. That has made American officials more cautious about declaring these kind of strikes successful. Military officials said they were not aware of any strikes. The C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to comment. The C.I.A. learned of Mr. al-Rimi’s location from an informer in Yemen in November, according to a United States official who was briefed on the strike. That information allowed the government to begin tracking him through surveillance drones. Local news reports in Yemen said that a drone strike this month killed two militant suspects in the area of Wadi Abedah in central Yemen. The reports did not identify the people killed in the strike. Mr. al-Rimi, 41, is among the few Qaeda leaders whose terrorist pedigree traces to the era before the Sept. 11 attacks. A veteran of Qaeda’s training camps in Afghanistan, Mr. al-Rimi later returned to his native Yemen, where he was sentenced to five years in prison for plotting to kill the American ambassador there. He broke out of jail a year later, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Qaeda affiliate. The State Department offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to Mr. al-Rimi’s capture, and later doubled the reward to $10 million, as he was linked to numerous plots against American interests. According to the State Department, he is believed to have played a role in the 2008 attack on the American Embassy in Sana, which killed 10 guards and four civilians, as well as the 2009 plot by the Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to take down a Detroit-bound flight with explosives concealed in his underwear. In the first major military operation authorized by President Trump, Chief Petty Officer William (Ryan) Owens, a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, was killed in Yemen in 2017 trying to kill or capture Mr. al-Rimi. “He was an Al Qaeda veteran whose career started in the camps in pre-9/11 Afghanistan,” said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. “After he was busted out of prison, he was part of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula’s relaunch management team, becoming their military commander.” Mr. Joscelyn said that Mr. al-Rimi was one of just four Qaeda officials who appeared in a video announcing the group’s relaunch in 2009. Analysts said that numerous Qaeda leaders have been killed in similar strikes. “These strikes are necessary to degrade the group, but not sufficient to destroy it,” Mr. Joscelyn said. The affiliate in Yemen was for a time considered the most capable of striking American interests, but it hasn’t pursued a plot targeting the United States in years. Bruce Riedel, a 30-year veteran former C.I.A. officer, said he had heard about the strike but added that it was unclear whether Mr. al-Rimi had been killed. “Al-Rimi is an important target, probably more dangerous to Yemen and Saudi Arabia than for Americans given the group’s diminished capabilities during the Yemen war,” he said. The strike against Mr. al-Rimi came at roughly the same time the American military unsuccessfully tried to kill a senior Iranian military official in Yemen, Abdul Reza Shahlai. The attempted strike against Mr. Shahlai came on the same day an American drone killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s most powerful commander. Saeed al-Batati and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.']","American officials believe they may have killed the terrorist leader, Qassim al-Rimi, but have not confirmed his death."
Britons on Brexit: ‘We’ve Made a Spectacle of Ourselves’,2020-01-31,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — When Britain leaves the European Union at 11 p.m. on Friday, some will be celebrating and others will be mourning. But for most people interviewed this week around the country, it seems to mark a time for recovery — from years of wrangling that has upended the political system and sometimes strained the country’s social fabric. “It’s just been day after day of dysfunction, division and economic uncertainty. I’m not sure how we are supposed to bounce back from this,” said Andrew Fielden, a 39-year-old London-based accountant who supported Britain remaining in the European Union. “The irony is that Brexit was all about taking back control, but we’ve never been so out of control. No one even knows what the reality of Brexit will look like.” Since the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the union, political discord has rippled through the country, sundering towns and cities and rupturing relationships among families and friends. The atmosphere became so toxic that in December’s general election, many Britons crossed traditional political divides to deliver the Conservative government a substantial mandate to “get Brexit done.” “Voting in the election was one of the hardest decisions of my life,” said Madeline Shaw, 42, a social worker from the southern port city of Southampton. She said she had almost always voted for the opposition Labour Party, but switched to the Conservatives this year because they promised to deliver Brexit. “We’ve made a spectacle of ourselves squabbling over Brexit for years. We’ve let down vulnerable communities, whose needs have been neglected because the government was paralyzed by Brexit,” Ms. Shaw said. “We had to move forward before the damage caused became irreparable.” Nothing has divided Britain quite like the question of Brexit. Those in favor are adamant that cutting financial and legal ties with the European Union and taking back control of immigration will allow Britain to reclaim its sovereignty and prosper. Those who want to remain feel an impending sense of loss at the prospect of being excluded from the bloc, its economic benefits and influence in the rest of the world. The tension between the two camps is visible in the port town of Boston on the east coast of England, which has both Britain’s highest proportion of Eastern European immigrants and one of its largest majorities for Brexit. Around 13 percent of the town’s 65,000 people were born elsewhere in Europe, according to the 2011 census, and Boston’s European population has continued to grow over subsequent years. “This isn’t about racism or discrimination against foreigners,” said Martin Lewis, a retired teacher from the town. “We welcome different nationalities and cultures in England, but the number we have absorbed is out of control. There aren’t enough jobs, houses and services to accommodate these people.” A Polish handyman from the town, who did not give his name for fear of damaging his business, said that many of the anxieties Boston residents had over immigration were inflated and not representative of reality. “We do the work they do not want to do, we live 10 people to one house, we earn our way of life and we do not burden anybody,” he said, adding that while he felt welcome in the town he was aware of hostile comments about the Polish community made “behind closed doors.” Boston residents were reluctant to talk about Brexit on a recent cold and rainy day — “There’s more to this town, there’s more to this country” one pensioner said. But reflecting on the past three and a half years, many of them said that the “Remain” movement’s reluctance to honor the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum felt like the biggest threat to the country’s democracy. “I do worry about the divides that have arisen from Brexit, but I fear that we would have seen unrest if the Brexit decision had been reversed,” Mr. Lewis said. Young Britons, who see Brexit as a major threat to their future, criticize older generations for being out of touch with their needs as the terms of the country’s relationship with its European neighbors are hammered out. “I am concerned about the people who carry the perspective that as long as issues of the country aren’t harming them personally, they can remain uninformed and uninvolved,” said Eden Reyhanian, an 18-year-old student at a school in North London. “Events within politics have made me feel as the likelihood of cohesion within our country is out of the picture, and while our nation is ideally supposed to become more unified when faced with threats of division, the opposite has occurred.” Oscar Redgrave, a 17-year-old student in Shrewsbury, Western England, who started a pro-European Union campaign group for young people, said one of the most worrying aspects of Brexit was how it had pushed racism and discrimination into the mainstream. “As we’ve become more divided on the subject of immigration, racism and hate crimes have become normalized, and British society has become more closed-minded,” he said. “It’s very disturbing.” But Mr. Redgrave is still hopeful that Brexit might be one day be reversed. He hopes for an overhaul of Britain’s electoral system, which critics say favors larger political parties. “Most young people are really for Europe,” he said. “If we get a voting system that allows us to really vote for who we want then I can see a scenario where we are back in Europe in five to 10 years. It’s possible.”']","As Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union becomes a reality, some people are celebrating and others are mourning. But for most, it seems, it is a time for recuperation and healing."
"At the Stroke of Brexit, Britain Steps, Guardedly, Into a New Dawn",2020-01-31,"By Mark Landler, Stephen Castle and Benjamin Mueller","['LONDON — To the recorded peals of Big Ben and the gentle fluttering of Union Jacks, Britain bade farewell to the European Union at 11 p.m. on Friday, severing ties to the world’s largest trading bloc after nearly half a century and embarking on an uncertain future as a midsize economy off the coast of Europe. For Britain, having transitioned in the postwar era from a globe-girdling empire to a reluctant member of the European project, it was yet another epoch-making departure. It is a departure that will upend settled relations in virtually all areas of society, the economy and security matters, while confronting Britain with new questions of national identity. Three and a half years after the former prime minister, Theresa May, proclaimed that “Brexit means Brexit,” the British government will finally have to decide precisely what that means. Britain must still negotiate its future trade relations with the European Union, a thorny process that could take through the end of the year, or longer. On Friday, the departure elicited both hope and trepidation from Britons. Many simply were relieved that the bitter and divisive debate over Brexit is over. “This is the moment when the dawn breaks, and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in an address to the nation on Friday night that he also posted on his Twitter account. Brexit, he said, was a chance to “spread hope and opportunity to every part of the U.K.” Mr. Johnson, whose vow to “Get Brexit Done” won him a commanding majority in elections last month, vowed to knit together a country that had been split geographically and generationally by the Brexit debate. Even the future of the United Kingdom now seemed uncertain, with Scotland threatening to renew its drive for independence and Northern Ireland musing about unification with Ireland. On Friday, Mr. Johnson’s cabinet met in Sunderland, an industrial city in the north, a traditional Labour stronghold where the early returns after the referendum in June 2016 foretold the country’s stunning decision to leave the European Union. The prime minister celebrated Brexit as a triumph for self-government, and promised to undertake the “biggest revival of our infrastructure since the Victorians.” For all the historical resonance, the celebrations of Britain’s departure were oddly attenuated. A countdown clock flickered on the darkened wall of 10 Downing Street, while inside the prime minister hosted a party with British-sourced food and English sparkling wine. British embassies were instructed to hold low-key affairs — no special events — and to avoid anything that smacked of “triumphalism.” In a chilly Parliament Square, several thousand Brexiteers gathered to sing “God Save the Queen” as the clock struck 11 p.m. Even the timing of the exit seemed a compromise: the European Union decided to make Britain’s departure effective at midnight in its Brussels headquarters. Some British commentators complained that the Europeans made a greater show of Britain’s leaving, which they had opposed, than Britain did. Brussels staged a light show in the Grand Place on Thursday, while members of the European Parliament serenaded their departing British colleagues with “Auld Lang Syne.” The ambivalence attested to the divisions that still run through Britain. Pro-Europe activists were despairing, some channeling their anger into efforts to help Europeans in London navigate the reality of reduced rights and a more tenuous life in a country they had long made their home. Still, even the most vociferous opponents of Brexit seemed eager to end, or at least suspend, the toxic debate, make the best of the outcome and try to forge a new relationship with the European Union more to their liking. “Britain can alter its political relationship with Europe, but it can’t alter its historical or geographical relationship and, in the end, we’ll have to find a way of working together,” Tony Blair, a former prime minister and ardent opponent of Brexit, said on Friday to foreign journalists in London. “It’s a destiny-changing decision and obviously it’s one I’m profoundly sad about,” said Mr. Blair, who had his own struggles with Britain’s fitful relationship with Europe. “But you’ve got to take a big historical look at this.” As Britain casts off from Europe, Mr. Johnson hopes to deepen his country’s alliance with the United States, starting with a trade deal that the government wants to negotiate in tandem with its agreement with the European Union. President Trump avidly encouraged Brexit and his emissary welcomed Britain’s new status. “America shares your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring,” Robert Wood Johnson IV, the United States ambassador to Britain, said in a statement. Yet, doubts remained about what sort of a trade deal Britain could expect from President Trump. “He believes in America first,” said Kim Darroch, the former ambassador to the United States, in an interview with the Guardian. “And he believes, particularly, in rewarding people who vote for him — and that is American farmers and big American corporations.” For Mr. Johnson, whose capacious Parliamentary majority leaves him with few domestic constraints, the question is which sectors of the economy to prioritize and what trade-offs to make in the post-Brexit era. His government argues that by freeing itself from European regulation, it could become a leader in new technologies like artificial intelligence. As Mr. Johnson’s influential adviser, Dominic Cummings, once put it, Britain can become the best place for those who want to “invent the future.” Yet in leaving Europe’s single market and customs union, Britain is sacrificing the smooth and frictionless flow of goods across its borders — something businesses currently take for granted. Whatever the outcome of the trade talks, exporters and importers will almost certainly face extra layers of bureaucracy and border checks. That will affect industries, from aerospace to food, and could cost jobs in parts of the country where Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won unexpected victories in last month’s general election. Formal negotiations between London and Brussels are expected to start in late February or early March. Mr. Johnson has insisted they must conclude this year, but critics say the timetable is unrealistic. Though the European Union is the far bigger economic entity, it is wary of allowing Britain to become a competitor with lighter regulations, which could undercut European producers. Its goal will be to extract pledges from Britain not to dilute its environmental, labor, or antitrust rules. Britain will probably want to negotiate everything simultaneously, while also engaging in talks with the United States and other nations — a strategy that it hopes will increase its leverage. In Sunderland, Mr. Johnson said he hoped to strike deals covering 80 percent of British trade within three years. In time, Brexit will overhaul how the country trades. But well before that, the split has sent tremors through the lives of Europeans who make their homes in Britain, instantly unraveling the promise that they could live and work there without question. For British cities shaped by waves of migration, none more so than London, the change could be seismic. In shops, restaurants and cultural centers, Europeans talk of going back to their home countries sooner than planned. They bemoan the application required to stay. And those who might once have taken their place are increasingly choosing not to come at all. “Through no fault of their own, people who thought they had forever built their lives on their rights as European Union citizens are all of a sudden having the rug pulled out from under them,” said Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the3million, a group that promotes European citizens’ rights. When the links between Britain and the European Union are severed at the end of the transition period, European citizens’ rights to live and work in Britain will end, as will the rights of Britons to move and work throughout the bloc. For Britons, too, the date of Britain’s departure hardly means an end to rancorous debates that have split families and friends over the last three years. The wounds remain raw. And the labels born of Brexit — Remainers who fought to keep Britain in the European Union, and Leavers who fought to do the opposite — have yet to wear off. Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, a co-founder of For our Future’s Sake, a youth-led group that campaigned to hold a new Brexit referendum last year, said there was only so much healing that could happen while the battle over what kind of Brexit Britain should pursue rages on. Coming from a family with many members who supported Leave, and from a part of England that voted to leave, she said the three years of turmoil were still taking their toll. “We’ll have a couple months of people trying not to talk about it again, trying to pretend it’s not a thing that’s happening, trying not to bring it up at dinner,” Ms. Chetwynd-Cowieson said. “But realistically it’s not going to be sorted in a year. It’s going to start rearing its head and opening divisions within families again.” Mr. Blair, the former prime minister, warned that Mr. Johnson would have to work hard to prevent the breakup of the country, given renewed calls for Scottish independence and Irish unification. A majority in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted against Brexit in 2016, and on Friday evening, the headquarters of the Scottish government in Edinburgh was lit up in the colors of the European flag. Mr. Blair acknowledged that the British had always been ambivalent about European integration. But he said, “the tragedy is that it was actually quite a successful relationship.” Those who dream of Britain rejoining the bloc one day will have to wait for a while, he added. “Who knows?” Mr. Blair said. “The thing I’m sure about is that there’s no point in occupying a lot of time on that now.”']","On a rainy evening of dampened festivities, its epoch-making departure stirred hopes and fears, but also relief that the ordeal is finally over."
Portraits of Brexit Day: U.K. Celebrates and Mourns Leaving E.U.,2020-01-31,By The New York Times,"['After three years of uncertainty, political acrimony and fractured opinions across a nation that found itself divided as never before, Brexit finally arrived on Friday night. At 11 p.m. — midnight in Brussels — Britain said farewell to the European Union, officially departing from the bloc after 47 years of membership and setting off on a new solo journey. While the moment was highly anticipated in the years since the country’s 2016 referendum, little will immediately change when the countdown is over. The commemorations have been notably subdued. Even the official government celebrations — a victory lap for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had pledged to see through Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union “do or die” — were muted. British flags lined the square outside Parliament and the Mall leading to Buckingham Palace, and a light show was staged outside Mr. Johnson’s official residence in Downing Street, a side road that is closed to the public. Elsewhere, those who supported remaining in the European Union staged protests and others wore mourning clothes to show their grief at the end of Britain’s membership. Though little will be different for Britons waking up on Saturday morning — the beginning of an 11-month transition period while Brussels and London negotiate the terms of their new relationship — the moment is a hugely symbolic one.

Coronavirus Live Updates: U.S. and Australia Tighten Controls as Toll Passes 250,2020-02-01,By The New York Times,"['[This briefing has ended. Read about the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.] Stocks in China plunged in early Monday trading as investors returned from a long holiday to the prospect of the world’s No. 2 economy virtually shut down by the coronavirus epidemic. Stocks in Shanghai opened 8.7 percent lower, while shares in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen fell 9 percent. The markets had been closed since Jan. 23 for the Lunar New Year holiday, and government officials extended that closure until Monday while the authorities dealt with the outbreak. Other markets in the region, which have already digested much of the impact, opened lower as well. Shares in Tokyo and in Australia were down about 1.5 percent in early Monday trading. Stocks in Hong Kong opened about half a percent lower. The damage could be confined to Asia. Futures markets that predict the performance of stocks in the next day forecast a positive opening for Wall Street and a mixed day for shares in Europe. A 44-year-old man in the Philippines has died of the coronavirus, health officials said on Sunday, making him the first known death outside China. The man, a resident of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus, died on Saturday after developing what officials called “severe pneumonia.” “This is the first known death of someone with 2019-nCoV outside of China,” the World Health Organization’s office in the Philippines said in a statement, using the technical shorthand for the coronavirus. Philippine health officials said the man had arrived in the country on Jan. 21 with a 38-year-old woman who remains under observation. “In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement,” said the health secretary, Francisco Duque III. “However, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours, resulting in his demise.” Hours before the death was announced, the Philippines said it was temporarily barring non-Filipino travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Mr. Duque said the Philippines was currently observing 23 people who had been isolated in hospitals with possible coronavirus symptoms. Chinese officials on Sunday reported a surge in new cases. ◆ The death toll in China rose to at least 360. ◆ More than 2,000 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 17,205, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 150 cases have been confirmed in at least 23 other countries. ◆ All of China’s provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak. ◆ Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Finland, Sweden and Spain. ◆ Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China. ◆ China has asked the European Union for help in buying urgently needed medical supplies from its member countries, China’s official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. Many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts say the outbreak is likely to become a pandemic, defined as an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents. Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, but there is a growing consensus that it is readily transmitted. Scientists have found that it is spreading more like influenza than its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS. “It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know,” he added. The effects of a pandemic would likely be harsher in some countries than in others. While wealthier countries can direct their resources toward early detection and treatment, countries with fragile health care systems will not necessarily be able to offer the same level of care. [Three American airlines have suspended flights between the United States and China. Are you affected, or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com] China is now dealing with another disease outbreak — this one mostly affecting animals, but also potentially deadly among people. The Ministry of Agriculture said late Saturday that a fresh outbreak of a lethal form of influenza had been found in poultry in the southern province of Hunan, and that officials had ordered the slaughter of 17,828 chickens. China has previously dealt with several bird flu outbreaks. In the new case, the H5N1 bird flu virus was found at a farm in the city of Shaoyang. The farm had 7,850 chickens, and more than half have died from the bird flu, the ministry said. It called the strain “highly pathogenic.” Although bird flu poses more of a danger to poultry than humans — it is not easily transmissible among people — the World Health Organization has called on countries to be on guard. China is also grappling with an African swine fever epidemic that has infected tens of thousands of pigs and could stoke worries about the food supply. The Chinese government has delivered on its promise to build a hospital for coronavirus patients at the epicenter of the outbreak within 10 days. About 1,400 military medics will begin working at the hospital in Wuhan on Monday, according to state news media. Several state outlets streamed footage from the new hospital, which spans roughly 365,000 square feet and has been fitted with 1,000 beds. A second facility in Wuhan, with 1,500 beds, is expected to be completed this week. An official in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, said in a news briefing on Sunday that the time required to confirm new cases of the virus had halved to no more than two hours, and that the accuracy of the test kits had improved. But the situation in Hubei remains “severe and complicated,” Vice Governor Xiao Juhua said. Since the coronavirus emerged, hospitals in Wuhan have been met with a shortage of masks and basic protective gear for doctors and nurses, and overwhelmed hospitals have had to turn away many people with flulike symptoms. Eleven days into the lockdown of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the epidemic began, the government there is extending its quarantine in an effort to halt the coronavirus that has killed at least 224 people in the city. Starting Sunday, the authorities are putting into quarantine people in Wuhan who have had close contact with confirmed carriers of the virus and people with pneumonialike symptoms who may be carriers. Under the new rules, many may face supervised quarantine away from their families. The government had already ordered residents not to leave the city and to stay indoors as much as possible. Now, people who have had close contact with confirmed carriers of the virus “will be sent to centralized isolation and observation points,” according to the new rule. The regulation did not specify where people will be kept for observation, but it warned that people would have no choice. “Those who refuse to cooperate will be compelled under the law by assisting public security offices,” the order said. “During isolation, each district will provide free room and board, as well as medical observation and treatment.” President Trump’s national security adviser played down the risk of an outbreak of the coronavirus in the United States, saying on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “right now there’s no reason for Americans to panic.” The national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, said that the United States had offered to send health officials to China to help contain the epidemic, but that officials had not yet received a response from Beijing. Mr. O’Brien also defended remarks by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who said on Thursday that the United States could benefit economically from the outbreak because it could cause companies to reconsider their global supply chains and ultimately “help to accelerate” the return of jobs to the United States. “I think what Commerce Secretary Ross is saying is there’s a danger, there’s a risk factor in doing that, and wouldn’t it be better if we had supply chains and factories here in the U.S.?” Mr. O’Brien said. New Zealand imposed new restrictions on travelers from mainland China, saying it would deny entry to visitors departing from or transiting through the mainland for two weeks starting on Monday. Citizens and residents will be allowed entry to New Zealand, but will be required to quarantine themselves for 14 days, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. The government will also send a charter flight to repatriate up to 300 citizens in Wuhan. “Ultimately, this is a public health decision,” she said. Many other countries have expanded travel restrictions on noncitizens who had traveled to China, including the Philippines, the United States and Australia. Japan and South Korea are barring noncitizens who have traveled to Hubei. (South Korea also said it would restrict tourism to and from China.) Vietnam recently barred almost all flights to and from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau until May 1, according to the United States Federal Aviation Administration. But Vietnam then partly eased its ban, allowing flights from Hong Kong and Macau to continue. Indonesia is suspending visa-free travel for Chinese citizens and barring passengers who have visited mainland China. Like other countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia depends heavily on Chinese tourism. On Thursday alone, 10,000 Chinese tourists canceled their trips to Bali, according to one industry association. Russia, which shares a 2,600-mile border with China and which had temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens, is also halting visa-free entry for Chinese tour groups, the government said. Iraq is temporarily barring travelers coming from China. Chinese people working in oil production are allowed to remain, though any who leave will not be able to return for the time being. Saudi Arabia’s state airline and Oman also suspended flights to China on Sunday, according to Reuters. A day after New York City’s health authorities said that a woman hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital Center might have the new coronavirus, the authorities on Sunday announced that two more patients might have the virus. Samples from all three patients are being sent for testing to a laboratory in Atlanta that is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The turnaround time for the results is usually at least 36 hours, but often longer. For more than a week, New York City has been bracing for the arrival of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, as isolated cases began to appear elsewhere in the country. In all three suspected cases in New York, the individuals had recently been in China and came down with flulike symptoms. All three had been tested for influenza and a number of other common illnesses, and those tests came back negative. Citing what it called the “apparently inevitable” spread of the coronavirus, Israel’s government on Sunday closed its borders to arrivals from China and said that it would work on producing a vaccine. Israeli citizens who have traveled to China will be allowed back, officials said. And the Israeli news media reported that the country was expected to extend the work permits of nearly 1,700 Chinese construction workers whose contracts expired. The arrival of the same number of workers from China who were due to replace them has been indefinitely postponed. Taiwan complained on Sunday that it was being punished because the World Health Organization considers it part of China, which has been subject to travel bans as the coronavirus spreads. Italy and Vietnam included Taiwan in banning flights from China, a move that they announced after the W.H.O. declared the outbreak a global health emergency. Vietnam backtracked on Saturday, but the ban from Italy remains, Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, said on Sunday. He pointed out that Taiwan had 10 confirmed cases, versus more than 14,000 in mainland China. “The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Taiwan is not higher than in most countries affected,” Mr. Wu said, adding that other than China, “no other country has had its flight banned by Italy.” China considers self-governed Taiwan to be part of its own territory and has long sought to limit Taiwan’s diplomatic relations and recognition at international bodies. Taiwan also announced that it would deny entry to Chinese nationals from Guangdong, a coastal province that has been battered by the virus, and travelers who have recently visited the area. As many as 9,000 medical workers in Hong Kong have pledged to strike this week, a threat that alarmed officials in the territory, which confirmed its 14th coronavirus case late Saturday. The workers are demanding that Hong Kong close all border checkpoints to visitors from mainland China, saying they represent a threat to health care workers in the city. Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong’s No. 2 official, appealed to the medical workers to reconsider. “At this critical moment, I believe the general public would count on medical personnel to fight against the epidemic together, in the spirit of professionalism,” he wrote in a blog post on Sunday. Health officials said it was unclear where the latest coronavirus patient in the territory had developed the disease. The patient, an 80-year-old man, had visited mainland China during a cruise, and later spent several days on a cruise ship in Japan with more than 3,000 passengers and employees. “We are very worried,” said Chuang Shuk-kwan, a Hong Kong health official. “Everyone should prepare mentally for the possibility that the disease is spreading within the community.” Hong Kong officials say that the number of visitors from the mainland and other countries has decreased significantly after they closed several border points and cut flight arrivals by half. But several border points remain open, and many medical workers fear that Hong Kong’s well-regarded health care system will be overwhelmed. They have also voiced frustrations about patients from mainland China hiding their travel and medical history, potentially endangering other patients. Two of the 120 Germans repatriated from China on Saturday have fallen ill and are being treated for the coronavirus in a university hospital in Frankfurt, the German authorities said. All of those who were repatriated by the German government are being quarantined for two weeks at army barracks in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Eight cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the southern German state of Bavaria, the state ministry said. All of them are linked to a company in the town of Starnberg that was visited by a Chinese woman who began exhibiting symptoms on her return flight to China. Eleven British citizens were expected to return from Wuhan on Sunday, raising to 94 the total number of people who have been repatriated, the country’s foreign secretary said. The group — which traveled on a French flight carrying people from 29 European countries — will be taken to a hospital in northwestern England where a previous batch of repatriated citizens have been staying in isolation, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told the BBC. Most of the 64 French citizens on the flight will be quarantined near Aix-en-Provence in southern France or the resort area Carry-Le-Rouet, a spokesman for France’s health ministry said. In Britain, footage from the facility, Arrowe Park Hospital, showed some of the quarantined people wearing face masks while eating breakfast or playing pool indoors. Ben Pinkerton, a 23-year-old teacher from Northern Ireland, described the facility as “very comfortable.” “We have TVs, video games, a nice room and good food,” he said in a Facebook message. Kharn Lambert, who is also in quarantine at the center, told Sky News on Saturday that those being kept in the facility were in good health and good spirits — “albeit subdued.” He said that they were allowed to go in a courtyard, but an outer perimeter that prevents them from leaving “is patrolled by the police quite regularly.” Reporting was contributed by Austin Ramzy, Chris Buckley, Tiffany May, Jason Gutierrez, Sui-Lee Wee, Choe Sang-Hun, Tess Felder, Anton Troianovski, Alissa J.

Berlin Freezes Rents for 5 Years in a Bid to Slow Gentrification,2020-01-31,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Rental prices on more than 1.5 million Berlin apartments will be frozen or lowered for five years as a result of new legislation aimed at halting a recent spike in rents that is driving out older and lower-income residents. The measure, which lawmakers approved on Thursday and which is to take effect next month, is an attempt by Berlin’s leftist government to slow the gentrification of a city that built a reputation on a creative scene but is being squeezed by real estate investors and infrastructure projects. “We have created an instrument that will stop the partially absurd price developments for the next five years,” Katrin Lompscher, Berlin’s senator for city development and living, said at a news conference on Friday. “It is up to politicians to create the basic conditions for lower- and middle-class earners to be able to afford to live in Berlin.” Renting is more common in Germany than homeownership, with more than half of the country’s residents renting their homes. In Berlin, a city of three million people, only 18 percent of residents own their homes. The new law caps most rents in the city at 2019 levels and limits the amount that can be charged based on the apartment’s condition and amenities. Critics say the move will hamper desperately needed growth in the property market and frighten off those willing to build affordable housing in a city once known for its “poor but sexy” party scene of the 1990s that has become a rapidly changing European capital. Real estate developers and members of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party have threatened to challenge the law. They argue that it violates the country’s Constitution, which stipulates that rents are set by the federal government. “The rent cap is equivalent to an expropriation and is a catastrophe for Berlin’s real estate market,” said Jürgen Michael Schick, the president of Germany’s Real Estate Association. The group has warned about the negative effects the measure could have since the city government proposed it last year. “Limiting and reducing the income from rents will create uncertainty for investors and will ward off real estate developers from investing,” Mr. Schick said. Ms. Lompscher said the aim was not to halt growth in the city’s housing stock, but to ease the strain on renters while private developers and city officials facilitate the construction of more housing. The city, Germany’s capital, plans to construct more than 60,000 apartments in the coming years, many of them lower-priced properties, she said. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the reunited city found itself with a glut of apartments, many of which were publicly owned. In an effort to bring in desperately needed cash to pay for the reunification of East and West Berlin, many properties were privatized. Foreign property investors quickly understood the potential for growth in Berlin — where rents are still notably cheaper than in London, Paris or Rome —\xa0and began buying and renovating apartments. They also started charging higher rent. At the same time, the city’s population continued to grow, adding about 250,000 new residents from 2012 to 2017, according to official figures. That combination of factors led to a spike in rental prices, especially in the most desirable areas of the city. In 2017, Berlin ranked internationally as the only major city where property values had increased more than 20 percent from a year earlier, with rents keeping pace. “Three million tenants will benefit in the city,” said Iris Spranger, the housing affairs spokeswoman for the city’s Social Democrats, one of the governing parties that approved the law. “After a long phase of galloping prices, rents will now be stopped,” she said, “and that is sorely needed.”']","The move, in a capital once known for its artists and its party scene, aims to reverse a trend that is driving out older and lower-income residents."
Britain’s Brexit Shrug: Let’s Just Get On With It,2020-01-31,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain formally exits the European Union on Friday night, casting off from the Continent after nearly half a century and ending a debate that had convulsed the country for more than three years. Yet for all the gravity of the moment, there is a palpable sense of anticlimax. Now that Britain has finally reached this point of no return — one that millions of Britons had long either dreaded or dreamed of, marched against or eagerly prepared for — the prevailing emotion is neither sadness nor excitement. Rather, it is a characteristically British reflex: Get on with it. In time, the British are likely to discover that getting on with it isn’t so easy. For the next 11 months, Britain will continue to abide by the European Union’s rules and regulations, while it decides what sort of Brexit it wants for itself. That will be hammered out in talks with the bloc’s leaders in Brussels over trade relations — negotiations that could prove as divisive and traumatic as the political fight over the withdrawal. But that, for now, lies in the future. For most people, nothing will be all that different when the sun rises on Saturday morning. To a great extent, that reflects the endless, enervating nature of the Brexit debate. Since the day Britons narrowly voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, the issue has divided families, cast a shadow over businesses, and paralyzed the government. Parliament, that venerable symbol of British democracy, became a gladiatorial arena, at once riveting and horrifying to those who tuned in to the daily combat. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised during the recent election to “get Brexit done,” British voters, exhausted and fed up, gave him the largest Conservative Party majority since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. “Everyone — but everyone — including the most passionate Remainers like me, had a ‘get Brexit done’ corner in our souls,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University, referring to the choice between leaving the European Union or remaining in it. “We’ve had three and a half years of this, so we were well into the fourth or fifth stage of grief.” Mark Malloch Brown, another prominent Remainer and a former No. 2 official at the United Nations, said, “Even though it’s not the outcome I wanted, it returns government to its proper place.” Brexit has already left a deep imprint on the country. Financial firms have moved some of their operations to other European cities, workers from other European Union countries have begun leaving, and the fierce national debate over whether, and how, to leave has radically realigned the country’s politics. Since Mr. Johnson’s victory, however, the British have given themselves a kind of holiday from history. Brexit has largely vanished from the front pages, replaced by the saga of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, whose decision to leave Britain seems to fascinate people more than Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. Even the ceremonies to mark the moment speak to the ennui. The government will project a countdown clock on the walls of 10 Downing Street and mount a red, white and blue light show in nearby Whitehall. Brexiteers plan to throw a party in Parliament Square, where the weather forecast calls for rain showers. But the bell in Big Ben will not ring; the government decided not to ante up the 500,000 pounds ($650,000) necessary to make the bell usable during renovations of the Houses of Parliament. Even if it had rung, Big Ben would have served only to underscore the attenuated nature of the celebration. Because the European Union dictates Britain’s departure, Brexit will be official at the stroke of midnight, Brussels time, which is only 11 p.m. in London. Not everybody views Brexit with resignation. “I don’t think it’s an anticlimax,” said William Shawcross, a writer who works for the government as a special envoy for British victims of terrorism. “I think this is one of the most exciting moments in Britain’s modern history. I am thrilled by it!” Britain, he said, now had a rare opportunity to improve its society, unshackled from the bureaucracy of Brussels. Going through with Brexit was a crucial vindication of the people’s democratic wishes. Still, Mr. Shawcross said the government had wisely decided to avoid a triumphalist tone in marking the departure. Mr. Johnson has vowed to heal the rifts left by the Brexit debate, and his government has begun taking steps in that direction. The simplest way is to steer public money toward people for whom voting in favor of Brexit was a protest against what they perceived as an economy that had left them behind. And so the government seems likely to approve a costly high-speed railway project that would connect London with Manchester, Leeds and other cities in northern England. Voters in the Midlands and north helped fuel Mr. Johnson’s election victory. Many of them were traditionally Labour Party supporters, who voted to leave the European Union and seethed as Parliament failed to carry out their wishes. The railway, its advocates say, could help reinvigorate those parts of the country. Yet Mr. Johnson will have to reconcile this kind of big-ticket project with the small-government ideology that drives the Brexiteers in his cabinet. Focused on free trade and deregulation, their goal is to turn Britain into a nimble free agent in the global economy — Singapore-on-Thames, in the words of the evangelists. That is a starkly different vision of Britain from that held by the Conservative Party’s new voters in the north. They yearn for a country whose automobile industry and fishing grounds are protected from the ravages of global competition. Mr. Johnson, analysts said, hopes to manage that tension by, in effect, giving both what they want: public spending in the north and deregulation in London. In an excerpt from remarks he plans to deliver on Friday evening, Mr. Johnson cast Brexit as not just a unifying force, but also a remedy for generations of economic inequity between Britain’s north and south. “This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances — your family’s life chances — should depend on which part of the country you grow up in,” he was scheduled to say. “This is the moment when we begin to unite and level up.” Critics predict Mr. Johnson will have trouble reconciling the buccaneering Britain he wants with the northern voters who swept him to victory. “By leaving Europe, he is punishing exactly those parts of the country, because it is those parts of the country that will lose residual manufacturing jobs,” said Mr. Brown, the former United Nations official. Mr. Johnson faces a similar dilemma in foreign policy. His ministers speak grandly of a “global Britain,” a respected player with friends on both sides of the Atlantic but free to strike trade deals with anyone. “There’s a great opportunity for this country to be an even stronger force for good in the world,” the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said in a briefing with reporters this week. As an example, he cited the next United Nations climate change summit, which Britain will host in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. Without the leverage of European Union membership, however, some analysts said Britain would be a diminished power, overly dependent on its alliance with the United States. Mr. Johnson fended off heavy pressure from the Trump administration to bar the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from its broadband network. But with Britain embarking on a trade negotiation with the United States, it is not the last time Mr. Johnson is likely to face difficult trade-offs. “Boris Johnson does want to have a global foreign policy,” said Simon Fraser, a former head of the British diplomatic service. “But a lot of this talk of a global Britain is very glib, not very substantial, and needs to be filled out.” For all of Mr. Johnson’s promises of unity, Britain remains a deeply divided country. Many still regard Brexit as a national tragedy. At Oxford, students marked Britain’s departure from the bloc by creating a website that features interviews of young people, mostly Europeans, in which they were asked to name their most formative, best and worst European moments. The Brexit referendum ranks as the highest-scoring worst moment. Slightly over half of those who voted last December backed parties that either opposed Brexit or favored another referendum. How Mr. Johnson reaches out to those people will determine whether he is successful in putting the rancor of the last three and a half years behind the country. Mr. Garton Ash, the Oxford professor, said the government could make strides by supporting student exchange programs between Britain and the European Union, adopting an open immigration policy and encouraging freedom of movement. “The jury is still out on what he’s going to do for the pro-Europe part of the country,” Mr. Garton Ash said. “But if he can do a lot on that front, people will gradually and grudgingly accept it.”']","For the last three years, Britons have debated Brexit. Now that it is here, there is a sense of relief even though the country still must decide what sort of Brexit it wants."
Giuliani Sought Help for Client in Meeting With Ukrainian Official,2020-02-01,"By Ronen Bergman, Anton Troianovski and Kenneth P. Vogel","['KYIV, Ukraine — When Rudolph W. Giuliani met with a top aide to Ukraine’s president last summer, he discussed the prospect of a coveted White House meeting for the president while seeking Ukraine’s commitment to certain investigations that could benefit President Trump politically. Mr. Giuliani also threw in a request of his own: help the mayor of Kyiv keep his job. The mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, a professional boxer turned politician and longtime friend and former client of Mr. Giuliani’s, was on the verge of being fired from his duties overseeing Kyiv’s $2 billion budget. Firing Mr. Klitschko would have fit with President Volodymyr Zelensky’s campaign promise to fight Ukraine’s entrenched interests and allowed him to replace a political adversary with a loyalist in one of the country’s most important posts. But despite the fact that Mr. Zelensky’s cabinet approved Mr. Klitschko’s removal, he remains there today, leaving his adversaries in the murky and lucrative world of Ukrainian municipal politics to wonder whether Mr. Trump’s personal attorney may have tipped the scales in his favor. “The coincidence in timing between Klitschko’s meeting with Giuliani and the developments in the governance of Kyiv was striking,” said Oleksandr Tkachenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament whom Mr. Zelensky had been expected to nominate as Mr. Klitschko’s replacement. Mr. Giuliani’s effort to help his friend and former client, first reported in The Washington Post, shed fresh light on the former New York mayor’s mingling of personal, business and political interests with his role as personal attorney to the president of the United States. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged discussing Mr. Klitschko’s position in a meeting with a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, in Madrid on Aug. 2. “I said, ‘I don’t know, I’m from the outside, but he seems like one of the good guys,’” Mr. Giuliani said, recalling the conversation. “‘And I’m speaking, speaking, speaking as a personal friend, not as a representative of the government or anything else.’” In the same meeting, Mr. Giuliani discussed a possible Oval Office visit by Mr. Zelensky that the Ukrainian president had been seeking, and asked for a commitment by his government to pursue investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his son, and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. The meeting took place at a time when Ukraine’s new president was looking to cement support from the United States, his country’s most powerful ally in the conflict against Russia, and to build a relationship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani said that he made it clear that he was relating his personal view of Mr. Klitschko, not that of the administration. “I gave it as my opinion — not the government — and based on our personal relationships,” he said. Mr. Yermak also acknowledged that the two discussed Mr. Klitschko’s fate. “Giuliani asked for my opinion about Vitaliy Klitschko as a mayor,” Mr. Yermak said in a statement in response to an inquiry from The Times. “He immediately issued the disclaimer that I should not see his question as an attempt to influence me.” Mr. Yermak said he told Mr. Giuliani that he had long known Mr. Klitschko and that he had the support of Kyiv’s citizens. “That was the end of our conversation about Klitschko,” Mr. Yermak said. “As a result I reject any speculation that Mr. Giuliani in any way sought to influence my opinion or to make me accept some narrative regarding Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko.” Given the complex and opaque nature of Ukrainian politics, it is not clear whether Mr. Giuliani’s intervention was the decisive force allowing the mayor to keep his job. But it is clear that he tried. Mr. Klitschko, a former heavyweight world boxing champion, first hired Mr. Giuliani as a consultant for his unsuccessful run for mayor of Kyiv in 2008. Since 2014, Mr. Klitschko has held dual roles: both the largely ceremonial, elected position of Kyiv mayor and the powerful position of head of Kyiv’s city-state administration, an appointment made by the Ukrainian president. The latter position gives him oversight of matters such as the city budget, building permits and transportation funds, making him one of the most powerful people in the country. Mr. Klitschko supported Mr. Zelensky’s opponent, the incumbent Petro O. Poroshenko, in last spring’s presidential election in Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky’s landslide victory appeared to augur Mr. Klitschko’s political demise. Mr. Zelensky, a comedian, had frequently lampooned Mr. Klitschko on his Saturday Night Live-style variety show, portraying him as a dunderheaded member of Ukraine’s shadowy, corrupt elite. In one skit, Mr. Zelensky played a translator to a boxing-belt-wearing Mr. Klitschko, who is unable to string together an intelligible sentence. After taking power in May, Mr. Zelensky had no way to remove Mr. Klitschko as mayor but could strip him of the more influential post as head of the Kyiv administration. Ukrainian politicians and analysts expected him to do so. A confidante of Mr. Klitschko’s, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was concerned about harm to his business if he spoke publicly, said that by the end of July, “it was clear that only outside interference, say the president of the United States or anyone on his behalf,” could save Mr. Klitschko from dismissal. As the power struggle escalated, Mr. Klitschko flew to New York to meet with Mr. Giuliani. On July 30, in an apparent prelude to the dismissal, Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Bohdan, called a news conference and accused Mr. Klitschko of allowing corruption to flourish in Kyiv. Without offering evidence, Mr. Bohdan said he had been offered a $20 million bribe for Mr. Klitschko to remain head of the Kyiv administration. The next day, Mr. Klitschko posted photographs on Facebook of his meeting with Mr. Giuliani, his “old friend and one of the most authoritative mayors in the world.” The two discussed “the situation in Ukraine,” he said, “future cooperation between the United States and Ukraine,” and the topic of “local self-rule” — an apparent reference to Mr. Klitschko’s battle to hold on to power at home. Upon returning to Kyiv, Mr. Klitschko told his aides that his American allies would help him keep his job, according to several people who heard him make the comments in staff meetings and who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are still involved in municipal politics and were afraid to be identified when discussing issues related to Mr. Klitschko.  “That’s ridiculous,” Mr. Klitschko said in a statement on Friday. Asked about the meeting with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Klitschko said, “I did not ask anyone for any assistance.” Mr. Klitschko said he had never had a business relationship with Mr. Giuliani, a claim contradicted by Mr. Giuliani, who consulted for the former boxer’s 2008 campaign. Mr. Giuliani said that he had not formally represented Mr. Klitschko in years, “even though I still advise him.” But two days later, Mr. Giuliani was speaking about Mr. Klitschko to Mr. Yermak in Madrid. On Sept. 4, Mr. Zelensky’s cabinet approved the dismissal of Mr. Klitschko as head of the Kyiv administration. But on Sept. 6, Mr. Giuliani fired off a tweet: “Reducing the power of Mayor Klitschko of Kiev was a very bad sign particularly based on the advice of an aide to the President of Ukraine who has the reputation of being a fixer. The former champion is very much admired and respected in the US.” The tweet came as Mr. Zelensky was scrambling to stabilize his relationship with Mr. Trump after finding out that American military aid to Kyiv had been halted for unexplained reasons. The last step needed to make the dismissal official was Mr. Zelensky’s signature on the dismissal — a formality, it seemed, since it was Mr. Zelensky’s office that had sought approval for the firing in the first place. But the signature never came. Asked by reporters in October, Mr. Zelensky said that he was still thinking about whether or not to sign. “When a controversial issue arises, he tries to balance various interests,” a Kyiv political analyst, Volodymyr Fesenko, said of Mr. Zelensky’s unexpected reprieve. “He decided not to make a sudden move.” Aside from any influence Mr. Giuliani may have had, Mr. Fesenko points to a power struggle within different factions in Mr. Zelensky’s administration as another factor, along with Mr. Zelensky’s own dwindling political capital amid intense criticism from domestic political opponents that he was too soft on Russia. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Klitschko declined to comment on the Madrid meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, or on why Mr. Zelensky decided to keep him in office. He described Mr. Giuliani as “a big friend of Ukraine and one of the most successful mayors of the world.” Mr. Giuliani himself became a fraught figure in Ukraine as the impeachment investigation unfolded on Capitol Hill. “Starting in late September, the Giuliani issue became very toxic,” Mr. Fesenko said. “It seemed Klitschko’s team stopped pushing the relationship with Giuliani.” Ronen Bergman and Anton Troianovski reported from Kyiv, and Kenneth P. Vogel from Washington.']","As he discussed the possibility of a White House meeting for Ukraine’s president, President Trump’s lawyer asked to save the Kyiv mayor’s job."
"Amid Trump’s Trial, Pompeo Visited Ukraine. Here’s How It Went.",2020-01-31,By Edward Wong,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that the Trump administration was committed to supporting Ukraine in its defense against aggression by Russia, which invaded and annexed part of the country and is supporting a separatist insurgency. “Today I’m here with a clear message: The United States sees that the Ukrainian struggle for freedom, democracy and prosperity is a valiant one,” Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference after meeting with Ukraine’s leader in Kyiv. “Our commitment to support it will not waver.” Ukraine is a “bulwark between freedom and authoritarianism in Eastern Europe,” Mr. Pompeo added. His visit, in which he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, was aimed at calming unease among Ukrainian officials about the relationship between Washington and Kyiv, which has been thrust into the spotlight because of the impeachment of Mr. Trump, based on charges of abuse of power and obstruction over the president’s actions on Ukraine. Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Zelensky met before noon in the president’s office in central Kyiv, and the Ukrainian leader said they had talked about new steps to strengthen the partnership between the two nations. “I don’t think these friendly and warm relations have been influenced by the impeachment trial of the president,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news conference with Mr. Pompeo when asked whether Mr. Trump’s impeachment had affected ties between Kyiv and Washington. While the two officials offered reassurances that relations were strong, Mr. Pompeo did not give Mr. Zelensky one thing he has sought since his election in April: an invitation to meet President Trump at the White House, which would be an important signal to Russia of American support for Ukraine. Mr. Pompeo’s message that Mr. Trump was not ready to receive Mr. Zelensky at the White House was a blow to the Ukrainian president’s national security efforts. Evidence that Mr. Trump had earlier demanded, in return for such a visit, that Ukraine announce the start of an investigation that could benefit him became an important part of the impeachment inquiry. In response to a question on Friday, Mr. Pompeo said a White House visit by Mr. Zelensky was not dependent on the kind of investigation Mr. Trump had sought. Ukrainian officials are angry that the Americans have granted Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, two visits with Mr. Trump in White House, most recently in December. In renewing his request for a meeting Friday, Mr. Zelensky said, “If we have an important subject for this conversation other than strategy and tactics, but important things we can negotiate over, something to sign and that I can bring back, then I am ready to go tomorrow!” Mr. Pompeo was the first official from Mr. Trump’s cabinet to meet with Mr. Zelensky since the impeachment inquiry began last fall. Mr. Trump met briefly with the Ukrainian leader on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York — the day after Democrats in the House of Representatives announced the opening of the inquiry. The Democrats’ move was prompted by a formal complaint filed by a C.I.A. whistle-blower who said that Mr. Trump had pressed Mr. Zelensky in a July 25 call for political favors at the same time he was withholding from Ukraine $391 million of military aid mandated by Congress. The impeachment trial in the Senate began this month but appeared as of early Friday to be moving to a swift close. The military aid from Washington, which the White House released on Sept. 11, after Mr. Trump heard about the formal whistle-blower complaint, is aimed at helping Ukrainian soldiers fight a yearslong Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine and other European nations want the Trump administration to get involved in talks with leaders in Kyiv and Moscow to help settle the conflict. Analysts say that Mr. Trump’s actions on Ukraine — which critics say centered on gaining political advantage for his re-election campaign this year — and his open admiration of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have weakened decades of American support for Ukraine. Mr. Trump and his aides deny that he withheld the aid for political reasons, and say they were asking that Ukraine conduct legitimate investigations into corruption. And Mr. Pompeo said on Friday that “the United States under President Trump has been the world’s fiercest defender of Ukraine’s sovereignty.” Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center in Kyiv, a research group, welcomed the move by Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Zelensky to reaffirm American aid for Ukraine, including military support, but said there were still major concerns. “At the same time, we feel that Ukraine has become toxic in Washington, and there is a lack of new initiatives toward Ukraine,” she said. “There’s also a lack of U.S. support and U.S. involvement in peace negotiations with Russia.” On Friday morning, as snow fell lightly in Kyiv, Mr. Pompeo met with Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s foreign minister, and went to the golden-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral downtown to attend a wreath-laying ceremony for the soldiers who have died fighting in the Donbas. In the evening, Mr. Pompeo visited wounded soldiers at a hospital. More than 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed since the war began in 2014, the same year Russia invaded and occupied the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea. The conflict has become grinding trench warfare in open fields with regular shelling. The Ukraine trip is a fraught one for Mr. Pompeo, who arrived on Thursday night after a stop in London and plans to travel afterward to three more nations that became independent from Moscow. Mr. Pompeo has been dogged by sharp questions over his role in the Ukraine affair and, more recently, an acid comment he made about Ukraine in a Jan. 24 conversation with a National Public Radio reporter. The reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, a veteran national security correspondent, said that after she asked about Ukraine, Mr. Pompeo shouted at her and asked her to locate Ukraine on an unmarked map. She added that, using the “f-word,” he asked, “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” Mr. Pompeo enabled Mr. Trump’s actions on Ukraine by ordering the recall of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the respected ambassador to Ukraine, last April. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and associates with Ukraine business ties had been pressing the president hard for the ouster of the ambassador, who had been an anticorruption advocate. Mr. Trump’s main demand of Mr. Zelensky had been that he announce investigations into Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, who had been on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company. There is no evidence that the older Mr. Biden acted inappropriately on Ukraine policy because of his son’s corporate ties. On several occasions, Mr. Pompeo, an ardent Trump loyalist, has reiterated Mr. Trump’s conspiratorial assertions about Ukraine, the Bidens and questions of interference in the 2016 presidential election — assertions that have been discredited and have angered the Ukrainians. “As secretary of state and C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo had every opportunity to put his mark on Russia and Ukraine policy,” said Andrew S. Weiss, a former American official who worked on Russia and Ukraine and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “But at nearly every turn he focused instead on the audience of one — Donald Trump.” “That’s why he turned a blind eye when Trump and cronies like Rudy Giuliani decided to totally dismantle the Ukraine policy framework that has been in place since 1991 and, knowingly or unknowingly, did a huge solid for the Kremlin,” he added. “Making a short pit stop in Kyiv hardly begins to undo the damage that has been wrought.” Mr. Pompeo canceled planned trips to Ukraine twice — once in November and once at the start of January. William B. Taylor Jr., the veteran diplomat whom Mr. Pompeo appointed to be chief of mission after Ms. Yovanovitch was forced out, wrote a Jan. 26 opinion piece for The New York Times in which he tried to address Mr. Pompeo’s angry, dismissive question to NPR about Ukraine. “Russia is fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, Europe and the United States,” Mr. Taylor wrote. “This war has many components: armed military aggression, energy supply, cyberattacks, disinformation and election interference. On each of these battlegrounds, Ukraine is the front line.” In an interview in Kyiv with ABC News, Mr. Pompeo said he “absolutely” wanted the Ukrainians to get the military aid and did not deny that he had argued to the president to lift the hold on aid, as The New York Times reported. But he also said Mr. Trump wanted to ensure that “resources get to the right place,” and Mr. Pompeo would help “deliver for him.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Lara Jakes from Washington.']","The secretary of state met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, during the impeachment trial of President Trump over a pressure campaign against Ukraine."
